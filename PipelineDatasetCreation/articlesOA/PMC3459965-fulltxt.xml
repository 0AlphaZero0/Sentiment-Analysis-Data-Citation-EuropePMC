Its dysregulated expression in other tumors led us to hypothesize that latexin may have tumor suppressor properties in hematological malignancies. We found that latexin was down-regulated in a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines as well as in CD34+ cells from the blood and marrow of patients with these malignancies. 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytodine treatment and bisulfite sequencing revealed hypermethylation of latexin promoter in tumor cells. Retrovirus-mediated latexin overexpression in A20 mouse lymphoma cells inhibited their in vitro growth by 16 fold and in vivo tumor volume by 2 fold. Latexin caused growth inhibition of lymphoma cells by significantly increasing apoptosis through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Pim-2. The molecular mechanism underlying latexin-mediated tumor inhibition was not through its canonical carboxypeptidase inhibitor activity. These results are consistent with a tumor suppressor role for latexin and suggest that latexin may have clinical efficacy in the treatment of malignancies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by American Cancer Society ACS178898 (to YL) and BD Biosciences Research Grant Award (to YL) and the support of The Edward P.

<italic>Lxn</italic> was primarily studied in the nervous system, involving the specification of cortical brain regions during development <xref rid="pone.0044979-Arimatsu1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Hatanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Arimatsu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Arimatsu3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Arimatsu4" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, as well as the speed of nerve transmission in adult peripheral nervous systems <xref rid="pone.0044979-Jin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. <italic>Lxn</italic> was found to be involved in the inflammatory response in macrophages owing to its paired cystatin-like domains <xref rid="pone.0044979-Aagaard1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

<italic>Lxn</italic> thus may have the similar mechanisms as TIG1 to regulate hematopoiesis.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence obtained from a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, as well as from primary cells from patients with these diseases, that <italic>Lxn</italic> expression is almost universally absent or significantly reduced from that of normal stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, treatment with a de-methylating agent at least partially restores <italic>Lxn</italic> expression in a variety of tumor cell lines, and methylation level of the CpG island in the <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter region is inversely associated with its expression. Perhaps most importantly, we show that when <italic>Lxn</italic> expression was re-initiated ectopically in two lymphoma cell lines using a retroviral expression vector, their growth, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, was significantly blunted. We further show that <italic>Lxn</italic> inhibits lymphoma cell growth by significantly increasing apoptosis through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and that its anti-tumor activity is mediated via mechanisms unique from its canonical inhibition of carboxypeptidase A. These results demonstrate that <italic>Lxn</italic> plays a functional role in tumor cell growth and introduces an unexplored pathway potentially important to cancer treatment in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Loss of <italic>Lxn</italic> Expression in Malignant Cells</title><p>We first determined <italic>Lxn</italic> mRNA abundance in tumor cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

The CpG island spans from within the canonical 5&#x02032; promoter (&#x02212;208 nt) to the transcription start site (+1 nt), and extends through the entire first exon (+44 nt). There are 15 CpG dinucleotides within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The CpG island identified here is not exactly same as the one reported previously, this may be due to the different criteria we used for defining this region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g002">Figure 2B</xref> depicts the quantitative variation in methylation for each CpG site among nine tumor cell lines.

Surprisingly, although HL-60 had very low <italic>Lxn</italic> expression, we found that none of the CpG sites were methylated. This is probably due to other epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone deacetylation of latexin promoter in HL 60 cells.</p><fig id="pone-0044979-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0044979.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Hypermethylation of <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter CpG sites in leukemic cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CpG-enriched region in <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter.

<italic>Lxn</italic> Inhibits Tumor Cell Growth through Increasing Apoptosis but not via its Canonical Function</title><p>As we previously reported in our normal hematopoietic stem cell studies, high <italic>Lxn</italic> expression is associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. To determine if these mechanisms were applied to our results with tumor cells, we next measured these two parameters in vector-infected A20 cells throughout 21 days of culture. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with BrdU and 7AAD allows for the discrimination of cell subsets that are apoptotic (A), necrotic (N) or reside in G0/G1, S and G2/M phase of cell cycle.

In order to test whether or not the suppressive effect of ectopic <italic>Lxn</italic> expression on the growth of A20 and WEHI231 cells was due to its canonical inhibitory activity, we carried out the following experiments. We first determined which <italic>Cpa</italic> genes are enriched in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. By searching our gene expression profile of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (unpublished data), we found that <italic>Cpa3</italic> is the only gene highly expressed in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044979.s002">Table S1</xref>). Next, we tested <italic>Cpa3</italic> expression in A20 cells that were uninfected, or infected with empty or <italic>Lxn</italic> expression vectors, and found that it was not expressed in any type of these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0044979.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Last, we treated A20 and WEHI cells with potato carboxypeptidase A inhibitor (PCPI), a 39 amino acid protein which strongly inhibits mammalian CPA, at a series of concentrations ranging from 5 to 60 ug/ml of culture medium. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, none of the concentrations had any effect on the growth patterns of the tumor lines, despite the continuous presence of PCPI for 12 days of culture. To rule out the possibility that PCPI failed to inhibit tumor growth because it did not enter the cells, we used fluorescein isothyiocyanate (FITC) to label PCPI in cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g004">Fig. 4D</xref> shows A20 cells following a 30 min incubation with labeled PCPI (30 ug/ml of culture medium). The three-color micrograph shows PCPI in green (FITC), the nucleus in blue (DAPI), and the B220 lymphoid cell surface marker in red (phycoerythrin, PE). It is apparent that PCPI is plentiful in the cytosol but is not found in the nucleus.

We isolated stem/progenitor-enriched CD34+ cells from bone marrow and blood cells in lymphoma and leukemia patients, as well as in normal donors. The patients included those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T cell pro-lymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), plasma cell leukemia (PCL), acute T cell lymphoma (ATLL) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL, preB phenotype). The normal CD34+ cell samples were derived from cord blood (CB) and young (31 and 35 years) and old (85 and 97 years) adults. <italic>Lxn</italic> mRNA expression, quantified by real-time PCR, was decreased by at least two-thirds in primary malignant CD34+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). Quantification of LXN in CD34+ cells of all human normal and leukemic samples compiled to date is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0044979-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>.

The observation that low <italic>Lxn</italic> expression in hematopoietic cells was associated with increased replication led us to hypothesize that <italic>Lxn</italic> was down-regulated in malignancies with high proliferative rates and/or low apoptosis.</p><p>Here, we show that <italic>Lxn</italic> is either not expressed or is strongly down-regulated in a variety of leukemias and lymphomas. As a result of these findings and close linkage structurally and genetically with TIG1, we proposed that <italic>Lxn</italic> may similarly act as a tumor suppressor. Along with this proposal, there is expectation that manipulation of <italic>Lxn</italic> levels in malignant cells would alter their growth characteristics. Accordingly, two lymphoma cell lines in which <italic>Lxn</italic> expression was absent were infected with a <italic>Lxn</italic> expression vector. In one of the most significant findings of this study, we found that re-initiation of <italic>Lxn</italic> expression dramatically reduced their growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results demonstrate that the level of <italic>Lxn</italic> expression is functionally related to both normal and malignant cell growth and, if the findings are true for human tumors, may provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention. Surprisingly, <italic>Lxn</italic> knock-out mice did not development leukemia nor lymphoma even though their hematopoietic stem cell pool was over-expanded and blast cells were detected in the peripheral blood <xref rid="pone.0044979-Mitsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. These results suggest that <italic>Lxn</italic> may influence the crucial, step in carcinogenesis <xref rid="pone.0044979-Greaves1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. It thus will be of great interest to introduce additional carcinogenetic &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d;, such as oncogenes or alkylating agents, to <italic>Lxn</italic> knockout stem cells to determine whether <italic>Lxn</italic> deletion will accelerate tumor development. In addition, we observed that re-initiation of <italic>Lxn</italic> expression did not completely suppress tumor cell growth, suggesting that it would at best be a part of a multi-drug regimen.</p><p>We investigated the possible mechanisms by which ectopic <italic>Lxn</italic> expression may suppress growth of lymphoma cells and found increased apoptosis to be the major mechanism causing inhibition. Consistent with our study of normal hematopoietic cells, our recent findings indicate that high <italic>Lxn</italic> content is associated with more apoptotic cells, thus fewer stem cells <xref rid="pone.0044979-Liang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Apoptosis is controlled by the balance of both positive (pro-apoptotic) and negative (anti-apoptotic) signals. We found that <italic>Lxn</italic>-induced apoptosis is mainly through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2 and Pim-2. Decreased level of Bcl-2 allows other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK to aggregate, inducing cytochrome C release and caspase activation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of Bcl-2 is implicated in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. <xref rid="pone.0044979-Kelly1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Three Pim-2 protein isoforms are active kinases which phosphorylate pro-apoptotic protein BAD and dissociate its binding from Bcl-xL, resulting in the inhibition of Bad-induced cell death. <xref rid="pone.0044979-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Macdonald1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> Enhanced expression of Pim-2 was detected in multiple B-cell lymphoma types <xref rid="pone.0044979-GomezAbad1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma <xref rid="pone.0044979-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, and acute myeloid leukemia <xref rid="pone.0044979-AgrawalSingh1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Thus our studies identify <italic>Lxn</italic> as a novel regulator of the apoptotic pathway, in which it suppresses tumor survival through the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Pim-2 anti-apoptotic factors.</p><p>The well- known function of <italic>Lxn</italic> is the sole carboxypeptidase A inhibitor in mammals. <xref rid="pone.0044979-Uratani1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> Therefore, it was plausible that other carboxypeptidase A inhibitors might mimic <italic>Lxn</italic>&#x02019;s anti-tumor effects. A CPA inhibitor from potato tubers has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of mammalian CPA and was therefore chosen to test its anti-tumor properties. We found that it freely entered A20 lymphoma cells but did not have suppressive growth effects via apoptosis, irrespective of dose. Since CPAs are not expressed in A20 cells, we conclude that non-canonical functions of <italic>Lxn</italic> were responsible, yet unknown intracellular functions of <italic>Lxn</italic> account for its anti-tumor effects. In addition, it is unlikely that tumor suppressive effect of <italic>Lxn</italic> is through the regulation of ABGL2-mediated microtubule tyrosination cycle, like TIG1, because we did not detect the expression of ABGL2 in hematopoietic cells (data not shown). These results are in line with findings of other investigations in which gene expression or protein abundance regulated by <italic>Lxn</italic> were not related to carboxypeptidase inhibition <xref rid="pone.0044979-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0044979-Mitsunaga1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, the action of mode of <italic>Lxn</italic> in regulating normal and malignant hematopoiesis is not through its canonical CPA inhibitor activity. Future studies aimed at identifying direct targets, or downstream signaling pathways, of <italic>Lxn</italic> will be critical for our understanding of its function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.</p><p>Addressing the issue of why and how <italic>Lxn</italic> expression is down-regulated in tumor cells, we found that CpG dinucleotides in regulatory regions of the <italic>Lxn</italic> gene were methylated. Most human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested showed strong patterns of methylation involving most of the 15 CpG dinucleotides in <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter. This, in turn, led to a loss of gene expression that was at least partially reversible. When cell lines were treated with de-methylating reagent, 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine, <italic>Lxn</italic> expression was re-initiated or up-regulated. Thus, hypermethylation of the CpG island in the <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter may contribute to silencing or down-regulation of <italic>Lxn</italic> expression in leukemia and lymphoma cells. Ongoing studies will focus on the genetic and epigenetic regulation of <italic>Lxn</italic> transcription in cancer stem cells, with promise for improved targeted approaches for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Young 8-to 12- week old female C57BL/6 (B6) and 7-week old female BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME).

Samples were then analyzed by denaturing PAGE (Novex, 10% bis-Tris gel) using the equivalent of 4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells per lane. Following electrophoresis, samples were electro-transferred onto immunobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), which were subsequently blocked and probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-LXN Ig-G antibody at a 1&#x02236;3000 dilution. This antibody was generated from the <italic>Lxn</italic>-specific amino acid sequence CKHNSRLPKEGQAE at the carboxyl terminus, and was produced by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX). The antibody for detection of human LXN was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA) and used at 1&#x02236;2000 dilution. The antibodies for apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bax, Bad were provide by Dr. Bondada. The antibody for Pim-2 was purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Primary antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and electro-chemifluorescent (ECF) reagent (Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Blots were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 860 system and Imagequant Software. Following the detection and quantification of anti-LXN antibody, immunobilon-P membrane was sequentially stripped in 40% methanol and the buffer containing 100 mm &#x000df;-mercaptoethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 62.4 mM Tris-HCl to remove ECF reaction product and antibodies, respectively. The stripped membrane was re-probed with anti-actin antibody (Sigma) at 1&#x02236;500,000 dilution and detected as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Genomic Bisulfite Sequencing</title><p>To investigate the methylation pattern of <italic>Lxn</italic> promoter, CpG island analysis in the upstream sequence of <italic>Lxn</italic> open reading frame.
