</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Both solid and liquid tumors are now understood to originate from the malignant transformation of resident adult stem and progenitor cells. [1], [2] Nowhere is this paradigm better established than in leukemia, yet events causing neoplastic conversion remain poorly understood. [3] We identified latexin (Lxn) as a novel, homeostatic regulator of the size of the hematopoietic stem cell population in mice. [4] The stem cell pool size was inversely related to quantitative Lxn expression at both the levels of transcript and protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We found that population size was influenced by Lxn in a stem cell-autonomous manner, and acting through the concerted mechanisms of self-renewal and apoptosis, which were decreased and increased, respectively, by Lxn abundance. [4] Thus, Lxn acts as a brake on the expansion of stem cell population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Unrestrained stem cell expansion carries with it the risk of mutations, genomic instability and carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that Lxn expression patterns in stem and progenitor cells may act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting stem and progenitor cell proliferation, influencing the crucial steps toward malignancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Lxn was primarily studied in the nervous system, involving the specification of cortical brain regions during development [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], as well as the speed of nerve transmission in adult peripheral nervous systems [10]. Lxn was found to be involved in the inflammatory response in macrophages owing to its paired cystatin-like domains [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It was detected in mast cells associated with a unique type of intracellular granule distinct from histamine-containing secretory granules and lysosomes [12]. Lxn has about 30% sequence homology, but much greater structural homology, with tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) (or retinoic acid receptor responder 1, RARRES1), whose expression was down-regulated in an extensive list of tumor types in humans. [11], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Lxn and TIG1 are closely linked genetically and may represent members of a family of functionally related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Lxn was reported to be a TNF-responsive gene in human papillovirus-infected keratinocytes, suggesting that it may contribute to TNF-mediated suppression of cervical cancer development [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A recent report revealed that Lxn was down-regulated in patients with gastric carcinomas, and overexpression or knockdown of Lxn inhibited or stimulated tumor growth respectively [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Decreased or absent Lxn expression was observed in several human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines [19], as well as in malignant melanoma patients. [20] However, there is still lack of direct evidence for the cause-effect relationship between Lxn and hematopoietic malignancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Gene silencing, especially of tumor suppressors, and inappropriate gene activation, especially of oncogenes, are common themes in carcinogenesis. [21] Both often occur through aberrant DNA methylation that is accentuated during aging. [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27] A CpG-enriched region was identified in Lxn promoter and its hypermethylation was found in a variety of human gastric carcinoma cell lines. [18] Promoter hypermethylation of TIG1 was also associated with its silencing in tumor cells. [13], [16] However, it is not known whether Lxn expression is regulated by promoter methylation in hematopoietic malignancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Lxn in regulating hematopoiesis has not been determined yet. Lxn protein binds to carboxypeptidase A (Cpa) and inhibits its enzymatic activity, indicating that Lxn regulates protein degradation and metabolism. [19] Lxn was highly expressed in mast cells and its expression was further enhanced by LPS, indicating its potential function in inflammation. [11] Proteomic analysis on Lxn knock-out hematopoietic cells revealed that Lxn deletion reduced the abundance of multiple cellular proteins, especially those involving cell-stroma interaction, such as N-cadherin, Tie2, and Roundabout 4. [19] Ectopic expression of Lxn in gastric cancer cell lines led to the differential expressions of several cancer-related genes, including Maspin, WFDC1, SLPI, S100P, and PDGEFB [18], although none of them are overlapped with previously mentioned proteomic results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A recent study revealed ATP/GTP binding protein-like 2 (AGBL2) as a novel binding partner of TIG1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The interaction between TIG1 and AGBL2 regulates the microtubule tyrosination cycle, which is implicated in tumorigenesis, stem cell differentiation and development. [28] Lxn thus may have the similar mechanisms as TIG1 to regulate hematopoiesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence obtained from a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, as well as from primary cells from patients with these diseases, that Lxn expression is almost universally absent or significantly reduced from that of normal stem and progenitor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Moreover, treatment with a de-methylating agent at least partially restores Lxn expression in a variety of tumor cell lines, and methylation level of the CpG island in the Lxn promoter region is inversely associated with its expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Perhaps most importantly, we show that when Lxn expression was re-initiated ectopically in two lymphoma cell lines using a retroviral expression vector, their growth, both in vitro and in vivo, was significantly blunted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We further show that Lxn inhibits lymphoma cell growth by significantly increasing apoptosis through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and that its anti-tumor activity is mediated via mechanisms unique from its canonical inhibition of carboxypeptidase A. These results demonstrate that Lxn plays a functional role in tumor cell growth and introduces an unexplored pathway potentially important to cancer treatment in patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the loss or decrease of Lxn expression in malignant cell lines resulted from promoter hypermethylation, methylation of the 5′ CpG island of Lxn gene surrounding its transcriptional start site was determined by genomic bisulfite sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The CpG island spans from within the canonical 5′ promoter (−208 nt) to the transcription start site (+1 nt), and extends through the entire first exon (+44 nt). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The CpG island identified here is not exactly same as the one reported previously, this may be due to the different criteria we used for defining this region.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that Lxn promoter hypermethylation might be involved in the loss of expression in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, we studied the effect of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating reagent, on Lxn expression (Fig. 2C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The up-regulation of Lxn by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in HL60 cells, which shows no hypermethylation of CpG sties (Fig. 2B), might be because the demethylation of other DNA sequences induces chromatin remodeling, thus exposing Lxn promoter for the transcriptional initiation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Recently we found that Lxn is a natural regulator of hematopoietic stem cell population in mice by influencing self-renewal and apoptosis [4]. Lxn expression in stem cells is inversely proportional to the size of the population in mice and thus acts as a negative regulator through cell-intrinsic mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The observation that low Lxn expression in hematopoietic cells was associated with increased replication led us to hypothesize that Lxn was down-regulated in malignancies with high proliferative rates and/or low apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that Lxn is either not expressed or is strongly down-regulated in a variety of leukemias and lymphomas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>As a result of these findings and close linkage structurally and genetically with TIG1, we proposed that Lxn may similarly act as a tumor suppressor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Along with this proposal, there is expectation that manipulation of Lxn levels in malignant cells would alter their growth characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, two lymphoma cell lines in which Lxn expression was absent were infected with a Lxn expression vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In one of the most significant findings of this study, we found that re-initiation of Lxn expression dramatically reduced their growth in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the level of Lxn expression is functionally related to both normal and malignant cell growth and, if the findings are true for human tumors, may provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, Lxn knock-out mice did not development leukemia nor lymphoma even though their hematopoietic stem cell pool was over-expanded and blast cells were detected in the peripheral blood [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Lxn may influence the crucial, step in carcinogenesis [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It thus will be of great interest to introduce additional carcinogenetic “hits”, such as oncogenes or alkylating agents, to Lxn knockout stem cells to determine whether Lxn deletion will accelerate tumor development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed that re-initiation of Lxn expression did not completely suppress tumor cell growth, suggesting that it would at best be a part of a multi-drug regimen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>We investigated the possible mechanisms by which ectopic Lxn expression may suppress growth of lymphoma cells and found increased apoptosis to be the major mechanism causing inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our study of normal hematopoietic cells, our recent findings indicate that high Lxn content is associated with more apoptotic cells, thus fewer stem cells [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Apoptosis is controlled by the balance of both positive (pro-apoptotic) and negative (anti-apoptotic) signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>We found that Lxn-induced apoptosis is mainly through the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2 and Pim-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Decreased level of Bcl-2 allows other pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK to aggregate, inducing cytochrome C release and caspase activation, and apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Dysregulation of Bcl-2 is implicated in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. [32] Three Pim-2 protein isoforms are active kinases which phosphorylate pro-apoptotic protein BAD and dissociate its binding from Bcl-xL, resulting in the inhibition of Bad-induced cell death. [33], [34] Enhanced expression of Pim-2 was detected in multiple B-cell lymphoma types [35], T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma [36], and acute myeloid leukemia [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Thus our studies identify Lxn as a novel regulator of the apoptotic pathway, in which it suppresses tumor survival through the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Pim-2 anti-apoptotic factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The well- known function of Lxn is the sole carboxypeptidase A inhibitor in mammals. [12] Therefore, it was plausible that other carboxypeptidase A inhibitors might mimic Lxn’s anti-tumor effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>A CPA inhibitor from potato tubers has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of mammalian CPA and was therefore chosen to test its anti-tumor properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We found that it freely entered A20 lymphoma cells but did not have suppressive growth effects via apoptosis, irrespective of dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Since CPAs are not expressed in A20 cells, we conclude that non-canonical functions of Lxn were responsible, yet unknown intracellular functions of Lxn account for its anti-tumor effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is unlikely that tumor suppressive effect of Lxn is through the regulation of ABGL2-mediated microtubule tyrosination cycle, like TIG1, because we did not detect the expression of ABGL2 in hematopoietic cells (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>These results are in line with findings of other investigations in which gene expression or protein abundance regulated by Lxn were not related to carboxypeptidase inhibition [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Thus, the action of mode of Lxn in regulating normal and malignant hematopoiesis is not through its canonical CPA inhibitor activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Future studies aimed at identifying direct targets, or downstream signaling pathways, of Lxn will be critical for our understanding of its function in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Addressing the issue of why and how Lxn expression is down-regulated in tumor cells, we found that CpG dinucleotides in regulatory regions of the Lxn gene were methylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Most human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines tested showed strong patterns of methylation involving most of the 15 CpG dinucleotides in Lxn promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, led to a loss of gene expression that was at least partially reversible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>When cell lines were treated with de-methylating reagent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, Lxn expression was re-initiated or up-regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Thus, hypermethylation of the CpG island in the Lxn promoter may contribute to silencing or down-regulation of Lxn expression in leukemia and lymphoma cells. </plain></SENT>
