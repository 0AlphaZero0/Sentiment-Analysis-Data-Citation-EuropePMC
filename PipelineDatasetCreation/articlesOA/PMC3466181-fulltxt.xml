Recent investigations have suggested that the NC-loop might be involved in catalysis and substrate recognition in many enzymes from the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily. To foster a deep understanding of its role in catalysis, stability, and divergent evolution, we here systemically investigated the function of the NC-loop (residues 131&#x02013;151) in a lipase (FClip1) from thermophilic bacterium <italic>Fervidobacterium changbaicum</italic> by loop deletion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis. We found that the upper part of the NC-loop (residues 131&#x02013;138) was of great importance to enzyme catalysis. Single substitutions in this region could fine-tune the activity of FClip1 as much as 41-fold, and any deletions from this region rendered the enzyme completely inactive. The lower part of the NC-loop (residues 139&#x02013;151) was capable of enduring extensive deletions without loss of activity. The shortened mutants in this region were found to show both improved activity and increased stability simultaneously. We therefore speculated that the NC-loop, especially the lower part, would be a perfect target for enzyme engineering to optimize the enzymatic properties, and might present a hot zone for the divergent evolution of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolases. Our findings may provide an opportunity for better understanding of the mechanism of divergent evolution in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily, and may also guide the design of novel biocatalysts for industrial applications.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by National Basic Research Program of China (973 program, 2012CB721000 and 2011CBA00800), and the Natural Science Foundation of China (30970632).

The enzymes in this superfamily can recognize a broad variety of functional groups, including carboxylic acids, epoxides, peptides, alkyl halides, and hydroxynitriles <xref rid="pone.0046881-Holmquist1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. For this reason, they are one of the most widely used groups of biocatalysts in industry <xref rid="pone.0046881-Bornscheuer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, although the members of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily display great diversity in their sequence and function, all of them have a canonical &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold, which consists of a mostly parallel, twisted, eight-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet flanked by &#x003b1;-helices on both sides. This core architecture functions as a stable scaffold to accommodate the catalytic residues and can tolerate large insertions without losing its structure or catalytic machinery. The insertions can occur at several locations, including the loops after &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;4, &#x003b2;6, &#x003b2;7 or &#x003b2;8 <xref rid="pone.0046881-Nardini1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. They can vary from a few amino acid residues to a complete extra domain. This affects the geometry and microenvironment of the active site, and gives the family members striking abilities to accommodate different substrates.</p><p>The insertion after the &#x003b2;6 sheet is the most important one in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily. It forms the lid or cap domain of many family members <xref rid="pone.0046881-Holmquist1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-Nardini1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and has great impact on the substrate recognition and catalysis <xref rid="pone.0046881-Miled1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-Dugi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Recently, it has been found that the flexible loops that link the insertions onto the core architecture also play important roles in enzymatic function. The loop, the so-called NC-loop, is located right after the &#x003b2;6 sheet, and it connects the N-terminus of the catalytic domain and the cap domain. After studying the sequence and structure of epoxide hydrolases, Pleiss and his colleagues proposed that NC-loop might interact with the substrate by defining the substrate-binding pocket and regulating the accessibility of active site <xref rid="pone.0046881-Barth1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-Barth2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Later, it was proved that the residue Tyr on the NC-loop of epoxide hydrolases is involved in substrate binding, stabilization of the transition state, and possibly protonation of the epoxide oxygen <xref rid="pone.0046881-Nardini2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-Elfstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The NC-loop of the esterase ybfF carries the catalytic residue Asp <xref rid="pone.0046881-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The catalytic residue Glu of haloalkane dehalogenases is also found within the NC-loop <xref rid="pone.0046881-Chovancova1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. All these evidences suggest that exploring the functional and evolutionary role of the NC-loop may be important for understanding the adaptation and evolution of these kinds of enzymes.</p><p>Lipases prefer to hydrolyze water-insoluble triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids. They have tremendous potential applications in the synthesis of optically active compounds, bulk products such as laundry detergents, lipids and biodiesel <xref rid="pone.0046881-Jaeger1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The lipase V family is a subfamily of the bacterial lipolytic enzyme family. The enzymes belonging to this subfamily share certain amino acid sequence similarity (20&#x02013;25%). Besides lipases, there are also various bacterial non-lipolytic enzymes in this family, such as epoxide hydrolases, dehalogenases, meta-cleavage product hydrolases, and non-heme haloperoxidases (perhydrolases) <xref rid="pone.0046881-Arpigny1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The members of the lipase V family have structures consisting of an &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold domain and a cap domain. A long NC-loop linking these two domains participates in the formation of the substrate-binding site and may modulate the movement of the cap domain. The NC-loops of epoxide hydrolases and haloalkane dehalogenases have been proved to play important roles in enzyme catalysis and substrate binding, but little attention has been paid to the functional role of the NC-loop in the lipase V family.</p><p>Recently, we cloned a novel lipase gene from thermophilic bacterium <italic>Fervidobacterium changbaicum</italic>. This lipase belongs to the lipase V family. The gene was overexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the recombinant protein FClip1 showed high activity towards triglycerides and <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl esters with varying alkyl chain lengths <xref rid="pone.0046881-Cai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. FClip1 displayed extreme stability at high temperatures, and had a maximum activity at 80&#x000b0;C. Structural modeling suggested that it has a canonical &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold domain and a cap domain. Its NC-loop has 21 amino acid residues and links the &#x003b2;6 strand of the catalytic domain to the &#x003b1;4 helix of the cap domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). This loop is longer than its counterparts in the lipase V family but shows considerable similarity to that of the perhydrolase family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This implies that it might have some unique function in this enzyme and evolutionary relevance to the perhydrolase family.</p><fig id="pone-0046881-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0046881.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The structure of FClip1 and sequence alignment of FClip1 with related &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolases in the NC-loop region.</title><p>(A) Secondary structure topology diagram of FClip1.

In order to obtain its structural information, the modeled structure of FClip1 was constructed by using Phyre 2 Protein Fold Recognition Server with the aryl esterase PFE from <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> (PDB code: 1VA4) as a template (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s012">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s002">S2A</xref> for the details). Phyre 2 uses the alignment of hidden Markov models and incorporates <italic>ab initio</italic> folding simulation. This significantly improves modeling accuracy that could routinely create the accurate models at very low sequence identity (15&#x02013;25%) <xref rid="pone.0046881-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Phyre 2 has been used successfully to model the 3D structures of many proteins, such as esterase <xref rid="pone.0046881-Levisson1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, endonuclease <xref rid="pone.0046881-Calvo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and phosphomevalonate kinase <xref rid="pone.0046881-Herdendorf1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, providing valuable and timely information for both basic research and industrial applications. The modeled structure of FClip1 possesses a catalytic domain and a cap domain. In this way, it is similar to the epoxide hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenases, meta-cleavage product hydrolases and non-heme haloperoxidases of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The catalytic domain of FClip1 has a canonical &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold and the active site is located at the interface between the two domains. The cap domain is constituted of four &#x003b1;-helices and locates on the top of the catalytic domain.</p><p>Accurately defining the boundary of NC-loop is crucial for studying its structure-function relationship. The modeled structure of FClip1 shows that the NC-loop contains 21 residues (Asp131&#x02013;Lys151), and connects the &#x003b2;6 strand of the catalytic domain and the &#x003b1;4 helix of the cap domain. In order to further validate the recognition of NC-loop, the secondary structure of FClip1 was predicted independently as a complement to the 3D structure modeling. The amino acid sequence of FClip1 was submitted to the online servers Porter <xref rid="pone.0046881-Pollastri1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and SCRATCH <xref rid="pone.0046881-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, respectively. Consistent with the modeled structure, the results of both servers suggested that the NC-loop connected the catalytic domain and the cap domain, and was a long loop region starting from the residue Asp131 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the NC-loop demarcates the boundary of the two domains and performs a hinge-like function. It has been reported that such hinge-like loops usually regulate the relative orientation of two domains and play roles in modulating enzymatic activity and substrate specificity [22&#x02013;24]. Based on the solvent accessibility surface of amino acid residues, NC-loop can be roughly divided into two parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The N-terminal part (Asp131&#x02013;Ser138, upper part) is located in the interior of the protein and participates in the formation of the substrate-binding pocket, and the C-terminal part (Glu139&#x02013;Lys151, lower part) is a highly surface-exposed region that contains relatively high numbers of charged residues (Glu139, Asp140, Lys149, and Lys151, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0046881-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0046881.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Design of the NC-loop deletion mutagenesis of FClip1.</title><p>(A) Detailed structural conformation of the NC-loop.

(B) The design of systematic deletion of the NC-loop.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0046881.g002"/></fig><p>Comparing the amino acid sequence of the NC-loop in FClip1 to its counterparts in the lipase V family revealed a six-residue insertion (Asn143&#x02013;Phe148) in the middle of the NC-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Given the fact that FClip1 is a thermophilic protein and is much more stable than other members of the lipase V family, this long NC-loop is an unusual feature because longer flexible loops are entropically more costly and thermodynamically unfavorable than short ones <xref rid="pone.0046881-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-ScalleyKim1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that this NC-loop showed certain similarity to that of the perhydrolase family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). They share similar length (20&#x02013;21 residues) and have two conserved residues (Asn143 and Pro144) in the C-terminal region of the NC-loop. Actually, phylogenetic tree analysis showed that FClip1 has the nearest evolutionary distance to the perhydrolase family among all the members from lipase V family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In addition, a trace of perhydrolase activity (about 3 mU/mg) was found in FClip1, which is about three orders of magnitude lower than its lipase activity (Li <italic>et al</italic>. unpublished results). We therefore speculated that FClip1 might be an evolutionary intermediate between perhydrolases and lipases.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Effects of the NC-loop on the Catalytic Activity of FClip1</title><p>In order to understand the function of the NC-loop in catalysis, the &#x00394;NC-loop mutant lacking all 21 residues of the NC-loop and the &#x00394;6 mutant lacking the insertion region (Asn143&#x02013;Phe148) were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Both of the mutants can be expressed in soluble form in <italic>E. coli</italic> with reasonable expression levels (&#x0223c;5 mg protein/g cell). Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that both of the mutants had well-folded secondary structures and remained a typical &#x003b1;-helix/&#x003b2;-sheet spectral signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting that the deletions from the NC-loop did not change the overall folding state of the enzyme.</p><p>Enzymatic activities of the mutants were measured at 75&#x000b0;C using <italic>p</italic>NPC4 and <italic>p</italic>NPC12 as substrates, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046881-t001">Table 1</xref>, deletion of the entire NC-loop (&#x00394;NC-loop mutant) caused a complete loss of catalytic activity.

However, the six-residue insertion can be deleted without damaging the activity. This suggests that the catalytic function of FClip1 is not related to this inserting region. In order to investigate the functional elements of the NC-loop in more detail, we designed and constructed a series of mutants by systematically truncating the NC-loop from its N-terminal or C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). All the mutants could be expressed in soluble form in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the far-UV CD spectra of the representative mutants show that the overall folding states of the enzymes were not affected by the deletions from the NC-loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s005">Figure S5</xref>). However, the deletions at different regions of NC-loop resulted in different structural consequences. For the N&#x00394;8 mutant, the mean residue ellipticity ([&#x003b8;]<sub>MRW</sub>) at 193 nm lowered and the minima at 208 and 222 nm lost intensity compared to wild type. The calculation of secondary structure composition showed the helical content of the N&#x00394;8 mutant decreased by 11% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s013">Table S2</xref>). For the C&#x00394;7 and C&#x00394;13 mutants, there was a substantial increase in helical structure by 8% and 6%, respectively, as indicated by the increased signals at 193, 208 and 222 nm.</p><p>Deletions from the N-terminal and C-terminal of the NC-loop showed very different effects on enzymatic activity. Deletions from the upper part of the NC-loop (N&#x00394;3, N&#x00394;5, N&#x00394;7, and N&#x00394;8 mutants) caused the enzyme to lose more than 98.6% of its activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046881-t001">Table 1</xref>). Removing as little as three residues could greatly inactivate the enzyme. The deletions caused slight increases in <italic>K</italic>

<sub>cat</sub>, whose effects are similar to those of the removal of the entire NC-loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046881-t001">Table 1</xref>). The lower part of the NC-loop (Glu139&#x02013;Lys151), however, was able to tolerate extensive deletion without loss of activity. The C&#x00394;3, C&#x00394;5, C&#x00394;7, and C&#x00394;13 mutants showed comparable activity for <italic>p</italic>NPC12 to that of the wild type enzyme, and increased activity for <italic>p</italic>NPC4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046881-t001">Table 1</xref>). The C&#x00394;13 mutant, which lacked all 13 residues of the lower part (Glu139&#x02013;Lys151), even increased its catalytic efficiency about 2.1-fold. Deletions from the lower part of the NC-loop were also found to change the substrate preference. The C&#x00394;3, C&#x00394;5, C&#x00394;7, and C&#x00394;13 mutants were more favorable to <italic>p</italic>NP-esters with shorter acyl chain length than the wild type enzyme. The selectivity of the C&#x00394;3, C&#x00394;5, C&#x00394;7, and C&#x00394;13 mutants between <italic>p</italic>NPC4 and <italic>p</italic>NPC12 were increased 1.8-, 1.6-, 1.9-, and 2.2-fold, respectively. This confirmed our structural modeling results that the NC-loop is involved in substrate binding.</p><p>In order to pinpoint the residues that might account for the loss of activity of the upper part deletion mutants, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis on the upper part of the NC-loop. The residues within the Asp131-Ser138 region were substituted with Ala except for Ala132 and Ala133. All mutants retained a considerable degree of activity, no less than 70% of that of wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046881-t002">Table 2</xref>). The best mutant D131A even enhanced the specific activity about 2.2-fold and exhibited a catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic>
<sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic>
<sub>m</sub>) 1.8-fold higher than that of wild type. These results indicated that the residues in this region are not directly involved in enzyme catalysis. Considering this and the fact that the lower part of the NC-loop can be deleted without loss of activity, we conclude that none of the side chains on the NC-loop is essential to the catalysis. This is different from some members of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily, in which the residues on the NC-loop play crucial roles in the catalytic process, such as stabilizing the transition state <xref rid="pone.0046881-Nardini2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, anchoring the substrate <xref rid="pone.0046881-Elfstrm1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, or serving as the catalytic residue <xref rid="pone.0046881-Park1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046881-Chovancova1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. NC-loop also serves the hinge-like function and its flexibility mediates the orientation of the cap domain. The variability in the position of the cap domain is likely to have a significant impact on activity and substrate recognition <xref rid="pone.0046881-Bains1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, the NC-loop may be an important region to divergent evolution in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily. It has been reported that the NC-loop plays a crucial role in the conversion of an esterase into the epoxide hydrolase <xref rid="pone.0046881-Jochens1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This is an excellent example of the evolutionary role of the NC-loop in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily. In this way, the evolution of the NC-loop may have been an important event during the divergent evolution of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0046881-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0046881.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Specific activities and kinetic parameters of the wild type FClip1 and its mutants.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0046881-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0046881.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enzyme</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Specific activity (U mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Together with the increased thermostabilty and chemical resistance, these results suggest that the stabilizing effect of the loop-deletion mutants may come from the increased local stability of the active site. The lower part of the NC-loop might be highly flexible, thus the deletions from this region could increase the local rigidity of the protein. Given the participation of the NC-loop in the formation of substrate pocket, it is not surprising that the deletions from the NC-loop would affect the flexibility of the active site. This is consistent with previous bioinformatic surveys and accumulated structural studies showing that shorter loop regions are a common strategy for the proteins to improve the stability <xref rid="pone.0046881-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0046881-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Insight into the Structural Changes Caused by Deletion of the Lower Part of NC-loop</title><p>The C&#x00394;13 mutant is a special mutant, which displayed a 2-fold increase in activity and a 12-fold increase in stability over wild type.

This is an unusual phenomenon because it does not obey the generally accepted principle of stability-function tradeoffs <xref rid="pone.0046881-Tokuriki1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This kind of mutations is very rare in point mutations and may be valuable for protein engineering. In order to better understand the structural basis of this property, the 3D model of C&#x00394;13 was constructed by homology modeling using the above-mentioned wild type structure as a template (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046881.s002">Figure S2B</xref> for Ramachandran plot of the model).

Therefore, any modification at this region may have significant impact on the geometry of the substrate-binding pocket. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046881-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, deletion of the loop changed the shape and enlarged the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket. The electrostatic potential of the protein surface near the NC-loop also changed significantly because of the removal of four charged residues (Glu139, Asp140, Lys149, and Lys151). These structural differences altered the microenvironment of the active site, which may account for the change in the activity of the C&#x00394;13 mutant.</p><p>The structural information allowed us to expound the changes in the properties of the C&#x00394;13 mutant. On one hand, C&#x00394;13 had a much shorter NC-loop that decreased the redundant flexibility near the active site, and thus increased the stability of the enzyme. On the other hand, deletion of the lower part of NC-loop changed the geometry and electrostatic distribution of the substrate-binding pocket, which might account for the change in activity. This kind of structural effects is rare to achieve by regular site-directed mutagenesis. Actually, the importance of loop deletions and insertions has been well recognized in both natural protein evolution and protein engineering [34&#x02013;36]. The C&#x00394;13 mutant improved activity and stability simultaneously, presenting a good example to demonstrate the evolutionary potential of NC-loop. Given the great divergence of NC-loop in the different &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolases, this region seems to have great potential to be evolved for a particular functional requirement.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Conclusion Remarks</title><p>Flexible loops play important roles in many protein functions, such as hinging the concerted movement between protein domains <xref rid="pone.0046881-Knfel1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, participating in the formation of the binding sites for metallic cations <xref rid="pone.0046881-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and ligands <xref rid="pone.0046881-Maes1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, mediating protein-protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0046881-McPhalen1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and modulating protein stability <xref rid="pone.0046881-Nagi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The insertions and deletions of loop regions on protein scaffolds are the key event during the divergent evolution of enzyme families <xref rid="pone.0046881-Holmquist1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In this study, we have systemically investigated the function of the NC-loop of FClip1 by loop deletion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results suggest that the NC-loop could modulate both catalytic activity and stability of FClip1. While the upper part of the NC-loop is crucial to enzyme catalysis, the lower part can tolerate extensive modifications and may serve as a plastic region for further protein engineering. To our knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly evaluate the role of the NC-loop in enzyme catalysis, stability, and divergent evolution. Because of the great diversity of the NC-loop in sequence, conformation, and function in the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase fold superfamily, we believe it is necessary to establish the panoramic sequence-structure-function relationship map of NC-loop in different &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolases. This will not only help us to better understand the mechanism of divergent evolution of the &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; hydrolase superfamily, but may also promote the engineering of this important group of enzymes for industrial applications.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Enzymes, Bacterial Strains, and Reagents</title><p>DNA polymerase and PCR reagents were purchased from TaKaRa (Otsu, Japan).
