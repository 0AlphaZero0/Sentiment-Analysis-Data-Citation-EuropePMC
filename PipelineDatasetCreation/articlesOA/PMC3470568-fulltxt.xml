In 2011&#x02013;2012, the influenza B epidemic in Taiwan was unusually large, and influenza B was predominant for a long time. To investigate the genetic dynamics of influenza B viruses during the 2011&#x02013;2012 epidemic, we analyzed the sequences of 4,386 influenza B viruses collected in Taiwan from 2004 to 2012. The data provided detailed insight into the flux patterns of multiple genotypes. We found that a re-emergent TW08-I virus, which was the major genotype and had co-circulated with the two others, TW08-II and TW08-III, from 2007 to 2009 in Taiwan, successively overtook TW08-II in March and then underwent a lineage switch in July 2011. This lineage switch was followed by the large epidemic in Taiwan. The whole-genome compositions and phylogenetic relationships of the representative viruses of various genotypes were compared to determine the viral evolutionary histories. We demonstrated that the large influenza B epidemic of 2011&#x02013;2012 was caused by Yamagata lineage TW08-I viruses that were derived from TW04-II viruses in 2004&#x02013;2005 through genetic drifts without detectable reassortments. The TW08-I viruses isolated in both 2011&#x02013;2012 and 2007&#x02013;2009 were antigenically similar, indicating that an influenza B virus have persisted for 5 years in antigenic stasis before causing a large epidemic. The results suggest that in addition to the emergence of new variants with mutations or reassortments, other factors, including the interference of multi-types or lineages of influenza viruses and the accumulation of susceptible hosts, can also affect the scale and time of an influenza B epidemic.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by grants from Centers for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan (DOH100-DC-2019, DOH100-DC-2022, DOH101-DC-2015 and DOH101-DC-2401).

Influenza B viruses are not classified into different subtypes based on the HA and NA genes, as influenza A viruses are. However, since 1983 or earlier, isolates of influenza B viruses have been divided into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, defined by the reference strains B/Victoria/2/87 (Vic87) and B/Yamagata/16/88 (Yam88) <xref rid="pone.0047179-Kanegae1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Rota1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Viruses of these two lineages have been observed to circulate simultaneously or individually in particular time periods and areas <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. For example, in the United States, Vic87-lineage influenza B viruses were predominant during the 1980s, but during which time, these viruses were isolated only from sporadic outbreaks in Europe and Asia <xref rid="pone.0047179-Rota1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. During the 1990s, Yam88-lineage influenza B viruses replaced Vic87-lineage viruses and became the predominant strains in the United States. However, both Vic87- and Yam88-lineage influenza B viruses were still detected in eastern Asia during this period. During the 2000&#x02013;2001 season, Vic87 viruses re-emerged and spread worldwide, and both Vic87 and Yam88 viruses co-circulated in many countries <xref rid="pone.0047179-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Thus, the epidemics of influenza B viruses fluctuated periodically and geographically.</p><p>The evolution and antigenic drift of influenza B viruses are slower than those of influenza A viruses <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Hay1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; nonetheless, various mechanisms of insertion, deletion and reassortment within different lineages increase the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Nerome1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Influenza B viruses have experienced relatively frequent segment reassortment events, and reassortments between different lineages have resulted in high genome diversity, and multiple genotypes can co-circulate during a particular time period and in a particular area <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Matsuzaki1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, it has been shown that the influenza B viruses isolated between 1979 and 2003 belong to at least fourteen genotypes, resulting from genomic reassortments between the descendents of Vic87 and Yam88 viruses <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. These newly emerging reassortants were associated with unusual influenza B epidemic. For example, in 2002&#x02013;2003, the worldwide influenza B epidemic was attributed to new reassortant variants <xref rid="pone.0047179-Shaw1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Therefore, analyses of the influenza B gene constellation are an important part of the surveillance of these viruses.</p><p>In Taiwan, Yam88- and Vic87-lineage influenza B viruses have circulated/co-circulated during the seasonal or inter-season periods of influenza. Most of the influenza B viruses isolated from 1998 to 2001 belonged to the Yam88 lineage, but some Vic87 viruses were also isolated in March 2001 <xref rid="pone.0047179-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In 2002, at least three genotypes of influenza B virus strains were identified, including B/Shanghai/361/2002-like strains (Yam88 lineage), B/Hong Kong/330/01-like strains (Vic87 lineage) and B/Hong Kong/1351/02-like strains (reassortant Vic87 lineage with Yam88 NA) <xref rid="pone.0047179-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In the epidemic of 2004&#x02013;2005, reassortant Vic87 viruses and two genotypes of Yam88 viruses were detected in Taiwan, and the re-emergent reassortant Vic87 viruses also caused the epidemic in 2006&#x02013;2007 <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Jian1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In the 2011&#x02013;2012 season, Yam88-lineage viruses were found to uniquely emerge in Taiwan <xref rid="pone.0047179-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, whereas Vic87 lineage viruses circulated in some regions of the world and predominated in China; during this time, influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the major type in Europe and the USA <xref rid="pone.0047179-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. To track the genomic characteristics and dynamics of the viruses during the large epidemic of 2011&#x02013;2012 in Taiwan, we analyzed and compared the HA sequences of influenza B viruses collected in Taiwan from 2004 to 2012. The whole genomes of several representative viruses of various genotypes were also included in the analysis. These data allowed the evolutionary processes of influenza B viruses to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Laboratory Surveillance of Influenza Viruses in Taiwan</title><p>The data from the Taiwan influenza surveillance network revealed that the prevalence of influenza subtypes/types varied from season to season. From July 2004 to March 2012, there were six periods predominated by influenza B viruses; three were the influenza seasons of 2004&#x02013;2005, 2006&#x02013;2007 and 2011&#x02013;2012, and the other three were the inter-season periods in 2008, 2010 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). Of note, the influenza epidemic of 2011&#x02013;2012 was larger and longer than previous epidemics caused by influenza B viruses in Taiwan. It was unusual for influenza B viruses to continue to predominate for a long period across the inter-season and seasonal periods. In addition, influenza B viruses replaced influenza A viruses as the major influenza viruses from March 2011 to February 2012. To continuously monitor the genetic characteristics of the evolving influenza B viruses, the Taiwan CDC has regularly performed large-scale analysis of the viral HA sequences <xref rid="pone.0047179-Jian2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In this study, we analyzed 4,386 (68.2%) of the 6,430 influenza B isolates collected from July 2004 to March 2012. Based on the HA sequences, we genetically classified these influenza B viruses into the Vic87 and Yam88 lineages and their respective sub-lineages. The prevalence of each lineage during this 8-year period, analyzed month by month, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>. Vic87 and Yam88 viruses either co-circulated with each other, or one of the lineages became the predominant type during a period of 1&#x02013;2 years covering the influenza season and the inter-season period, and then predominance shifted to the other lineage. For example, in 2004&#x02013;2005, both Vic87 and Yam88 viruses co-circulated. Then, Vic87 viruses were dominant in the 2006&#x02013;2007 season and in the inter-season of 2010, whereas Yam88 viruses predominated in the inter-season of 2008 and the season of 2011&#x02013;2012 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). Of note, the unusually large epidemic of 2011&#x02013;2012 in Taiwan, caused by re-emergent Yam88-lineage viruses, occurred after a lineage switch took place in July 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0047179-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0047179.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Data from the laboratory-based surveillance network in Taiwan from 2004 to 2012.</title><p>(A) The monthly distributions of the influenza isolates, including A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses, are shown as bars.

The phylogenetic relationships based on HA showed that most of the viruses from the 2011&#x02013;2012 season belonged to a large TW08-I genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), which was the major Yam88-lineage genotype and co-circulated with two other genotypes, TW08-II and TW08-III, during 2007&#x02013;2009 in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The specific amino acid residues in HA genes of the three genotypes viruses were 63K, 123A and 244G for TW08-I; 165I, 180Y and 244D for TW08-II; as well as 244S and 439E for TW08-III. We further tracked the epidemiologic changes in the TW08-I genotype from 2007&#x02013;2012. Although the prevalence of TW08-I was the highest (54%) among the co-circulating viruses in 2008, it was replaced by TW08-II in 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, TW08-I re-emerged in 2011. TW08-I viruses first overtook the TW08-II viruses in March 2011, and in July 2011, the TW08-I viruses replaced the Vic87 viruses that had been the predominant viruses circulating in Taiwan since March 2010. Subsequently, the TW08-I viruses caused a large epidemic in 2011&#x02013;2012 in Taiwan. There were relatively fewer TW08-II isolates in 2011&#x02013;2012, and the TW08-III genotype was not detected after May 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). With respect to the antigenicity of these TW08-I viruses, ferret antisera against each of the genotypes were used for the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Based on the results of HI tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t001">Table 1</xref>), of the 2011&#x02013;2012 viruses tested using antisera raised against the prototype TW08-I virus B/Taiwan/3798/2007, TW08-II virus B/Taiwan/30/2008 and TW08-III virus B/Taiwan/2563/2008, they all showed good reactivity compared with the titer against the homologous virus. Some of them showed slightly reduced reaction (a 4-fold reduced titer compared with the titer against the homologous virus) with antisera raised against the TW08-I virus B/Taiwan/94748/2012 and TW08-II virus B/Taiwan/101/2010. The results suggested that TW08-I viruses circulating in 2011&#x02013;2012 were antigenically similar to those in 2007&#x02013;2009. We also observed that antisera raised against TW08-I viruses B/Taiwan/3798/2007 and B/Taiwan/94748/2012 reacted less with TW08-II reference viruses, resulting in a &#x0003e;4-fold reduction in the HI titer. It indicated that the Yam88 viruses of 2007&#x02013;2012 have evolved genetically into three genotypes and some isolates in TW08-II seemed to diversify antigenically.</p><fig id="pone-0047179-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0047179.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Phylogentic analysis of HA genes and distribution of various genotypes.</title><p>(A) Phylogenetic topology of the HA genes from multiple genotypes of influenza B viruses from 2007 to 2012 in Taiwan.

Viruses in Taiwan</title><p>To understand in detail the genetic composition and molecular evolution of the TW08-I viruses isolated in 2011&#x02013;2012, whole-genome sequence analyses of the Yam88 lineage viruses that previously circulated in Taiwan were performed. Eight representative viruses isolated during 2007&#x02013;2012 were selected among the genotypes of TW08-I, TW08-II and TW08-III. In addition, the available complete genomic sequences of viruses that circulated in Taiwan and other countries from 1994 to 2007, together with B/Victoria/02/1987, B/Yamagata/16/1988 and the vaccine strains B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Wisconsin/01/2010 were downloaded from the NCBI database and included in the following phylogenetic analyses. Based on the phylogenetic relationships of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;H</xref>), all the eight genome segments of TW08-I and TW08-III viruses belonged to a large earlier TW04-II clade, which was one of the two major evolutionary genotypes of Yam88-lineage viruses in the 2004&#x02013;2005 influenza season, Taiwan, in their respective phylogenetic trees. Regarding the TW08-II virus, six of the eight segments (PB2, HA, NP, NA, MP and NS) belonged to TW04-II genotype in the respective tree, except for PB1 and PA. The PB1 of TW08-II viruses was more closely related to those of the B/Yamanashi/166/1998-like (YA98), B/Canada/16188/2000-like (CA00) and B/Taiwan/45/2001-like (TW01) viruses, which are older viruses from the Yam88 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The PA segments of TW08-II clustered together with those of B/Victoria/504/2000-like viruses and were also located close to that of the YA98 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). These results indicated that these three genotypes, TW08-I, II and III, that co-circulated in Taiwan during 2007&#x02013;2012 were all derived from TW04-II, and reassortment events were involved in the generation of TW08-II viruses. We also extensively tracked the evolutionary histories of the TW04-I and TW04-II viruses in 2004&#x02013;2005. The PB2, PA, NP and NS segments of TW04-II viruses could be traced back to those of the CA00-like viruses, and the other four segments, PB1, HA, NA and MP, were closely related to B/Beijing/76/1998-like (BE98) viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;H</xref>). For the TW04-I viruses, seven gene segments (all except HA) could be traced back to TW01-like viruses; the HA segment was more closely related to that of the BE98 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3A&#x02013;H</xref>). In addition, the phylogenic patterns of the PB2, NP and NS segments were congruent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3A, E, H</xref>), as were those of NA and MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g003">Fig. 3E, F</xref>), indicating that the evolutionary histories of these particular genome segments of Yam88 viruses from 2004 to 2012 in Taiwan have similar patterns.

The TW08-I viruses from 2011&#x02013;2012 exhibited ten major drift mutations relative to the viruses from 2008: T457A in PB1; S530L in PA; T196A in HA; T107I and S296R in NA; N45D, P67S and V82M in NB; S59N in M2; and V87I in NS2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t002">Table 2</xref>). Other amino acid signatures of the TW08-II and TW08-III viruses were also indicated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t002">Table 2</xref>). The results suggest that the large 2011&#x02013;2012 epidemic in Taiwan was caused by Yamagata lineage influenza B viruses that were derived from the TW08-I viruses of 2007&#x02013;2009 and the evolution of the 2011&#x02013;2012 epidemic viruses was developed by drift mutations in several gene segments, with no significant reassortments.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0047179-t002"

The network continually monitors the circulation of influenza viruses and routinely collects clinical specimens from outpatients in communities and from hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness.

The isolated influenza strains were then sent to the Taiwan CDC for further genetic and antigenic characterization by genomic sequencing and hemagglutinin inhibition assays. From July 2004 to March 2011, the sequences of HA genes for most of influenza B strains isolated in Taiwan were determined (3829 of 3855, 99.3%). The viruses for HA sequence analysis from April 2011 to March 2012 were selected randomly, and the number of analyzed viruses each month was limited up to 100. The monthly sampled percentages from April 2011 to March 2012 were 42%&#x02013;12.5% with the overall percentage as 21.6% (557/2575). Viral RNA used for molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis was extracted from the supernatants of cultured isolates using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kits according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA). Automated extraction was also conducted using the MagNA Pure LC extraction system (Roche).

Multiple genotypes were defined based on the analyzed phylogenetic topology of the viral HA genes. Because the full genome sequences of the Taiwanese viruses belonging to the TW01, TW04-I and TW04-II genotypes are available in the NCBI database, these sequences were downloaded as references. For viruses of the TW08-I, TW08-II and TW08-III genotypes, a total of eight representative strains isolated from 2007 to 2012 were chosen for full genome sequencing and were included in subsequent comparisons. Multiple sequence alignments, protein translation and phylogenetic analysis were performed based on the nucleotide sequences using MEGA4 and BioEdit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html">http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html</ext-link>).

Taiwan has experienced influenza B epidemics at a 2- to 5-year interval, and the Vic87 and Yam88 lineages can circulate simultaneously or individually during a particular time period. Human immunity and interactions between different types/subtypes of influenza viruses are considered to shape the trends of fluctuating dominance <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Goldstein1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. When there is a large, long-lasting epidemic of influenza A, influenza B will suffer a major population bottleneck, with greatly reduced activity <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In Taiwan, we also observed similar epidemiologic patterns for influenza B; its activity was highly limited by different subtypes of influenza A viruses. For example, the large pandemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hampered the activity of influenza B viruses, resulting in the long-lasting persistence of influenza B viruses at a low level from 2009 to 2010. The absence of influenza B viruses led to an increase in the size of the susceptible population. Furthermore, the influenza vaccines recommended by WHO that were used in Taiwan during the three influenza seasons of 2009&#x02013;2012 contained a component of only the Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses), making the vaccine less effective against the Yamagata lineage. These factors may explain why the large Yam88-lineage influenza B epidemic occurred in 2011&#x02013;2012. The previous studies have suggested that evolution of influenza B virus was highly influenced by reassortment and insertion-deletion, and less governed by antibody selection <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Air1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In this study, the TW08-1 influenza B viruses circulated in both 2007&#x02013;2009 and 2011&#x02013;2012 were antigenically similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t001">Table 1</xref>) and they kept the same constellation of 8 genome segments without detectable reassortment over the five years, indicating that antigenic drifts and genetic reassortment did not involve in emergence of this influenza B epidemic strain. Therefore, the evolution of influenza B viruses was dynamically driven by multiple factors. In this study, both the interactions between influenza A and influenza B viruses of different lineages or genotypes and the size of the susceptible population were shown to determine the time and intensity of influenza B epidemics and shape their dynamic patterns.</p><p>In this study, we provided a detailed flux pattern to track the rise and decline of multiple genotypes of influenza B viruses, and also demonstrated the evolutionary processes that a newly emerging or persistent virus became predominant and caused an epidemic. The virus should acquire genetic changes and overtake the existing predominant virus. In a previous study <xref rid="pone.0047179-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a new genetic reassortant influenza B virus with the HA of the Vic87 lineage and the NA of the Yam88 lineage was shown to have been isolated since 2002 in Taiwan, and this strain co-circulated with two other Yam88-like and Vic-87-like viruses during the same period. However, the reassortant became one of the two major types in the 2004&#x02013;2005 influenza season and accounted for 73% of isolates from January to April 2005 in Taiwan <xref rid="pone.0047179-Tsai1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In our study, using HA sequences, we could track the epidemiologic changes in the TW08-I virus from 2007 to 2012. The TW08-I virus, which was derived from the TW04-II virus of 2004&#x02013;2005, co-circulated with the other two genotypes, TW08-II and TW08-III, during 2008&#x02013;2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">2</xref>). Interestingly, the TW08-I virus fluctuated during the years following; the TW08-I virus was dominant (54%) among the co-circulating genotypes in 2008 but was replaced by TW08-II in 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). However, the TW08-I virus re-emerged and successively overtook the TW08-II virus and the other Vic87-like viruses in March and July 2011, respectively. The TW08-I subsequently caused the large epidemic in Taiwan. When comparing the complete genome sequences of TW08-I viruses isolated in 2011&#x02013;2012 and 2007&#x02013;2009, there were 1&#x02013;2 drift-associated amino acid substitutions in each of the PB1, PA, HA, NA, NB, M2 and NS2 segments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t002">Table 2</xref>). No significant reassortment was detected among the analyzed TW08-I isolates. The T196A substitution of HA proteins is the only difference between the TW08-I viruses of 2007&#x02013;2009 and 2011&#x02013;2012 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t002">Table 2</xref>). The T196A substitution was not proposed to locate at antigenic site. This is consistent with the data of HI tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t001">Table 1</xref>) that the TW08-I viruses in 2011&#x02013;2012 were antigenically similar to those in 2007&#x02013;2009. The substitutions, K63R, A123P, S165I, N180Y and G244D, and K63R, A123P, G244S and G493E were detected respectively in the other two genotypes, TW08-II and TW08-III, comparied with those of TW08-I viruses. Among these substitutions, S165I and N180Y in TW08-II were reported to locate at antigenic sites <xref rid="pone.0047179-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The data is consistent with the data of HI test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0047179-t001">Table 1</xref>) that the antisera raised against TW08-I viruses reacted less with TW08-II viruses, suggesting that some isolates in TW08-II seemed to diversify antigenically. Based on the data of antigenic similarity between the TW08-I viruses isolated in 2007&#x02013;2009 and 2011&#x02013;2012, it is proposed that the large epidemic in 2011&#x02013;2012 in Taiwan was caused by TW08-I viruses that had circulated persistently in antigenic stasis for 5 years.</p><p>The phylogenetic patterns of influenza B viruses usually have longer side branches, which are likely to develop into various lineages or genotypes, than the phylogenetic patterns of influenza A (H3N2) viruses <xref rid="pone.0047179-Ferguson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Influenza B viruses diverged into two major lineages, Vic87 and Yam88, in the 1970s, and the Yam88 lineage continued to develop into multiple sub-lineages <xref rid="pone.0047179-Rota1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Lindstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The divergent evolution of influenza B viruses, which resulted in the co-circulation of multiple descendants, provides the opportunity for viruses to exchange gene segments between different lineages and genotypes, thus increasing the genetic diversity of the viruses. The frequent and complex reassortment events of influenza B viruses have been reported based on the incongruent phylogenetic patterns of the viral gene segments <xref rid="pone.0047179-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Of note, the evolutionary processes of some viral gene segments were not linear&#x02013;these segments would disappear from the population, and a novel segment would then appear and emerge. For example, the PA, NP, NA, M and NS segments of Vic87 lineage were detected only before 1996, 1995, 2002, 1996 and 2000, respectively, whereas the novel NS segment, which originated in 1984, entered the population after 1997 <xref rid="pone.0047179-McCullers1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Lindstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In this study, we also found that the TW08-II virus had acquired PB1 and PA segments from ancient YA98-like strains and these two segments did not have an evolutionary linkage with current isolates, indicating that some minor and persistently circulating lineages/genotypes of influenza B viruses existed and that they maintained and increased the diversity of the gene pools available for future epidemic strains. These characteristics of influenza B highlight the importance of enhanced surveillance and large-scale sequence analyses of these viruses.</p><p>In Taiwan, 3 of the 8 winter influenza epidemics from 2004&#x02013;2005 to 2011&#x02013;2012 were caused by influenza B viruses, indicating that influenza B accounts for a significant proportion of influenza burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0047179-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Among the 3 influenza B epidemics, viruses in the seasons of 2004&#x02013;2005 and 2011&#x02013;2012 were different lineage from that contained in the vaccine. Furthermore, it was reported that the vaccine efficacy for influenza B was highly reduced when the circulating epidemic lineage was not matched with vaccine lineage <xref rid="pone.0047179-Belshe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0047179-Beran1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Based on the burden of influenza B, vaccine-mismatch strains and the limited cross-protection between the two influenza B lineages, the developed quadrivalent influenza vaccine that includes H1N1, H3N2 and two lineages of influenza B viruses could be expected to increase the effectiveness of vaccine and reduce influenza-related morbidities and mortalities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0047179.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
