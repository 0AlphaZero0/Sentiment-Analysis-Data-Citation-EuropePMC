</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Many traditional concepts of protein science were originally developed for globular domains and are now challenged by intrinsically disordered domains [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Structure-function relationships in globular domains are often pictured in terms of a single average structure that harbors one or several catalytic or binding sites on its surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, disordered domains present multiple conformational states and protein function is instead traced to short sequences called “linear motifs” [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Linear motifs are usually assumed to depend on the presence of less than five function-determining residues and are considered as independent functional units [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As opposed to globular domains, there is no general consensus for the representation of structure- function relationships in disordered domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Evolutionary structural biology commonly describes globular domains in terms of a continuous sequence alignment with a low percentage of gaps [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Conserved and coevolving residues within the core of a globular domain are assigned a structural role [4], while those on the surface are suggested to convey affinity and specificity for other molecules [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Currently, the relationship between conservation, co-evolution and function in disordered domains, also called “evolutionary unstructural biology” [5], is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For disordered regions, alignments are often unreliable [6] and contain a high percentage of gaps [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Also, disordered domains are considered to present a lower degree of sequence conservation and co-evolution than globular domains [7], [8], [9] and have different amino acid substitution patterns [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Moreover, globular domains can also present linear motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The static protein paradigm is at odds with the presence of functional linear motifs because such motifs are believed to exert their function only within a context of structural disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the well-known dynamic nature of proteins should also be considered for evolutionary models of globular domains containing linear motifs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The papillomavirus E7 protein is an interesting model system to compare sequence and function evolution in disordered and globular domains [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>E7 contains a disordered N-terminal domain (E7N) formed by the conserved regions CR1 and CR2 and a globular homodimeric C-terminal domain (E7C) [14], [15], [16], [17] (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The disordered E7N domain contains multiple functional linear motifs that mediate ubiquitination [18], phosphorylation by the DYRK1A [19] and caseine II [20] kinases, binding to the AB domain of the retinoblastoma protein at the E2F [21] and Lx[CS]xE sites [21], [22] and binding to the papillomavirus E2 master regulator [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The Lx[CS]xE motif and the CKII- Acidic region cooperate in Rb binding, showing that some of these linear motifs are functionally coupled [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The globular E7C domain also presents two linear motifs, namely a nuclear export signal [24] and a PDZ binding motif [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These linear motifs can account, at least in part, for the high number of binding partners reported for E7 and for the multiple binding interfaces between E7 and some of its targets (Figure 1) [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Some of the E7 targets, such as the retinoblastoma protein, also interact with multiple host proteins, leading to formation of a complex and poorly understood virus-host protein interaction network. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>E7C is often regarded as a homodimerization and zinc-binding module [16], [17], but the dimer is not the only active conformation of E7C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For example, the transforming ability of E7 is unaffected by several mutations that impair dimer formation [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>E7C monomers [14], [27] modulate binding to the AB domain of the retinoblastoma protein [21], [22] and may be able to bind zinc, while E7C large structured oligomers [27], [28] present a chaperone activity [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Last, the globular E7C domain can bind to an unstructured peptide from the host protein p21 [17], which suggests that E7C may also be a linear motif binding module. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the E7C fold arose from a host PHD domain [30], which is involved in protein-protein interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The published results deal only with structural homology, and the issue of functional similarity was not explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Here, we have used the papillomavirus E7 protein to study structure-function relationships and sequence evolution of disordered and globular domains. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>224 papillomavirus types had at least one ORF coding for an E7 protein ( File S1), except for Tursiops truncatus papillomavirus types 1, 2 and 3, Delphinus delphis papillomavirus, Sus scrofa papillomavirus type 1, Ursus maritimus papillomavirus type 1 and Phocoena spinipinnis papillomavirus type 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Variant E7 sequences have been reported for many clinically important types, such as HPV16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Since our goal was to assess evolution of the E7 protein across papillomavirus types, we kept a balanced representation by retrieving a single E7 sequence for each type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Seventeen E7 sequences from reptilian [31], avian [32] and some artiodactyl [33] papillomaviruses had an N-terminal domain sequence with no recognizable homology to the other E7N domains. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We examined the previously reported sequence alignments of 207 E7N domains and 219 E7C domains [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The alignment of E7N sequences showed two types of clearly disparate regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>On one hand, several blocks of positions presented less than 30% gaps and were easily aligned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>These regions could be pictured as sequence logos (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, most positions outside these stretches presented more than 30% gaps and could not be aligned with confidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>These variable regions could be represented as a histogram of the observed length of the stretches and the average residue compositions (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined and compared sequence conservation and co-evolution of the E7N and E7C domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We used the information content of a position in the alignment as a measure of conservation [37], including all positions in the alignment with less than 30% gaps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the average conservation for the disordered E7N domain and the globular E7C was very similar (E7N 2.4±1.0 bits, E7C 2.1±1.2 bits) (Figures 2C and 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>An algorithm based on mutual information [4] identified two pairs of coevolving residues within the E7N domain (Figure 2A) and two pairs of coevolving residues within the E7C domain (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that a lack of globular structure did not necessarily lead to a lower degree of sequence conservation and co-evolution in the E7 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Co-evolution of one E7N residue with a residue on the surface of the E7C domain (Figure 2A and 3A) suggested that some relevant activity of the protein may involve physical contact between the domains and that evolution of the two domains in E7 had not been entirely independent. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>For the E7 oncoprotein we found that these signals provided useful tools for mapping functional coupling of linear motifs within its disordered domain, further indicating that E7N is a proper domain and not a mere juxtaposition of independent linear motifs [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the confidently aligned positions of the E7N domain are on average as conserved as the globular E7C domain and the number of coevolving residue pairs is the same (Figures 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This is unusual for a disordered domain [7], [8], [9] and may stem from the high functional density in E7N, characteristic of many viral proteins [54]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Several E7N regions evolve in a coordinate manner (Figure 2), as shown by the coevolving residue pairs, the restricted linker lengths and motif co-occurrence [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, consecutive E7N functional motifs are close in space to each other as indicated by the short linker lengths, while the co-evolution signals may indicate functional coupling or at least transient physical contact between the Lx[CS]xE motif and the CKII-Acidic region [4]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>For example, chaperone activity depends on the formation of large oligomers [29]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the E7C domain has other activities in addition to being a dimerization sequence. </plain></SENT>
