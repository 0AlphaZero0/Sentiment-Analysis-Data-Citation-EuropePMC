</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescent localization revealed that NTPDase2-positive cells lie closely adjacent to smooth muscle but are separate from them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NTPDase2 positive cells exhibited co-localization with the widely accepted ICC marker - c-kit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>They were further shown to co-localize with other ICC markers CD34 and Ano1, but not with mast cell marker tryptase. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The identity of these cells as ICC was further confirmed by the presence of three mesenchymal markers – vimentin, desmin, and PDGFβ receptor, which indicates their mesenchymal origin. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the gastrointestinal tract, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) function as pacemakers, neurotransmitter transducers, and mechanosensors that respond to physical and chemical signals, and thereby modulate smooth muscle contractility [1], [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Alterations in ICC function have been linked to more than a dozen gastrointestinal diseases [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, novel ICCs have also been identified in the urinary bladder in several species, including guinea pigs, rats, and humans [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Unlike ICC in gut, the function of ICC in bladder is poorly understood, but emerging data indicates that they too, are implicated in several bladder diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These disorders offer the chance to gain insights into ICC functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In megacystis-microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS), a congenital lethal disease in newborns, patients are unable to void spontaneously and have a massively dilated bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the lack of ICC in the MMIHS bladder is responsible for this lethal voiding dysfunction [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Proto-oncogene c-Kit (C-kit, tyrosine-protein kinase Kit, or CD117) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed on the surface of hematopoietic as well as other cell types such as mast cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Signaling through c-kit plays a role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, and gain of function mutations in this protein are associated with multiple tumors [13], [14], [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the digestive tract, c-kit is used as the “gold standard” for identification of ICC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>C-kit has also been identified in urinary bladder in guinea pig, rat and human, and further functional characterization has suggested these c-kit-positive cells are like the ICC in gastrointestinal tract [11], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the mouse urinary tract, there has been some confusion about the presence of c-kit in bladder ICC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Pezzone and co-authors reported c-kit positive cells in ureter, but not in bladder [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, McCloskey et al. identified c-kit positive cells in both wild-type and W/Wv (c-kit mutant) mice [23], while other investigators have failed to find c-kit in mouse bladder at all [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>ICC are stellate-like cells with long dendrites or spikes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>They have close contacts with nerve varicosities and smooth muscle cells and form gap junctions with each other, which provide a route for the diffusion of low molecular weight materials as an important intercellular signal communication pathway between these types of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Thus gap junctions have a crucial role in mediating the synchronized contraction of smooth muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Nemeth et al. reported that gap junction protein connexin 43 is present in ICC with convincing co-localization of c-kit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>ICC could be seen to form a three-dimensional network in the normal colonic bowel wall and lack of connexin43 expression in the aganglionic bowel of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) may be partly responsible for the smooth muscle motility dysfunction in HD patients [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>It has remained unclear as to whether ICC in the urinary bladder also express connexin 43, or where connexin 43 is located. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>While dozens of studies indicate that connexin 43 plays a crucial role in modulating bladder overactivity, its precise localization is still the subject of debate and attributed mostly to bladder smooth muscle cells and/or myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to define more clearly the molecular signature of ICC and in doing so resolve some of these uncertainties [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We recently identified a population of cells in mouse bladder that express ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2), an ectonucleotidase that degrades ATP/UTP to ADP/UDP and further to AMP/UMP [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>These NTPDase2-positive cells are a unique subset of cells in bladder that exhibit narrow elongated and branched cell processes and clearly wrap around smooth muscle cell bundles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>They are also expressed in a sub-region of the lamina propria that is immediately adjacent to the bladder smooth muscle layer and seems to be a natural extension from between the smooth muscle spaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly our data indicated they were distinct from smooth muscle, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and neurons, indicating they might be ICC [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In this study we have used confocal immunofluorescent microscopy of multiple cellular markers to define the identity of these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that they are ICC by the usual accepted definitions and that ICC in mouse bladder can be clearly defined by the presence of c-Kit, NTPDase2, CD34, Ano1, connexin 43, vimentin, desmin, PDGF receptor and merlin/NF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These data establish a molecular expression profile for ICC in mouse bladder, which can be used to assist in explorations of their functional roles in future. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>ICC were originally discovered as a morphologically distinct cell in gastrointestinal tract [51], [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>They now have a widely accepted role as a ‘pacemaker’ cell responsible for generating slow waves involved in peristalsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>ICC or ICC-like cells are now being described in many other muscular organs [7], [41], [53], [54], [55], but their functions in these systems are much less clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The urinary bladder has been reported to possess ICC in several species, but there is some question as to whether they are universally expressed in mammals or have similar functions to their counterparts in the GI tract [22], [23], [24], [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have clearly demonstrated the presence of ICC marker c-kit, in NTPDase2-positive cells of mouse bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>NTPDase2 is not expressed by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, neurons or smooth muscle [33], therefore colocalization with c-Kit identifies it as another specific marker for ICC in bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The localization of NTPDase2 expression in ICC cells raises an interesting question as to whether purinergic signaling plays a role in the regulation of their function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Multiple purinergic receptors have been reported in ICC, including P2X2/5, P2Y4 and P2Y1 [57], [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>In a c-kit mutant mouse (W/Wv), purinergic contraction of bladder smooth muscle has been significantly up-regulated, indicating an intriguing relationship between c-kit signaling pathway and purinergic signaling pathways [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The presence of purinergic receptors in ICC and the clear functional importance of purines in bladder pathophysiology, suggests that NTPDase2/purinergic signaling might be important in regulating ICC pacemaker activity or mechanosensory function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Mechanical stretch of cells causes release of ATP [60], and mechanical stretch of ICC regulates pacemaker activity and smooth muscle contraction in both stomach and bladder [1], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of connexin 43 in ICC provides an ideal pathway for ATP and other purines to communicate through connexin hemichannels or intercellular gap junctions [61], [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that NTPDase 2 might play an important regulatory role in ICC purinergic signaling, possibly by temporally and spatially limiting P2-receptor exposure to nucleotides and nucleosides. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>There has been some controversy as to the existence of c-kit positive cells in mouse bladder and our own experience has been that many commercially available c-kit antibodies fail to immunostain frozen sections [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This is possibly due to variants or isoforms of c-Kit expressed in different tissues and/or substantial species heterogeneity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05532">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05532</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported to be a highly sensitive and specific marker for GIST, with 100% sensitivity compared with 95% for kit signaling [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we show clear evidence for expression of gap junction protein connexin 43, three mesenchymal related markers in vimentin, desmin and PDGF-R and finally a novel neural marker that has been reported in GIST ICC cells, merlin/NF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Combining our findings in this study with our previously published data on NTPDase2 positive cells in mouse bladder [33], we summarize the cellular protein expression profile in table 1 and compared these markers with other cell types in the urinary bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The picture which emerges strongly indicates that the NTPDase2-positive cells are mouse bladder ICC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>This expanded molecular profile may be useful for identifying ICC in mice given the technical difficulties associated with c-kit detection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Connexin 43 appears to be an important participant in disease states like bladder carcinoma and bladder overactivity, but it is almost universally considered to be located on bladder smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>As but one example, connexin 43 was recently shown to be important in regulating diurnal changes in bladder capacity and micturition [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>While the major findings are not in question and indeed are of great significance, the authors attributed this function to connexin 43 in bladder smooth muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The connexin 43 labeling showed a sparse staining pattern that is likely located at the edge of muscle bundle, exactly the location of ICC [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Since the presence of ICC in mouse bladder has been difficult to define by c-kit staining, it is understandable that immunostaining deep within the detrusor is usually considered to be smooth muscle cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>However, we have previously shown that these cells are distinct from smooth muscle cells with multiple markers, including α-SMA, Entpd1, Nt5e, NTPDase2 (table 1) [33], and now several more in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>In other published studies, connexin 43 found in the lamina propria, are attributed as myofibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In our experience, myofibroblasts are enriched immediately beneath the urothelial layer instead of next to smooth muscle layer and this was demonstrated by labeling myofibroblasts with α-SMA while the connexin 43 positive cells do not stain α-SMA [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The finding of connexin 43 in ICC indicates that its function in bladder is likely due to the activity of ICC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>A somewhat surprising finding was that merlin/NF2, most often considered a neuronal marker, was expressed in bladder ICC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="?"><plain>Does this indicate that bladder ICC have nerve cell like function? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Considering the pacemaker and neurotransducer functions of gastrointestinal ICC, it may be true. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The role of ICC in bladder is not well defined but by analogy with GI tract may be responsible for tonic regulation of smooth muscle contractility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Since dysregulation of ICC in GI tract leads to serious pathology ranging from GIST to motility disorders, there is a strong likelihood of ICC involvement in certain syndromes of voiding dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Indeed as noted, alterations to connexin 43 expression have been linked to cancer and overactive bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Better ways to define the morphological signature of ICC will hopefully assist investigations into their function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In summary, we defined a unique set of molecular markers of NTPDase2 positive cells in mouse urinary bladder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>These findings are in line with other reports in gastrointestinal ICC or previous observations in bladder ICC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>We believe that, as in other species, these NTPDase2 positive cells are mouse ICC, and we hope that our findings will help other investigators to avoid misidentifying this unique cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>A clear definition of molecular expression in bladder ICC will also facilitate directed investigations in mouse knockouts to understand the role of ICC in spontaneous contraction and mechanosensation. </plain></SENT>
