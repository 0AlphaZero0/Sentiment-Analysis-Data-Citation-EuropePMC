<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Depression symptoms are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (5,6), and antidepressant medication use may also be associated with the development of diabetes in high-risk individuals (7–9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both depression symptoms and antidepressant medications have been associated with overweight/obesity in individuals with or at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (7,10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Depression is known to impair adherence to treatment recommendations in several chronic illnesses, including diabetes (11,12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility that problems with motivation and concentration, two cardinal symptoms of depression, could interfere with adherence to weight-loss efforts such as those shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (13) and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An analysis of a subset of DPP participants showed that higher baseline levels of depression symptoms were associated with lower levels of baseline physical activity (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Another analysis from the original DPP cohort suggested that baseline depression symptoms did not adversely impact the chances of successful initial weight loss among participants randomized to the intensive lifestyle arm (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether depression symptoms at baseline affected weight in the metformin or placebo arms of the DPP clinical trial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Weight regain is common after successful weight loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no studies have examined mood or antidepressant use as predictors of weight regain in individuals with prediabetes or diabetes who were previously successful in losing weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this study, we explored the association between weight gain and depression symptoms or antidepressant use in participants who successfully lost at least 3% of their baseline body weight after 1 year of the DPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We examined the associations between depression symptoms or antidepressant use and weight regain 6 months subsequently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We also examined the associations between cumulative depression symptoms or antidepressant use over the course of the DPPOS and weight regain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Our hypotheses were that depression symptoms would predict weight regain and that antidepressant use would predict weight regain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These associations would suggest the importance of regular monitoring for depression in successful weight loss participants in order to intervene early to decrease the risk of weight regain and for close follow-up for weight regain in individuals taking antidepressants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="s1"><title><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The DPP was a randomized controlled clinical trial designed to compare the effects of lifestyle modification (achievement of ≥150 min of exercise per week and 7% weight loss) or metformin on delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in overweight or obese adults who had impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose (17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Participants with major psychiatric disorders and those taking greater than moderate doses of antidepressants were excluded (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The first phase of the DPP study concluded after a mean 2.8 years of follow-up, with the finding that both lifestyle and metformin treatment resulted in significantly reduced risk of progression to type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The study then continued in 2001 as the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), designed to assess the effects of lifestyle or metformin on preventing long term macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In the DPPOS, participants continued in their assigned DPP treatment group: metformin, intensive lifestyle modification, or placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>While weight loss per se was not a goal for participants in the metformin or placebo groups, all three treatment groups received exercise and weight loss advice in DPPOS and were eligible to attend quarterly lifestyle education sessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle intervention participants were also offered additional semiannual weight loss–specific campaigns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>While the mechanism of weight loss in the metformin group may differ than other groups, all three treatment groups were included in this analysis because the objective was to see what the presence of depression symptoms did to the risk of weight regain among those who successfully lost weight regardless of the intervention or mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Data were collected longitudinally throughout the DPP/DPPOS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Participants’ weight was collected every 6 months during both DPP and DPPOS through October 2008. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>As the weight regain event happened throughout the course of the study, the weight regain outcome was defined as a time-to-event variable at the subject level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Concurrent medication data were collected every 6 months in DPP/DPPOS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Nutrition data were collected at DPP baseline and year 1 and DPPOS years 1, 2, and year 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Psychological and behavioral questionnaires were administrated annually in both DPP and DPPOS (17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Analyses in this paper are limited to successful weight losers, defined as participants randomized to the lifestyle, metformin, or placebo arms who achieved at least the median or greater weight loss (3% of baseline body weight) at the 12-month visit after randomization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome of this analysis was weight regain (i.e., failure to maintain weight loss), defined as time to the first measured occurrence of a regain to the DPP baseline weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We took a participant-centric perspective in selecting return to baseline weight, rather than a set kilogram definition, of weight regain, as we believe the former approach more closely mirrors concerns regarding how those who attempt weight loss and clinicians gauge the success of their efforts in real-world settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Data collection in this analysis, spanning the DPP and DPPOS, continued for a mean of 10 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Participant data were censored at the point of weight regain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between the key predictors (depression symptoms and antidepressant use) and the main outcome of weight regain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that both variables would predict weight regain. “Depression symptoms” was defined categorically as a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score ≥11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The BDI is a 21-item questionnaire, widely used clinically and in research, that has been shown to reliably detect mild, moderate, and severe levels of depression; the cut point of ≥11 indicates at least mild depression symptoms (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Presence or absence of antidepressant use (selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and dopamine agonists) was derived from concurrent medication data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Because depression symptoms and antidepressant use were measured repeatedly throughout the study, we used time-dependent covariate analyses to model the relationship between depression and weight regain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Predictors in the models included depression symptoms 6 months prior to assessment of weight regain, percent of time having depression symptoms at previous DPP/DPPOS visits, taking an antidepressant 6 months earlier, and percent of time taking an antidepressant at previous DPP/DPPOS visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>For variables measured only at annual visits, such as depression scores, missing values at the semiannual visits were imputed using the previous annual visit data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Other nonstructural missing values were very sporadic and imputed using the last-value-carried-forward approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Again using time-to-event analyses, we then sequentially assessed for the effect of several covariates potentially related to weight gain, including 1) baseline treatment group (lifestyle, metformin, and placebo); 2) age, sex, and ethnicity; 3) marital status, income level, and education level; 4) BMI at randomization and percent weight loss at the 12-month DPP visit; 5) baseline activity and nutrient intake at DPP entry and at entry into the analysis and time-dependent leisure activity; 6) medical comorbidity (assessed by number of chronic medications at the visit before weight regain), total number of serious adverse events before weight regain, incident diagnosis of diabetes, and initiation of diabetes medications other than metformin during follow-up; 7) diabetes status plus antiglycemic medication use; 8) average leisure activity throughout the study period; and 9) DPP baseline participant self-rating of general health using the General and Physical Functioning questions of the SF-36 and mild or greater levels of anxiety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>(Serious adverse medical events include conditions resulting in hospitalization for &gt;24 hours, prolongation of a current hospitalization, permanent or severe disability, death, or congenital abnormality in pregnancy; are life threatening; or are involved in an accidental or intentional medication overdose.) Anxiety was assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a 21-item self-administered questionnaire shown to reliably detect mild levels of anxiety at a score ≥8 (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Participants were not asked the indication (depression vs. anxiety) for antidepressant use at DPPOS visits; however, only 16% of participants had mild or greater levels of anxiety, and depression and anxiety symptoms are often comorbid (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To examine the possibility that the association between depression symptoms or antidepressant use and weight regain varied by the degree of initial weight loss, we examined the interaction between percentage of initial weight loss (3–7%, or approximately 7–15 pounds, versus ≥ 7%) and the depression variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The SAS system was used for all analyses (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for multiple factors potentially related to weight gain, antidepressant use, but not depression symptoms, remained associated with a risk of weight regain in these participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The risk of weight regain was 72% higher for participants using antidepressants at the visit 6 months prior compared with non–antidepressant users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>This association remained when the analysis was restricted to SSRI antidepressant users. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>SSRIs were the most frequently used (78%) antidepressants among DPP participants (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Even though SSRIs are traditionally thought to be associated with less weight gain than are many older antidepressants, recent examinations (26) have suggested the tendency for some SSRI users to gain weight over time—a finding consistent with other DPP analyses (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that the weight regain seen in our participants is due to antidepressant side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The small number of participants using non-SSRI antidepressants precluded a comparison of risk of weight regain by antidepressant class. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>There are several possible explanations for the failure of depression symptoms in predicting weight gain in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>While weight gain is a feature of some forms of depression, it is not as prevalent as weight loss (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Other investigators have found that the prevalence of obesity is related to depression severity (1,2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Individuals with more severe depression were excluded from DPP—only 2.7% had moderate or greater levels of depression at the time of initial enrollment (18)—and most of the participants with BDI score ≥11 during the period of observation had only mild symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that more severe, but not milder, depression symptoms would be related to weight regain, but we did not have enough power to detect this association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>This would not discount the association between antidepressant medication use and weight regain, however. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Depression symptoms were assessed annually during our period of observation, while antidepressant medication use was assessed every 6 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that, similar to the initial DPP cohort, depression symptoms in our participants were of short duration and may have resolved by the time of follow-up assessment (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The frequent attention DPP participants received throughout the study may have helped lead to symptom resolution in some participants with milder depression symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that antidepressants were effective in treating the mild depression symptoms in our population, leading to symptom resolution while antidepressant use continued. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>While the DPP and DPPOS were not designed to ascertain this, a recent analysis (26) noting marginal differences between antidepressants and placebo for participants with mild depression symptoms lessens this possibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>We therefore cannot differentiate between spontaneous, antidepressant-aided, and psychosocial support–assisted resolution of depression symptoms in our cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>All of these possibilities would lead to a failure to detect an association between depression symptoms as a predictor of weight regain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Our analysis was also limited by the small number of participants (7.4%) reporting both depression symptoms and antidepressant use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The lower-than-expected prevalence of depression in our sample may be the result of DPP study selection criteria (individuals taking higher than the normal starting antidepressant dose were excluded) and recruitment bias (depressed individuals may have been less likely to volunteer for a long intensive study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of participants in our cohort had mild depression symptoms that did not likely meet the threshold for major depressive disorder, which may explain why many participants with depression symptoms did not report taking antidepressants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>We therefore could not test for differences between participants with both depression symptoms and antidepressant use compared with participants with only depression symptoms or only antidepressant use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mild nature of depression symptoms in our cohort may limit the generalizability of our findings to other populations of individuals at risk for diabetes with more severe depression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In our study of successful initial weight losers, after adjustment for multiple relevant covariates, antidepressant use at the previous (6 month) DPPOS visit was predictive of weight regain on follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This suggests that overweight individuals with impaired glucose intolerance who successfully lose weight and who are recent antidepressant medication users may be at higher risk for regaining weight than non–antidepressant users with impaired glucose tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Maintaining initially successful weight loss strategies over time can be difficult (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>These at-risk individuals may benefit from ongoing support via regularly structured coaching and reinforcement to help them maintain their successful weight loss strategies and refine them for new or unexpected challenges to maintaining behavior change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Early detection of weight regain could lead to intensification of weight loss strategies or the addition of new strategies to minimize regained weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Future studies could design and elucidate practical, effective strategies for real-world settings to help these at-risk individuals maintain successful weight loss. </plain></SENT>
