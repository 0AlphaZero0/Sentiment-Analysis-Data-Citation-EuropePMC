However, no study has simultaneously and systematically compared the characteristics of SSB proteins. In addition, SSB proteins may bind RNA and play an unknown biological role in RNA metabolism. Here, we expressed a novel species of SSB protein derived from <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> KOD1 (KOD), as well as SSB proteins from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (TTH), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and <italic>Sulfolobus Solfataricus</italic> P2 (SSOB), abbreviated kod, tth, bl21, and ssob, respectively. These SSB proteins could bind ssDNA and viral RNA. bl21 resisted heat treatment for more than 9 h, Ssob and kod could withstand 95&#x000b0;C for 10 h and retain its ssDNA- and RNA-binding ability. Four SSB proteins promoted the specificity of the DNA polymerase in PCR-based 5- and 9-kb genome fragment amplification. kod also increased the amplification of a 13-kb PCR product, and SSB protein&#x02013;bound RNA resisted Benzonase digestion. The SSB proteins could also enter the host cell bound to RNA, which resulted in modulation of viral RNA metabolism, particularly ssob and bl21.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (Y2101159).

These processes are rigorously and orderly integrated at the molecular level <xref rid="pone.0055076-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. SSB proteins play a key role in the integration of metabolic pathways by helping target relevant enzymes to the sites of on-going genome maintenance programs and ensuring that the enzymes complete their biological function effectively and accurately <xref rid="pone.0055076-Kur1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055076-Richard1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. SSB proteins are typically tetrameric or dimeric, and each polypeptide is composed of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which presents a narrow ssDNA-binding cleft studded with residues that make numerous interactions with a small number of nucleotides in a relatively compact substructure <xref rid="pone.0055076-Lohman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. They also contain a glycine and proline-rich region, as well as a flexible C-terminal tail essential for protein interactions <xref rid="pone.0055076-Lohman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>SSB proteins are present in all three branches of organisms and in viruses <xref rid="pone.0055076-Kur1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Recently, several studies on the biological function and application of SSB proteins have been performed. SSB proteins protect the vulnerable single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from nucleolytic digestion and prevent hairpin formation, thus keeping ssDNA in a suitable conformation for the action of enzymes involved in processes such as DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription <xref rid="pone.0055076-Fedorov1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, SSB proteins are involved in physical interactions with several proteins that play important roles in those pathways, and thus are critical for essential life activities <xref rid="pone.0055076-Shereda1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. SSB proteins are known to increase the efficiency and fidelity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) <xref rid="pone.0055076-Perales1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and also to prevent the formation of primer dimers <xref rid="pone.0055076-Olszewski1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The SSB protein of TTH also interacts efficiently with RNA, resulting in a dramatic increase in the size of the cDNA synthesised by the reverse transcriptase activity of TTH DNA polymerase <xref rid="pone.0055076-Perales1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The SSB protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has the following functions; targeting restriction endonuclease digestion to any restriction enzyme site in cloned ssDNA via DNA oligo splints <xref rid="pone.0055076-Milavetz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, improving the DNA sequencing results through regions with strong secondary structure <xref rid="pone.0055076-Kowalczykowski1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and enhancing RNA transcription <xref rid="pone.0055076-Richard2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The unique ability of SSB proteins to bind ssDNA but not double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) allows for the efficient separation of the three types of DNA molecules in the PCR reaction mixture, which makes it an indispensable tool in the development of nucleotide aptamers <xref rid="pone.0055076-Kur1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The affinity of SSB towards ssDNA has been successfully utilised to detect hybridisation on gold surfaces by surface plasmon-resonance imaging <xref rid="pone.0055076-Brockman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Although numerous applications of SSB proteins have been reported, a systematic functional comparative analysis of SSB proteins derived from different species has not yet been performed. Thus, it remains possible that SSB proteins bind single-stranded RNA. The SSB proteins may also have novel applications based on other biological characteristics. Also, differences between the SSB proteins derived from thermophilic bacteria and <italic>E. coli</italic> remain unknown. In this study, we compared the biological functions of SSB proteins derived from the thermophilic bacteria TTH, SSOB, and KOD, as well as <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3).

To express these four SSB proteins, the coding sequences of tth, ssob and kod were synthesised by Biovisualab Ltd (Biovisualab, Shanghai, China) with a His-tag at their N-termini, and were inserted into the pET11a expression vector (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ). The open reading frame encoding bl21 was cloned by PCR using <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) chromosomal DNA as template with primers (forward, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TATACATATGGCTCACCACCACCACCACCACGCCAGCAG AGGCGTAAACAAG-3&#x02032;</named-content>, reverse, <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-TGGTGGTGCTCGAGTCATC AGAACGGAATGTCATCATC-3&#x02032;</named-content>). A high-fidelity DNA polymerase (HiFiFast) (Biovisualab, Shanghai, China) was used. The PCR product with a His-tag was inserted into a pET21a expression vector (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) after digestion with <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). After sequence confirmation, the correct plasmids were used for SSB protein expression. Based on the supporting rare codon, tth was expressed in BL21 (DE3) competent cells and the remaining kod, ssob, and bl21 were expressed in Transetta (DE3) chemically competent cells (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China).</p><p>Cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in LB medium containing ampicillin (80 mg/L) or chloramphenicol (34 mg/L) to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were harvested after 4 h induction by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 30 min in a Hitachi centrifuge (Hitachi, Japan), and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mL of buffer (20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM PMSF and 0.02% Triton-X100), and then disrupted by sonication. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min in a Hitachi centrifuge (Hitachi, Japan). The supernatant was heat-treated at 70&#x000b0;C for 30 min and denatured mesophilic proteins were discarded by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min in a Hitachi centrifuge (Hitachi, Japan). The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a Ni<sup>2+</sup> Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI), and bound proteins were washed and eluted with 5&#x02013;120 mM imidazole. The eluted fractions containing protein were detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Target proteins were collected and dialysed against 40 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. The concentration of purified protein was determined using a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with the absorption coefficient at 280 nm. A series of quantitative albumin was used as a reference. After filtration through a 0.45-mm Durapore polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane filter (Millipore Ireland, Cork, Ireland), 50% (v/v) glycerol was added to each of the SSB proteins and then stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for further use.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>SDS-PAGE and Native-PAGE Analysis</title><p>To confirm the protein molecular weight and purity, 5 &#x000b5;g of each SSB protein was applied to 12.5% running gel containing 0.1% SDS under reducing conditions for SDS-PAGE analysis. To verify the polymerisation form of these SSB proteins, 5 &#x000b5;g of each SSB protein was loaded onto 3.5&#x02013;5&#x02013;12% non-denaturing gradient polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis with a NativeMarker&#x02122; protein marker (Life Technoloies, Carisbad, CA). ssob is a strongly alkaline protein, it&#x02019;s isoelectric point&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.464, with positive charge at PH 8.3 buffer and will move to anode. To visualize the ssob in a native-PAGE, we lowered the pH of the running buffer and gel to 7.4 and reversed the negative and positive pole. All gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Tsingke, Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>ssDNA and Viral RNA Binding Analysis</title><p>To verify the ssDNA binding activity of the four SSB proteins, a 146- or 537-bp PCR product was denatured at 100&#x000b0;C for 10 min and cooled on ice rapidly to obtain ssDNA. ssDNA (250 ng) was incubated with 1&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;g of each of the SSB proteins in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.2 mM EDTA binding buffer at room temperature for 5 min. Then, the protein ssDNA mix was analysed by native-PAGE analysis. To visualise the ssDNA&#x02013;SSB protein complex, we first performed AgNO<sub>3</sub> staining since this method stains both DNA and protein. The gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid for 20 min, rinsed three times with water for 2 min, impregnated with AgNO<sub>3</sub> (1 g/L) and HCOH (1.5 mL/L) for 30 min, rinsed again with water briefly, and visualised using developing solution (30 g/L Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 1.5 mL/L HCOH, and 2 mg/L Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

Although this method can be used to identify DNA and proteins, it cannot efficiently identify the ssDNA&#x02013;protein complex. To complement this method, we stained the gel with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 since the protein ssDNA complex migrated slower than protein alone. The protein binding activity could be analysed using this method, and relative dsDNA was used as a specific control.</p><p>For RNA binding analysis, 120 ng of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was incubated with 1.5 &#x000b5;g each of the four SSB proteins in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.2 mM EDTA binding buffer at room temperature for 5 min. The denatured HCV RNA was obtained by heating the RNA at 65&#x000b0;C for 5 min. RNA&#x02013;SSB protein complexes were applied to a 1.2% TAE agarose gel. After electrophoresis, RNA or RNA protein complexes were stained with ethidium bromide.</p><p>To determine their heat resistance, the SSB proteins were incubated in water at 95&#x000b0;C for 5, 120, 240, or 600 min.

A total of 3.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3 </sup>U of Benzonase could digest 120 ng of HCV RNA at room temperature within 30 min, while 3.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2 </sup>U could completely digest the HCV RNA. To challenge the protection effect, 1.5 &#x000b5;g of each of the SSB proteins were added to bind RNA or denatured RNA.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055076-g008">Figure 8B</xref>, the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells derived from HCV RNA with no SSB proteins or combined with BSA were 23234&#x000b1;3345 and 20425&#x000b1;1423, respectively. While the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells derived from HCV RNA combined with 10 ng of either ssob, bl21, kod or tth were 73434&#x000b1;9890, 83534&#x000b1;8971, 56564&#x000b1;7679, and 43434&#x000b1;9670, respectively. When the SSB protein concentrations were increased to 20 ng, these mean fluorescence intensities increased to 134344&#x000b1;21011, 153434&#x000b1;21098, 101234&#x000b1;12100, and 98000&#x000b1;10910, respectively, while the HCV RNA with no SSB proteins or combined with BSA, the mean fluorescence intensity were 24866&#x000b1;2443 and 23431&#x000b1;1412, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055076-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that SSB proteins could significantly enhance the viral protein expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0055076-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that SSB proteins were transfected into host cells along with the viral RNA, cells transfected with 500 ng HCV RNA and SSB proteins were analysed using the immunocellularchemistry assay 24 h after transfection. SSB proteins could be detected by the primary anti-His antibody followed by a Alexa Fluor 568-labelled secondary antibody in cells transfected with SSB proteins, which suggested that SSB proteins bound viral RNA and co-entered host cells with the transfection complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0055076-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding and stacking between SSB proteins and nucleoside bases, sugars and phosphates of ssDNA was believed to form the basis for ssDNA binding and specificity <xref rid="pone.0055076-Shamoo1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this study, our results showed that all four SSB proteins bind HCV RNA. When the SSB proteins were heated at 95&#x000b0;C for 9 h, ssob, kod and bl21 could still bind HCV RNA, and the SSB protein protected the bound RNA against Benzonase digestion. When these SSB proteins were included in the reverse transcription reaction mix, they increased first-strand cDNA synthesis yield more than five times (data not shown). Furthermore, our study demonstrated that SSB proteins improved the transduction and expression efficiency of <italic>in vitro</italic>&#x02013;transcribed viral RNA. <italic>In vitro</italic>&#x02013;transcribed HCV RNA acted as mRNA for viral protein translation in transfected host cells <xref rid="pone.0055076-Wakita1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055076-Zhong1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our data suggested that the SSB proteins could not only bind the viral RNA and undergo co-entry into the host cell with the transfection complex, but also improve viral RNA function. These enhancements could be due to increased HCV RNA stability, increased translation efficiency, increased HCV RNA replication, and increased protein stability. Together with the enhancement of first strand cDNA synthesis, these effects should not only contribute to the RNA protection role, but may also be related to the biological functions of SSB proteins in RNA metabolism pathways in organisms <xref rid="pone.0055076-Davydova1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055076-Pham1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Notably, the SSB proteins derived from bacteria displayed biological function in mammalian cells. Thus, this study has increased our knowledge of, and may reveal novel applications for, SSB proteins.</p><p>
<italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> KOD1 is a novel thermophilic bacterium <xref rid="pone.0055076-Morikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the DNA polymerase derived from which exhibited high fidelity and long-term heat resistance <xref rid="pone.0055076-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To explore the possible application of its SSB proteins, we first expressed kod, and performed systemic functional studies together with the other three SSB proteins which were reported previously. Our results showed that kod binds ssDNA and viral RNA, and showed excellent heat resistance compared to the other SSB proteins. kod also significantly enhanced PCR specificity and improved RNA expression. Thus, kod may in future be used to enhance DNA amplification or protein expression.</p><p>The functional unit of bl21 was reported to be tetrameric <xref rid="pone.0055076-Raghunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, although the monomer migrated at approximately 20 kDa based on SDS-PAGE analysis, which is consistent with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0055076-Raghunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Our native PAGE analysis showed that bl21 always migrated at approximately 480 kDa, which is not consistent with other reports <xref rid="pone.0055076-Kur1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055076-Raghunathan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, in these reports, the authors had not provided the data derived from native-PAGE, so it is possible that the native-PAGE condition could not damage the interaction between bl21 tetramers. For kod, there were always two bands migrating at approximately 40 kDa. Since no N-linked glycosylation site was identified in its primary sequence, this form might be the result of degradation. All SSB proteins expressed in this report were his-tagged at the N-terminus. Our data showed that the his-tag had no effect on the function of the SSB proteins, which is beneficial for industrial production.</p><p>The four SSB proteins were divided into two groups based on primary sequence analysis. tth and bl21 were similar to that of <italic>E. coli</italic> (NCBI LOCUS: 1EYG_D), which suggested that although TTH is a thermophilic bacterium, its SSB shares structural features with that of <italic>E. coli</italic>. kod is similar to <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, which suggested that these proteins from both thermophilic bacteria are relatively similar. Protein derived from non-extremophiles showed moderate heat-resistance. Interestingly, protein derived from thermophilic bacteria was not always heat-resistant.</p><p>Although ssRNA could be stained with ethidium bromide in a TAE gel, visualisation of the ssDNA protein complex was difficult. Ethidium bromide could not efficiently stain the ssDNA, but ssDNA was stained red by AgNO<sub>3</sub>. Thus, we performed a series of experiments to explore the characteristics of ssDNA and ssDNA-binding patterns by AgNO<sub>3</sub> staining. In this report, we used Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gels to represent a series of experiments since the binding activity could be reflected by mobility changes of the protein ssDNA complex. Regarding the effects on PCR specificity and enhancement of reverse transcriptions, SSB proteins were mixed with DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that the SSB proteins did not interact with the DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase (data not shown). Thus, the effects of SSB proteins on PCR specificity and enhancement of reverse transcriptions is likely accomplished through other mechanisms, and not by a direct interaction with the DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase.</p><p>
<italic>E. coli</italic> SSB was found to increase the processivity of DNA unwinding by the HCV helicase, SSB stabilizes the helicase at the unwinding junction and prevents its dissociation <xref rid="pone.0055076-Rajagopal1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Together with our data, host SSB proteins might be involved into viral life cycle and viral pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we present here a systematic functional analysis of a novel SSB protein derived from KOD1 and three reported SSB proteins. We found that all SSB proteins bound to ssDNA and viral RNA. Also, ssob and bl21 resisted heat-treatment for more than 4 h, and kod could withstand 95&#x000b0;C for at least 10 h. When SSB proteins bound to RNA, they both protected the RNA against nuclease attack and accelerated viral RNA processes in the host cell. Our results may provide a basis for future studies of the novel functions of SSB proteins.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Takaji Wakita (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) for providing us the JFH1 plasmid.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0055076-Brown1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Brown T (1999) Genomes.
