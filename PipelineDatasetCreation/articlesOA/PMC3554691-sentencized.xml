</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Nucleic acid replication, repair, recombination, transcription, and translation play a critical role in genome metabolism in organisms [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These processes are rigorously and orderly integrated at the molecular level [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SSB proteins play a key role in the integration of metabolic pathways by helping target relevant enzymes to the sites of on-going genome maintenance programs and ensuring that the enzymes complete their biological function effectively and accurately [2]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>SSB proteins are typically tetrameric or dimeric, and each polypeptide is composed of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, which presents a narrow ssDNA-binding cleft studded with residues that make numerous interactions with a small number of nucleotides in a relatively compact substructure [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>They also contain a glycine and proline-rich region, as well as a flexible C-terminal tail essential for protein interactions [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>SSB proteins are present in all three branches of organisms and in viruses [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recently, several studies on the biological function and application of SSB proteins have been performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>SSB proteins protect the vulnerable single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from nucleolytic digestion and prevent hairpin formation, thus keeping ssDNA in a suitable conformation for the action of enzymes involved in processes such as DNA replication, repair, recombination, and transcription [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SSB proteins are involved in physical interactions with several proteins that play important roles in those pathways, and thus are critical for essential life activities [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>SSB proteins are known to increase the efficiency and fidelity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [9], and also to prevent the formation of primer dimers [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The SSB protein of TTH also interacts efficiently with RNA, resulting in a dramatic increase in the size of the cDNA synthesised by the reverse transcriptase activity of TTH DNA polymerase [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The SSB protein of Escherichia coli has the following functions; targeting restriction endonuclease digestion to any restriction enzyme site in cloned ssDNA via DNA oligo splints [11], improving the DNA sequencing results through regions with strong secondary structure [12], and enhancing RNA transcription [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The unique ability of SSB proteins to bind ssDNA but not double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) allows for the efficient separation of the three types of DNA molecules in the PCR reaction mixture, which makes it an indispensable tool in the development of nucleotide aptamers [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The affinity of SSB towards ssDNA has been successfully utilised to detect hybridisation on gold surfaces by surface plasmon-resonance imaging [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although numerous applications of SSB proteins have been reported, a systematic functional comparative analysis of SSB proteins derived from different species has not yet been performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, it remains possible that SSB proteins bind single-stranded RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The SSB proteins may also have novel applications based on other biological characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Also, differences between the SSB proteins derived from thermophilic bacteria and E. coli remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the biological functions of SSB proteins derived from the thermophilic bacteria TTH, SSOB, and KOD, as well as E. coli BL21 (DE3). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding and stacking between SSB proteins and nucleoside bases, sugars and phosphates of ssDNA was believed to form the basis for ssDNA binding and specificity [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>In this study, our results showed that all four SSB proteins bind HCV RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>When the SSB proteins were heated at 95°C for 9 h, ssob, kod and bl21 could still bind HCV RNA, and the SSB protein protected the bound RNA against Benzonase digestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>When these SSB proteins were included in the reverse transcription reaction mix, they increased first-strand cDNA synthesis yield more than five times (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our study demonstrated that SSB proteins improved the transduction and expression efficiency of in vitro–transcribed viral RNA. In vitro–transcribed HCV RNA acted as mRNA for viral protein translation in transfected host cells [18]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Our data suggested that the SSB proteins could not only bind the viral RNA and undergo co-entry into the host cell with the transfection complex, but also improve viral RNA function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>These enhancements could be due to increased HCV RNA stability, increased translation efficiency, increased HCV RNA replication, and increased protein stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Together with the enhancement of first strand cDNA synthesis, these effects should not only contribute to the RNA protection role, but may also be related to the biological functions of SSB proteins in RNA metabolism pathways in organisms [21]–[23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Notably, the SSB proteins derived from bacteria displayed biological function in mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study has increased our knowledge of, and may reveal novel applications for, SSB proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 is a novel thermophilic bacterium [24], the DNA polymerase derived from which exhibited high fidelity and long-term heat resistance [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>To explore the possible application of its SSB proteins, we first expressed kod, and performed systemic functional studies together with the other three SSB proteins which were reported previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that kod binds ssDNA and viral RNA, and showed excellent heat resistance compared to the other SSB proteins. kod also significantly enhanced PCR specificity and improved RNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Thus, kod may in future be used to enhance DNA amplification or protein expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>The functional unit of bl21 was reported to be tetrameric [3], although the monomer migrated at approximately 20 kDa based on SDS-PAGE analysis, which is consistent with previous reports [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Our native PAGE analysis showed that bl21 always migrated at approximately 480 kDa, which is not consistent with other reports [2], [3], in these reports, the authors had not provided the data derived from native-PAGE, so it is possible that the native-PAGE condition could not damage the interaction between bl21 tetramers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>For kod, there were always two bands migrating at approximately 40 kDa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Since no N-linked glycosylation site was identified in its primary sequence, this form might be the result of degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>All SSB proteins expressed in this report were his-tagged at the N-terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that the his-tag had no effect on the function of the SSB proteins, which is beneficial for industrial production. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>The four SSB proteins were divided into two groups based on primary sequence analysis. tth and bl21 were similar to that of E. coli (NCBI LOCUS: 1EYG_D), which suggested that although TTH is a thermophilic bacterium, its SSB shares structural features with that of E. coli. kod is similar to Sulfolobus solfataricus, which suggested that these proteins from both thermophilic bacteria are relatively similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Protein derived from non-extremophiles showed moderate heat-resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, protein derived from thermophilic bacteria was not always heat-resistant. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Thus, we performed a series of experiments to explore the characteristics of ssDNA and ssDNA-binding patterns by AgNO3 staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>In this report, we used Coomassie brilliant blue-stained gels to represent a series of experiments since the binding activity could be reflected by mobility changes of the protein ssDNA complex. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>We found that the SSB proteins did not interact with the DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Thus, the effects of SSB proteins on PCR specificity and enhancement of reverse transcriptions is likely accomplished through other mechanisms, and not by a direct interaction with the DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>E. coli SSB was found to increase the processivity of DNA unwinding by the HCV helicase, SSB stabilizes the helicase at the unwinding junction and prevents its dissociation [26]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>We found that all SSB proteins bound to ssDNA and viral RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Also, ssob and bl21 resisted heat-treatment for more than 4 h, and kod could withstand 95°C for at least 10 h. </plain></SENT>
