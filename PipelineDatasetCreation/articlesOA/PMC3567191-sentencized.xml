</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The Gram-positive, spore-forming obligate anaerobe Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea worldwide [1]–[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD) range from mild diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis and even death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although CDAD is primarily a toxin-mediated disease [3], [4], the high cost and difficulty in treating C. difficile infections largely arises from its ability to form endospores [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because spores are metabolically dormant and intrinsically resistant to harsh physical insults [3], [7]–[9], they allow C. difficile to resist antibiotic treatment and persist in healthcare-associated settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, spores are the primary vectors for transmission [10] and the cause of recurrent infections, the latter of which occurs in ∼25% of cases and can lead to severe CDAD [6], [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In order to initiate an infection, C. difficile spores ingested from the environment must germinate into toxin-producing vegetative cells in the intestinal tract [1], [3], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similar to other spore-forming bacteria, C. difficile spores germinate specifically in response to small molecules known as germinants [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For C. difficile, these germinants are bile salts, which are abundant in the small intestine [15]–[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>While germinants have been identified for a number of bacterial species, the molecular events that occur upon germinant sensing remain poorly characterized [13], [14], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Shortly after germinant addition, cortex hydrolases become activated and degrade the spore cortex, a thick protective layer of modified peptidoglycan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Because the cortex maintains the spore in a dehydrated, metabolically dormant state, the removal of this physical constraint is essential for germination to proceed and metabolism to resume in the spore core [13], [14], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, despite the importance of cortex hydrolysis, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate cortex hydrolase activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the Clostridia, the primary cortex hydrolase appears to be SleC, since disruption of sleC in both C. difficile [19] and the related foodborne pathogen C. perfringens [20] results in a severe germination defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In C. perfringens, SleC undergoes several processing events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>During sporulation, the N-terminal prepeptide is removed to produce pro-SleC, which consists of an N-terminal propeptide attached to the hydrolase domain [21]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>During germination, the zymogen pro-SleC is cleaved at a conserved site to release the propeptide (Figure 1A); this event appears to activate its hydrolase activity [22], [25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>While Csps purified from C. perfringens germination exudates are N-terminally processed [25], whether Csps are regulated in a manner analogous to other subtilases is unclear. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The cspBA fusion gene is encoded in the genomes of only five clostridial species (Figure S2). C. difficile is unique among these species in that the CspA portion of CspBA (CD2247) lacks an intact catalytic triad (Figures 1A and S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether CspBA is produced as a fusion protein, we raised antibodies against the CspB portion of CspBA and analyzed CspB production in both sporulating cells and purified spores by Western blotting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>As a control, we constructed a targeted gene disruption [32] of the cspBA-cspC (cd2247-cd2246) operon (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In sporulating C. difficile cells, the anti-CspB antibody detected two polypeptides of ∼130 kDa and ∼55 kDa (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The former corresponds to the predicted MW of CspBA of 125 kDa, while the latter corresponds to the size of Csp proteases detected in C. perfringens spores (∼60 kDa) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Notably, the ∼55 kDa protein was enriched in purified spores, suggesting that interdomain cleavage of CspBA occurs during spore formation and that CspB may be preferentially incorporated into the developing spore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Although the mutant strains exhibited similar levels of sporulation (Figure 1C), CspB levels in sleC− mutants spores were consistently ∼3-fold lower than in wildtype spores (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these results indicate that CspBA is processed to CspB during C. difficile spore assembly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>While the cspBAC locus was previously identified by transposon mutagenesis as being essential for C. difficile spore germination [27], the effect of CspBA on SleC cortex hydrolase processing was not tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To determine whether loss of CspBA prevents SleC processing, we analyzed SleC cleavage in response to a bile salt germinant [16] by Western blotting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>As predicted, disruption of cspBAC in C. difficile prevented SleC cleavage during germination (Figure 1B), and this defect could be complemented by ectopic expression of the cspBAC locus from a multicopy plasmid [33] (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Thus, the cspBAC locus appears to regulate SleC activity in a manner similar to C. perfringens [20], [22], [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In order to gain insight into the mechanism by which CspBA activates SleC during germination, we conducted structure-function analyses of the CspB domain of CspBA, since CspB is the only Csp protease encoded by C. difficile with an intact catalytic triad (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Based on its homology to subtilases [25] (Figure S3), we hypothesized that CspB is synthesized as a pro-enzyme that undergoes autoprocessing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we recombinantly produced wildtype CspB difficile (residues 1–548 of CspBA) and CspB perfringens, along with mutants with the catalytic serine inactivated, and compared their apparent MW by SDS-PAGE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Whereas mutation of the catalytic serine caused both CspB difficile and CspB perfringens to run at their expected MWs of ∼60 kDa, the wildtype CspB proteins migrated with MWs of ∼55 kDa (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Thus, Csps autocatalytically remove their prodomain in a manner similar to other subtilases. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Spore germination is essential for Clostridium sp. pathogens such as C. perfringens and C. difficile to initiate infection [12], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A critical step during germination is the degradation of the thick, protective cortex layer surrounding the spore core by cortex hydrolases [13], [14], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>However, despite their functional importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control cortex hydrolase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide the first molecular insight into cortex hydrolase regulation by solving the structure of CspB, a protease required for cortex hydrolase activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Combined with our functional analyses of CspB in vitro and in vivo, the structure reveals that Csps are subtilisin-like proteases with two distinctive functional features: a central jellyroll domain and a retained prodomain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The central β-barrel jellyroll domain of CspB interrupts the subtilase domain and wedges itself tightly between the subtilase domain and prodomain in three-dimensional space (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>This unique position is likely critical for CspB function, since the jellyroll domain markedly restrains the conformational mobility of CspB through extensive and specific interactions at the subtilase-jellyroll domain interface (Figure 4B and S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The rigidity conferred by the jellyroll domain presumably helps CspB survive the environmental extremes that spores can encounter, such as freeze-thaw cycles and boiling temperatures [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The jellyroll domain also facilitates CspB autoprocessing in vitro (Figure 4B), indicative of a role in helping CspB adopt the correct subtilase fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this proposal, deletion of the jellyroll domain in C. difficile markedly reduced CspBA levels relative to wild type (Figure 7B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In these respects, the jellyroll domain is more functionally analogous to the β-barrel P-domains of kexin-like subtilisins than to the jellyroll domain of prokaryotic Tk-SP subtilisin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Like the CspB jellyroll domain, the P-domain of kexin-like proteases, such as the mammalian enzyme furin, is important for autoprocessing, folding, stability, and activity of the subtilase domain [31], [42], [49]–[51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the jellyroll domain of Tk-SP is dispensable for autoprocessing, protein folding and activity in vitro, despite being important for Tk-SP thermostability [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>The retention of the CspB prodomain is another unique feature identified by our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Unlike the majority of subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain stays bound to the wildtype subtilase domain via a network of interactions that result in tighter prodomain binding relative to other subtilases (Figure 5B and S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Prodomain binding to its cognate protease appears highly specific, since prodomain swapping does not result in efficient folding of CspB (Figure S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is consistent with the limited sequence conservation of prodomains across Csps (Figure S3); indeed, even the salt bridges critical for prodomain chaperone activity (Figure 5D) are not conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Despite the low level of sequence conservation, the position of prodomain autoprocessing is highly conserved (Figure 2B), and a small internal deletion of the prodomain disrupts autocleavage even though diverse residues are tolerated at the P1 position (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, Csps exhibit less specificity in P1 substrate recognition than most subtilases [52]–[56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, while residues around the prodomain cleavage site do not affect autocleavage efficiency, they do control active site accessibility after autoprocessing, excluding even a small, highly reactive, serine protease probe in vitro (Figure 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Taken together, Csps appear more functionally similar to the site-specific kexin-like protease subfamily than to the highly processive subtilisin subfamily [28], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Similar to kexin-like proteases, Csps cleave their putative substrate, SleC, at a single site during germination [22] (Figure 1B) and remain more closely associated with their prodomain following autoprocessing [31], [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>By contrast, subtilisin subfamily members such as Tk-SP function as major degradative enzymes that rapidly degrade their prodomain following autoprocessing [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>While these observations provide new insight into the structure and function of Csp proteases, they raise a number of questions for future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="?"><plain>Does the prodomain remain associated with autoprocessed CspB in dormant spores as it does in vitro? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="?"><plain>If the prodomain stays bound to mature CspB in dormant spores, what happens to the prodomain during germination? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Given that chymotrypsin cannot access numerous prodomain cleavage sites during extended incubation in vitro (Figure 4), a significant change in CspB conformational mobility would appear to be required for the prodomain to be degraded and its putative substrate SleC to gain access to the CspB substrate binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Another question raised by our study is the role of CspC in regulating germination in C. difficile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Given that Δjelly, S461A, and Q66/S461A mutant spores exhibit germination defects that are &gt;100-fold less severe than cspBAC− spores and that a major difference between these mutant spores is the absence of CspC in cspBAC− mutant spores (Figures 7 and 8), catalytically inactive CspC (Figure 1A) may play a role in SleC activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggests that CspC helps transduce the germination signal to CspB (J. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Sorg, personal communication). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is unclear what fraction of pro-SleC must be proteolytically activated to induce successful spore germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5% of spores of the CspBA catalytic mutant S461A successfully germinate, which correlates with a small fraction of pro-SleC undergoing processing in the mutant strain (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that only a small fraction of SleC must be proteolytically activated in order to mediate spore germination in some cells; alternatively, a small fraction of S461A spores could efficiently cleave pro-SleC and thus germinate successfully. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>While further experimentation is needed, the work presented here provides the first structure-function analyses of Csp proteases in vitro and in vivo and lays the groundwork for mechanistically addressing how the germination pathway senses and integrates the germination signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study may provide the structural basis for designing therapeutics that either block prodomain and/or jellyroll domain binding to the CspBA subtilase domain during spore formation or prematurely activate CspBA to induce cortex hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>These CspBA agonists or antagonists could prevent C. difficile transmission and disease recurrence. </plain></SENT>
