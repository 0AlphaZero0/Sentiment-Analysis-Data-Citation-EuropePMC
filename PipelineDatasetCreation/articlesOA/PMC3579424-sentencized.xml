</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Salinity is one major limiting factor to plant growth and crop productivity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cultivated soils worldwide are becoming more saline from marginal irrigation water, excessive fertilization, and desertification processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Currently, more than 800 million hectares of land throughout the world are affected by levels of salt that could substantially reduce crop productivity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Strategies for alleviation of salt stress involve developing salt-resistant cultivars, leaching excess soluble salts from upper to lower soil depths, flushing soils that contain soil crusts at the surface, reducing salt by harvesting salt-accumulating aerial plant parts in areas with negligible irrigation water or rainfall for leaching, and amelioration of saline soils under cropping and leaching [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>An alternative is to alleviate salt stress by inoculating crop seeds and seedlings with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Looking into the perspectives of crop production losses due to the severity of abiotic stresses, especially salinity, tolerance to stress provided by microbial inoculants becomes more important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Beneficial effect of PGPB under salinity has been related to hydraulic conductance, osmolyte accumulation, sequestering toxic Na+ ions , maintaining higher stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activities [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Azopsirillum halopraeferens, tolerates 3% NaCl [5], colonizes mangrove roots in seawater [6], and enhances the growth of halophytes irrigated with seawater [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Most other Azospirillum species can tolerate only 2% NaCl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Similarly, some Bacilli strains able to tolerate 8% NaCl and showing PGP activities have been reported by Upadhyay et al. [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>PGPB with ACC deaminase activity have been successfully used to reduce the negative effects of salinity by lowering stress ethylene production in the vicinity of growing root [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mayak et al. [9] reported that ACC deaminase producing salt tolerant bacteria can survive well in a saline environment and that their beneficial properties help plants to overcome stress effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Halotolerant bacteria are a group of bacteria able to grow well in media containing a wide range of NaCl (1-33%) or in the absence of NaCl [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Hence, it was hypothesized that isolating bacteria with PGP activities from naturally saline habitats would give bonafide candidates which could help ameliorate saline stress effect on wheat plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Microorganisms surviving at extreme environmental conditions have been found suitable for use in different agricultural practices [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple food crop for more than one third of the world population and is the main staple food of Asia [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Seed germination and seedling growth of wheat, like other crops, were negatively affected by drought and salinity stresses [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Salinity stress adversely affects total dry matter and plant growth, as most of the energy available is used in to make osmotic adjustments by the plant [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The screening of salt tolerant lines/cultivars has been attempted by many researchers on various species at seedling growth stage [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Both water availability and salt stress can impair coleoptiles growth, thus affecting seedling establishment in the field [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The relation of various seedling growth parameters like early emergence and fast seedling growth to seed yield and yield components under saline conditions are important for the development of salt tolerant cultivar for production under saline soil condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The use of rhizobacteria is one of the most acceptable approaches to reduce the effect of salt-stress on plants as they are endowed with mechanisms which either modulate or ameliorate the salt stress [4, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Wheat is grown both as winter and spring crop in India and is cultivated under rainfed conditions where precipitation is less than 850 mm annually. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Salinity is one of the major constraints which hamper wheat production in the country. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Hence, the present study was conducted in an attempt to isolate and characterize halotolerant bacteria from saline habitats e.g. Sambhar salt lake, Jaiselmer saline soils and Pushkar lake and evaluate check their ability to ameliorate saline stress and improve seedling germination of wheat under salt affected conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>High salinity is one of the most common environmental stress factor that adversely affect plant productivity by retarding the plant growth and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To promote plant growth under saline condition, direct use of salt-tolerant bacteria has drawn considerable research interest both in industry and in academics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a large number of halotolerant bacteria were isolated, and screened for their tolerance levels of NaCl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In this study, all the isolates at higher NaCl concentrations grew with long stationary phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the synthesis of protective factors and adaptation of current environmental conditions [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis of five halotolerant bacterial 16S rDNA gene sequence revealed them to belong to Bacillus and Hallobacillus species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>These strains with high salt tolerance were further characterized for the PGP activities including IAA production, P-solubilization, HCN and siderophore production and ACC deaminase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Upadhyay et al. [8] found that only 18% (24 out of 130) of strains isolated from wheat rhizosphere in soils of Varanasi, were found tolerant to 8% of NaCl, while maintaining PGP activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Siddikee et al.[11] reported that different halotolerant bacteria were able to withstand high salt concentration (1.75 M NaCl) and were able to facilitate plant growth promotion in the presence of growth inhibitory levels of salt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In the present study 32% (27 out of 84) of strains could grow well at 15% NaCl and 25% (21 out of 84) at 20% NaCl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Tolerance of bacterial strains to higher salinity levels in the present study was probably because of the naturalization in the saline habitats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Five high salt tolerating bacteria were studied for their PGP activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>SL3 and J8W had multiple PGP activities (IAA and siderophore positive), however, SL32 and PU62 showed only siderophore and P-solubilization activities respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>PGPR that have ACC deaminase activity help plants to withstand stress (biotic and abiotic) by reducing the level of stress ethylene [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In the present study none of the five strains studied produced ACC deaminase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Since all the five had mitigating effect of salinity stress on the wheat seedling, there must be other mechanisms by which these halotolerant bacteria are able to stimulate seed germination, root elongation and increase in root biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Since IAA secreted by bacteria may promote root growth directly, by stimulating cell elongation or cell division [23], the observed positive effect of strain Hallobacillus sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>SL3 on wheat seedling could be due to this mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>However, strain B. halodenitrificans PU62 which also enhanced these parameters could be due to some other mechanism as it did not show IAA production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>It was observed that halotolerant strains, which produce IAA but not ACC deaminase, inhibited root growth rather than promote elongation in the presence of salt [11], reflecting a higher synthesis rate of ACC under stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, IAA concentration itself may have inhibited root growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In our study the halotolerant bacteria producing neither IAA nor ACC deaminase enhanced root elongation and root dry weight under salt stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Also the deleterious effect of salt on seed germination rate was mitigated with inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This could be the result of better water uptake induced by inoculation which is reflected in faster root growth in inoculated seedlings exposed to these stresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>A report showed that the turgor pressure at low water potential (20% PEG 6000) was higher in inoculated seedlings in two wheat cultivars under osmotic stress [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Another way of protection is by production of exopolysaccharides which bind with cations, including Na+, and thus decrease the content of Na+ available for plant uptake [8, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Obviously, there could be more than one mechanism that PGPR employ for protection against salt induced stresses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In this study we have shown that different halotolerant bacteria, isolated from saline habitats are able to withstand high salt concentrations and can facilitate plant growth promotion in the presence of growth inhibitory levels of salt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Given the variation in plant growth promotion, the selection and subsequent commercial use of halotolerant bacteria with multiple PGP activities can be used as bioinoculants for saline environments. </plain></SENT>
