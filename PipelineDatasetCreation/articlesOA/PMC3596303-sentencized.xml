</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir for all avian influenza A viruses (AIVs), and are subtyped according to 16 haemagglutinin (HA) subtypes and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most AIVs are of low pathogenicity and cause mild or subclinical infections in aquatic birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have been isolated from over 136 species of wild birds and are most commonly isolated from Anseriformes and Charadriiformes [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Despite widespread surveillance, there remain substantial unanswered questions about the spatial, temporal and ecological role of the host populations in defining the genetic structure of AIVs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Since the emergence and westward spread of HPAI H5N1 from SE-Asia, one of the outstanding questions is the role wild birds, particularly long distance migrants, might play in the dissemination of AIV from SE-Asia to other geographic regions [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The Caucasus region is crossed by thousands of migratory birds annually, and Georgia is located at the intersection of three wild bird migratory flyways – the Central Asian, East Africa-West Asia and Mediterranean/Black Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the wetland habitats within Georgia are used as a migratory stop-over and over-wintering area for tens of thousands of ducks, and for breeding, migration stop-over and over-wintering for hundreds of thousands of gulls offering potential for AIV transmission among bird populations originating in different geographic areas. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>AIV surveillance work on Charadriiformes, particularly waders and gull species has mainly been carried out in North America, north western Europe and Russia [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Gulls have been shown to harbor a variety of influenza subtypes, including H13 and H16, which almost exclusively occur in gulls and terns [1], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>High AIV prevalence during migration stopover has been observed, notably in waders, particularly the Ruddy turnstone, in Delaware Bay, on the East coast of the United States [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>What is not known is the role that Charadriiformes might play in AIV virus ecology and in the potential for AIV dissemination outside this wader species AIV hotspot in Delaware Bay, and in species and geographic regions outside North America. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here we report the findings of a longitudinal study set up in the Republic of Georgia in 2009 to investigate the ecology and evolution of AIV in wild birds in the Caucasus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We test the hypothesis that Georgia acts as a hub for the transmission of AIV due to frequent mixing events among birds originating from different geographic areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition, using Armenian Gulls (Larus armenicus) as a model species, we longitudinally track the antibody profile of this host population and the point at which any AIV infection might occur, to investigate the ecology of AIV in these Eurasian gulls. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Previous experimental work has also shown that patterns of virus attachment of avian influenza viruses differs among even closely related avian species [22] so we also assessed whether the predominant route of AIV shedding might differ among ducks and gulls sampled in Georgia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>We took paired tracheal and cloacal swabs from all ducks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Of these duck swabs, 87.5% (28/32) of the AIV-positives originated from cloacal swabs and 12.5% (4/32) from tracheal swabs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>In gulls, 74% (2192/2994) of all swabs were taken from fresh feces after pre-species identification, and 13% (398/2994) each from paired trachea and cloacal sampling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Of the AIV-positive sampled taken from gulls, 69% (37/53) were obtained from fresh feces, 274% (13/53) from cloacal swabs and only 6% (3/53) from tracheal swabs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>No individual bird was sampled as AIV- positive from both tracheal and cloacal swabs </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>After excluding the gull fresh feces samples from the analyses as paired samples were not taken, we found a significant difference between the number of AIV-positive tracheal and the number of AIV-positive cloacal samples with disproportionately more cloacal than tracheal-positive samples (Chi-squared test for given probabilities: X-squared = 27.76, p-value = &lt;&lt;&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>However there is no significant difference between the respiratory and cloacal shedding patterns between gulls and ducks (Pearson's chi-squared test with Yates continuity correction: X-squared = 0.02, p-value = 0.885). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it is important to take both tracheal and cloacal samples if possible, because a) no bird was detected as M RRT-PCR positive through both tracheal and cloacal swabs and therefore AIV-positive birds might be missed, and b) although we observed no significant difference in the source of AIV-positive swabs we cannot exclude that predominant shedding patterns might differ among different subtypes, by host, and by amount of virus from different routes, so potentially affecting not only detection if one does not take both tracheal and cloacal swabs, but also virus isolation success. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Therefore we also considered whether the ability to isolate virus from gulls or ducks differed in terms of route or amount of virus excreted by a certain route, or whether particular subtypes were shed by a particular route. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The very limited number of tracheal swab RRT-PCR positive samples, the high CT-values and the lack of virus isolates suggest that this is the less important route of shedding in this study and that taking fresh faecal or cloacal swabs is imperative to detect AIV infection and potentially isolate the subtypes circulating (even uncharacterized) in gulls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>In ducks, 31 fresh faeces, cloacal or tracheal samples were RRT-PCR MA-positive (CT-values: 22–38) (Table S2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>After one month from when the first chicks hatched, we did not sample a) any chicks with downy juvenile plumage, or b) record any sero-positive birds, likely because any MDA had waned and we were sampling older birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>However, we continued to use serological testing as any evidence of seroconversion would allow us to target which swabs taken for virological testing to prioritise through M RRT-PCR diagnostic screening to detect what we predicted would be a peak on infection in juveniles around the point of fledge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Of 328 swabs tested and 143 sera tested subsequently, none were virologically or serologically positive for AIV or antibodies. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the HA and NA gene segments for 23 virus isolates to characterize the genetic evolution of LPAI viruses in Georgia relative to other circulating AIVs in Eurasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>In ducks, the HA and NA sequences were overall phylogenetically similar to others in Eurasia, but either a) grouped within-clade with solely Georgian sequences or b) within clades with relatively long branch lengths to sequences derived from other geographic areas, or c) phylogenetically characterized as a unique clade, suggesting that AIV sequence data density is not yet great enough to robustly test hypotheses about the spatial and temporal patterns in the evolution of Eurasian AIVs in ducks but that this Georgian dataset has captured previously unobserved genetic diversity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>In gulls, we observed that Georgian HA and NA sequences always grouped within clades containing only gull-derived isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these clades often only contained Georgian sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>For example, H13 viruses formed two clades containing only Georgian isolates and a third clade where the closest relative was a virus isolated from a gull in Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>To date, H13 and H16 have been regarded as predominantly species-specific to gulls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Here, however we observed that both H9 and H11 viruses derived from gulls formed phylogenetic clades distinct from circulating duck H9 and H11 viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>For example, the H11N1 virus isolated from a Black-headed Gull in 2010 was phylogenetically distinct from other Eurasian H11 viruses, with the exception of a virus isolated from a gull in Kazakhstan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>BLAST analyses in NCBI against published HA sequences showed a 97% similarity with this Kazakhstan virus and only 93% similarity with viruses isolated from shorebirds and ducks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>We also compared 44 H11 Eurasian virus isolates including 3 gull isolates, 2 currently unpublished, which also showed close similarity among the gull isolates and dissimilarity from the Eurasian duck isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Whilst not conclusive owing to the extremely limited samples available, the H11 viruses from Kazakhstan and Georgia might represent a ‘gull’ lineage of H11 viruses similar to the species-specific lineages seen in H13 and H16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>Likewise the H9 viruses might contain a lineage, which is species-specific to gulls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>We note that we observed no overlap in the subtypes in the two orders of birds (anseriformes and charadriiformes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>These substantial phylogenetic differences are notable and highlight the need for improved surveillance not only in ducks, but also in gulls and terns to investigate the ecology and evolution in these species groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>If Georgia acts as a hub for the transmission of viruses from one geographic area to another when birds aggregate for important stages of their life-cycle, one would predict firstly that the closest relatives to viruses isolated in Georgia, would be isolated from a wide geographical area throughout Eurasia and Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>One would also predict that other areas where birds might aggregate but are not a hub for transmission might only yield closest relatives from a more limited geographic region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>To test whether Georgia is a hub for transmission exhibiting both high virus diversity and high population mixing, we first constructed ML phylogenetic trees (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>We observed that the closest relatives to Georgian viruses were geographically spread throughout Central and South Asia, and Western Europe, and from both more northerly and southerly latitudes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>The predominance of closest relatives from more western areas of Europe might reflect the greater level of wild bird surveillance that is carried out in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Flyway maps have been constructed primarily from bird ring data [5] and we can use such maps as a surrogate for the linkage among host populations within Eurasia and Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Integrating the phylogenetic and flyway data, we see that birds originating from different flyways likely mixed in Georgia as the origin of the closest relatives to the viruses they carried to Georgia were from the Black Sea-Mediterranean, the East Atlantic, the Central Asian and the East Asian/Australasian flyways (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Although sufficient data are not yet available for more formal hypothesis testing, we also used the phylogenetic results here to test how relatively well-connected Georgia might be to bird populations in other geographic regions compared with countries to the east and west, both to inform important sites in which to carry out targeted surveillance to capture virus diversity, and to further test our hypotheses of the ecology and evolution of AIVs in the natural host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>We measured the relative frequency with which viruses from a particular country are found in a phylogenetic clade together with other viruses from Europe, Central Asia or East Asia (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>We found that isolates from Sweden are always within European clades, viruses from the Netherlands nearly always, and viruses from Georgia nearly equally likely to be closely related to viruses from Europe, Central Asia or East Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Conversely, viruses from Mongolia and Russia were mostly closely related to viruses from East and Central Asia, and over 50% of viruses from China were mostly closely related to viruses from East Asia with a smaller proportion related to viruses from Europe and Central Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>However, to fully test the characteristics required of an area to be considered key to the ecology of AIVs requires data from areas representing the full spectrum of host population mixing and a greater understanding of the host population ecology. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>To account for these observations, one hypothesis is that three factors might be important in the ecology of gulls and AIVs in Georgia and the interplay among these factors affects the risk of AIV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>At the start of the breeding season a) the population density of gulls is relatively high, b) susceptibility is relatively low because the population is predominantly adult (we found a seroprevalence rate of 50% in adult birds on the breeding grounds prior to hatch) and c) the probability of introduction of virus is likely small as the population is single species and colony-based. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>After hatch, and waning of maternally-derived antibodies after approximately 1 month of age, the population density is still high but population susceptibility also is now increased owing to the naive juveniles, but the probability of introduction of virus is still low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>In our study, gulls did not become infected with AIVs until they moved off the breeding grounds to the overwintering grounds in September and October. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Here the population density is still relatively high, susceptibility is high as birds arrive sero-negative from the breeding grounds, but now we hypothesize that the probability of introduction of virus is also high, whether as a result of increased mixing of gulls from different breeding colonies and areas, or contact with virus-infected species not present in the breeding areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>We also observed that the viruses isolated from gulls were H13, H9 or H11 subtypes, with H9 and H11, as well as H13, potentially from ‘gull’ lineages rather than phylogenetically like AIVs isolated from ducks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>Thus, putatively the introduction of AIVs into gulls in Georgia is more influenced by the dynamics of infection within gulls similar to the dynamics of H13 and H16 AIV infections among colonies seen in other geographic regions (personal communication, Josanne Verhagen, Erasmus Medical Centre) rather than by the arrival of ducks for migration stop-over and post-breeding moult. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>Our duck population sample is taken from predominantly migratory/post-moult ducks from September onwards in the Javakheti Uplands and overwintering ducks in the Kolkheti Lowland Wetlands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>On Madatapa Lake in the Javakheti Uplands, we estimate 100–150 breeding pairs consisting of Northern Shoveler, Mallard, Garganey, Gadwall and Common Pochard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>On a nearby lake there is a breeding population of Ruddy Shelduck. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>In late August and September local breeding populations of ducks aggregate to moult on the shallow lakes of Javakheti, their numbers augmented by the arrival of ducks from other breeding areas, using the site both to moult and as a migratory stop-over. This time is co-incident with the breeding gull population leaving the colony. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>Although previous data from northwest Europe and North America has suggested that peak prevalence in ducks occurs in the post-moult sites, where large numbers of naive juvenile birds mix in high density for the first time, prior to southward migration, here we find one peak in prevalence co-incident with post-breeding moult and autumn migration, followed by a period where there is low duck density and low or no prevalence, then another peak of similar prevalence when overwintering ducks arrive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Prevalence levels are not as high as seen in more northerly latitude post-moult study areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the majority of infections occur in the initial congregation sites and the lower levels we observed in Georgia are capturing the wave of virus dissemination as birds migrate and re-aggregate along the route, with birds from different geographic regions mixing, and differing by previous exposure history or other individual species-derived immunological factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>In both the gull and duck data, population density, susceptibility and probability of introduction through sub-population mixing appear to drive the dynamics of infection with LPAI viruses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>During the study period we only detected LPAI viruses and no HPAI viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>This is despite the fact that during 2009–2012 HPAI outbreaks in wild birds were reported in other central Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries located within flyways that putatively also include Georgia (Wahid interface, OIE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>The lack of HPAI viruses suggest that either the timing of such outbreaks relative to bird migration is critical to dissemination of HPAI viruses by wild birds, or that wild birds play a more limited role in the dissemination of HPAI viruses than has been thought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>For example, if wild birds did play a substantial role in the dissemination of HPAI viruses, one would predict that outbreaks in other, more northerly Central Asian countries in March would likely pose little threat to Georgian bird populations if migration is south-north in that period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>HPAI virus incursion threat to Georgia would likely be from countries where birds overwinter, further down the migratory route and the timing of active surveillance within Georgia could be targeted accordingly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>Conversely, if wild birds play a more limited role in HPAI virus dissemination, then assessment of HPAI virus disease incursion risk to Georgia might focus on passive die-off reporting rather than active surveillance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>Understanding the ecology and evolution of AIVs in the natural host is key to understanding the role that wild birds might play in disseminating viruses among different geographic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>From our data, geographic areas in which frequent migration events occur have the potential to influence virus genetic diversity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>We also observe that the closest geographic relatives to LPAI viruses isolated in Georgia are not solely isolated from countries to the west. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>Acquiring higher resolution data from Central and South Asia, particularly in terms of the LPAI viruses that circulate, is critical to establishing the relative inter-linking between different geographic regions and also the potential for AIV dissemination, particularly HPAI viruses, from east to west, mediated by wild birds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>To fully evaluate the factors that drive the evolution of AIVs we require a much greater understanding of the interplay between host species, environment, geography and time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>Future work should include using the global AI sequence diversity to test for such interplay, particularly using methods that remove the confounding influence of some individual factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>Not only will this work give us key insight into the ecology and evolution of LPAI viruses in the natural host, but it will act as a basis for understanding some of the drivers that might be important when investigating the role that wild birds might play in HPAI virus spread, and the risk that this could pose to animal and public health </plain></SENT>
