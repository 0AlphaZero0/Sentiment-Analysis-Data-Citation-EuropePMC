<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>TnC consists of two globular lobes, the N- and the C-lobe, connected with a central linker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Each lobe contains a pair of EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The Ca2+-binding sites in the N-lobe are believed to be responsible for the regulation of muscle contraction, whereas those in the C-lobe show higher affinities for Ca2+ and play a structural role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In cardiac muscle, TnC has only one functional regulatory Ca2+-binding site (site II) in the N-lobe due to the replacement of the key Ca2+-coordinating amino acid residues in site I [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Unlike calmodulin, which is another example of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins with four Ca2+-binding sites and recognizes a number of target proteins, TnC is known to have only one Ca2+-dependent target protein - TnI. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Understanding of structural changes upon Ca2+ binding to, or Ca2+release from TnC should help the effective development of such drugs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>MD simulations explore the atomic level details of molecular motion of macromolecules by means of computing the Newtonian equations of motion for each atom to obtain the time dependent evolution of the molecular system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Such simulations, starting with the groundbreaking work on BPTI in the late 1970s [5], have revealed the source of mechanical strength of the sarcomeric protein titin [6], the folding of the BPTI molecule on millisecond time scale, the folding of the WW domain [7], [8] and the dynamics of the STM virus in a system of over 1 million atoms [9], to name a few. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>EF-hand proteins have been the subject of several computational studies in recent years [10], [11], [12] and so has been another thin filament protein - actin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Deriu et al. [13], [14] used atomistic and continuum scale modeling to describe the macro mechanics of actin filaments as a function of nanoscale events on the local level using molecular dynamics, coarse-grained model and normal mode analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recent works analyzed the correlated motions in the Tn subunits and Tn inter domain interactions [16] and identified and designed putative ligands that can bind and fit into the hydrophobic pocket of the TnC N-lobe [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In an earlier interdisciplinary study, Ertz-Berger et al. [18] used molecular dynamics of the TnT domain (residues 70–170) to first explore the effect of mutations and then validate the computational predictions using transgenic mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The well known codon Arg-92, a mutational hotspot, was mutated in silico to Trp and Leu and effects of the mutations in cTnT on the molecular flexibility of cTnT were studied with MD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Ca2+ binding to Site I of cardiac Tn was observed to induce correlative motions in the EF-hand and domain movements that precipitate the forming of the TnI interface. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Troponin binds Ca2+ at sites I and II in the N-lobe of TnC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Site I is a Ca2+-binding loop formed by TnC residues 29–40 and site II is a Ca2+-binding loop formed by TnC residues 65 to 76 (chicken fast skeletal isoform residue numbers). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The key function of the EF-hand regulatory domain is to sense a Ca2+ chemical signal and undergo a conformational change which enables the further downstream transduction of the signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In the case of TnC it has long been considered that this conformational change is a closure of the N-lobe A/B helix hydrophobic pocket and that in the absence of Ca2+ at the regulatory sites the N-lobe of TnC forms a “closed” structure; then upon Ca2+-binding to the regulatory sites, it adopts a “open” structure to provide TnI-interaction sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Although these “final” structures have been investigated relatively well, the pathway between these two structures has not been understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Additionally it has been proposed [20] that in the process of thin filament relaxation, upon Ca2+ release from the TnC sites I and II, the TnI switch region is expelled from the TnC binding pocket which then closes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Upon Ca2+ binding, the pocket opens and the TnI switch region is re-inserted into the pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Despite the rich body of experimental and computational evidence unanswered questions regarding whether the EF-hand motif in general, and the TnC N-lobe in particular, is a bi-stable switch shuttling between open and closed states remain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Indeed, blockage of the opening motion of the N-lobe by intra-domain disulphide bridging results in the practical disappearance of the Ca2+-dependent regulatory function of Tn [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The first TnC structural study [22] presented a Ca2+-depleted N-lobe with a fully closed hydrophobic pocket and in subsequent work [23] the authors postulated the HMJ model conceptualizing that binding of Ca2+ causes the opening of the hydrophobic pocket for further interaction with TnI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In the case of cardiac TnC however the hydrophobic pocket of the N-lobe maintains a closed conformation after Ca2+ binds to site II while Site I does not bind Ca2+ at all, as was shown in several structural studies [24], [25], [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Small molecule binding (bepridil) or protein ligand (TnI) causes the hydrophobic pocket to open [27], [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Computational and experimental studies of calmodulin have shown a fluctuation of the N-lobe between open and closed states [29] or a lesser opening of the N-lobe [30] and further emphasized the backbone plasticity of the EF-hand proteins [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Grabarek’s EF β-scaffold model suggests that subtle changes in the backbone dihedral φ, ψ angles in the N-lobe β-sheet allow the N-lobe to sample different conformations until a target specific one is reached. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used MD simulations to characterize the Ca2+-dependent dynamics of the fast skeletal troponin molecule and the TnC subunit in the Ca2+-saturated and depleted states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We focused on the N-lobe and on describing the atomic level events that take place subsequent to removal of the Ca2+ ion from the regulatory sites I and II. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This approach allowed us not only to compare the initial and final states of troponin but to also explore the dynamics of troponin in the activated and deactivated state; to explore the dynamics that take place subsequent to Ca2+ release; to reveal the atomic level details of the conformational changes that occur in response to Ca2+ release; and to characterize the transitional events leading to thin filament relaxation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>A closure of the hydrophobic pocket results from the integrated effect of the following conformational events: breakage of H-bond interactions between the backbone nitrogen atoms of the residues at positions 2, 9 and the sidechain oxygen atoms of the residue at position 12 (N2-OE12/N9-OE12) in sites I and II; expansion of sites I and II and increased site II N-terminal end-segment flexibility; strengthening of the β-sheet scaffold and the subsequent hydrophobic re-packing of the N-lobe hydrophobic residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Additionally the Ca2+ release allows the N-lobe to rotate 25–35 degrees relative to the rest of the Tn molecule. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Structural comparison of the open and semi-closed state reveals that the N2-OE12/N9-OE12 interactions at site I and site II are present and well maintained throughout the trajectories and the two sidechain oxygen atoms of GLU40 and GLU76 are firmly pointed towards the Ca2+ ion and towards the nitrogen atoms at position 2 and 9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>There is also little difference in the packing of the core PHE25, PHE74 and PHE77. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The packing of other N-lobe hydrophobic residues however show remarkable differences between the open, semi-closed and closed states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The PHE28 side chain reaches out to a lesser degree in the semi-closed state while VAL44 is able to approach PHE77 less. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Since the N2-OE12/N9-OE12 interaction at sites I and II and the Ca2+ ion are still present, the PHE28 side chain cannot escape further out and only a semi-closed state can be reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In the closed state the aromatic ring of PHE28 is positioned above the B helix and over the main chain nitrogen atom of VAL44 whereas in the open and semi-closed state the aromatic ring is further back into the space between the A and B helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The VAL44 side chain is thus either in contact with the aromatic ring of PHE28 or pointed towards the aromatic ring of PHE77 and PHE25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The packing of the hydrophobic residues between the D helix and the B helix is also less complete - the three methionines: MET81(D), MET45(B) and MET80(D) are further separated in the semi-closed than in the closed state. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the THR38N-GLY70O H-bond at the β sheet in the closed state is well formed at a distance of approximately 2 Å whereas in the semi-closed and open state, the distance is stable at over 4.7 Å, except in the case of the TnCSite2noCa2+ simulation where the release of the ion allows the formation of the THR38N-GLY70O H-bond. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The key difference however is that the removal of Ca2+ breaks the N2-OE12/N9-OE12 ‘prong’ interaction; liberates the N-terminal end segment of the binding site II thus allowing the B helix VAL44 to slide swiftly under the rising aromatic ring of the A helix’s PHE28 and make a contact with the PHE77 of the unperturbed hydrophobic core scaffold (PHE77, PHE74 and PHE25) of the N-lobe. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Based on our findings we propose a model for thin filament regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The deactivation of troponin can be interpreted as a closure-rotation conformational change occurring in response to Ca2+ release. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to Ca2+ removal from regulatory sites I and II, the N-lobe hydrophobic pocket closes, while the rising PHE28 residue pushes the TnI switch region towards the front of the pocket while the entire N-lobe rotates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The rotation of the TnC causes displacement of the TnI regulatory segment onto actin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>TnI is now poised to inhibit the actomyosin cross-bridge cycling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Full release of the TnI switch region from the TnC binding pocket may not be necessary for the deactivation process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Since the A helix is a full turn longer than the B helix, a comfortable binding interface (MET17, PHE21, LEU48) is presented for TnI to remain in close contact with the closed N-lobe pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Subsequent events may include melting of the TnC connecting helix as suggested by Vinogradova et al. [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Activation of the thin filament will be then precipitated by rotation and a re-opening of the hydrophobic pocket that can be envisioned as a reversal of the above described steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The Ca2+ ligands will reach [11] to grab and pull in the ion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The sidechain oxygen atoms of the site-terminal GLU and ligands 1, 3 and 5 will be attracted to the ion thus rotating the backbone, restoring the N2-OE12/N9-OE12 interactions and inducing the B helix to move away from the A helix while unpacking the hydrophobic core. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>TnI switch region is then readily re-inserted in the opened pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Rotation in the opposite direction occurs at the same time. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This study focused on the troponin molecule in isolation, as have other recent computational studies of troponin [16], [17], [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This fact notwithstanding, a discussion of the importance of protein-protein interaction involving troponin and other thin filament proteins should be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Recent work [52] suggests that the N-terminal helix of TnT in the core domain of troponin and the C-terminal segment of TnT may interact with actin and tropomyosin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Incorporating these observations, there are several models [53], [54], [55] of the actin-tropomyosin-core troponin domain complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Yet the exact location and orientation of the core domain of the troponin complex along the actin-tropomyosin filaments has been elusive so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The structural opening of the N-lobe of TnC was investigated in various complexes in cardiac system using FRET [56] and it was found that the structural opening was slightly constrained by the presence of actin (∼1 Å in the distance measurements of the aforementioned study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Yet 1 Å can be attributed to the orientation difference of fluorescence probes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Thus there has been no clear evidence for interactions that involve the N-lobe of TnC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless; molecular dynamics investigations of troponin in the presence of other thin filament proteins would further reveal the dynamic behavior of this sensor system and we plan to pursue this direction in the future. </plain></SENT>
