Although individual molecules can be promiscuous in terms of their contribution to function, molecular functions emerge from the specific interactions of molecules giving rise to modular organisation. As functions often derive from a range of mechanisms, we demonstrate that they are best studied using networks derived from different sources. Implementing a graph partitioning algorithm we identify subnetworks in yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI), genetic interaction and gene co-regulation networks. Among these subnetworks we identify cohesive subgraphs that we expect to represent functional modules in the different data types. We demonstrate significant overlap between the subgraphs generated from the different data types and show these overlaps can represent related functions as represented by the Gene Ontology (GO). Next, we investigate the correspondence between our subgraphs and the Gene Ontology. This revealed varying degrees of coverage of the biological process, molecular function and cellular component ontologies, dependent on the data type. For example, subgraphs from the PPI show enrichment for 84%, 58% and 93% of annotated GO terms, respectively. Integrating the interaction data into a combined network increases the coverage of GO. Furthermore, the different annotation types of GO are not predominantly associated with one of the interaction data types. Collectively our results demonstrate that successful capture of functional relationships by network data depends on both the specific biological function being characterised and the type of network data being used. We identify functions that require integrated information to be accurately represented, demonstrating the limitations of individual data types. Combining interaction subnetworks across data types is therefore essential for fully understanding the complex and emergent nature of biological function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JIM was funded by a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) CASE studentship with industry partner Pfizer and RMA by a BBSRC studentship.

In terms of molecular function, the field of Systems Biology is largely defined by a focus on interacting components. A level of importance set out by Hartwell and colleagues in their seminal article <xref rid="pone.0062670-Hartwell1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, which emphasised the modular nature of molecular function. In recent years networks have become the primary paradigm of representation of molecular interactions, reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0062670-Barabsi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Usually functional modules and subnetworks are assumed to be one and the same, for example, a range of graph-property based approaches have been developed that identify subnetworks in protein-protein interaction <xref rid="pone.0062670-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, metabolomic <xref rid="pone.0062670-Segre1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, gene expression <xref rid="pone.0062670-Zainudin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and genetic interaction data sets <xref rid="pone.0062670-Costanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, these analyses potentially lead to an incomplete picture of function, since function usually arises from the coordinated and highly-specific operation of molecules of different types.</p><p>When studies do attempt to integrate distinct data sets, e.g.,<xref rid="pone.0062670-Hwang1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062670-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the emphasis has for the most part been placed on reconciling data-types, predicting gene function <xref rid="pone.0062670-Xiao1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062670-Mostafavi1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> or identifying new interactions <xref rid="pone.0062670-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, as opposed to comprehensively delimiting the modules that comprise a specific unit of molecular function. For example, it has been reported that there is very limited overlap between genetic interaction and protein interaction data <xref rid="pone.0062670-Costanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, despite both being clearly linked to molecular phenotype. Although it is clear that genetic interactions are best explained by considering epistasis within and between modules <xref rid="pone.0062670-Segre1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062670-Michaut1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, an integrated understanding of molecular and cellular function remains elusive.</p><p>Biological annotation, such as provided by Gene Ontology (GO) terms <xref rid="pone.0062670-Ashburner1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, are widely used to analyse functional characteristics of different data-types. This is, in part, because GO encapsulates and describes the modular nature of biology. Annotation enrichment methods for characterising protein or gene sets are widespread <xref rid="pone.0062670-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and have also been used for determining the functions of subnetworks <xref rid="pone.0062670-Tong1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, biological annotations are, necessarily, only a proxy for true function, derived from observable traits. Given the widespread use of biological annotation to characterise function, it is imperative to ascertain both the extent and reliability of networks constructed from different data to recapitulate biological function meaningfully. Importantly, such analysis should highlight the areas of biological function best described by each data type. Furthermore, by combining different data types in a single combined network we can determine whether a deeper biological insight can be gained from the integration of multiple data types.</p><p>Here we use a graph partitioning approach combined with annotation enrichment to identify how different interaction data-types capture functional modules at the molecular level using the well characterised yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as a model. Three interaction networks were constructed using: (i) protein, (ii) genetic and (iii) gene co-regulation interaction data. In addition, a combined network was created by integrating interactions from these networks. Each network was exhaustively partitioned to identify highly connected subnetworks, that form a set of subgraphs. Based on reciprocal best hits we identify subgraphs with significant overlap between the different data types and show these overlaps can represent related functions as represented by the GO. We next investigated the relationship between the subgraphs from the different data types (and a combined network) and GO. Our results show striking differences in both the ability of networks derived from different data types to capture specific functional modules and also in the total functional space that is covered by each network. By integrating subgraphs from different networks to form new composite subnetworks, we identify more comprehensively the components of functional modules, i.e., cohesive groupings of molecules not fully defined by a single data type.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Interaction Networks and Subgraph Identification</title><p>Four interaction networks were assembled from large-scale <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> data: a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network consisting of 12,182 interactions between 3,339 genes, a genetic interaction network consisting of 42,546 interactions between 3,529 genes, a co-regulation network consisting of 3,006,725 weighted interactions between 4,358 genes, and a combined network consisting of 3,052,053 unique weighted edges between 5,489 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s004">Files S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s007">S4</xref>). Individual subgraphs isolated from connected subnetworks identified by graph partitioning, were produced for all these interaction networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s001">Figure S1</xref>). A total of 9,590, 9,227, 12,889 and 11,383 unique subgraphs were obtained from the PPI, genetic, co-regulation and combined interaction networks, respectively. These subgraphs include between 3 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0062670.e001.jpg"/></inline-formula> genes. The set of subgraphs forms a sample of the possible subnetworks at every level of granularity, hence providing an efficient basis for studying the functional organisation of the interactome from the most general to the most specific. As this method allows genes to appear in more than one subgraph from a network, we checked how often genes recur in subgraphs. We find that genes only appear in at most &#x0223c;1% of subgraphs, due to our subgraph validation and removal of identical subgraphs.</p><p>In order to validate the subgraphs we investigated their edge density, which is a measure of the number of links relative to the number of nodes present in a subgraph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The rationale is that biologically meaningful subgraphs will be more cohesive, i.e., there will be more interactions between nodes within the subgraph relative to interactions between nodes from different subgraphs. Therefore we selected only those subgraphs with significantly more interactions between nodes within a subgraph than interactions between subgraphs. We see that in the PPI and genetic networks as the subgraphs get smaller, as the network is split into more partitions, the edge density of the subgraphs increases. In the case of the co-regulation and combined networks, we define a weighted density measure that decreases with increasing subgraph size and is clearly apparent for subgraphs with &#x0003e;&#x0223c;40 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Collectively, this confirms that subgraphs of a range of sizes capture cohesive subgroups of interacting genes. We therefore surmise that this set of subgraphs, or integrated subgraphs from different networks, will correspond to biological modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Congruent Network Subgraphs</title><p>In order to ascertain whether novel functional modules can be identified by the integration of data, we determined the extent to which subgraphs from the different data types are congruent. To do this we investigated whether the partitioning of different networks had resulted in the production of pairs of subgraphs from different networks that have significantly intersecting gene sets. We term such pairs &#x0201c;congruent subgraphs&#x0201d;. By comparing subgraphs from the PPI, genetic and co-regulation networks, we identified statistically significant gene intersections and subsequent &#x0201c;best hits&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;best reciprocal hits&#x0201d; between the subgraphs of two networks (see Methods for more details). A best hit represents a significant gene intersection between two subgraphs where one subgraph best matches the other, where best match is determined using the maximal Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). A best reciprocal hit, again, represents a significant gene intersection, where both subgraphs are the best match to one another. Thus, best reciprocal hits indicate the strongest congruence between subgraphs from different networks. A summary of best hits and best reciprocal hits are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>, respectively.</p><fig id="pone-0062670-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Results from best hits analysis.</title><p>(A) Number of subgraphs from one network (named outside of the intersection) that are a best hit to a subgraph from another network (named within the intersection). (B) Number of best reciprocal hits between subgraphs from two networks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0062670.g001"/></fig><p>To obtain a high-level insight into the congruence relationships between subgraphs from different networks, we visualised best hits (and best reciprocal hits) using a network, where nodes represent subgraphs and edges represent the hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g002">Figure 2</xref>). From a total of 4669 subgraphs that are involved in a best hit with one or more subgraphs, 3689 subgraphs are involved in a best hit with just one other subgraph, while a minority of subgraphs have many more best hits; the node degree fitting a power-law distribution. A repeated topological pattern of this best hits network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g002">Figure 2</xref>) is for the subgraph of one network to be connected to a large number of subgraphs from one other network. Interestingly, there are 115 subgraphs that have a degree <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0062670.e002.jpg"/></inline-formula> (top <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0062670.e003.jpg"/></inline-formula>). These subgraphs, that we refer to as <italic>high-degree subgraphs</italic>, are a set of genes that are repeatedly identified by partitioning networks into different sized partitions. Therefore, high-degree subgraphs and their hits appear to be robust sets of highly connected genes that transcend multiple networks. We hypothesised that high-degree subgraphs might have particular functional significance. Indeed, high-degree subgraphs and the subgraphs that are their best hits (together termed <italic>high-degree neighbourhoods</italic>) are: (i) significantly more likely to be enriched for one or more GO terms and (ii) capture GO functions with significantly better accuracy than subgraphs that are not congruent, in all networks (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0062670.e004.jpg"/></inline-formula>, two-tailed Mann Whitney U test, in all cases), collectively indicating that the congruent subgraphs are more likely to be real functional modules. Furthermore this result highlights the value of integrating information between networks in order to validate network subgraphs.</p><fig id="pone-0062670-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Network of best hits between subgraphs of PPI, genetic and coregulation networks.</title><p>Nodes represent individual subgraphs with blue, red or yellow nodes corresponding to subgraphs from the PPI, genetic or co-regulation networks, respectively.

New co-enriched GO term pairs are produced by merging best reciprocal hits from each network combination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t001">Table 1</xref>).

ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows a PPI and a genetic subgraph that are best reciprocal hits, merged into a subnetwork. Several of the nodes identified by both subgraphs are clearly highly central to this subnetwork and have high node betweenness coefficients, e.g, YCL061C (MRC1), YMR048W (CSM3), YLR288C (MEC3) and YPL194W (DDC1). Furthermore several genetic interactions between these central genes also have high edge betweenness coefficients. Individually, both subgraphs are significantly enriched for genes involved in DNA replication and cell cycle control (GO:0006260 and GO:0007049). However, by combining these two subgraphs 81 new functional links are made between GO terms that are not co-enriched in subgraphs from any single network but are co-enriched when subgraphs from different networks are combined. Specifically, presence of Sir2 family genes (YOR025W and YDR191W) that are NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylases involved in cell cycle progression <xref rid="pone.0062670-Brachmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> cause the new links, such as linking NAD binding (GO:0070403) to S phase of mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000084) and DNA replication factor C complex (GO:0005663). The Sir2 family members genetically interact with several proteins that are central to the subnetwork, including YCL061C (S-phase checkpoint protein) and YMR048W (replication fork associated factor). Hence, by combining network data-types novel and biologically meaningful functional links can be identified.</p><fig id="pone-0062670-g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>A subnetwork that represents merged subgraphs that are best reciprocal hits.</title><p>This functional module characterises control of DNA replication.

Many network subgraphs consist of gene sets that are enriched for specific biological functions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref> summarises functional enrichment for subgraphs from each network, for each of the three ontologies: biological process, molecular function and cellular component. We use the percentage of all annotated terms that are enriched terms in subgraphs to represent the coverage of a particular ontology. We see that the PPI network captures functional annotations with the greatest coverage for the cellular component ontology (93%), compared to subgraphs from the genetic and co-regulation networks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). The biological process ontology is covered about the same by the different data sources (82&#x02013;83%). Interestingly, we find that the greatest coverage (over 92%) for all three ontologies is captured using a combination of data sources. MCCs, used to measure the accuracy with which subgraphs capture specific GO term annotations, were significantly different for enriched terms for different networks across all three ontologies (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum, PPI, Genetic and co-regulation all P&#x0003c;2.2&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). Combined these results indicate that the distinct network data sources have significantly different abilities to capture the biological functions represented by GO.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0062670-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>GO coverage for each network.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0062670-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0062670.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">WholeNetworks</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI (HT)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref>

Unsurprisingly, we see little enrichment in these randomised subgraphs. Subgraphs from the PPI network show the most enrichment with 17% of terms from the cellular component ontology enriched. Although this may seem high it is a large reduction in the coverage of the cellular component ontology compared to the original analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). In all other networks and ontologies the coverage of GO is reduced to &#x02264;10%. This demonstrates that it is the structure of these networks that holds the functional information and partitioning these networks results in subgraphs that represent real functions.</p><p>Our high-confidence PPI network may be prone to ascertainment bias because we only select interactions that have been reported more than once. This may favour interactions between genes that have been extensively studied. To control for this ascertainment bias we repeated the enrichment analysis using only data from high throughput experiments. We see that the coverage of the biological process ontology has been lowered from 84% to 77%, whereas the cellular component ontology is only slightly affected and the coverage of the molecular function ontology remains the same (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). Overall, we conclude that using a high-throughput PPI network does not affect the trends of our results.</p><p>In order to investigate the non-independence of GO relative to the network data types, we investigated the coverage of GO but this time using the different annotation types: inferred electronic annotations (IEAs) and non IEAs. We find that in both cases the overall coverage of GO is reduced for all data types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t004">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, when we use a subset of GO, the combined network no longer shows any greater coverage than the individual data types. Additionally, we also looked at terms enriched only in subgraphs from the combined network and identified the annotation types associated with these terms. We see that the most frequent annotation types are experimental (mutant phenotype, direct assay and genetic interaction), computational (sequence or structural similarity) and IEAs. These results suggest that no single network is overly annotated from (or used to annotate) a single annotation type and it is only when we use the entirety of GO that we see the improved performance of the combined network.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0062670-t004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>GO coverage for networks without inferred electronic annotations and using only inferred electronic annotation.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0062670-t004-4" xlink:href="pone.0062670.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">No IEA</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PPI</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Genetic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Co-regulation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Combined</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BP</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enriched terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2035</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2027</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1942</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2396</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2744</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2714</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3030</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3172</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coverage (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Average MCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.12</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MF</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enriched terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">690</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">749</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">778</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">960</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1226</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1401</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1665</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1777</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coverage (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Average MCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.16</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.14</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Enriched terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">629</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">495</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">504</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">662</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total terms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">682</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">591</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">700</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">720</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Coverage (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">91</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Average MCC</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.14</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">

Indeed, there are 28, 1,797, 5,166 and 3,848 subgraphs with no enrichment in the PPI, genetic, co-regulation and combined networks respectively. Interestingly, there are very few unknown subgraphs in the PPI network, whereas there are many in the co-regulation network. These unknown subgraphs may be erroneous localities within the networks, they may be subgraphs that represent real functions but the members are poorly annotated or they may represent functions not well described by the GO. Dutkowski <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0062670-Dutkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> have recently identified groups of genes in yeast that represent novel ontology terms not included in the GO. This result suggests that the unknown subgraphs identified in this study may represent real functional modules not accurately described by GO.</p><p>To ensure that the improved characterisation of biological function of the combined network was not an artefact of the network having the most nodes, we repeated the enrichment analysis with the common gene networks. Here, the only difference between the networks are the edges as each network contains the same nodes. We see that the coverage of GO is reduced in all networks, likely because the networks all have fewer nodes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, this trend does not affect all the networks equally as the co-regulation network has a severe reduction of GO coverage. This is likely to be caused by the different reduction of edges in these networks. Both the PPI and genetic networks retain 11 and 16% of edges in the common network respectively, whereas the co-regulation network only retains around 4%. Interestingly, we find that the combined network assembled from common nodes still has the greatest coverage of GO for all three ontologies, despite only containing 4% of edges from the original network. Furthermore, there are 156 enriched terms from the combined network subgraphs that are not enriched in the subgraph from any other network. Therefore, we conclude that the results presented for the original combined network are not affected by the number of nodes in the network and the combination of information from a variety of sources allows for the identification of areas of biological function not found by inspecting these networks individually.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Accuracy of Gene Ontology Term Enrichment by Network Subgraphs</title><p>GO terms can refer to very common functions (i.e, be assigned to a considerable fraction of all genes), or refer to specialist functions (i.e., be assigned to very few genes), or lie somewhere between these two extremes. In order to ascertain whether the functional categories enriched in subgraphs from different networks were biased towards capturing general (versus more specialist) functions, we looked at the number of subgraphs enriched for generalist and specialist terms and the accuracy of this enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We find that PPI subgraphs and subgraphs from the combined network capture functions with relatively less bias for specialist or general terms than either the genetic or co-regulation subgraphs; the genetic network subgraphs displaying a bias for capturing less specific functions at the expense of highly specialist functions, whereas an approximately opposite trait can be observed for co-regulation network subgraphs. It is clear that very general functions with a membership of over &#x0223c;100 genes are difficult to capture from any of the networks, relative to more specialist functions with fewer members. Furthermore, the accuracy with which the function is captured diminishes when the function is defined by many genes.</p><p>To further investigate the capture of distinct functional categories by network subgraphs, we visualised gene ontology terms using a Voronoi tree-mapping approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the tree maps, each cell represents a GO term, where terms of similar functions are grouped together. The maps from different networks are directly comparable with the equivalently positioned cells in each tile representing the same GO terms. The intensity of cell shading indicates the accuracy with which the GO term is captured by a network, using MCC score as the accuracy measure. Importantly, the Voronoi maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g004">Figure 4</xref>) highlight the disparity between the ability of network subgraphs to capture certain types of functional data. Cellular component annotation appears to be the easiest type of biological function to capture, using any type of network data. Conversely molecular function is more difficult to capture. This tree-mapping approach also highlights that certain functional areas within each ontology can be either successfully captured, or are difficult to capture, using the network data. In contrast, some areas are clearly shaded in all maps from the same ontology. The ability therefore of different networks to capture functional relationships, is related both to the type of data used to create the network, and also the specific function in question.</p><fig id="pone-0062670-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0062670.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>GLASS visualisation of enriched GO terms.</title><p>Each cell represents a GO term and is coloured blue, red, yellow or green if one or more subgraphs are enriched for that GO term in the PPI, genetic, co-regulation or combined networks, respectively.

From the trees on which the maps are based, we can identify distinct areas within an ontology, that are best characterised by subgraphs from a single network. Examples of such areas are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g005">Figure 5A</xref>. We can identify specific subgraphs from a single network that accurately characterise a single GO term. In the PPI network a single subgraph represents the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit cellular component term, where 28/30 members annotated with the term and a MCC of 0.94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

Therefore, the combining data-types from multiple biological networks can improve characterisation of certain biological functions, when compared to analysis of any network in isolation. Indeed, terms from the molecular function ontology are enriched with the greatest coverage by the subgraphs from the combined network (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). To give a specific example, the synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP) receptor activity molecular function term is best represented by a combined network subgraph which incorporates edges from all other networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). We have included lists of the 20 most accurately represented GO terms from each network and ontology in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s008">File S5</xref>. Ultimately, it seems that although these networks capture overlapping areas of biology, there are functional modules that are most accurately characterised by a single network. Therefore, we find that the choice of data used to generate a network can have a significant effect on the ability of that network to answer specific biological questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that the integration of subgraphs from individual networks can reveal new functional groupings. Many of the subgraphs identified from the individual data-type networks have significant overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Indeed, we find that some subgraphs are the best hits of many other subgraphs and these appear to capture GO functions very accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g002">Figure 2</xref>). By merging subgraphs from the PPI and genetic networks that are best reciprocal hits to create a new subnetwork, we find we can identify new cohesive modules that describe a particular biological function better than any subgraph from individual networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Collectively, these results show that not only can the integration of data reveal more functional information, but also the integration of individual modules from these data can reveal novel functional links.</p><p>Not surprisingly, we find different interaction data types capture different types of biological event, which can have varying degrees of contribution to a specific function. Moreover, we find differences in the characterisation of general and specialist GO terms between the networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062670.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, it appears as though subgraphs from particular networks are better suited to capturing GO terms annotated by many genes whereas subgraphs from other networks better characterise GO terms annotated by few genes. From the three networks containing a uniform type of data, biological functions are most accurately and completely captured by the PPI network (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, the molecular function ontology, which denotes enzymatic and biochemical properties of gene products, is only partially captured by PPI interactions, indicating that subgraphs that represent physical components and protein complexes contain both biochemically similar or unrelated subunits. More remarkable, however, is the almost complete extent to which PPI subgraphs captured functional annotations from both the cellular component (93%) and biological process (84%) ontologies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). The co-regulation network performed least effectively overall at capturing biological functions. This is potentially an unavoidable feature of gene expression data. As a measure of transcript abundance, gene expression data can only provide an estimate for the relative change at the level of the protein. Despite these drawbacks, the co-regulation network captures the majority of functions embodied by biological process and cellular component GO ontologies. Interestingly, the co-regulation network captures more molecular function GO terms than either the PPI or genetic networks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Genetic interactions imply a functional relationship between genes. Undeniably, these relationships have functional relevance from a organismal perspective, as they are expressed phenotypically. In a systematic study to characterise such within- and between-pathway genetic interactions in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Kelley and Ideker <xref rid="pone.0062670-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> identified that between-pathway relationships have a tendency to be better explanations for genetic interactions than within-pathway interactions. Here, the so-called &#x0201c;pathways&#x0201d; are cohesive subnetworks of proteins in the PPI network. Kelley and Ideker <xref rid="pone.0062670-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> classify genetic interactions as within-pathway or between-pathway, the former indicating a genetic interaction between elements of the same subnetwork and the latter indicating a genetic interaction between elements from a separate subnetwork. Thus, within-pathway genetic interactions are indicative of a functional PPI subnetwork, such as a protein complex. Furthermore, they identify that many between-pathway interactions link interdependent functional relationships. Between-pathway interactions thus indicate distinct functional PPI modules that collectively are essential units of a single, greater functional process. If these findings are upheld by GO annotation, genes involved in genetic interactions should always both be attributed with a given process or component annotation that captures their common cellular activity, be that either a relatively specialist or a very general function. Indeed, we show that 83% of the biological process terms and 80% of cellular component terms are captured by genetic interactions. Therefore, the interaction network derived from genetic interactions is clearly a reasonable choice of data for capturing physically interacting and process-related functions.</p><p>Our combined network differs from those of Kelley and Ideker <xref rid="pone.0062670-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, in that it is a weighted union of the PPI, genetic and co-regulation networks permitting direct comparison with the networks derived from a uniform data-type. Thus, it represents a union of both within- and between-pathway interactions. We find that in many cases this integrated view offers the most useful view of modular function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g003">Figures 3</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062670-g005">5</xref>). Moreover, the most notable aspect of the combined network is that the coverage of captured annotations is almost complete for each GO ontology. Molecular function GO annotations are more successfully depicted by combined data than by any other network we investigated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). These findings are true of networks assembled from a common set of nodes, controlling for network size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, subgraphs from the combined network assembled from common genes were enriched for 156 terms that were not enriched by subgraphs from any individual network. This suggests that the combined network is more than the sum of the three individual networks and can identify areas of biological function that are not represented in the individual networks. However, the accuracy with which these functions are captured is generally not as great as for the PPI network (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0062670-t003">Table 3</xref>). This is perhaps due to a greater level of noise in the combined network compared to the PPI network, stemming from the co-regulation and genetic interaction data. Yet it is conceivable that a more refined data integration method, involving, for example, machine-learning of real functional links, could attenuate the error rate. Clearly, by continually adding more interaction data to biological models, we will inevitably capture additional functional links. Importantly, while we have demonstrated that each one of the three frequently studied types of biological interaction - PPI, genetic and gene co-regulation - all make a valid yet distinctive contribution to a network model, combined they reveal more about the modular nature of biological function.</p><p>It is unlikely that the networks used in this study represent the complete networks in yeast. Indeed, the genetic interaction network is built from experiments on only a subset of yeast genes <xref rid="pone.0062670-Costanzo1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and all networks contain fewer genes than the &#x0223c;6000 annotated yeast genes. Therefore the improved coverage of GO and unique functional links identified from the combination of data suggests that this approach may be useful in organisms with incomplete interaction networks. Additionally, the identification of subgraphs with no known annotation is analogous to the novel terms identified in the network-extracted ontology (NeXO) <xref rid="pone.0062670-Dutkowski1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As with uncharacterised terms present in NeXO, the unknown subgraphs in this analysis may represent true functional modules that are not in the GO. Hence, the characterisation of these unknown subgraphs may prove to be a useful step in expanding the GO to encompass as yet unknown functions.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that a network derived from a single data-type is capable of defining certain areas of biological function with greater accuracy than networks from other sources. As a consequence the choice of interaction data directly influences the ability of networks to depict specific functional relationships. Certain networks are therefore better suited for studying specific biological functions. We also find that combined subnetwork data represents the greatest range of biological functions. Indeed, it appears as though the combination of interaction data may be able to characterise areas of biological function that cannot be characterised by a single network. In addition, our definition of both subgraphs derived from the combined network and congruent subgraphs are novel ways of identifying functional modules; specifically their strength is the definition of function that arises from concerted actions of diverse types of molecules and interactions. What these results collectively demonstrate is that a more complete perspective of a biological system is revealed by combining networks derived from multiple data-types. Interestingly, functional modules identified from congruent network subgraphs represent areas of biology that may only be understood through the combination of data of diverse types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Network Generation</title><p>Four interaction networks were assembled where nodes represent genes and edges represent interactions between genes:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A PPI network was assembled with physical interaction data from the BioGRID database <xref rid="pone.0062670-Stark1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

We partitioned each network until until the average size of the partitions was estimated to &#x0223c;3 nodes.</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062670.s001.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062670.s002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><p>

<bold>GO enrichment among network subgraphs.</bold> Two types of graph are shown: (i) bar plots A, B, C and D show the relative level of enrichment of GO terms pertaining to more specialist, or general functions, measured by the number of genes represented, from each network. Here, a positive value represents relative enrichment of GO terms of the given size, while a negative value represents relative lack of GO terms of the given size. (ii) Density plots E, F, G and H show overall relationship between the number of genes represented by the GO term (x-axis) and the maximum accuracy with which the term is captured by subgraphs from each network, measured using MCC (y-axis). Regions with denser shading indicate a greater number of GO terms.</p><p>(EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0062670.s003.eps"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062670.s004"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>
