<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimization of these applications requires a detailed understanding of the molecular determinants that control of coiled-coil formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although many of these determinants have been identified and characterized in great detail, a puzzling observation is that their presence does not necessarily correlate with the oligomerization state of a given coiled-coil structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, other determinants must play a key role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, we recently investigated the unrelated coiled-coil domains from GCN4, ATF1 and cortexillin-1 as model systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found that well-known trimer-specific oligomerization-state determinants, such as the distribution of isoleucine residues at heptad-repeat core positions or the trimerization motif Arg-h-x-x-h-Glu (where h = hydrophobic amino acid; x = any amino acid), switch the peptide’s topology from a dimer to a trimer only when inserted into the trigger sequence, a site indispensable for coiled-coil formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because high-resolution structural information could not be obtained for the full-length, three-stranded cortexillin-1 coiled coil, we here report the detailed biophysical and structural characterization of a shorter variant spanning the trigger sequence using circular dichroism, anatytical ultracentrifugation and x-ray crystallography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We show that the peptide forms a stable α-helical trimer in solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We further determined the crystal structure of an optimised variant at a resolution of 1.65 Å, revealing that the peptide folds into a parallel, three-stranded coiled coil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The two complemented R-IxxIE trimerization motifs and the additional hydrophobic core isoleucine residue adopt the conformations seen in other extensively characterized parallel, three-stranded coiled coils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings not only confirm the structural basis for the switch in oligomerization state from a dimer to a trimer observed for the full-length cortexillin-1 coiled-coil domain, but also provide further evidence for a general link between oligomerization-state specificity and trigger-sequence function. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As a result of its simple architecture consisting of just one type of secondary structure, the α-helical coiled coil is considered a paradigm for studies aimed at understanding the fundamental principles that govern protein stability, folding and oligomerization [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Such studies have resulted in the extensive use of coiled coils for the rational design of multi-stranded structures in applications as diverse as basic research, biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science and medicine [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, designed two- and three-stranded coiled coils were successfully used as lead molecules to target the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor-suppressor protein implicated in colorectal cancers and to inhibit HIV infection, respectively [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the factors that control coiled-coil folding and oligomerization are not yet well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Amongst such factors, “trigger” sequences are known to play an important role in coiled-coil formation [5]–[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>They comprise short, distinct amino-acid sequences, many of which fold into moderately stable monomeric α-helices prior to the formation of coiled-coil structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the function of a trigger sequence is to present key residues in a coiled coil-like conformation, which serves as a scaffold for the recognition and in-register alignment of partner helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Interacting helices then “zip up” along the molecule to form a stable coiled-coil structure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Several determinants that control the oligomerization state of coiled coils have been identified and studied in great detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Major roles are played by the specific placement of hydrophobic core residues, in particular isoleucine and leucine, and their distribution generally correlates well with the oligomerization state of coiled coils [11]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>An accumulation of isoleucine and leucine residues at the heptad repeat a and d core positions, respectively, favors the formation of dimers whereas the reverse arrangement results in tetrameric structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a more even distribution of isoleucine at both the a and d positions facilitates trimer formation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Interhelical interactions between side chains of residues at the e and g positions as well as the packing of these amino acids against the hydrophobic a and d core residues also contribute significantly to oligomerization-state specificity of coiled coils [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This is exemplified by the trimerization motif Arg(g)-h(a)-x-x-h(d)-Glu(e) (denoted R-hxxhE where h(a) = Ile, Leu, Val, Met; h(d) = Leu, Ile, Val; x = any amino acid residue) that specifies a three-stranded, parallel topology of coiled-coil domains [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The trimerization driving force of the motif can be explained by optimal side chain–side chain interactions whereby the strictly conserved arginine and glutamate residues form a distinct, bifurcated, interhelical salt-bridge network and participate in the formation of the hydrophobic core by establishing tight packing interactions to the neighbouring residues at the a and d positions through their aliphatic moieties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An open issue is that the presence of a specific oligomerization-state determinant frequently does not correlate with the corresponding coiled-coil topology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Although the trimerization motif R-hxxhE is predominantly found in protein families harboring parallel, three-stranded coiled-coil domains, it is also present in some dimers and antiparallel trimers [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We have recently addressed this issue and identified a general link between coiled-coil oligomerization-state specificity and trigger-sequence function [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>By using the archetype coiled-coil domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 as a model system, we showed that trimer-specific oligomerization-state determinants such as the trimerization motif or isoleucine residues at the heptad-repeat a and d positions switch the peptide’s topology from a dimer to a trimer only when inserted into the trigger sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We successfully confirmed our results in two other, unrelated coiled-coil dimers, ATF1 and cortexillin-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Because of its substantial size of 18 continuous heptad repeats, we used a combination of trimer-specific determinants to switch the cortexillin-1 coiled coil from a dimer to a trimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we rationally substituted residues to complement two ideal trimerizer motifs of the type R-IxxIE and introduced one additional hydrophobic core isoleucine residue in the trigger sequence of the cortexillin-1 coiled coil (referred to as Cort-Ir-M1; Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These substitutions were designed to span the entire trigger sequence [14]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>A well-documented example is the application of a coiled coil-based strategy for the investigation of the activation mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic transmembrane receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>These studies have shown that dimerization is not always sufficient to induce autophosphorylation and that additional conformational changes such as, for example, rotation of the kinase domains relative to each other are required for activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>A coiled-coil based approach has been used to test the dimerization-rotation model for several homodimeric proteins (for a representative example, see [30]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Typically, the extracellular domain of a given receptor is replaced by the short dimeric coiled coil of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Put3 and fused to its transmembrane domain and intracellular domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>By removing residues of the transmembrane domain at the junction to the coiled coil, designed variants with seven different rotational conformations of the cytosolic domains relative to each other were generated by imposing the Put3 heptad-repeat pattern [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>It should also be noted that the coiled coil contains a trimerization motif of the type R-LDALE, which is a strong determinant of specific trimer formation in such short coiled coils [14]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
