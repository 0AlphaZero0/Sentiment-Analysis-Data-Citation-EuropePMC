</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Brain metastases affect up to 30% of patients with cancer.[56] A 2002 population-based study in the Netherlands found that 8.5% of cancer patients developed brain metastases.[65] This latter study showed that the 5-year cumulative incidence of brain metastases was approximately 16%, 10%, 7%, 5%, and 1% for patients with lung cancer, renal cell cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal carcinoma, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These incidence estimates for specific pathologies can be applied to estimates of new cancer cases in the United States for 2010 to yield an estimate of approximately 60,000-70,000 yearly cases of brain metastases.[34] However, if autopsy-based incidence figures are used, the expected number of cases of brain metastases may be as high as 170,000 per year.[35] Barnholz-Sloan et al.[9] calculated the population-based incidence of brain metastases within the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, 16,210 patients were found to have brain metastases, representing 9.6% of all lung, melanoma, breast, renal, and colorectal cancer patients diagnosed from 1973 to 2001.[9] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>More than 80% of brain metastases are detected after the primary tumor has been diagnosed (metachronous metastases) and less frequently, they are the first manifestation of disease or are diagnosed at the same time as the primary tumor (synchronous metastases). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis of the primary tumor to the onset of neurologic symptoms is approximately 12 months, ranging from 3 months in the setting of lung adenocarcinoma to 53 months in breast cancer.[64] Brain metastases are symptomatic at some point in 67% of patients.[76] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Some types of primary cancer have a predilection for spread to the central nervous system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, the reported percentage of cases of each primary type that metastasizes to the brain varies considerably. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Lassman and De Angelis[43] reviewed nine studies and found the following variation in reported percentages of patients developing brain metastases for specific primary histologies: 18-64% (lung cancer), 2-21% (breast cancer), 2-12% (colorectal cancer), 4-16% (melanoma), 1-8% (kidney), 1-10% (thyroid), and 1-18% (unknown primary). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of brain metastases was 6-24% in five cited studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Cancer patients with brain metastases present with significant neurologic, cognitive, and emotional difficulties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of brain metastases was traditionally considered to represent end-stage disease and indicative of a turning point from curative treatment to palliative management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, progress in systemic therapy is enabling patients with cancer to live longer after diagnosis of brain metastases, which has focused attention on the long-term sequelae of treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disease, such as somnolence, fatigue, depression, and complaints of âmental slownessâ and âmemory problems.â Secondary effects related to neurocognition have come under scrutiny because of physician and patient desires to enhance quality of life (QoL) during and after cancer therapy.[49] Current trials and those being planned primarily focus on identifying the best treatment approaches for patients with multiple (&gt;4 brain metastases, arbitrarily defined) and treatment approaches that can either prevent, minimize, or treat cognitive sequelae associated with brain metastases treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These topics will be briefly discussed below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><sec id="sec1-2"><title><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>WHOLE-BRAIN RADIATION THERAPY </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Almost half a century ago, in the absence of any effective therapy or brain imaging tools, the majority of patients with brain metastases presented with significant neurologic symptoms or increase in intracranial pressure and symptoms consequential to this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although no contemporary studies of observation alone exist, older data suggest that these patients in general could be expected to live approximately a month, and the use of steroids to relieve edema and mass effect could lengthen survival to about 2 months.[14] A series of clinical trials, primarily led by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) in the 1960s, suggested that the use of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) could lengthen median survival to about 4 months, and a considerable amount of clinical research effort was directed toward testing various dose-fractionation schemes, none of which was found to be superior to any other scheme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This lack of a dose-effect relationship was explained on the basis of two factors: The dose of WBRT was always subtherapeutic, given the inherent sensitivity of the brain to late radiation toxicity, and therefore, almost half of all patients continued to succumb to intracranial disease progression; and ineffective systemic therapies resulted in absence of extracranial disease control, which resulted in the demise of the other half of this group of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This observation was not surprising, given that almost half of all patients with brain metastases have lung cancer as the underlying disease, which was effectively untreatable with chemotherapy until the advent of the platinoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Consequently, WBRT became the modality of choice, and although various schedules are in use, the schedules of 30 Gy in 10 fractions and 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions are most commonly used and balance the need to deliver modest dose of radiotherapy in a short period of time.[1415] However, no modern trial compared the best supportive care with WBRT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The Medical Research Council has recently initiated a large randomized trial of corticosteroids/best supportive care alone compared with the same treatment plus WBRT in patients with primary nonsmall cell lung cancer and brain metastases.[21] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>WBRT provides effective symptom relief in the majority of cases.[22] Although symptom response rates after WBRT vary, complete or partial responses have been documented in 43-64% of patients as early as week 2 in randomized controlled studies conducted by RTOG.[14313952] Recently, various groups have reported responses in the same rangeâin 38% of patients after 30 Gy WBRT;[2] symptomatic relief after â¥25 Gy in 66%, allowing corticosteroid dose reduction;[74] and radiographic responses in comparable proportions of patients.[55] WBRT-induced tumor reductions correlated with better survival and cognitive function preservation in a cohort of 135 patients from a phase III trial of WBRT with a sensitizing agent motexafin gadolinium.[44] Previous RTOG data suggest that patients with controlled brain metastases after WBRT tend to experience stable mini-mental status examination (MMSE) scores, whereas those with uncontrolled lesions experienced an average decrease of 6 point at 3 months.[63] Of the survivors at 6 months from the WBRT arm of the randomized RTOG radiosurgery trial, 40% experienced improvement in mental status, and 45% experienced a decreased need for corticosteroids.[1] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although the median survival of 4 months has become a widely quoted statistic, and for the most part remains true even today, there is clear recognition that not all patients with brain metastases have equivalently poor survival outcome, and a small but significant minority live for a longer period of time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used prognostic system is the RTOG Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) classification.[27] Gaspar et al.[27] performed RPA to generate regression prognostic trees of 1200 patients from three consecutive RTOG trials conducted between 1979 and 1993, which tested several different WBRT fractionation schemes and radiation sensitizers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This classification scheme stratifies patients on the basis of three prognostic categories (RPA classes 1, 2, and 3, with a higher class indicating a worse prognosis) according to age at diagnosis, absence or presence of extracranial metastases, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, and status of the primary cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>On the basis of this analysis, the median survival of patients with brain metastases ranges from 2.3 to 7.1 months, prompting the debate regarding whether the patients in at least the best-prognosis category should or should not be treated with more aggressive therapies to control intracranial disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>At the core of the debate was the recognition that WBRT produced only a modest rate of intracranial disease control and that, too, for a limited duration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>For example, Nieder et al.[54] have shown that, with WBRT to 30 Gy, few lesions larger than 1 cm3 are locally controlled after one year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In 1990, Patchell et al.[59] reported on a seminal trial, randomly assigning patients with a single brain metastasis and KPS â¥70 to WBRT with biopsy versus surgical resection, and although relatively small (N = 48), this trial changed practice because patients with a single brain metastasis experienced improved survival (median survival, 40 vs. 15 weeks for resection vs. biopsy), superior local control (80% vs. 48%), and lengthening of functional independence as defined by the maintenance of KPS greater than 70 (38 vs. 8 weeks). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The clear lesson from this trial was that there are indeed some patients with brain metastases for whom enhanced intracranial disease control translates into a survival and QoL advantage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In part to better identify the cohort with improved prognosis, a more recent analysis (and more relevant to contemporary clinical practice) of the RTOG database of brain metastases led to the development of a revised prognostic scale â graded prognostic assessment (GPA).[71] Although analysis of the RTOG RPA database showed the status of the primary cancer to be prognostic, the RTOG GPA analysis showed the number of metastatic lesions (one, two, or three, or more than three) to be prognostic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Neither system suggested that the type of primary tumor influences outcomes when all brain metastases patients were analyzed in aggregate, however, when stratified by primary histology, marked survival differences emerged leading to the creation of diagnosis-specific GPA (DS-GPA) [Table 1].[72] Unfortunately, even the DS-GPA (and other prognostic indexes) do not consider the specific molecular biology of various tumors (e.g., patients with melanoma tumors bearing the BRAF V600E mutation tend to respond to therapy better and live longer than those without the mutation).[26] In general, patients with KPS &gt;70 and limited (or stable) systemic disease tend to live longer with up to 30% survival being reported at one year.[66] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>They also argue that increased CNS tumor burden and failure of local and regional control contribute to cognitive decline and that the increased need for salvage therapy in patients not treated with upfront WBRT adversely affects QoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Conversely, opponents of this strategy argue that improved CNS tumor control does not appear to increase overall survival time, and that routine use of initial WBRT limits therapeutic options at the time of recurrence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the limited available evidence suggests that upfront WBRT might adversely affect neurocognition, late toxicity that patients wish to avoid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>There remains considerable interest but scant data regarding neurocognitive effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Acute side effects of WBRT include common effects (occurring in &gt;50% of patients) such as alopecia, fatigue, and scalp erythema and less common effects (occurring in &lt;20% of patients) such as otitis externa, impaired sense of taste, nausea, and headache. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In 1989, Lindquist et al.[45] reported the first case of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastasis, in a patient treated for a cerebral hypernephroma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>By the mid-1990s numerous reports of SRS alone or following WBRT had been published, and strong opinions developed regarding selection criteria for patients treated with WBRT, SRS, or both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Some practitioners adopted formulaic recommendations based on tumor size, KPS, age, status of extracranial disease, and number of brain metastases while giving no formulaic weight to potential brain toxicity.[24] Others used KPS together with a strict cut-off limit on the number of brain metastases that could be treated with SRS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Yet others adopted a less rigid approach that allows SRS for almost any number of targets, depending in a flexible manner on tumor location, degree of edema, likelihood of clinical complications, etc., Ideally, one might have hoped that published guidelines and editorials based mainly on interpretations of Phase III studies dealing with 1-4 brain metastases would lead to unanimity among experts regarding treatment recommendations for 1-4 brain metastases, and, by extrapolation, recommendations for patients with &gt;4 brain metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>For &gt;4 brain metastases, WBRT remains the standard of care for some physicians despite the lack of randomized trials comparing WBRT to SRS, despite the relative lack of detailed outcome data for WBRT (other than overall survival and clinical response), and despite the small but favorable literature on SRS for multiple metastases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Some physicians recommend WBRT for &gt;4 brain metastases, whereas others recommend SRS alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This controversy is related to the controversy surrounding treatment of â¤4 brain metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Physicians who favor combined therapy (SRS+WBRT) for â¤4 metastases cite the widely accepted Phase III finding that brain control with combined therapy is significantly better than with SRS alone or WBRT alone.[4173738] Physicians who favor SRS alone cite the Phase III finding that risk of neurocognitive deficit is doubled with the addition of WBRT to SRS.[17] Whether SRS is used alone or combined with WBRT, these studies lend strong support for SRS, at least as a component of management; they lend little support for WBRT alone for patients meeting Phase III selection criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This suggests that SRS is underutilized.[30] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Most physicians recognize that WBRT for brain metastases provides improved survival and symptom relief compared with observation or corticosteroids even if the degree of benefit relative to number of brain metastases is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, given the lack of Phase III outcomes data supporting WBRT alone as the best currently available alternative for â¤4 brain metastases, it seems counterintuitive to blindly favor WBRT alone as the best currently available alternative for &gt;4 brain metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Those who favor WBRT over SRS argue (1) that WBRT prevents some of the distant brain metastases that would otherwise develop after SRS alone;[4] (2) that brain recurrences after initial SRS alone are associated with a high rate of clinical neurological deficits;[62] (3) that there are methodological flaws[47] associated with the Phase III finding that SRS-alone patients fare better than SRS+WBRT patients on Hopkins verbal learning tests;[4] and (4) that salvage therapy, widely known to be more frequently required in SRS-alone patients, could be less effective than initial therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Physicians who favor SRS alone have several counter arguments: (1) they cite the Phase III findings of Chang[17] that although the addition of WBRT decreases distant brain failure compared with SRS alone, the addition of WBRT doubles the risk for significant verbal learning and memory deficits at 4 months; (2) they argue that the finding of Ayoma et al.[3] that the addition of WBRT to SRS leads to a significantly longer time to MMSE decline is based on the flawed assumption[50] that MMSE is an adequate measure of neurocognitive function changes related to radiation, and they further note that posttherapy leukoencephalopathy was seen on MRI in some patients in the combined arm and in no patients in the SRS-alone arm;[3] (3) they question Dr. Regine's conclusion that brain recurrences after SRS alone are associated with a high rate of neurologic deficits[62] since his reported rate of serious neurologic complications affecting language, memory, cranial nerve, gait, and motor function is far higher than that reported by other authors, which may reflect unfortunate target selection; (4) they believe the acknowledged brain control advantages of SRS+WBRT are not outweighed by the acknowledged side effects of WBRT[486973] side effects, which have motivated proponents of WBRT to develop IMRT-based hippocampal-sparing WBRT techniques for multiple metastases;[2861] and (5) they argue that salvage SRS, although needed more frequently in patients treated initially with SRS alone rather than with combined therapy, is safe, efficient, and effective, even for &gt;4 brain metastases.[46] It is further argued that the four metastasis limit for SRS techniques is a historical relic reflecting technological and practical limitations of early SRS technology, limitations which have since been overcome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Given the state of this controversy, the majority of patients in our own catchment area prefer SRS alone for &gt;4 metastases to avoid hair loss and to minimize fears of WBRT-related neurocognitive deficits, and because they prefer a one-day rather than a multi-week procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Additionally, SRS patients (and their physicians) often express the desire to minimize interruptions in systemic therapy, leading them to prefer SRS treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>For many physicians who favor SRS alone for 1-4 brain metastases, the recommendation for SRS for &gt;4 brain metastases seems reasonable, especially when they are committed to obtaining frequent follow-up exams and providing salvage therapy as needed, as they do for patients with â¤4 metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>That recommendation has been supported by the development of commercial radiosurgery apparatus that is capable of treating a large number of brain metastases, so that physicians using currently available apparatus are faced with few technical limitations in the number of lesions that can be treated with SRS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Our own clinical experience suggests that treating a large number of lesions is safe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, physicians should be mindful that normal tissue dose increases with number of tumors treated with SRS, and that normal tissue dose is apparatus-dependent.[46] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>There are now several trials that directly compare SRS and WBRT in patients with 4+ brain metastases: (1) A University of California, San Francico (UCSF)-led multi-institutional trial evaluating neurocognitive outcomes in patients with 5+ brain metastases treated with SRS or WBRT (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01731704) and (2) MD Anderson phase III trials comparing SRS versus WBRT in patients with 1-10 brain metastases from melanoma and nonmelanoma primary cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01644591 and NCT01592968). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>These trials should inform about cognitive outcomes related to brain irradiation and to compare the relative effectives of two different approaches to brain metastases treatment. </plain></SENT>
