</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Not much is known about the molecular and functional features of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in rabbits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this, we derived and characterized 2 types of rabbit PSCs from the same breed of New Zealand White rabbits: 4 lines of embryonic stem cells (rbESCs), and 3 lines of induced PSCs (rbiPSCs) that were obtained by reprogramming adult skin fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>All cell lines required fibroblast growth factor 2 for their growth and proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>All rbESC lines showed molecular and functional properties typically associated with primed pluripotency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle of rbESCs had a prolonged G1 phase and a DNA damage checkpoint before entry into the S phase, which are the 2 features typically associated with the somatic cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the rbiPSC lines exhibited some characteristics of naïve pluripotency, including resistance to single-cell dissociation by trypsin, robust activity of the distal enhancer of the mouse Oct4 gene, and expression of naïve pluripotency-specific genes, as defined in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to gene expression profiles, rbiPSCs were closer to the rabbit inner cell mass (ICM) than rbESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rbiPSCs were capable of colonizing the ICM after aggregation with morulas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that rbiPSCs self-renew in an intermediate state between naïve and primed pluripotency, which represents a key step toward the generation of bona fide naïve PSC lines in rabbits. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can exist in two morphologically, molecularly and functionally distinct pluripotent states, designated as the naïve and primed states (Nichols and Smith, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The first rabbit pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines were produced from New Zealand White rabbit blastocysts in the form of embryonic stem cells [rabbit ESCs (rbESCs)] (Fang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In their undifferentiated state, rbESCs required both fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and growth factors of the transforming growth factor (TGF) β family (activin, nodal) for self-renewal (Wang et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results were confirmed in another study, which showed that activin/nodal signaling through Smad2/3 activation was necessary for maintaining the pluripotent status of rbESCs (Honda et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These rbESCs did not colonize rabbit embryos after being injected into blastocysts (Honda et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Honda et al. also established rabbit induced PSC lines [rabbit iPSCs (rbiPSCs)] from adult liver and stomach cells (Honda et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Similar to rbESCs, rbiPSCs are dependent on FGF2 for self-renewal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rbESCs and rbiPSCs seemed to exhibit the cardinal feature of primed pluripotency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, this conclusion should be moderated because none of these studies evaluated these cell lines for other criteria that demarcate naïve and primed pluripotency; moreover, these studies did not compared these cell lines with rabbit inner cell mass (ICM) cells and PSCs from other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the status of rbESCs and rbiPSCs is yet to be thoroughly evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In our study, we compared rbESCs and rbiPSCs at both molecular and functional levels and concluded that (i) rbESCs do not exhibit all the characteristic features of pluripotency and (ii) rbiPSCs exhibit some characteristic features of naïve pluripotency. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four ICMs isolated from 52 blastocysts by immunosurgery were plated on feeder cells in rbESC medium supplemented with FGF2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these ICMs could form outgrowths, of which 4 produced a population of highly proliferating cells that could be routinely passaged more than 40 times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These rbESC lines – designated rbES-4, rbES-8, rbES-18 and rbES-19 – formed flattened colonies of compact cells (Fig. 1A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.20134242/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1A</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>They were passaged every 3 days after collagenase II treatment of the colonies, followed by gentle dissociation into small clumps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>All attempts to passage these cell lines after trypsinization into single-cell suspensions resulted in extensive differentiation and apoptosis (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>All the 4 lines were positive for alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 1B; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.20134242/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1A</ext-link>) and were strictly dependent on FGF2 for self-renewal, as determined by their altered morphology after FGF2 withdrawal for 24 h (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Conventional Giemsa staining showed a normal chromosome number in all the selected lines (&gt;50 metaphase spreads analyzed: 42XY) (Fig. 1D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.20134242/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S1A</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For rbES-18 line, the cells were karyotyped using G-banding, and normal chromosome complements were observed in the 4 analyzed metaphase spreads (Fig. 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Immunolabeling showed that all the 4 lines expressed Oct4 in virtually every cell in the respective populations (Fig. 1F; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.20134242/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S3</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>All the 4 cell lines could undergo in vitro differentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs) (Fig. 1H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Differentiation was accompanied by the rapid loss of Nanog and Oct4 expression and upregulation of the ectodermal marker Nestin and endodermal marker Hnf3β. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The mesodermal marker Flk1 was expressed at robust levels in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>All the 4 rbESC lines could induce teratomas after being injected under the kidney capsules in SCID mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>All teratomas contained derivatives of the 3 embryonic germ layers (Fig. 1I,J; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bio.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/bio.20134242/-/DC1">supplementary material Fig. S2A</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Using the molecular and functional criteria that characterize pluripotency in rodents and primates, we demonstrated that rbESCs and rbiPSCs show some key differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>First, similar to mECSs, rbiPSCs are resistant to trypsinization to single-cell suspensions, a procedure that induces extensive cell death and differentiation when applied to rbESCs, mouse EpiSCs (Tesar et al., 2007), and primate ESCs (Wianny et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Second, similar to mESCs, rbiPSCs express elevated levels of E-cadherin, whereas rbESCs express both E- and N-cadherins similar to mouse EpiSCs and primate ESCs (Tesar et al., 2007; Hawkins et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Third, the cell cycle of rbESCs had a longer G1 phase than the S and G2 phases and similar to somatic cells, they undergo growth arrest in the G1 phase after DNA damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This is in sharp contrast to the SSEA1+ rbiPSCs as well as to all mouse and primate PSCs examined until date, which have a relatively short G1 phase and lack a DNA damage checkpoint in the G1 phase (Aladjem et al., 1998; Hong and Stambrook, 2004; Fluckiger et al., 2006; Filipczyk et al., 2007; Momcilovic et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Fourth, the CR4 element of the mouse Oct4 DE exhibits a more robust activity in rbiPSCs than in rbESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>High CR4 element activity is observed in mESCs, whereas low activity is observed in mouse EpiSCs (Tesar et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Fifth, the Oct4 promoter is less methylated in the rbiPSCs than in the rbESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Sixth, rbESCs and rbiPSCs show distinct gene expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>We identified 14 genes whose activity is different between rbiPSCs and rbESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Similar to that in mESCs, Essrb, Klf4, Piwil2, Cdh1, Dazl, and Pecam1 are strongly expressed in rbiPSCs; however, they are expressed at low levels in rbESCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Last, based on the expression of the 22 selected genes, rbiPSC lines are the closest to rabbit ICM, whereas the profiles of all rbESC lines are the farthest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Taken together, it can be concluded that rbiPSCs show many characteristic features of naïve pluripotency as defined in rodents, i.e. resistance to single-cell dissociation, no expression of N-cadherin, robust activity of the distal enhancer of mouse Oct4, and robust expression of ICM-specific markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However, rbiPSCs do not show all the attributes of naïve pluripotency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>For instance, they exploit FGF2 signaling for self-renewal, an attribute of primed pluripotency (Nichols and Smith, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In addition, they do not express all the molecular markers of naïve pluripotency, including Rex1, Tbx3, Gbx2, Fgf4, and Dax1 (Tesar et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they show a reduced capacity to colonize the ICM after injection into rabbit blastocysts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we propose that rbiPSCs self-renew in an intermediate state between naïve and primed pluripotency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Such an intermediate state may resemble the intermediate epiblast stem cells (IESCs) recently described in the mouse (Chang and Li, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Like IESCs, rbiPSCs express Rex1 (naïve pluripotency marker) and Otx2 (primed pluripotency marker) at low levels, and express Pecam1 (naïve pluripotency marker) and Pitx2 (primed pluripotency marker) at high levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both rbiPSCs and IESCs can colonize the ICM after aggregation with morulas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>In the case of IESCs, the IESC-derived ICM cells failed to contribute to post-implantation development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In the case of rbiPSCs, we could not address this question because the morula aggregation technique requires removal of the mucin coat, which prevents embryo implantation into the uterus after transfer to surrogates (Murakami and Imai, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>However, the growth requirements of IESCs and rbiPSCs seem different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>IESCs, which grow on gelatin, respond either to LIF or to activin to self-renew in the undifferentiate state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>By contrast rbiPSCs grow on feeders and are strictly dependent on FGF2 signalling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the possibility remains that rbiPSCs could also be dependent on LIF produced by feeder cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>We have shown that rbESCs do not show all the attributes of pluripotent stem cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In particular, they have a DNA damage checkpoint in the G1 phase like somatic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>It is generally assumed that shortening the G1 phase sustains the pluripotent state by restricting the window of opportunity for differentiation cues (Mummery et al., 1987; Burdon et al., 2002; Sela et al., 2012; Coronado et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In bona fide pluripotent stem cells, the lack of a DNA damage checkpoint in G1 might further reduce this window by preventing growth arrest at a critical point for self-renewal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Thus, rbESCs lack some key features of the pluripotent cell cycle, which might explain why they exhibit such a low proliferation rate and high spontaneous differentiation rate than rbiPSCs and primate ESCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>To conclude, we have reported the first PSC lines in a non-rodent species that show characteristics of naïve pluripotency. </plain></SENT>
