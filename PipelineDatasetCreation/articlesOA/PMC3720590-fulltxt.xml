<italic>Mycoplasma bovis</italic> (<italic>M. bovis</italic>) is an important pathogen that causes various bovine diseases, such as mastitis in cows and pneumonia in calves. The surface proteins are generally thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of this organism. We screened the entire genome of <italic>M. bovis</italic> Hubei-1 and discovered a gene named <italic>vpmaX</italic> that encodes the 25 kDa variable surface lipoprotein A (VpmaX). Sequence analysis revealed that VpmaX contains several repetitive units and a typical bacterial lipoprotein signal sequence. The <italic>vpmaX</italic> gene was cloned and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> to obtain recombinant VpmaX (rVpmaX). Western blot analysis using a rabbit antibody against rVpmaX demonstrated that VpmaX is a membrane protein. Immunostaining visualized via confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that rVpmaX was able to adhere to embryonic bovine lung cells (EBL), and this was also confirmed by a sandwich ELISA. In summary, a surface-localized adhesion protein was identified in <italic>M. bovis</italic> Hubei-1.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding: National Natural Science Foundations of China, No 31072131.

A flat-bottom 96-well ELISA plate (Jet Biofil, Guangzhou, China) was coated with EBL cell membrane or cytosolic protein fractions and blocked with bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-BSA). For the adhesion assay, the rVpmaX protein was serially diluted with PBST and applied to either coated or blank plates. For the adhesion inhibition assay, rVpmaX was incubated with rabbit anti-rVpmaX serum at different dilutions before interacting with the coated proteins. After incubating for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, unbound proteins were removed by washing, and the interaction between proteins was evaluated by adding rabbit anti-rVpmaX serum and goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). The absorbance was read at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The test was repeated three times.

<italic>M. bovis</italic> is the causative agent of chronic pneumonia in feedlot cattle and dairy calves <xref rid="pone.0069644-Maunsell1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Due to the frustrating result of antibiotic therapy in its treatment, this organism causes substantial economic losses for the cattle industry worldwide. It has been fifty-two years since the identification of this microbe <xref rid="pone.0069644-Hale1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but its pathogenesis is still unclear, mainly because the research techniques available for this organism are limited. Because adhesion to susceptible host cells is a prerequisite for colonization and infection for many bacteria, current research is focused on the adhesion component of mycoplasma. Vsps in the <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain PG45 was confirmed to be involved in <italic>M. bovis</italic> cytoadhesion to host cells <xref rid="pone.0069644-Sachse1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069644-Sachse2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Moreover, as immunodominant lipoproteins in <italic>M. bovis</italic>, Vsps underwent high-frequency phase and size variations during natural infection <xref rid="pone.0069644-Rosengarten1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and have therefore attracted the most interest in <italic>M. bovis</italic> research.</p><p>The Vsps gene family has been reported to be a characteristic region in <italic>M. bovis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0069644-Lysnyansky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and was reported to be completely deleted in the <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain Hubei-1 <xref rid="pone.0069644-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, our study identified a surface protein in <italic>M. bovis</italic> Hubei-1, the VpmaX, that contains some traits similar to those of the Vsp proteins in PG45. First, it has seven short repetitive units of four aa and three long repetitive sequences comprising sixteen aa. Research in <italic>M. pulmonis</italic> revealed that a long Vsa protein with many tandem repeats (35 or 40 repeats) contributed less to adhesion than a short Vsa containing fewer repeats (3, 4, or 5 repeats) <xref rid="pone.0069644-Bolland1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that VpmaX would have a substantial ability to adhere host cells. This was affirmed by the CLSM and sandwich ELISA assay. Second, although VpmaX possesses no conserved sequence in the N-terminal protein region and upstream DNA sequence like the Vsps family in PG45, it does have a typical lipoprotein signal sequence, which likely anchor it to the <italic>M. bovis</italic> membrane. The VpmaX localization assay confirmed our speculation that VpmaX existed in the membrane fragment of <italic>M. bovis</italic>. Finally, <italic>M. bovis</italic> VpmaX expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> displayed an abnormal migration in SDS-PAGE gel: the rVpmaX molecular weights calculated from the deduced sequence is 28 kDa, but its molecular mass according to the position of the band after SDS-PAGE is approximately 35 kDa. A similar phenomenon was also observed in PG45 VspB <xref rid="pone.0069644-Lysnyansky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, a protein of 268 aa with a predicted mass of 25 kDa that has an electrophoretic migration that suggests the product expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and in mycoplasma has a mass of 46 kDa.</p><p>A comparison between VpmaX and its counterpart in HB0801, VspX, shows that the sequences of the two proteins are identical. However, there is some variation between VpmaX and its corresponding protein in PG45, PL. This is also consistent with a previous study that high frequency of variation occurred within the products of the various <italic>vsp</italic> genes due to spontaneous insertions or deletions of repetitive units in <italic>M. bovis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0069644-Lysnyansky1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Because <italic>M. bovis</italic> Hubei-1 and HB0801 were both isolated in Hubei province, it is reasonable that the two strains contain identical protein sequences in VpmaX.</p><p>Many surface proteins in mycoplasma function as adhesions to host cells. Our study verified that recombinant VpmaX and natural VpmaX can strongly adhere to EBL cells using CLSM and sandwich ELISA. Previous research demonstrated that <italic>M. bovis</italic> Vsp antigens were constantly present in the cytoplasm of macrophages and were also present on the surfaces of epithelial cells in larger airways when cattle were experimentally infected with <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain 1067 <xref rid="pone.0069644-Hermeyer1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We observed a similar distribution of rVpmaX in EBL cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069644-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0069644-g003">Figure 3</xref> indicate that rVpmaX adhesion is pervasive on the EBL membrane and in the cytoplasm. The widespread existence of proteins in EBL cells that VpmaX can adhere to implies that <italic>M. bovis</italic> VpmaX may relate to some critical and common mechanism when <italic>M. bovis</italic> evading host body.</p><p>The variability of mycoplasma surface antigens under immune pressure has been reported for several mycoplasma species <xref rid="pone.0069644-LeGrand1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0069644-Markham1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. For example, the expression of the protein pMGA in <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> ceased when grown in broth containing an antibody against pMGA, and the organism instead expressed an antigenically unrelated new polypeptide (p82) <xref rid="pone.0069644-Markham1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We also have done some preliminary works to examine the antigenic variation of VpmaX. However, our immune pressure test <xref rid="pone.0069644-LeGrand1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> showed that <italic>M. bovis</italic> grown in broth containing anti-rVpmaX serum still expressed VpmaX, but after the fifth passage under immune pressure, the organism expressed a new protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa that reacted with the rabbit anti-rVpmaX serum. The isolation and identification of this newly observed 55 kDa protein using mass spectroscopy is still in progress. However, the persistent expression of VpmaX under immune pressure may indicate that this protein may plays an important role in the survival of <italic>M. bovis</italic> strain Hubei-1. This speculation can also be supported by the prevalence of VpmaX interacting proteins in EBL cells.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we characterized various aspects of the <italic>M. bovis</italic> Hubei-1 protein VpmaX, including the existence of repetitive units, its localization in the membrane, unusual migration in SDS-PAGE; these features are shared with Vsps in PG45 and HB0801. Furthermore, VpmaX has been confirmed to be an adhesion-related protein that is able to strongly adhere to EBL cells. The pervasive VpmaX adhesion in EBL cells suggests that this protein may play a role in some important process during <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection, which is worth further exploration. Understanding the interplay between adhesion proteins and host cells will allow for a better understanding of <italic>M. bovis</italic> infection and may facilitate its prevention.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0069644-Hale1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
