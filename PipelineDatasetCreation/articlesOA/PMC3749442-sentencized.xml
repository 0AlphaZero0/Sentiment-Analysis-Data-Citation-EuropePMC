<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The zoonotic pathogens Campylobacter coli and C. jejuni differ from each other by around 15% at the nucleotide level, corresponding to an average of nearly 40 amino acids per protein-coding gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using whole genome sequencing, we show that a single C. coli lineage, which has successfully colonized an agricultural niche, has been progressively accumulating C. jejuni DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Members of this lineage belong to two groups, the ST-828 and ST-1150 clonal complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ST-1150 complex is less frequently isolated and has undergone a substantially greater amount of introgression leading to replacement of up to 23% of the C. coli core genome as well as import of novel DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the more commonly isolated ST-828 complex bacteria have 10–11% introgressed DNA, and C. jejuni and nonagricultural C. coli lineages each have &lt;2%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the C. coli that colonize agriculture, and consequently cause most human disease, have hybrid origin, but this cross-species exchange has so far not had a substantial impact on the gene pools of either C. jejuni or nonagricultural C. coli. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bacterial genomes show great flexibility in their genome size and composition and can acquire genes encoding entire metabolic pathways from other organisms (Lawrence 1999; Ochman et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are many species that are characterized by a large and stable ‘core genome’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although DNA within the core genome can be replaced in recombination events, this is almost always with homologous DNA from another member of the same species (Fraser et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>An important evolutionary question is what underlies this stability (Doolittle &amp; Zhaxybayeva 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="?"><plain>Is the core genome in each species a coadapted unit, such that equivalent genes taken from other species will not function properly? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="?"><plain>Is each gene in the core genome adapted to the specific sets of environments that the species inhabits? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="?"><plain>Or is acquisition of DNA limited by mechanisms that prevent uptake of DNA from outside the species? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Campylobacter are Gram-negative microaerophilic epsilon proteobacteria that inhabit the intestinal tracts of birds (Waldenstrom et al. 2002; Sheppard et al. 2010a) and other animals (Rosef et al. 1983) and have some capacity to survive in the nonenteric environment (Sopwith et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>They have relatively small genomes of approximately 1.6 megabases (Parkhill et al. 2000), which limits the diversity of functions available to each organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, in common with many other bacteria, Campylobacter shows high levels of recombination (Suerbaum et al. 2001; Snipen et al. 2012), which might compensate for small genome size by providing each organism with the ability to import genes that confer adaptations to specific environments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are among the main causes of human gastroenteritis worldwide, largely because of infection of farm animals and transmission through the food chain to retail products (Sheppard et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Both species are associated with several agricultural hosts (Sheppard et al. 2010a). C. jejuni are usually more abundant in cattle and chickens, and C. coli dominates in pigs (Thakur et al. 2006). C. jejuni has also been isolated from many wild bird species (Waldenstrom et al. 2007; Colles et al. 2008), but little is known about the distribution of C. coli among wild hosts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Campylobacter-like organisms were described by Theodor Escherich in 1886 (Escherich 1886), and the genus was formally named in 1963 (Sebald &amp; Veron 1963). C. coli, identified as vibrio isolated from pig faeces (Doyle 1948), was designated as a species distinct from C. jejuni in 1973 (Veron &amp; Chatelain 1973), and this species classification has been uncontroversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, by analysing the sequence from 7 housekeeping loci from a large number of strains, we found evidence for the acquisition of substantial amounts of C. jejuni DNA by one of the three C. coli clades (Sheppard et al. 2008, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Both the correctness and implications of this finding have been debated (Cohan &amp; Koeppel 2008; Doolittle 2008; Caro-Quintero et al. 2009; Lefebure et al. 2010), and many questions remain about the patterns of introgression in the core and pan genome, and how it has influenced the evolution of these important pathogens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here, in addition to four previously published genomes, we chose 26 Campylobacter isolates from clinical, agricultural and nonagricultural sources (Tables S1 and S2, Supporting information), to encompass the known diversity based on analysis of seven housekeeping loci (Sheppard et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The genomes of the isolates were sequenced using the Illumina GA and Roche 454 platforms and assembled de novo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We performed model-based analysis of evolution of the core and pan genomes to reconstruct a history of between-species genetic exchange within the genus. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Locus names and reference sequences were defined based upon the finished genome of isolate NCTC11168 (Cabello et al. 1997; Parkhill et al. 2001; Gundogdu et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The presence of a preliminary set of orthologs was defined by identifying reciprocal best hits to 11 168 loci, with at least 70% nucleotide identity and 50% difference in alignment length using the blast algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The analysis of orthology was made for every genome, and the core genome, consisting of genes ubiquitous among isolates of the genus, was defined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Gene orthologs were aligned on a gene-by-gene basis using muscle (Edgar 2004) and then concatenated into contiguous sequence for each isolate genome including gaps for missing nucleotides (or entire genes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A phylogeny of whole genome alignments (1.53 Mbp) was reconstructed using mega (Kumar et al. 2008) version 3.1 with the Kimura 2-parameter model and neighbour-joining clustering. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The progressive mauve backbone output file was used to assign regions of each genome as either core (‘backbone’) segments, conserved among all of the genomes, or accessory (‘variable’) segments absent from at least one alignment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the multiple genome alignment was automatically analysed to identify conserved segments using a homology hidden Markov model (Treangen et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Regions where the posterior probability of sequence homology was &gt;90% using a model trained on 80% identity and tuned to the sequence composition of Campylobacter were considered to be homologous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Nonhomologous regions create alignment gaps, and those alignment gaps were used to delineate a ‘backbone’ of conserved segments among each pair of genomes by simply calling any region with &gt;20 nucleotides inserted or deleted in one genome as nonbackbone (indels &gt; 20 nt). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Pairwise backbone predictions were merged into multigenome backbone predictions using the previously described methods (Treangen et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Using this technique, the amount of core and accessory genome was determined for all the isolates and for C. jejuni and C. coli individually and the three C. coli clades separately and for subsets of isolates (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>S9, Supporting information). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a gene-by-gene alignment was extracted from bigsdb (Jolley &amp; Maiden 2010) for genes present in all the C. coli clade 1 genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>A genealogy for these alignments was estimated using clonalframe, a model-based approach to determining microevolution in bacteria (Didelot &amp; Falush 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This programme differentiates mutation and recombination events on each branch of the tree based on the density of polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Run on the C. coli clade 1 alignment, clonalframe, estimated that recombination introduced polymorphism at an average of 8% of affected sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This value is higher than the genetic diversity within C. coli clade 1 and thus corresponds to imports from the other clades and species, as well as back-recombination events replacing previously introgressed DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The programme was run with 50 000 burn-in iterations followed by 50 000 sampling iterations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>For each branch on the clonalframe genealogy, a list of homologous recombination events was extracted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Recombination events were defined as sequences of length &gt;50 bp with a probability of recombination ≥75% over the length reaching 95% in at least one site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To investigate the acquisition and loss of nonhomologous DNA, we used the model-based Bayesian method implemented in genoplast (Didelot et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>This model allows the rates of gain and loss of genetic elements to be investigated over time in individual lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A multiple alignment was produced for C. coli clade 1 genomes (excluding isolate 16) using progressive MAUVE (Darling et al. 2004, 2010), and the conserved orthologous segments and repeat elements defined the core genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Large gaps (≥500 bp) in the alignment, where one or more genomes contain a sequence absent in the other genomes, identify the position of imported DNA in the accessory genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>A binary matrix of presence/absence of genetic features of length 50 bp was constructed using the bbFilter script distributed with MAUVE. genoplast was run with default parameters using this matrix and the genealogy inferred by clonalframe as input. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The origin of homologous and nonhomologous recombination events in C. coli clade 1 genomes was determined using the blast algorithm (Altschul et al. 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A list of events identified with clonalframe and genoplast was extracted, and sequences were compared to a library database of all the C. jejuni and C. coli clade 2 and 3 genomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>For most of the genes, the C. coli isolates from the study of Lefebure et al. (2010) contain sequences similar to those found in C. jejuni, while in every case, the nonagricultural C. coli isolates in our sample harbour entirely distinct sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Even in the cases where a handful of the Lefebure et al. (2010) ST-828 complex isolates do have the distinct—and presumably ancestral—C. coli sequence, the method they employed did not detect introgression because these isolates make up only a minority of their isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>As a result, they inferred no introgression for these 15 genes, which is clearly an incorrect conclusion based on visual inspection of the neighbour-joining trees constructed using the combined sample (Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>A further limitation of the method employed by Lefebure et al. (2010) is that because phylogenies were constructed only for entire genes, they were likely to miss imports of short gene fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>The linkage model of structure uses a hidden Markov model, which can detect any tract long enough to introduce polymorphisms at several sites that are characteristic of the other species, and we observed many such imports that were much shorter than entire genes (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>While our analyses demonstrate introgression after a substantial period of little gene flow, many questions remain about its causes and adaptive consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for the increased uptake of C. jejuni DNA by C. coli lineages that are more common in agriculture (Table 2) is enhanced physical opportunity for genetic exchange associated with cocolonization of agricultural hosts by the two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the host range for nonagricultural C. coli, which include clades 2 and 3 and unintrogressed clade 1 isolates (Sheppard et al. 2010b), but it might be principally composed of reservoirs that are not colonized by C. jejuni. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>One challenge for a simple model in which recombination rates are regulated by physical proximity is the low rate with which agricultural C. jejuni have acquired C. coli DNA, although this might in part be explained by a higher frequency of C. jejuni in hosts in which they co-occur. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Given the absence of unintrogressed C. coli in food animals, it is possible to speculate that introgression may have provided key adaptations for proliferation in the agricultural niche. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Introgression has led to C. coli clade 1 having the largest pan genome (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>S9, Supporting information) and to the import of several genes involved in the transport and metabolism of L-fucose (Table 1), which has been shown to be important in colonizing hosts (Muraoka &amp; Zhang 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>There are other examples of pathogenic lineages that are proposed to have arisen after a rapid burst of genome-wide introgression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>These include Salmonella Paratyphi A and Typhi (Didelot et al. 2007) and Vibrio vulnificus (Bisharat et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>However, in Campylobacter, the genetic distance between hybridizing lineages is far greater and is comparable to that between Escherichia coli and Salmonella (Ochman &amp; Groisman 1994) or a human and a marmoset (Peng et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Whatever its adaptive benefits, the interspecies recombination that has been observed in C. coli presents a challenge to some views of how bacterial evolution proceeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that most changes in proteins occur by coevolution, with substitutions in one protein resulting in selection pressure for reciprocal changes in interacting partners (Fraser et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Recombination between divergent species would be expected to disrupt large numbers of evolved interactions and, if the genetic distance was sufficiently great, would be likely to create hybrids, or ‘hopeful monsters’ (Mayr 1970), with little chance of evolutionary success. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Here, there is an average of 40 protein coding differences between the two species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>To surmount the deleterious effects of disrupting numerous epistatic interactions, there would need to be substantial fitness advantages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Novel or extreme environments provide a setting within which hopeful monsters can be generated and proliferate because of the absence of well-adapted organisms (Rieseberg et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>There are many features that might make livestock such a habitat for bacteria that have evolved in wild hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, hopeful bacterial monsters can repair some of the most harmful disruptions to interactions of adaptive genes by subsequent homologous recombination of their interaction partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of larger numbers of isolates will allow more detailed characterization of this ongoing adaptive process and further develop our understanding of bacterial gene networks. </plain></SENT>
