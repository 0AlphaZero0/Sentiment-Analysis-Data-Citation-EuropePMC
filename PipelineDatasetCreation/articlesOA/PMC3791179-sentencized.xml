</text></title><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Legionella pneumophila (Lp) is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium that opportunistically infects human alveolar macrophages and causes a pneumonic illness known as Legionnaires’ Disease (LD) in normal and immunocompromised hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>LD is estimated to account for up to 15% of all hospital admissions for community-acquired pneumonia in North America and Europe1–5 and may also be an underreported cause of nosocomial pneumonia.6–8 Despite its epidemiologic importance, the immunologic and genetic factors that underlie human susceptibility to Lp infection remain poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The innate immune system is critical to host defenses against both extracellular and intracellular pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are central to the repertoire of innate immune receptors that recognize bacterial pathogens, including Lp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>TLR2 recognizes a number of molecular motifs on bacteria, including di-acylated and tri-acylated lipopeptides, peptidoglycan, lipotechoic acid, and GPI (glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol)-linked proteins.9–11 TLR2 signaling in response to bacterial ligands requires heterodimerization with one of two co-receptors, TLR1 or TLR6, which mediate recognition of tri-acylated or di-acylated lipoproteins, respectively.12–15 TLR2 recognizes Lp and regulates cytokine production in infected macrophages and after aerosolized in vivo infection of mice.16–19 However, the contributions of TLR2 co-receptors TLR1 and TLR6 to Lp immune recognition have not yet been defined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our current understanding of the immunopathogenesis of Legionella infection relies heavily on in vivo studies in mice and in vitro macrophage studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Human genetic studies permit study of immunologic mechanisms during natural infection, especially when coupled to functional immune studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our group and others have described common human polymorphisms that are associated with clinical susceptibility to infection and also regulate pathogen-induced immune responses by primary immune cells in vitro. 20–27 Given the central role of TLR2 in Legionella pathogenesis, we hypothesized that common genetic variants in TLR1, 2, or 6 modulate susceptibility to LD in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether TLR1 or TLR6 cooperate with TLR2 to recognize Lp and if polymorphisms in TLRs 1, 2, or 6 are associated with susceptibility to LD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To determine whether TLR2 responses to Lp are mediated through heterodimerization with TLRs 1 or 6, we measured NF-κB activity in HEK293 cells transfected with a murine TLR2 construct with or without constructs for murine TLR1 or TLR6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>HEK293 cells transfected with TLR2 plus TLR1 and stimulated with 106, 107, or 108 cfu/ml of Lp had significantly greater NF-κB activity than HEK293 cells transfected with TLR2 (T2) alone (p≤0.001, p&lt;0.005, and p&lt;0.005, respectively) (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cells transfected with TLR2 plusTLR6 also had greater activity in response to 106, 107, or 108 cfu/ml of Lp in comparison to cells expressing TLR2 alone (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.005, and p&lt;0.005, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As a control, responses to IL-1β, which stimulates NF-κB activity through the IL-1 receptor, were equally robust among cells transfected with different combinations of TLR constructs or empty vector. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To determine whether human TLR1, 2, or 6 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to legionellosis, we used a case-control study of an epidemic outbreak in The Netherlands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A description of this outbreak has previously been published28 and the clinical features of genotyped cases and controls are summarized in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 14 candidate polymorphisms, 5 in TLR1, 3 in TLR2, and 6 in TLR6 in 98 cases and 268 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Two TLR6 SNPs (rs3821985 and rs3775073) had HWE p values ≤ 0.001 and were not analyzed further. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Since TLR1 and TLR6 are contiguous genes on chromosome 4p14, we evaluated the linkage disequilibrium pattern for the 5 TLR1 and 4 TLR6 SNPs in the control population (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The majority of R2 values were &lt;0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The frequency of a single TLR6 SNP, rs5743808 (359T&gt;C), a nonsynonymous variant in the extracellular leucine rich repeat domain of the protein (encoding an isoleucine-to-threonine transition at amino acid residue 120), was greater in cases compared to controls (genotypic analysis: p= 7.9 ×10−5) (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This association remained significant after a conservative Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons (p=9.5 ×10−4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Among cases, 15% carried the C allele (had TC or CC genotype) compared to 3% of controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for LD were similar whether cases were compared to all controls (n=263) or controls without Pontiac fever (n=234) (OR of 5.83 vs. 5.17, respectively), a clinical marker of Legionella exposure (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We then compared cases to controls with serological evidence of exposure to Lp and found that the risk of LD associated with TC/CC genotypes was further enhanced when cases were compared to seropositive controls: 15% of cases had a TC or CC genotype compared to 0% of exposed, seropositive controls and 3% of all controls (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To ensure that our results were not due to population admixture, we also examined genotype frequencies for 359T&gt;C in 86 controls and 97 cases matched for age, sex and place of residence within 25 km. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Our data show that TLR6 mediates recognition of Lp and that a common polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to LD. In vitro, the presence of TLR1 or TLR6 was required for maximal TLR2-mediated responses to heat-killed Lp in transfected HEK cells. In vivo, a natural variant of human TLR6, 359T&gt;C, was associated with elevated risk of LD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Previously published work has implicated TLR2 in the mammalian innate immune response to Legionella.16–19, 35, 36 Although the majority of Gram-negative organisms have an LPS that signals through TLR4, the LPS structure of Legionella is atypical and appears to predominantly signal through TLR2.11, 16, 19, 37 In addition, the Legionella structural protein, peptidoglyan-associated lipoprotein (PAL), signals via TLR2.38 Studies of Legionella pulmonary infection in Tlr2−/−mice have shown 10 to 100-fold higher CFUs in the lung compared to wildtype counterparts17 and enhanced intracellular growth of Legionella has been shown in Tlr2-deficient murine macrophages.16 Our functional data suggests that TLR2/6 and TLR2/1 cooperate to recognize Lp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Our genetic association results further suggest that TLR6 is a genetic locus of LD susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Although we did not detect an association between TLR2 polymorphisms and LD, these results do not rule out a contribution of TLR2 variants to LD susceptibility since only three candidate SNPs in TLR2 (597T&gt;C, 1350T&gt;C, and 2258G&gt;A) were evaluated in our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Our study has several potential limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Although our results suggest an association of TLR6 with LD, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 359T&gt;C SNP is in linkage with a nearby causative variant and serves as a marker for this alternative risk locus. TLR6 is located in continuity with TLRs 1 and 10 along a 54 kb segment of chromosome 4p14 and the potential role of TLR10 variants in LD susceptibility was not evaluated in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The similar NF-κB responses of the TLR6 359T and 359C variants in response to heat-killed Lp could be explained if the 359T&gt;C polymorphism primarily modulates initial uptake or intracellular trafficking of live bacteria by the macrophage rather than NF-κB-driven cytokine responses in response to heat-killed Lp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>However, we have not evaluated this possibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>As with other genetic association studies, genotyping error can occur or confounding may exist due to the unaccounted-for effects of population stratification or ethnic admixture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We judged ethnic admixture to be unlikely to cause confounding, since &gt;95% of both cases and controls were of Caucasian Dutch background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We also included place of residence (along with age and sex) as one of the matching criteria in the original study design to control for possible population stratification and found that the association of the 359T&gt;C SNP with LD was similar whether we used the general control group (OR 5.83, p=7.9×10−5) or the smaller, matched control (OR 3.75, p=0.03) group as the comparator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Another potential weakness of this study is the relatively small number of LD cases (98 analyzed out of 188 identified in the original outbreak). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, our case sample size is larger than most outbreaks reported in the medical literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Ideally, these findings will be investigated in a future cohort of different ethnicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Few genetic association studies have addressed the role of TLR6 in infectious diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>One study reported an association of the 359T&gt;C and 745C&gt;T, among other polymorphisms, with tuberculosis in an African population.39 The TLR6 variant 745C&gt;T has a reported association with increased risk of invasive aspergillosis after stem cell transplantation.40 The mechanisms responsible for the association of TLR6 variants with these diverse pathogens --from an intracellular bacterium to an extracellular mould-- remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Several studies have investigated the role of TLR6 variants in mediating altered cytokine signaling to pathogens or pathogen motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In functional studies, 745T (249S) and the synonymous SNP 1083C have been reported to be associated with decreased whole blood IL-6 responses to bacterial lipopeptides, and SNP 1083C was additionally associated with decreased IL-6 responses to M. tuberculosis lysate and BCG.41 Other authors have demonstrated a link between TLR6, phagocytosis, and autophagy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>For example, TLR6 and 2 cooperate to recognize zymosan, a TLR2 ligand from yeast, and recruit the autophagy marker, LC3, to zymosan-containing phagosomes.42, 43 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of LD risk posed by TLR6 359T&gt;C variant (OR 5.83, dominant analysis) is greater than that posed by other polymorphisms previously associated with LD, specifically, TLR5 1174C&gt;T, TLR4 896A&gt;G, and TLR4 1196C&gt;T (ORs 0.40–2.24, Table 4).23, 24 Furthermore, we found no evidence of an interaction between the TLR6 359C allele and any of the TLR5 or TLR4 risk alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>These results support a role for human TLR6 in the immunopathogenesis of LD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>If validated in other genetic association studies of LD, one could imagine the usefulness of this SNP in outbreak settings, where individuals at highest risk could be targeted for pre-emptive therapy. </plain></SENT>
