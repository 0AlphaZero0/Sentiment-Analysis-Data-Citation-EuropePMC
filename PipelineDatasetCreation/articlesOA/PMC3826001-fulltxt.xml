CDK family is known to have a high level of structural homology, especially CDK2 shares 45% sequence identity with CDK4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The resemblance has helped spearhead research involving design of inhibitors for CDK4, mimicking the CDK2 inhibitors. CDK4 associates with D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3), phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein family members (p107, p130, pRb).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In human beings, pRb is encoded by the RB1 gene located on 13q14.1-q14.2. Phosphorylation of pRb by CDK4 inactivates pRb, causing the activation of E2F target genes, which facilitates progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, eventually leading to the condition of retinoblastoma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Developing and identifying small molecule inhibitors targeting CDK4 has been a prime area of research since past two decades. Some of the drugs that have been proven as desirable targets for cancer are flavopiridol, butyrolactone, the purine-based olomoucine and its analogues, arcyriaflavin A, and isoquinolinedione analogues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Flavopiridol, the first CDK inhibitor for human beings derived from an indigenous plant from India, demonstrated potent and specific <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of all CDKs tested (CDKs 1, 2, 4, and 7), clearly blocking the cell cycle progression at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] However, flavopiridol is not selective for CDK4. It inhibits other CDKs to almost the same extent as CDK4.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In similar lines, most CDK inhibitors suffer from low selectivity. The low selectivity of these chemical compounds may cause adverse side effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] This brings up the need for more potent and selective CDK4 inhibitors with better efficiency for the condition of retinoblastoma. Natural compounds have their advantage over chemical inhibitors by being a safer substitute and ensure lesser/no side effects. A library of 125 natural compounds was taken from Indian Plant Anticancer Compounds Database (InPACdb) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.inpacdb.org/">http://www.inpacdb.org/</ext-link>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] to test them for their efficiency as therapeutic agent for CDK4.</p><p>This study aims to find out whether linarin can be used as a potential natural inhibitor to target CDK4 in retinoblastoma using virtual screening studies</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Molecular optimization was carried out for crystal structure of CDK4 as a preparative process for docking.

The system was energy minimized by steepest decent method for 1000 steps, after which the potential energy of the system dropped from -1.25970e + 06 to -9.28789e + 05. Position restraint was performed using NVT and NPT steps that were processed as a part of equilibration phase for 100ps each, after which MD simulation was initiated to be run for 10ns. For analyzing simulation results, Xmgrace program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/</ext-link>.) was used to generate root mean square deviation (RMSD), potential energy, radius of gyration, and solvent-accessible surface graphs. RMSD graph shows a steep incline in the deviation starting from 1&#x000c5; to 3.9&#x000c5;, which stabilizes at around 3.5&#x000c5;, and it drops to a minimum of around 3&#x000c5; at 6800ps.

Each of the top five natural inhibitors were docked using semi-flexible docking following Lamarckian G.A algorithm, and generated 10 favorable conformations each at the end of every docking run. Grid box was set to dimension- 62 &#x000d7; 62 &#x000d7; 62 with coordinates of 41.734, 28.76, and 66.937. The analysis of docking results showed protein-Linarin complex to have the best binding energy and Inhibitor constant of -8.18 kJ/mol and 1.01 &#x003bc;M, respectively (as tabulated), correlating with AutoDock Vina result. The highly flexible and long side chain of Linarin contributed to its 13 rotatable bonds and high rotatable torsions. This complex was studied for interactions in the binding pocket. The residues Lys22, Lys35, His95, Asp99, Glu144, and Asn145 were involved in H-bonding interaction and Val9, Ile12, Phe31, Ala33, Asp97, Gln98, Arg101, Leu147, and Ala157 where shown to be involved in hydrophobic interactions. A comparative study was done between Linarin, Flavopiridol, and Isoquinolinedione after docking was performed, the results of which are tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The interactions involved in the active site region between the protein and these three inhibitors are individually displayed in [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">d</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Final list of shortlisted compounds as per AutoDock 4.0 validation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-4-256-g008"/></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A detailed perspective from a molecular viewpoint has been provided regarding the suitability of Linarinas, the effective inhibitor of the protein kinase, CDK4. Complying to the stringent parameters of the docking programs, a reliable binding energy of -8.9 kJ/mol was obtained on using AutoDock Vina and further validation of the result using AutoDock 4.0 gave binding energy value of -8.18 kJ/mol. Inhibitory constant value was 1.01 &#x003bc;M, better than the values shown by Flavopiridol and substituted isoquinolinedione. Furthermore, CDK4 docking interaction with Flavopiridol, substituted isoquinolinedione and Linarin at the ATP-binding were compared, wherein, the stability of interaction was observed to be better in Linarin in comparison with its counterparts. Moreover, several potential CDK4 inhibitors were observed to be Purine-based analogues and so was Linarin. Also, acd0073 (Linarin) incidentally happened to fall under the class of Flavonoids.</p><p>Flavonoids, apart from being well known for their antioxidant activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, has long been investigated for their potential as viable anti-cancer agents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Flavopiridol, the first CDK inhibitor in human beings, belonging to the family of flavonoids, was found to show activity for renal, prostate, colon, and gastric carcinomas.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Linarin sharing the same family characteristics was shown to have potency to serve as an inhibitor for human prostate cancer. Linarin has shown good sensitivity to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] The acquired results could extend its effectiveness as a reliable CDK4 inhibitor for the condition of retinoblastoma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors sincerely thank SASTRA UNIVERSITY for granting access to use LigPrep module of
