The basis for adaptation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to this specific habitat and reasons for the human predisposition to become colonized have remained largely unknown. Human nasal secretions were analyzed by metabolomics and found to contain potential nutrients in rather low amounts. No significant differences were found between <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers and non-carriers, indicating that carriage is not associated with individual differences in nutrient supply. A synthetic nasal medium (SNM3) was composed based on the metabolomics data that permits consistent growth of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates.

While the majority of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains grew well in SNM3, most of the tested coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) had major problems to multiply in SNM3 supporting the notion that CoNS are less well adapted to the nose and colonize preferentially the human skin. Global gene expression analysis revealed that, during growth in SNM3, <italic>S. aureus</italic> depends heavily on <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of methionine. Accordingly, the methionine-biosynthesis enzyme cysteine-&#x003b3;-synthase (MetI) was indispensable for growth in SNM3, and the MetI inhibitor DL-propargylglycine inhibited <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth in SNM3 but not in the presence of methionine. Of note, <italic>metI</italic> was strongly up-regulated by <italic>S. aureus</italic> in human noses, and <italic>metI</italic> mutants were strongly abrogated in their capacity to colonize the noses of cotton rats. These findings indicate that the methionine biosynthetic pathway may include promising antimicrobial targets that have previously remained unrecognized. Hence, exploring the environmental conditions facultative pathogens are exposed to during colonization can be useful for understanding niche adaptation and identifying targets for new antimicrobial strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many severe bacterial infections are caused by endogenous pathogens colonizing human body surfaces. Eradication of notorious pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> from risk patients has become an important preventive strategy.

<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a major cause of human invasive infections ranging from superficial skin and soft tissue infections to severe disseminated diseases such as sepsis and endocarditis <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Lowy1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>S. aureus</italic> is also a human commensal and part of the microbiota in healthy individuals, which facilitates its access to sterile tissues via open wounds and catheter entry sites. <italic>S. aureus</italic> can be isolated from various human body surfaces such as the pharynx, axillae and perineum but its main ecological niche and reservoir is known for long to be the human nose <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Miles1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003862-Weidenmaier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In contrast, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), such as <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, have a much lower virulence potential and use different areas of the skin as their major habitats <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Otto1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The basis of staphylococcal host and niche-specificity has remained unknown.</p><p>Analysis of nasal carriage over long time periods has identified three types of <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Gould1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. About 20% of the human population can be regarded as <italic>non-carriers</italic>, who are never or only in very rare instances colonized with low bacterial numbers. In contrast, <italic>intermittent carriers</italic> show alternating periods of non-carrier status and colonisation by various <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. The number of bacteria per isolation can be highly variable. The third group of roughly 20% <italic>persistent carriers</italic> is characterised by the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in nearly all nasal swabs, usually at high bacterial numbers and with one specific strain per person over time. Recently, it has been suggested to distinguish only between carriers and non-carriers because of similar <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal elimination kinetics and anti-staphylococcal antibody profiles in intermittent- and non-carriers <xref rid="ppat.1003862-vanBelkum1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that being an <italic>S. aureus</italic> carrier bears a higher risk of invasive S. <italic>aureus</italic> infections, predominantly by the carriers' own strain <xref rid="ppat.1003862-vonEiff1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but a lower risk of infection-associated mortality compared to being a non-carrier <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Wertheim1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The reasons for the underlying predisposition, which may involve individual differences in epithelial ligands for bacterial adhesins, local host defense, or availability of nutrients in the nose, have remained unclear. While some polymorphisms in immunity-related genes are weakly associated with the carrier status, the human predisposition appears to have multifactorial reasons <xref rid="ppat.1003862-vanBelkum2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. On the bacterial side several factors required for nasal colonization have been identified. Wall teichoic acid (WTA) polymers at the staphylococcal surface <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Weidenmaier2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Weidenmaier3" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and cell-wall anchored proteins, such as ClfB <xref rid="ppat.1003862-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Wertheim2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and IsdA <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, have been found to be required for nasal colonization and adhesion to nasal epithelial cells. While the epithelial receptor for WTA is still unknown, ClfB and IsdA bind to cytokeratin 10 and loricrin, major components of human squamous epithelial cells, and IsdA also binds to the matrix protein involucrin <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Mulcahy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Recently, up-regulation of WTA-biosynthetic genes <italic>tagO</italic> and <italic>tarK</italic> and of <italic>clfB</italic> and <italic>isdA</italic> during nasal colonisation has been shown in nasal swab samples from human volunteers <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Burian1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and in the cotton rat model of <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal colonisation <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Burian2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, underscoring the importance of these factors in nasal colonization. <italic>S. aureus</italic> encounters iron-limiting conditions in the nose because <italic>isdA</italic> expression is strictly dependent on iron limitation <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Clarke2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and haemoglobin has recently been shown to promote <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal colonization <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Pynnonen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The human body can be regarded as a chemostat, where the nutrients required for bacterial growth are replenished over time and allow growth of bacteria within human microenvironments <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. While several <italic>S. aureus</italic> nasal adhesion factors have been studied in the past, nothing is known about the growth conditions in nasal fluid such as the availability of carbon and nitrogen sources and the metabolic activities of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in its nasal habitat. Knowledge of metabolite availabilities and utilisation patterns could direct the identification of important metabolic enzymes that are essential during infection or colonization by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and could serve as targets for new antibiotics. Along this line enzymes from the folic acid biosynthetic pathway or the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase are valuable targets for widely used anti-staphylococcal antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole or mupirocin, respectively. Mupirocin is frequently used to eliminate <italic>S. aureus</italic> from the noses of high-risk patients <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Bode1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, but the increasing resistance to mupirocin <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Patel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and almost all antibiotics used to prevent or treat staphylococcal infections puts urgency to the development of new antimicrobial compounds. For this purpose the most critical and &#x02018;drugable&#x02019; metabolic pathways of <italic>S. aureus</italic> need to be identified.</p><p>In this study we elucidated the abundance of potential nutrients for <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the human nose by metabolomics analysis of nasal secretions. We found a high diversity but low concentrations of metabolites and no significant differences in the composition of secretions from <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers and non-carriers. A synthetic nasal medium (SNM3) was composed based on the metabolomics data. <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth in SNM3 led to similar gene expression patterns as during <italic>in vivo</italic> colonization. While <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates grew steadily in SNM3, CoNS did not, indicating that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is particularly well adapted to life in the human nose. Analysis of global gene expression in SNM3 revealed that the methionine-biosynthetic pathway may be a critical target for new anti-colonization drugs. In support of this notion an inhibitor of methionine biosynthesis had antimicrobial activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> in SNM3 but not in complex media. The inhibitor's staphylococcal target gene was strongly up-regulated during human nasal colonization, and deletion of the target gene led to reduced colonisation ability of the respective mutant in the cotton rat colonisation model. Thus, deciphering the <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism of pathogens represents a valuable strategy for defining new antimicrobial targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Human nasal secretions have similar composition in <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers and non-carriers</title><p>The abundance of potential nutrients in nasal secretions has never been described.

The up-regulated signals also included the genes for the iron-regulated IsdC surface protein and the osmoprotectant system OpuCC and OpuD. In the group of genes categorized for &#x0201c;information storage and processing&#x0201d; 10.6% of the genes were differentially expressed, 13 genes were up- and 20 down-regulated including various transcriptional regulators.</p><p>As expected, most of the major differences were found among genes governing the central &#x0201c;metabolism&#x0201d; (26.6% of all genes assigned to this group), in which 54% of all genes from the functional group E (&#x0201c;amino acid transport and metabolism&#x0201d;) differed more than twofold in expression between the chosen growth conditions. Here, 79 genes were up- and only three down-regulated in SNM3 compared to BM (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003862.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Significant up-regulation of amino acid biosynthesis genes was observed for glutamate, histidine, lysine, valine, leucine, isoleucine and methionine in SNM3 compared to BM. Remarkably, all of these amino acids, except for methionine and isoleucine, are integral components of SNM3. Whereas isoleucine can easily be generated from threonine, methionine has to be synthesized from aspartate, which was also not detectable in nasal secretions and therefore was not included in SNM3. Via O-acetyl-L-homoserine, aspartate reacts in a transsulfuration reaction with cysteine to form L-cystathionine and L-homocysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003862-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).

Among the methionine-biosynthetic genes those for MetE (5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine S-methyl-transferase) and its homologue MetF SAUSA300_0358 (bifunctional homocysteine S-methyltransferase), responsible for the conversion of L-homocysteine to L-methionine, were 13 to 14-fold up-regulated. The strong up-regulation of two L-methionine ABC-transport systems (SAUSA300_0435-0437 and SAUSA300_0796-0798) underscored the importance of methionine supply during growth in SNM3. In addition to the biosynthetic operons of the above mentioned amino acids, many ABC-type dipeptide/oligopeptide (<italic>opp</italic> genes) as well as metal ion transporters (especially for iron-siderophores), were strongly up-regulated in SNM3 (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003862.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, functional category P). The presence of iron-limiting conditions in SNM3 was reflected by distinct up-regulation of the operon for biosynthesis of staphyloferrin B (also called staphylobactin, <italic>sbnABCDEFGHI</italic>; SAUSA300_0118 to SAUSA300_0126), a potent siderophore facilitating the extraction of iron from human transferrin <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

The concentrations of glucose and amino acids are substantially lower in nasal secretions compared to human plasma of healthy individuals (glucose about 0.04&#x02013;1 mM vs. 4&#x02013;8 mM; amino acids about 0.65&#x02013;2.2 mM vs. 2.6 to 4.3 mM, respectively) <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Nasset1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. The sputum covering lung epithelia of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, which are frequently infected by <italic>S. aureus</italic>

These differences in nutrient availability suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> requires different metabolic activities during colonization of the human nose or infection of sterile tissues. It is interesting to note that lactate, an abundant compound on skin with concentrations around 2.5 mM <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and a product of <italic>S. aureus</italic> energy metabolism <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Ferreira1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, was undetectable in nasal secretions. Accordingly, metabolites in the nasal habitat differ from those on skin, and <italic>S. aureus</italic> metabolism does not seem to affect much the nasal metabolome. Our data indicate that the concentration of many nutrients in nasal secretions varies between donors, but none of the differences could be associated with the <italic>S. aureus</italic> carrier status. Thus, factors other than nutrient supply, such as differences in epithelial immunity or ligands for <italic>S. aureus</italic> adhesins, may be responsible for the predisposition to the <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriage status.</p><p>Various chemically defined media have been developed over the past decades with the purpose to achieve maximal growth and high capsule or protein expression in <italic>S. aureus</italic>
<xref rid="ppat.1003862-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003862-Taylor1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In contrast, our aim was to simulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation in the human nose, to use a representative synthetic nasal medium for comparing colonization capacities of different staphylococcal strains and to elucidate colonization-related bacterial metabolic processes. Expression profiles of representative <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes upon growth in the artificial nasal medium SNM3 corresponded well to those found in the human nose indicating that SNM3 provides suitable conditions for simulating <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth during nasal colonization. Of note, global transcriptomes of bacteria from SNM3 and complex media differed extensively indicating that complex media can hardly reflect <italic>in vivo</italic>-related gene expression. In accord with this finding, transcriptome data of <italic>S. aureus</italic> grown in human blood and serum have also yielded major differences compared to previously described expression profiles from complex-media grown bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Malachowa1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-denReijer1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Thus, SNM3 will allow to investigate bacterial metabolic processes during nasal colonization in detail and to monitor <italic>S. aureus</italic> competition with other resident bacteria under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions. Nevertheless, results obtained with SNM3 in genome-wide <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments should be validated in <italic>in vivo</italic> models.</p><p>In accordance with the limited nasal nutrient supply, the human nasal microbiome has been shown to be much less complex <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-WosOxley1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> than those of the upper or lower digestive tract, where bacteria are in regular contact with ingested food <xref rid="ppat.1003862-OHara1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Dewhirst1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Hence, bacteria in the human nose can be expected to compete fiercely for available nutrients and depend on mechanisms allowing them to thrive even with very low amounts of nutrients. In line with this notion all tested nasal <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates grew well in SNM3, and almost all viable cells formed colonies on SNM3 agar. <italic>S. aureus</italic> is obviously adapted to growth in moist environments with very dilute nutrients, while human skin is usually dry except for atopic dermatitis patients, whose skin structure and permeability is severely perturbed <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. In contrast, CoNS colonize healthy skin as their major habitat <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Widerstrom1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, which is in accordance with our finding that most of the tested CoNS isolates had major problems to form colonies on SNM3 agar and grew in liquid SNM3 only after long lag phases. It has remained unclear if CoNS use the human nose as a preferred or only as a transient habitat. While permanent <italic>S. aureus</italic> carriers are usually colonized by one specific single clone, multiple <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains can be found per nose and the pattern of strains is highly variable over time <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Our results indicate that CoNS are usually much less adapted to growth in nasal secretions than <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In line with our data a recent study has found a negative association between the colonisation with <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the abundance of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. It has been speculated that these bacterial species compete with each other during colonization of the nares <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our data supports the notion that most <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains can overgrow CoNS because of better metabolic adaptation. In addition to differences in the abilities to utilize dilute nutrients, competition between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and CoNS may also involve different capacities to produce bacteriocins such as lantibiotics <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Bastos1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Bierbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, to induce and resist host antimicrobial peptides such as defensins <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Wanke1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, which have been detected in nasal secretions <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, and to produce factors that compromise the ability of other staphylococci to adhere to epithelial surfaces such as the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> Esp protease <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Iwase1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>.</p><p>Metabolomics analyses have been proposed to facilitate the identification of new antimicrobial targets and have recently helped to define the staphylococcal pyruvate dehydrogenase as a target for a new class of organobismuth antimicrobials <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Birkenstock1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. We demonstrate here that a combined metabolomics and transcriptomics approach can lead to the identification of targets that are specifically important during <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions. Gene expression analysis of <italic>S. aureus</italic> grown in SNM3, or from <italic>in vivo</italic> samples, revealed that various amino acid biosynthesis operons are up-regulated during colonization. This implies a general importance of several anabolic pathways under such conditions.</p><p>Since SNM3 does not contain isoleucine, it can be assumed that the global transcription repressor CodY plays an important role for the up-regulation of a number of genes under the conditions used for microarray experiments, especially those for isoleucine biosynthesis <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Majerczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Pohl1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.

<xref rid="ppat.1003862-Schoenfelder1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Despite the obvious influence of CodY on the gene expression pattern no clear signs of stringent response, like down-regulation of ribosomal protein <italic>rpsL</italic>, could be detected <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Geiger1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.</p><p>The absence of methionine in nasal secretions and SNM3 was reflected by the strong up-regulation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> methionine import and, most conspicuously, methionine biosynthesis genes in SNM3 and in the noses of human volunteers. In a similar approach, metabolomics analysis of sputum from CF patients has recently allowed to develop a synthetic sputum medium, leading to the unexpected finding that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> depends on L-alanine as carbon source during CF lung infections. Furthermore, the high concentrations of aromatic amino acids in CF-sputum and the corresponding synthetic medium have been implicated in high-level production of pyocyanin <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Palmer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Palmer2" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. This cytotoxic respiratory inhibitor is important in competition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the CF lung, since the latter is strongly inhibited because of its pyocyanin-sensitive cytochrome bd oxidase <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Voggu1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>.</p><p>The methionine biosynthetic enzymes fulfil important criteria for antimicrobial drug targets, because they are absent from human cells that need to take up methionine from exogenous sources. However, such enzymes have hardly been regarded as antimicrobial targets before, because their importance has probably been missed when growing bacteria in complex media in antimicrobial screening programs. Nevertheless, this pathway has recently been proposed as a potential staphylococcal &#x0201c;Achilles heel&#x0201d; <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Schoenfelder1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. In our study the synthetic compound DL-propargylglycine, described as an inhibitor of cystathionine-&#x003b3;-synthase (MetI), which is unique to microorganisms and plants <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Johnston1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Marcotte1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> was used. The activity of DL-propargylglycine against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the inability of <italic>metI</italic> mutants to grow in SNM3 underscore the potential use of MetI or other methionine-biosynthetic enzymes as targets for new nasal decolonisation drugs. These drugs could be alternatives to eradicate e.g. mupirocin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In agreement with this notion, the <italic>S. aureus metI</italic> gene was strongly upregulated in human noses, and the <italic>metI</italic> mutant was compromised in nasal colonization of cotton rats. However, DL-propargylglycin itself does not seem to be suitable as a drug, because it also inhibits the human cystathionine-&#x003b3;-lyase. This enzyme converts exogenous methionine to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Steegborn1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>, leading to reduced production of the gaseous messenger molecule hydrogen sulfide with various eminent consequences <xref rid="ppat.1003862-Paul1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. While the rather low activity against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the severe impact on mammalian metabolism precluded the use of DL-propargylglycine in animal models, derivatives or new compounds with higher selectivity and activity against bacterial MetI or other methionine-biosynthetic enzymes may become promising lead substances for the development of new antimicrobial drugs.

All animals received drinking water with 2.5 mg/ml streptomycin continuously, starting three days prior to the experiment to reduce the natural nasal flora. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with German laws after approval (protocol T1/10) by the local authorities (Regierungspraesidium Tuebingen).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1003862.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
