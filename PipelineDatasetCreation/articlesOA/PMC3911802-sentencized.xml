<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It should therefore be possible to specify the risk and possibly prevent the development of the disease by investigating genetic polymorphisms; thus, the investigation of polymorphisms in genes encoding inflammatory mediators and cytokines is important. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether any of 31 SNPs in genes encoding cytokines or monokines are associated with asthma development in a Japanese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In a single locus model, we found that MMP8 rs17099451, and in a two-locus model, the combination of this rs17099451 in MMP8 SNP and rs44707 in ADAM33, as well as this MMP8 SNP and rs40401 IL-3, were selected as significant asthma development risk markers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The single locus model of the MMP8 was consistently selected, and the balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluation against the test data were superior in the single locus model compared with those in the two-locus model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>It is known that MMP8 is involved in the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis.18–20 Until recently, MMP8 has been thought to be produced only by neutrophils, but it is now known to be expressed in some other cell types, including articular chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cytotrophoblasts.21–25 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Using an MMP8 knockout mouse model, Gueders et al. revealed an important role for MMP8 in the control of neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration during allergen-induced lung inflammation; they also showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of MMP8 is partly caused by regulation of inflammatory cell apoptosis.26 In asthma patients, a significant inverse correlation between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid MMP8 levels and FEV1 and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid–activated MMP8 forms and FEV1 was detected.27 Inhaled budesonide normalized the MMP8/tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 ratio in asthmatic children via up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 production and down-regulation of MMP8 production by airway macrophages.28 Overall, these data suggest that MMP8 and its activation have an important role in the airway destruction, healing, remodeling, and treatment response in asthma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that the minor A allele of rs17099451 in MMP8 may have a suppressing effect on asthma development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in a person carrying the major C allele of this SNP, the promoter activity and the ensuing gene expression may be altered, so that suppression of inflammation is lost, resulting in an increase in airway inflammation and remodeling and the development of asthma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>MMP8 forms part of a cluster of MMP genes, MMP1, -3, -7, -10, -12, -13, -20, etc., located on chromosome 11q22.3.29 In this study, we found that rs17099451 in MMP8 was in LD with another MMP8 SNP, rs11225395; it is also possible that this SNP is in LD with other SNPs that may contribute to asthma development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-3 is a cytokine produced by active T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, which stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.30 Moreover, IL-3 mRNA-expressing cells and IL-3 production are increased in asthma patients; this increase in IL-3 is independent of eosinophil number.31 Park et al.32 reported that one exonic SNP (in exon 1), IL3 + 79T &gt; C (Ser27Pro) showed significant association with the risk of asthma and atopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The Pro-allele had dominant, protective effects against the development of asthma in nonatopic subjects (p = -.002) and also showed significant association with the risk of atopy in normal control subjects (p = 0.007).32 We also found that rs40401 in IL-3 had the most significant effect in the 2 × 2 dominant model analysis, which suggests that the minor C allele may have a suppressing effect on asthma development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Van Eerdewegh et al. reported that ADAM33 on chromosome 20p13 was linked to asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, using a genomewide scan of 460 white families.9 The ADAM33 gene group appears to be related to proliferation, differentiation, or migration of fibroblasts, muscle fibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells, factors that are related to bronchial hyperresponsiveness or bronchial remodeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>However, these proteins do not appear to be involved in the respiratory epithelium, which is related to asthmatic immunologic or inflammatory components.9,33 Although a previous genomewide association study in a Japanese population did not implicate ADAM33 among the three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma,34 another study suggested the involvement of ADAM33 in the development of childhood asthma among the Japanese.35 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Our finding that the MDR-based two-locus model analysis implicated rs44707 in ADAM33 as a significant factor also supports the relation of this gene to asthma development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our finding that the combination of MMP8 and IL-3 polymorphisms and MMP8 and ADAM33 polymorphisms were also selected by two-locus model analysis may suggest that several gene polymorphisms may be involved in the onset of asthma. </plain></SENT>
