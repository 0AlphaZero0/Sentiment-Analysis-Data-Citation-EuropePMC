<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To test CPF preparations for CTD phosphatase activity, we used a substrate of purified yeast Pol II that had been pre-phosphorylated with MAP kinase, including on Tyr1, Ser2, and Ser5 (Methods; Fig. 1b, lane 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Thus the Glc7-dependent Ser2 dephosphorylation observed in vitro (Fig. 1b) is likely non-specific and not used in vivo, consistent with the previously observed Ser2 dephosphorylation by Fcp1 in vivo25,35. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Although the mammalian homologue of Glc7, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), acts primarily on phosphorylated serine and threonine residues30,36, the recombinant enzyme is active on phosphorylated tyrosine residues37. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>As previously predicted22,23, Ssu72 was recently shown to contain a protein tyrosine phosphatase fold26, but it apparently acts as a serine-specific phosphatase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that recombinant human Ssu72 was able to dephosphorylate Ser5 but neither Tyr1 nor Ser2 in vitro, with up to 1.4 molar excess hSsu72 for each Pol II CTD heptad substrate (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>ChIP-chip experiments after Ssu72 nuclear depletion showed that Tyr1 dephosphorylation at the pA site was not influenced (Fig. 3b), suggesting that Glc7 remained in the nucleus and dephosphorylated Tyr1 normally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To show this, we tagged Glc7 with mCherry in the Ssu72-FRB strain, and found that the localization of Glc7 was not influenced by rapamycin addition (Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that Glc7 or Ssu72 can be depleted from CPF without destabilizing the complex, and that Glc7 catalyzes Tyr1 dephosphorylation, whereas Ssu72 does not. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The ChIP signal for total Pol II (Rpb3 subunit) normally decreases about 200 nucleotides downstream of the pA site, due to transcription termination and Pol II release from DNA (Fig. 4a, black line). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Whereas previous work showed that the Pol II CTD is phosphorylated at Tyr1, and that Tyr1 phosphorylation impairs binding of transcription termination factors8, it remained unknown whether Tyr1 dephosphorylation is required for termination in vivo and which enzyme dephosphorylates Tyr1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Here we establish yeast CPF subunit Glc7 as a CTD Tyr1 phosphatase, and show that Tyr1 dephosphorylation is required for normal recruitment of termination factors and transcription termination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>These results support the previously proposed ‘extended CTD code’ for the coordination of factor recruitment during the transcription cycle8 and indicate a crucial role for Tyr1 dephosphorylation in the elongation-termination transition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The data presented here and previously8 lead to the following model for the elongation-termination transition of Pol II at the 3′-ends of protein-coding genes (Fig. 4c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Elongating Pol II is phosphorylated mainly at Tyr1 (Y1P) and Ser2 (S2P), and this facilitates elongation factor binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Tyr1 phosphorylation impairs premature recruitment of termination factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>When Pol II reaches the pA site, the Glc7 subunit of CPF dephosphorylates Tyr1 (−Y1P), whereas Ser2 phosphorylation levels remain high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This allows for the binding of Pcf11 and Rtt103, termination factors that are not part of CPF and show peak occupancy ~100 nucleotides downstream of the pA site8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Both Pcf11 and Rtt103 contain CIDs that interact with Ser2-phosphorylated CTD19,41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Further downstream, transcription terminates and Pol II is released from genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>When Glc7 is depleted from the nucleus (+ Rapa), Tyr1 phosphorylation levels remain high downstream of the pA site, impairing termination and Pol II release which causes readthrough. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed an influence of Glc7 depletion on Tyr1 phosphorylation levels near the TSS (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by initiation with polymerases that remained partially phosphorylated on Tyr1 residues, by termination defects at upstream genes24, or by a possible role of Glc7 in transcription attenuation, which would be consistent with the role of Glc7 in Nrd1-dependent termination of snoRNA genes27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide evidence that pA-dependent 3′-pre-mRNA processing is coupled to transcription termination via CPF-triggered Pol II dephosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>A link between the pA site and transcription termination was established over 25 years ago42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>In the ‘anti-terminator’ model, transcription of the pA site triggers a change in the Pol II machinery that allows for termination1,2,43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In the ‘torpedo’ model, CPF-dependent RNA cleavage at the pA site results in a new RNA 5′-end that is recognized by the Rat1–Rai1–Rtt103 exonuclease complex, which degrades nascent RNA and triggers termination1,2,43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Our data are consistent with a combination of both models; Tyr1 phosphorylation would serve as an anti-terminator that is removed at the pA site by Glc7, allowing for recruitment of termination factors, including the torpedo nuclease complex that contains Rtt103. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Briefly, first we performed quantile normalization between replicate measurements and averaged the signal for each probe over the replicate intensities for the Glc7-FRB strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>For Supplementary Fig. 3, one replicate was analyzed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Profiles were smoothed using running median smoothing with a window half size of 75 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>To average profiles over genes, yeast genes were filtered: Of 4,366 yeast genes with annotated TSS and pA sites48, we excluded genes shorter than 800 bp or with a neighbouring gene within 400 bp downstream of the pA site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The resulting 619 genes were aligned at their pA sites and the ChIP signals averaged in a region from 400 bp upstream to 400 bp downstream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Averaging was performed by calculating the median over genes at each genomic position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Since CPF acts around the pA site, we were especially interested in whether the profiles change around the pA site relative to the region upstream of the pA site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>To better visualize these relative differences we further normalized the data to have approximately equal occupancy levels upstream (around – 400 bp) of the pA site for the ‘−’ and ‘+’ rapamycin treated profiles. </plain></SENT>
