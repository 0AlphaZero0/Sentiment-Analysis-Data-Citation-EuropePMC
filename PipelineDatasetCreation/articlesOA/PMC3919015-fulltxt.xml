Our aim was to scrutinize the expression patterns of several of the most biologically relevant components of the NF&#x003ba;B route in intestinal biopsies from active and treated patients and after <italic>in vitro</italic> gliadin challenge, and to assess normalization of the expression using an inhibitor of the MALT1 paracaspase. The expression of 93 NF&#x003ba;B genes was measured by RT-PCR in a set of uncultured active and treated CD and control biopsies, and in cultured biopsy series challenged with gliadin, the NF&#x003ba;B modulator, both compounds and none. Methylation of eight genes involved in NF&#x003ba;B signaling was analyzed by conventional pyrosequencing. Groups were compared and Pearson's correlation matrixes were constructed to check for coexpression and co-methylation. Our results confirm the upregulation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway and show that constitutively altered genes usually belong to the core of the pathway and have central roles, whereas genes overexpressed only in active CD are more peripheral. Additionally, this is the first work to detect methylation level changes in celiac intestinal mucosa. Coexpression is very common in controls, whereas gliadin challenge and especially chronic inflammation present in untreated CD result in the disruption of the regulatory equilibrium. In contrast, co-methylation occurs more often in active CD. Importantly, NF&#x003ba;B modulation partially restores coregulation, opening the door to future therapeutic possibilities and targets.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Celiac disease (CD, MIM: 212750) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder caused by intolerance to ingested gluten that develops in genetically susceptible individuals and affects &#x0223c;1% of Caucasians (<xref rid="DDT520C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Histological analysis of intestinal biopsies at diagnosis (when disease is active) shows that CD is characterized by the loss of <italic>villi</italic>, crypt hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in the gut, and there are circulating IgA and IgG class autoantibodies specific for the enzyme transglutaminase 2 and antibodies against gliadin (<xref rid="DDT520C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Clinical presentation varies from typical gastrointestinal symptoms to extraintestinal manifestations, all of which develop in the context of a sustained, chronic inflammation of the gut, but usually revert if gluten is totally excluded from the diet. From a genetic point of view, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 are necessary, but yet not sufficient for the development of CD, accounting for &#x0223c;35&#x02013;40% of heritability of the disease (<xref rid="DDT520C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). More recently, the two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the Immunochip fine mapping project have revealed 39 non-HLA regions associated with the genetic risk to CD development (<xref rid="DDT520C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="DDT520C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several genes within those regions that are related to the immune response have been proposed as etiological candidates, but a systematic functional confirmation is still pending for the identification of the causal variants and causal genes. Altogether those new <italic>loci</italic> are responsible for an additional 10&#x02013;15% of the genetic risk to CD, leaving a large proportion of the genetic component of the disease still to be explained. In the post-GWAS era, when increasing resources and efforts are being directed towards huge exploratory projects, it remains important to take into account what is already known about the functional players involved in the disease and adopt a pathophysiology-based point of view in the design of more specific and less costly studies.</p><p>In this sense, based on our previous knowledge on the role of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway in CD, we selected a set of 93 NF&#x003ba;B-related genes because the pathway has been shown to be constitutively upregulated in CD mucosa (<xref rid="DDT520C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and also because key mediators such as <italic>REL</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> present CD-associated variants (<xref rid="DDT520C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The transcription factor NF&#x003ba;B is a crucial regulator of the adaptive immune response and controls lymphocyte activation, proliferation and survival. Additionally, in a recent study, gliadin effects on enterocytes have been shown to be mediated through oxidative stress, NF&#x003ba;B activation and <italic>IL15</italic> upregulation (<xref rid="DDT520C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Much progress has been made concerning our understanding of the signaling mediators and regulatory mechanisms that govern NF&#x003ba;B activation (<xref rid="DDT520C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). TCR/CD28 coligation induces canonical NF&#x003ba;B signaling, leading to the transcriptional activity of NFKB1/RELA heterodimers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F1">1</xref>). This activation involves phosphorylation and degradation of small cytosolic I&#x003ba;B inhibitors, catalyzed by the I&#x003ba;B kinase complex (<xref rid="DDT520C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Activation of the atypical protein kinase C (encoded by <italic>PRKCQ</italic>) has been shown to provide a critical link between TCR/CD28 proximal signaling events and the NF&#x003ba;B pathway (<xref rid="DDT520C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) through the phosphorylation of CARD11 and subsequent triggering of the recruitment and assembly of the CARD&#x02013;BCL10&#x02013;MALT1 (CBM) complex (<xref rid="DDT520C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The canonical pathway can also be activated through the signaling of several G protein coupled receptors, IL1- and toll-like receptors and tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1), whereas the rest of the TNFR family usually activates the non-canonical NF&#x003ba;B pathway, leading to the formation of transcriptionally active NFKB2/RELB heterodimers (<xref rid="DDT520C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
<fig id="DDT520F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Simplified outline of the core of the NF&#x003ba;B route, focusing on the paracaspase MALT1 (in green) and its targets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddt52001"/></fig></p><p>In this work, we studied the expression of a considerable fraction of the most central functional components of the NF&#x003ba;B route, as well as of several of its targets, most of them involved in processes that are relevant to CD, and attempted to normalize the altered expression of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway using Z-VRPR-FMK (Z in this article), a MALT1 inhibitor able to modulate the pathway without completely repressing it (<xref rid="DDT520C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Of note, MALT1 is an important paracaspase that can cleave BCL10, TNFAIP3 and CYLD, which respectively trigger the TCR-induced adhesion to fibronectin, the loss of NF&#x003ba;B inhibition downstream of IL1- and toll-like receptor signaling, and the activation of the JNK pathway (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F1">1</xref>). It has also been suggested that MALT1 could take part in the cleavage of MAP3K14, given the fact that the API2-MALT1 fusion protein can do so in the lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) (<xref rid="DDT520C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Additionally, MALT1 controls caspase-8 activation during lymphocyte proliferation (<xref rid="DDT520C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and participates in the canonical NF&#x003ba;B activation observed in lymphocytes and lymphoma cell lines after RELB cleavage (<xref rid="DDT520C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that CD could be a good target disease to investigate DNA methylation owing to its inflammatory disease condition. This study is the first one to investigate whether DNA methylation changes are occurring in the celiac gut and if so, whether they are reversible upon treatment with a gluten-free diet (GFD). The fact that several genes involved in the NF&#x003ba;B system have been consistently found to be hypomethylated in some cancers (<xref rid="DDT520C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) provided us good candidates to study among our set of NF&#x003ba;B-related genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overexpression of NF&#x003ba;B-related genes and <italic>in vitro</italic> modulation of the pathway</title><p>Using a custom-designed Taqman low density array (TLDA), the relative expression of 93 NF&#x003ba;B-related genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt520/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S1</ext-link>) was assessed in basal (uncultured) biopsies from 16 active and 16 GFD-treated CD patients, as well as in 16 basal biopsies from non-celiac controls without intestinal inflammation. Twenty-two of the 93 genes studied were constitutively upregulated among patients, both at diagnosis (active CD) and after at least two years on GFD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F2">2</xref>). The only gene showing a significant constitutive downregulation in disease was <italic>ENPP2</italic> (data not shown). In turn, 9 of the 93 genes were overexpressed only in the active disease group.

Changes in mRNA levels were observed in all groups and culture conditions. In the case of several genes, expression was altered upon stimulation with gliadin but reverted to levels similar to those found in unchallenged cultured biopsy portions when incubated with both PTG and Z (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F3">3</xref>). Intriguingly, both the direction and the intensity of PTG-induced alterations varied notably among samples, whereas Z-mediated normalization was more uniform. Reversion by Z did not affect the group of genes that were constitutively overexpressed in CD patients, so we decided to focus on the differences between active and GFD disease statuses. We performed a class prediction analysis to extract the most meaningful genes indicative of disease activity and inflammation. Active and GFD-treated basal biopsies were randomly divided into training (12 samples from each group) and test subgroups, and the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method was applied. Four genes (<italic>CCL20</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>NOS2</italic>) were sufficient to correctly discriminate between disease statuses in seven of the eight test samples; one of the four treated patients was erroneously classified along with the active CD group. When the 16 biopsies from the treated group, cultured either in the presence of PTG or with both PTG and Z, were used as a second test group, PTG-challenged portions were classified into the active disease group, whereas the addition of Z was able to revert this in 5/8 cultured biopsy portions, which were included in the GFD-treated group.

However, in the case of the GFD-treated and control groups, PTG stimulation caused a pronounced loss of the coordination of gene expression trends, and interestingly, coregulation was somewhat restored when the challenge included both PTG and the NF&#x003ba;B modulator Z. Of note, upon PTG challenge, a much lower coordination was observed in the GFD group compared with the control biopsies.

The correlation matrixes of the genes represented in each of the PTG-response signatures were also constructed in the unchallenged and PTG-Z situations to obtain a global picture of the coexpression profiles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F6">6</xref>).

The level of correlation of this particular gene set was lower in GFD patients, even though Z seemed capable of reestablishing certain coexpression relationships between several gene pairs. Meanwhile, the set of highly coexpressed genes that make up the GFD-specific response to PTG showed no correlation at all among controls, suggesting an aberrant and coordinated alteration of several genes of the NF&#x003ba;B route in the acute response to gliadin that is mounted in the celiac mucosa. An exception to the lack of coexpression observed in controls was found in <italic>CXCL1</italic>, <italic>IER3</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>IL8</italic> (which were coregulated among them), supporting the idea of a significant, albeit controlled activation in response to gliadin among non-celiac individuals.

Four genes presented differences between active disease and control samples, whereas the GFD-treated group showed intermediate methylation levels, suggesting a partial reversion of the trend observed in the active disease status, except in the case of <italic>RELA</italic>, where methylation differences remained significant after GFD treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F7">7</xref>). <italic>MALT1</italic>, <italic>MAP3K7</italic> and <italic>TRADD</italic> showed subtle but significantly higher methylation levels than controls and <italic>RELA</italic> presented the opposite trend.

It is widely accepted that NF&#x003ba;B is a key regulator of inducible gene expression in the immune system. Both innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as the development and maintenance of the cells and organs that comprise the immune system are, at multiple stages, under the control of the NF&#x003ba;B family of transcription factors. Moreover, NF&#x003ba;B is responsible for the transcription of genes encoding a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<xref rid="DDT520C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It has also been shown that NF&#x003ba;B is a major mediator of IL15, which is able to decrease claudin-2 levels in epithelial tight junction structures and leads to augmented paracellular permeability (<xref rid="DDT520C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), a phenomenon that is recurrent, relevant and persistent in CD (<xref rid="DDT520C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The former characteristics and functions of NF&#x003ba;B, together with the fact that genetic polymorphisms in key NF&#x003ba;B-mediators such as <italic>REL</italic> and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> have been associated with susceptibility to CD (<xref rid="DDT520C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), make this pathway an extremely interesting candidate to have a prominent causative role in the development of the disease. The present work supports the idea of a systemic genetic alteration in celiac patients that leads to the constitutive and anomalous activation of the NF&#x003ba;B route, a hallmark of the disease.</p><p>Accumulated information from the literature, functional enrichment web resources and also protein&#x02013;protein interaction and pathway databases have been recently integrated into a single, comprehensive picture of the proteins that interact with, and participate to the NF&#x003ba;B activation system (<xref rid="DDT520C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Among other remarkable results, the work provides a list of the 25 most central proteins in the pathway. Interestingly, our results show that of the 22 genes that are constitutively overexpressed in CD mucosa, 7 (<italic>IKBKB</italic>, <italic>IKBKG</italic>, <italic>IRAK1</italic>, <italic>MAP3K14</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, <italic>NFKBIE</italic> and <italic>TRAF2</italic>) are among those core proteins. Another three genes are members of the MAPK family, which has been demonstrated central to the NF&#x003ba;B system by direct interaction, Uniprot annotation and manual curation approaches (<xref rid="DDT520C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Two other constitutively activated genes, <italic>MALT1</italic> and <italic>CARD10</italic>, are part of the very central CBM complex (together with <italic>BCL10</italic>) and, as is the case of <italic>FADD</italic> and <italic>TRADD</italic> (also upregulated), interact directly with <italic>TRAF2</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDT520F1">1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the genes that are overexpressed only in the active stage of the disease were found to be more peripheral to the core of the route, with the exception of <italic>BCL10</italic>.

Of note, gliadin stimulation provoked very different reactions in each of the different individuals, and several genes appeared both upregulated and downregulated in response to the challenge depending on the sample, illustrating the wide variability of human samples, particularly notable in terms of the effects of external stimuli on genetic expression in the context of a complex disease. However, the influence of Z seemed to be much more homogeneous and was able to revert the PTG effect in several genes.</p><p>It is important to stress that we observed strong correlation of expression levels among genes, especially in the case of non-celiac individuals, with GFD-treated patients showing levels of coregulation halfway between controls and active patients. Such degree of coexpression is expected, given the fact that these genes take part in the same biological route and are thus likely to share common regulatory mechanisms. Besides, as has been shown by systems biology approaches, coexpression networks form functional modules that underlie different traits (<xref rid="DDT520C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The fact that patients at diagnosis, on a gluten-containing diet, show a remarkably weaker coregulation of the NF&#x003ba;B system, points to the idea of chronic inflammation as the driving force for the altered and less coordinated gene expression profile in symptomatic patients.</p><p>To date, there have been few attempts to conduct comprehensive and comparative analyses of gene coexpression at the network level; a recent study aimed to reveal similarities and differences between hepatitis B virus-derived hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-derived HCC, focusing on the inflammatory processes driven by the viral infections. (<xref rid="DDT520C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) This work demonstrated the superiority of a network-based systems biology approach in identifying different oncogenic and dysfunctional modules, over previously employed differential expression analysis and viral protein target-based methods. More recently, a gene coexpression network centered on the response mechanisms to bacterial infection was constructed in the sweet orange (<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) (<xref rid="DDT520C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The authors concluded that such gene coexpression network could be very useful to visualize specific subnetworks involved in particular biological processes and aid in the search for gene&#x02013;gene interactions relevant to the resistance to infection.</p><p>Taking into account the potential effectiveness of coexpression-based approaches over classical differential expression-based analyses, we investigated whether the loss of the tight coregulation observed for non-CD controls in the selected NF&#x003ba;B-related genes depended not only on the presence/absence of disease, but also on disease status, gliadin stimulus and/or NF&#x003ba;B pathway modulation by <italic>MALT1</italic> inhibition. We therefore studied the effects of both PTG and PTG-Z challenges by constructing correlation matrixes of the expression fold changes induced by the different stimuli. We did not observe coordinated changes in the case of active disease, where coregulation appeared to be completely disrupted and hampered the coordinated response of the different genes. In contrast, in the case of GFD patients and non-CD controls, PTG alone induced fewer coordinated gene expression changes than PTG combined with Z, particularly in the treated CD group. These results suggest that exposition to gliadin may cause the overall deregulation of NF&#x003ba;B-related gene expression, also in non-celiac individuals, but that this lack of coordination in the response is augmented in CD.</p><p>Interestingly, PTG-driven loss of coexpression reveals the enormous plasticity of correlated gene expression in the NF&#x003ba;B system as a consequence of the gliadin insult that could have a phenotypic effect, and in the context of other important events, finally translate into the aberrant and augmented response of celiac patients to gluten exposure. The nature of the putative regulators of these coexpressions remains elusive, but it seems plausible that the regulation of the system as a whole, and not just the constitutive and differential expression levels of isolated genes, is the one affected by unidentified genetic variation. Deregulation would therefore occur after an immunotoxic challenge and would only be evident after exposure to gliadin, as has been recently shown in the case of <italic>PTPRK</italic> and <italic>THEMIS</italic> gene coexpression in celiac active gut and after <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation with PTG (<xref rid="DDT520C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>The gene coexpression signature specific to the control group upon PTG challenge is somewhat less dependent on NF&#x003ba;B modulation and is tightly regulated. In contrast, this gene set was only faintly coexpressed in PTG-challenged biopsies from GFD celiac patients. For its part, the signature corresponding specifically to the PTG-challenged GFD-treated group was not coregulated at all in non-CD individuals (with several exceptions suggestive of immune activation), indicating an aberrant but coordinated response to the immunogenic insult.</p><p>In general, Z again seemed to partially restore the coexpression patterns present in unchallenged biopsies, putting forward that it might be an agent capable of reverting the impact of the gliadin insult in treated celiac patients that are not suffering from chronic inflammation. Once more, the regulatory elements taking part in the coexpressed signatures remain unknown. It will be interesting to study whether, in the future, Z could be used to avoid acute symptomatology in celiac patients that generally comply with the GFD but that might occasionally transgress the only effective treatment for this condition.</p><p>This is the first study to investigate changes in the methylation levels of several NF&#x003ba;B related promoters in the celiac gut. The changes observed are somehow maintained in patients even after more than two years on GFD, although most of the time, differences with controls are less pronounced than in active disease, suggesting that CD-related methylation changes may be partially reversible or that more time may be needed in order that methylation levels are normalized. In the recent years, the idea of epigenetic elements as causal contributors to phenotypic variation and common disease has gained credit. For example, several inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract such as inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="DDT520C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) or distal colonic neoplasia (<xref rid="DDT520C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) as well as other complex diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (<xref rid="DDT520C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) or psychosis (<xref rid="DDT520C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and a long list of cancers (<xref rid="DDT520C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="DDT520C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) have been found to have specific DNA methylation signatures.</p><p>One of the most interesting findings of the present work relies on the fact that patients in every stage of the disease present strong correlations in the methylation levels of several NF&#x003ba;B-related genes, whereas controls do not at all. Although further research will be needed to confirm this idea, it seems that the observed co-methylations are independent of cell migration and/or selection events, because they can be reproduced in isolated, <italic>in vitro</italic>-cultured biopsy samples. It has been previously shown in cancer that genes with promoter hypermethylation and hypomethylation are highly consistent in function across different cancer types (<xref rid="DDT520C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) so that it is intuitively probable that methylation patterns of genes sharing function or participating in the same pathway could be regulated in a coordinated manner in a particular disease status or in response to a specific environmental challenge. Additionally, a recent work on breast cancer has shown that unexpectedly highly correlated DNA methylation levels are found in gene pairs from cancer samples (<xref rid="DDT520C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It is important to stress that correlated gene pairs showed strong, combined functional similarities, which led the authors to suggest that these findings may be helpful to annotate unknown genes and to suggest candidate genes that should be closely investigated with respect to particular diseases. Interestingly, in our study, correlation of methylation levels in patients seemed to be somehow associated with the disruption of the coexpression of those same gene pairs, suggesting a coordinated alteration of gene promoter methylation of NF&#x003ba;B-related genes that could affect gene expression, disrupting the regulatory equilibrium of the pathway.</p><p>In conclusion, we postulate that genetic and epigenetic variation, together with environmental factors that shape expression and methylation patterns, can affect different levels of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway and provoke the disruption of the tight regulatory equilibrium that ensures its optimal control of the immune response. Maintained disruption of this coordination could constitute a major driving force towards the development of chronic inflammatory disease, as is the case of CD. Although this appealing idea is still very speculative, we believe these results could humbly help configuring a novel point of view, from which the importance of networks, interactions and common regulatory elements or events outweighs the subtle and multiple changes that we observe when interrogating isolated variables, through which we have tried to explain the common complex diseases in the last years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients and biopsies</title><p>Celiac disease was diagnosed according to the ESPGHAN (European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hematology and Nutrition) criteria in force at the time participants were recruited and included anti-gliadin and anti-transglutaminase antibody determinations as well as a confirmatory small bowel biopsy.
