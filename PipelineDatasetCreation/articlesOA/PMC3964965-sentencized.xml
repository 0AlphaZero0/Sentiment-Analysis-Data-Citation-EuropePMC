</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Scientific discourse is predicated on mutual understanding, verification of information and the inference of new connections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ontologies facilitate such discourse by providing formal definitions of and disambiguation for entities of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, placing entities in an ontological context facilitates the ability to make connections over short and long ranges within and between networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is toward these goals that the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Protein Ontology (PRO) is an OBO Foundry ontology that defines classes of proteins and explicitly indicates how these classes interrelate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The (intended) scope of PRO is the totality of naturally occurring protein entities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PRO has been used to define dendritic and hematopoietic cell types (2,3), to describe biological processes, to flag protein entities mentioned in the literature (4) and to capture information isolated from the literature in text mining workflows (5,6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Classes defined in PRO range in specificity from protein families to classes whose member proteins have specific post-translational modifications, are part of specific complexes, and which occur in specific organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The levels of specificity form the basis for categorizing PRO terms [(Figure 1; fully described in (7)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Briefly, each PRO term categorized as ‘family-level’ refers to the class of proteins translated from a specific set of ancestrally related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A PRO term categorized as ‘gene-level’ refers to the class of proteins translated from a different gene related by 1:1 orthology in distinct organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Each term categorized as ‘sequence-level’ refers to the class of proteins translated from a specific mRNA of a given gene or from a specific translation start site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A term categorized as ‘modification-level’ refers to the class of all proteins modified in some specific way, either by amino acid modification or by proteolytic cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>And finally a term categorized as ‘complex’ refers to the class of complexes with a specific defined subunit composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>PRO makes no distinction between complexes whose components are modified before—or after—complex formation, and all complexes are grouped into the ‘complex’ category regardless of the specificity of their components. Figure 1.Illustration of PRO categories and relation to external resources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Categories (aka metaclasses) are listed along the top, with example terms for IRF5 (interferon regulatory factor 5) shown directly below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Circles denote protein terms, whereas squares denote protein complex terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>For each, blue indicates terms that are defined in an organism-agnostic way; green indicates terms that are organism-specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Solid lines show is_a relationships and broken lines show has_component relationships (though the complexes in this example have components in the modification category, this need not be the case). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Filled circles and filled squares indicate how UniProtKB and GO, respectively, fit into the hierarchy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Not all terms and relationships are shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>IRF, interferon regulatory factor; Phos, phosphorylated; m, mouse; h, human; iso, isoform; BMv, bone marrow variant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As an OBO Foundry ontology, PRO is dedicated to interoperability not only with other ontologies but also with existing protein-related resources such as UniProtKB (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, each organism-agnostic category described earlier in text also has organism-specific subcategories, so an ‘organism-gene’ PRO term would denote any translation product of a specific gene in a single organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The latter, of course, are precisely what UniProtKB entries represent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, PRO both uses UniProtKB and complements it by providing formal definitions for protein entities and placing the terms in an ontological context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>PRO makes use of ontology resources such as PSI-MOD (9) and SO (10) to define protein classes of the modification category. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>PRO also makes use of community orthology sets with persistent accession numbers to provide the ability to group related proteins across the organisms represented in PRO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These sets are used to make connections between UniProtKB and PRO, with specific connections given in the form of a mapping between accessions from the two resources (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, the organism-specific protein complexes defined in PRO extend the (parental) hierarchy found in the Gene Ontology (GO) Cellular Component Ontology (11), the protein complex branch of which corresponds to PRO’s ‘complex’ category. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The organism-agnostic complexes of GO thus provide parent terms for PRO’s organism-specific complex terms and provide the basis for connecting and comparing complexes between organisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The past few years have seen growth and changes to the ontology, as well as new points of access to the data and new applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Here we describe some of these developments. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Reference organisms </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Terms in the gene category comprise the largest metaclass within PRO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Terms in this metaclass are typically defined with respect to a gene in a reference organism, and the class of proteins covered by the term includes all translation products not only of that gene in that organism but also of any of its 1:1 orthologs in other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Until 2012, when PRO defined terms using only human, mouse and Escherichia coli as references, users could reliably discern the reference organism from the gene name (the casing of which differs for each of the three organisms). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>For example, a protein defined as the translation product of the ADA gene (PR:000003707) meant the human ADA (adenosine deaminase) gene and its 1:1 orthologs, not the translation product of the E. coli ada (bifunctional transcriptional activator/DNA repair enzyme Ada) gene (PR:000022054) and its 1:1 orthologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, the addition of terms using other organisms as a reference (see later in text) has rendered this mechanism inadequate, especially since non-orthologous genes in different organisms can be given the same designation even in standard nomenclatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For example, tubulin–tyrosine ligase (PR:000016788) is defined with respect to the human TTL gene, whereas uric acid degradation bifunctional protein TTL (PR:000035855) is defined with respect to the Arabidopsis thaliana TTL gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In general, model organisms with well-established nomenclatures are used as references; preference is given to human, whereas E. coli is used for prokaryote-only classes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fungi-only classes and A. thaliana for plant-only classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Mappings to external databases </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We have improved, formalized and expanded the mapping of accessions from external databases to PRO identifiers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The majority of mapped accessions for protein records is from UniProtKB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">http://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>), Reactome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reactome.org/">http://www.reactome.org/</ext-link>) and EcoCyc (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecocyc.org/">http://ecocyc.org/</ext-link>) databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In addition, we provide gene record mappings from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>), HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genenames.org/">http://www.genenames.org/</ext-link>), EcoGene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecogene.org/">http://ecogene.org/</ext-link>), PomBase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pombase.org/">http://www.pombase.org/</ext-link>) and the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">http://www.yeastgenome.org/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Previously these mappings were given only in a tab-delimited file that contains very limited information; now, however, they have also been formalized and expanded into a supplementary OBO-format file (promapping.obo, see later in text) that contains complete definitions of and relationships between the mapped terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>For example, we indicate that human follistatin protein (UniProtKB:P19883) is a subtype of follistatin protein found in any organism (PR:000000015) and is encoded by the human follistatin gene FST (HGNC:3971). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The PRO mappings, which previously covered only three organisms (human, mouse and E. coli), now cover 12 GO reference proteomes (12): human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, chicken, fruit fly, budding yeast, fission yeast, E. coli, A. thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Assignment of each organism-specific protein to a PRO organism-agnostic gene category term is done (largely) automatically using 1:1 ortholog inferences provided by OMA (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Mapping statistics for each release are provided at the PRO website. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Reuse of UniProtKB accessions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>PRO reuses external ontology identifiers whenever feasible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Thus, if a required term is already defined in another ontology, PRO uses that term without changing its identifier (i.e. we do not create an identical term and assign a PRO identifier to it). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>However, much information in the protein field is available in the UniProtKB database, with established and stable accessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when we incorporate UniProtKB entries into the PRO ‘organism-gene’ category (Figure 1, filled green circles), in the interest of minimizing the minting of new identifiers, we use UniProtKB accession identifiers directly, prefixing them with ‘PR:’ as in the example PR:P19883 (‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_P19883">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PR_P19883</ext-link>’ for the URL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>All such entries are cross-referenced back to the originating database, using ‘UniProtKB:’ as the prefix, as in the example ‘UniProtKB:P19883’ (‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19883">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P19883</ext-link>’ for the URL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In this way, the database and ontological representations of P19883 are clearly distinguished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In the future, use of UniProtKB isoform identifiers (of the form P19883-1) will be adopted. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>PRO Consortium scientists are working with scientists at Stanford within the framework of the Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) and the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immuneprofiling.org/hipc/page/show">http://www.immuneprofiling.org/hipc/page/show</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The goal of BISC is to collect and house data in the Immunology and Data Analysis Portal (ImmPort) and to make these data accessible on the web. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>An important part of ImmPort’s data and of the associated work by HIPC scientists derives from the application of the innovative CyTOF technique, a variation of mass cytometry in which antibodies are labeled with heavy metal ion tags rather than with fluorochromes to allow single samples to be probed simultaneously with many antibodies (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This, however, creates challenges for cell typing, as for many cell populations the CyTOF-generated data go far beyond our current knowledge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The Cell Ontology (15) defines cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>To enhance the utility of the CL to support automated analyses of cell types, an enhanced association of markers to particular cell types is needed, so that each cell type is associated with all markers it is known to express. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>A problem arises here because immunologists typically use multiple different names for the proteins identified in their experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>PRO is thus used as controlled vocabulary to yield consistent data for analysis while at the same time providing complete lists of synonyms associated with proteins of interest to allow for proper mapping of the data (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In addition, because practitioners of flow cytometry and CyTOF use antibodies as primary reagents to detect cellular markers, an adequate analysis and integration of their data requires a comprehensive mapping of antibodies to the proteins they detect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>We are curating a mapping between such antibodies and PRO IDs, thereby indicating the specific modifications that might be targeted in experiments and reference to the appropriate level of specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For example, anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody clone HI30 recognizes all isoforms of the CD45 marker, whereas HI100 recognizes only the CD45RA isoform (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Src provides another example. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Anti-Src clone 3828 recognizes only human Src of all forms, whereas K98-37 recognizes only the form phosphorylated (at least) on tyrosine-418 (human numbering); it is, however, predicted to cross-react with the corresponding form in other species. Table 1.Portion of antibody registryShading in the marker column indicates that the named marker includes the shown forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>For example, CD45RA is one isoform of CD45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Shading in the clone column indicates that the clone recognizes the shown subtypes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The top-down proteomics approach focuses on intact protein molecules, rather than their pieces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Thus, results more accurately reflect the structures and properties of proteins in actual biological systems than do results using a bottom-up proteomics approach (16) and allow the identification of multiple simultaneous modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The Proteoform Repository is a database that contains experimentally verified proteoforms—isoforms and post-translationally modified forms—from various cell types in three model organisms (human, mouse and yeast) (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>PRO provides the corresponding ontological representations with links to this data source (e.g. PR:000036126). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The formal representation of proteoforms in PRO will enable (i) the study of conserved modifications among these organisms, (ii) the association to functional information and (iii) uncovering relations between proteoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In addition, inclusion of the metadata related to the cell type(s) where the proteoforms were identified will allow comparison among different cell types or in normal versus disease states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>PRO Release 37 contains 194 proteoforms encoded by 164 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Eighteen were found to be conserved between human and mouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Considering only the highest confidence subset of the current repository data, we expect to integrate &gt;700 proteoforms, ∼400 of which contain multiple modifications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Representations of biological pathways using PRO </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>PRO provides unique identifiers for each form of proteins and protein complexes, and thus it is a useful resource for those seeking to represent pathways—particularly signaling and regulatory pathways—which often involve changes in post-translational modification of proteins and differences in composition of complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the organization of protein forms by orthology in PRO enables cross-species comparisons (6,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Recently, PRO has been used to describe two such pathways: Toll-like receptor signaling and the spindle checkpoint. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>TLRs are transmembrane receptors that facilitate recognition of microbial molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Activation of the receptors induces an intricate chain of protein–protein interactions regulated by the recruitment of different intracellular adaptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the pathways are not linear; they can diverge or merge to produce synergistic responses that are not predictable from the output evoked by an individual canonical pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The spindle checkpoint maintains genomic integrity during mitosis and meiosis by inhibiting chromosome segregation until all chromosomes have been correctly attached to the spindle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Checkpoint signaling involves numerous protein phosphorylation events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>One key checkpoint protein, BUB1B, is phosphorylated on at least 12 different sites by three different protein kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Four phosphorylated forms of BUB1B are defined in PRO, each phosphorylated on a different biologically relevant subset of the 12 sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Each form is functionally annotated to describe its characteristic protein–protein interactions and role in the spindle checkpoint and related processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Ambiguous protein forms </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>PRO can represent both intentional ambiguity (e.g. a complex can include any one of a family of proteins (19) and genuine uncertainty (e.g. a protein is known to be phosphorylated but the identity of the modified residue is unknown) for protein forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The ability to do so has practical applications in scientific discourse, as it is sometimes necessary to refer to collections of objects made either for the sake of convenience or to express incomplete knowledge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>One example of this is osteocalcin peptide, which exists in three forms that are distinguished by the carboxylation state of three specific glutamic acid (glu) residues (which can be converted to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, gla) (20,21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Fully carboxylated osteocalcin contains three gla residues, the undercarboxylated form contains one or two and the uncarboxylated form contains none. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Assays can distinguish between the three, but cannot distinguish between the possible undercarboxylated forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>PRO thus contains a general term for undercarboxylated osteocalcin (PR:000024926), defined as containing a minimum of one gla residue and a maximum of two, without indicating the positions of modification. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Annotation efforts are focusing more and more on capturing information at specific levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>For example, the GO Consortium has modified its policies and data files so curators can indicate the precise form of a gene product for which an indicated annotation applies, be it a specific isoform or a post-translationally modified form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we have enhanced the web view for terms in the organism–gene metaclass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Whereas the web view previously displayed information pertaining solely to the displayed term, the new view presents all the products of a specific gene (corresponding, in most cases, to a single UniProtKB entry) and presents all the annotation associated with each product (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Scientists can thus compare these different products directly, either using the GO-centric view (middle panel), where the relevant products of the gene are mapped to each GO annotation, or the PRO-centric view (bottom panel), where the relevant GO annotations are shown for each gene product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>For example, mouse interferon regulatory factor 8, encoded by the Irf8 gene (MGI:96395; protein sequence given in UniProtKB: P23611), can be sumoylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>When in the unsumoylated form (PR:000035709), the protein can positively regulate RNA polymerase II transcription initiation (GO:0060261). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The sumoylated form (PR:000035707), however, cannot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>This difference is made clear by the new view. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The approach described here for GO will be extended to other ontologies that are used for describing other attributes of PRO terms, such as involvement in disease, and absence or presence of protein domains.

<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>For example, Figure 3 shows the Cytoscape view for complexes containing the kinase, BUB1 and a related kinase BUB1 beta (aka BUBR1) in either the unphosphorylated form (upper part) or one possible phosphorylated form (lower part). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The figure illustrates how analogous complexes in another organism can be inferred based on the displayed network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For example, one can follow has_component relationships for the unphosphorylated version of the human complex to see that each of its components—human BUB1 and human unphosphorylated BUB1 beta—has a counterpart in Xenopus laevis [follow the is_a relationship to the organism-agnostic form (blue circles), then back down the other branch to the Xenopus version]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The conservation of components could indicate that Xenopus too has such a complex, though currently experimental evidence is lacking. Figure 3.Cytoscape view of BUB1:BUB1B complexes. </plain></SENT>
