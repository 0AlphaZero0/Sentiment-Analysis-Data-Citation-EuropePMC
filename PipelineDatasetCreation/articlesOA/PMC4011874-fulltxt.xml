Functional dissection of the uniporter is now possible through the recent identification of the genes encoding for MCU protein complex subunits. Cancer cells exhibit many aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels including resistance to apoptosis, increased reactive oxygen species production and decreased oxidative metabolism. We used a publically available database to determine that breast cancer patient outcomes negatively correlated with increased MCU Ca<sup>2+</sup> conducting pore subunit expression and decreased MICU1 regulatory subunit expression. We hypothesized breast cancer cells may therefore be sensitive to MCU channel manipulation. We used the widely studied MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to investigate whether disruption or increased activation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake with specific siRNAs and adenoviral overexpression constructs would sensitize these cells to therapy-related stress. MDA-MB-231 cells were found to contain functional MCU channels that readily respond to cellular stimulation and elicit robust AMPK phosphorylation responses to nutrient withdrawal. Surprisingly, knockdown of MCU or MICU1 did not affect reactive oxygen species production or cause significant effects on clonogenic cell survival of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to irradiation, chemotherapeutic agents, or nutrient deprivation. Overexpression of wild type or a dominant negative mutant MCU did not affect basal cloning efficiency or ceramide-induced cell killing. In contrast, non-cancerous breast epithelial HMEC cells showed reduced survival after MCU or MICU1 knockdown. These results support the conclusion that MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells do not rely on MCU or MICU1 activity for survival in contrast to previous findings in cells derived from cervical, colon, and prostate cancers and suggest that not all carcinomas will be sensitive to therapies targeting mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake mechanisms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Grant IRG-77-004-034 (DDH) from the American Cancer Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.org">http://www.cancer.org</ext-link>), administered through the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Iowa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uihealthcare.org/HoldenComprehensiveCancerCenter">http://www.uihealthcare.org/HoldenComprehensiveCancerCenter</ext-link>), National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 CA115438 (FED) and NIH R01 CA182804 (DRS) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">http://www.nih.gov</ext-link>).

Mitochondrial dysfunction is common to many pathological conditions, including cancer. Cancer cells typically exhibit disease promoting characteristics linked to alterations in mitochondrial function, including increased glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and resistance to apoptotic stimuli <xref rid="pone.0096866-AykinBurns1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Fantin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is believed to be essential for stimulating oxidative phosphorylation <xref rid="pone.0096866-Denton1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Glancy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and, if excessive, is thought to induce apoptosis through membrane permeability transition and induction of cell death pathways.</p><p>Very little is known about mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation or its signaling in cancer. The lack of cell membrane permeable pharmacological inhibitors of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has limited the ability to dissect these pathways but the recent characterization of MCU constituents has focused attention on critical components of the MCU complex. Initial evidence suggests that cancer cells reduce MCU activity for increased survival. Colon and prostate cancers overexpress a microRNA that appears to enable a pro-survival phenotype in part by targeting the MCU Ca<sup>2+</sup> conducting pore subunit <xref rid="pone.0096866-Marchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, overexpression of MCU or knockdown of its auxiliary MICU1 subunit in HeLa cervical cancer cells results in constitutive mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and increases HeLa cell sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and ceramide toxicity <xref rid="pone.0096866-DeStefani1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Mallilankaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

A significantly poorer prognosis was associated with MCU over expression and MICU1 under expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggesting the expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter subunits may play an important role in breast cancer biology. As triple negative breast cancers lacking estrogen, progesterone, and EGF receptors are aggressive and resistant to current available therapies, we asked if altered mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake could sensitize the highly aggressive triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line to therapeutically relevant stresses.</p><fig id="pone-0096866-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0096866.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Expression of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter subunits is associated with breast cancer patient survival.</title><p>Hazard ratios of queried gene expression combinations from the BreastMark mRNA survival analysis online algorithm.

A recent report demonstrated that the MCU pore forming subunit of the uniporter is transcribed in MDA-MB-231 cells and may be involved in caspase-independent apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0096866-Curry1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We hypothesized that stimulation of MCU activity in MDA-MB-231 cells would increase mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx leading to increased ROS levels while inhibition would reduce oxidative metabolism and limit energy availability. Both mechanisms are predicted to enhance cell killing to therapy related stress.</p><p>We modulated MCU activity in MDA-MB-231 cells through siRNA-mediated knockdown and adenoviral over expression of uniporter constituents.

Surprisingly, inhibition and activation of the MCU did not significantly alter ROS levels nor sensitize MDA-MB-231 cells to a variety of therapy relevant stresses. These results support the conclusion that MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells function independently of MCU/MICU1 mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, suggesting this pathway may not provide a universal therapeutic target in treating cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>BreastMark algorithm searches</title><p>The BreastMark online custom mRNA analysis algorithm tool (glados.ucd.ie/BreastMark) <xref rid="pone.0096866-Madden1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> was queried for uniporter subunit gene expression and their correlation with survival.

We asked whether MDA-MB-231 mitochondria have functional mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake mechanisms and if they would buffer agonist stimulated rises in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Using transduction of MDA-MB-231 cells with adenovirus expressing the mitochondrial targeted genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator ratiometric-pericam (mt-Pericam), we found that extracellular application of ATP translated into increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> were calculated from the ratio of its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive 485 nm to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive 415 nm excitation wavelengths. The rapid response of MDA-MB-231 mitochondria to changes in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels indicates these cells have functional MCU channels.</p><p>We confirmed that MDA-MB-231 cells express both MCU and MICU1 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2 B, C</xref>). To determine the effects of different MCU channel subunits on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, we used transient siRNA technology to effectively knockdown gene expression. Two siRNA duplexes against <italic>MCU</italic> and one against <italic>MICU1</italic> reliably reduced mRNA levels by greater than 85% by 48 hours compared to cells transfected with negative control siRNA (NC-si, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Immunoblots from mitochondrial fractions show dramatically reduced levels of MCU and MICU1 protein through at least 7 days after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2 C</xref>). As both pairs of siRNAs against <italic>MCU</italic> effectively silenced expression, we utilized MCU-si1 in subsequent experiments, unless otherwise stated. Although a second siRNA against <italic>MICU1</italic> reduced mRNA levels, it did not appreciably reduce MICU1 protein levels and produced off target effects (DH and MA, unpublished data) and was therefore not used further. Interestingly, knockdown of MCU reduced MICU1 protein levels without reducing <italic>MICU1</italic> mRNA expression indicating potential MCU-dependent post-transcriptional feedback regulation. Reciprocal feedback did not occur, as knockdown of MICU1 did not diminish MCU protein levels.</p><p>Knockdown of MCU precluded MDA-MB-231 mitochondria from responding to extracellular ATP application. The fraction of ATP-responsive mt-Pericam positive cells decreased by more than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, 74/129 NC-si transfected cells responded vs. 2/44 MCU-si transfected cells). The large proportion of non-responding cells after MCU silencing indicates that MCU is essential for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. The two responding MCU-si cells displayed mt-Pericam transients that were similar to those in NC-si cells. We interpret the small fraction of responding mt-Pericam cells in the MCU-si population as those that had lost or otherwise did not contain MCU siRNA. Knockdown of MICU1 significantly increased the proportion of responding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and enhanced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2 E&#x02013;G</xref>) both in peak amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) and in the integrated area of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>). The mt-Pericam experiments show that MDA-MB-231 cells contain functional MCU channels and that MICU1 serves to temper mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in response to stimuli known to increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our siRNA approach allows us to effectively block or enhance mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and to determine the physiological role of the MCU in MDA-MB-231 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Silencing MCU and MICU1 expression has little effect on ROS production or the clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-231 cells in response to therapy-related stresses</title><p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> has long been proposed to regulate mitochondrial processes <xref rid="pone.0096866-Denton2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, including flux through the electron transport chain that determines oxidative phosphorylation and contributes to ROS production.

We were able to effectively inhibit mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by silencing endogenous <italic>MCU</italic> or by overexpression of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeant mutant of MCU and enhance influx by knocking down <italic>MICU1</italic> or overexpressing WT MCU. However, in contrast to our findings in normal breast epithelial and HeLa cells, siRNA and adenoviral manipulations of uniporter activity did not readily translate into physiological phenotypes in MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that modulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter activity only subtly impinges on overall MDA-MB-231 cell survival and sensitivity to therapy-related stresses that rely on mitochondrial function. The lack of striking changes in the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to different cellular stresses including cytotoxicity, ionizing radiation, chemotherapy, and starvation suggest that these cells primarily utilize MCU-independent mechanisms for survival.</p><p>Our current results expand upon those from an initial report by Curry et al. who found breast tumors of basal origin have higher relative <italic>MCU</italic> mRNA expression compared to other tumor subtypes <xref rid="pone.0096866-Curry1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells with MCU knockdown exhibited increased apoptosis in response to ionomycin treatment that was found to act through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, but caspase-independent cell death pathway. Our attempts to challenge MDA-MB-231 cells with a variety of cellular stress protocols suggest that survival and colony formation is not exquisitely sensitive to MCU modulation. We observed a modest increase in basal plating efficiency and protection from paclitaxel treatment with one, but not another, specific MCU siRNA and not after MICU1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). We interpret our findings to indicate MDA-MB-231 cell survival mechanisms are not dependent or only minimally dependent on MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake.</p><p>We were surprised that MICU1 knockdown did not show a clear phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells as it did in normal HMEC and HeLa cells similar to previous findings <xref rid="pone.0096866-Csords1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Mallilankaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In agreement with our observations that the clonogenic survival in response to ceramide depends on MICU1 in HMEC and HeLa cells, knockdown of MICU1 in HeLa and endothelial cells increases basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, prolongs [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> transients, increases ROS production, increases the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, and decreases migration <xref rid="pone.0096866-Csords1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Mallilankaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The increase in ceramide toxicity could be rescued by adenoviral expression of ROS scavenging enzymes showing an interdependence between elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub>, ROS, and apoptotic agents. Although we clearly reduced MICU1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells with our siRNA approach and facilitated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in response to cellular stimulation, we did not observe changes to basal mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as measured by mt-Pericam, ROS levels, sensitivity to an array of stressors including ceramide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Figs. 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g004">4</xref>) or changes in migration rate (DH, unpublished data). The lack of phenotypic effects from MICU1 knockdown in our clonogenic assays may therefore be due to a deficient functional platform (i.e. unaltered basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and/or ROS levels) for these agents to elicit their effects. MDA-MB-231 cells appear to uncouple mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport from other mitochondrial-responsive mechanisms as has been determined for other cell types.</p><p>MCU and MICU1 were the first of several uniporter channel subunits identified including MCUB <xref rid="pone.0096866-Raffaello1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, MCUR1 <xref rid="pone.0096866-Mallilankaraman2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, EMRE <xref rid="pone.0096866-Sancak1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, MICU2 <xref rid="pone.0096866-Plovanich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Patron1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and possibly MICU3 <xref rid="pone.0096866-Plovanich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. How the macromolecular uniporter channel complex is expressed, assembled, and post-translationally regulated in different cells types and disease conditions remains to be discerned. There is evidence that the assembly of the MCU complex proteins is highly interdependent. We see that MCU knockdown decreases MICU1 protein abundance without affecting MICU1 mRNA levels but MICU1 silencing had no effect on MCU levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>). MCU knockout in HEK cells has been reported to reduce MCUB and EMRE protein levels, but not MICU1 abundance <xref rid="pone.0096866-Sancak1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. MICU1 knockdown causes the concomitant decrease in MICU2 protein levels <xref rid="pone.0096866-Sancak1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0096866-Plovanich1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, but not vice versa, uncovering a likely indirect role of MICU1 in eliminating the lower threshold of Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance through MCU <xref rid="pone.0096866-Patron1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Although MDA-MB-231 cell survival phenotypes fail to respond to MCU modulation, it does not exclude the possibility that other breast tumor cells may be sensitive to MCU inhibition. Searching the BreastMark algorithm for other uniporter subunit genes as performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0096866-g001">Figure 1</xref> further suggests that if protein abundance and activities of these subunits correlates with mRNA levels within tumor samples, the resulting effect on MCU activity would inversely correlate with patient outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0096866.s001">Table S1</xref>). Both MCUB and EMRE have favorable hazard ratios similar to MICU1, while MCUR1 has a hazard ratio of 1.287. These values inversely correlate with the proposed functions of MCUB as an endogenous inhibitory subunit in MCU/MCUB heteromeric channels, EMRE as an essential factor for MCU to assemble with MICU1, and MCUR1 as a necessary member for MCU-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Interestingly, combinatorial searches for MCU, MICU1, and MCUB co-expression patterns yields a broader hazard ratio range to more beneficial or poorer values. We have begun to investigate the effects of MCUB silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells and, similar to MCU and MICU1, MCUB siRNAs have little effect on the clonogenic survival at baseline or after therapy-related cellular stress. In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether the predicted increase in MCU activity that we see in gene expression datasets is indeed causative for poor patient prognosis in breast cancer patients.</p><p>The hypothesized importance of MCU activity in mitochondrial metabolism, ROS production, and adaptation to stress has been supported by our findings in HMEC and HeLa cells and in experiments using cells derived from cervical <xref rid="pone.0096866-Baughman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0096866-Mallilankaraman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, prostate, and colon cancers <xref rid="pone.0096866-Marchi1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and involved in pathophysiological responses such those occurring during cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury <xref rid="pone.0096866-Joiner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and neuronal excito-toxicity <xref rid="pone.0096866-Qiu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. MDA-MB-231 cells appear to have lost these MCU-mediated mechanisms and indicate that the requirement for mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake through MCU is not universal. In support of this notion, Pan, et al. recently reported that MCU knockout mice lack a robust phenotype <xref rid="pone.0096866-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similar to our observations, MEFs isolated from these knockout animals failed to show differences in apoptotic responses to a variety of agents, including ceramide, compared to WT mice. How MDA-MB-231 cells and MCU knockout mice have acquired the ability to adapt and survive independent of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter remains to be understood. Compensatory mechanisms may exist in these systems for maintaining basal mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels or within the downstream mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent signaling processes.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we find that the viability and proliferative capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells does not depend on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the uniporter complex. Inhibition and activation of MCU activity did not affect basal plating efficiency nor clonogenic survival in response to irradiation, the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel, the ER stress and apoptosis-inducing lipid ceramide, or nutrient withdrawal. Our data show targeting MCU channels may not be a reliable therapeutic option in treating all cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0096866.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
