</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recent genetic identification of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) [1], [2] and its associated regulatory subunit genes including MICU1 [3]â[5] now provide molecular targets for testing the functional relevance of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in specific cell types and disease states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial dysfunction is common to many pathological conditions, including cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cancer cells typically exhibit disease promoting characteristics linked to alterations in mitochondrial function, including increased glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and resistance to apoptotic stimuli [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is believed to be essential for stimulating oxidative phosphorylation [8], [9], and, if excessive, is thought to induce apoptosis through membrane permeability transition and induction of cell death pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Very little is known about mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation or its signaling in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The lack of cell membrane permeable pharmacological inhibitors of Ca2+ uptake has limited the ability to dissect these pathways but the recent characterization of MCU constituents has focused attention on critical components of the MCU complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Initial evidence suggests that cancer cells reduce MCU activity for increased survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Colon and prostate cancers overexpress a microRNA that appears to enable a pro-survival phenotype in part by targeting the MCU Ca2+ conducting pore subunit [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of MCU or knockdown of its auxiliary MICU1 subunit in HeLa cervical cancer cells results in constitutive mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and increases HeLa cell sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and ceramide toxicity [2], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, it is not known if breast cancer cells are sensitive to mitochondrial Ca2+ modulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We queried mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter subunit genes within the web based BreastMark algorithm with respect to how gene expression from breast cancer samples correlated with associated clinical outcomes [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A significantly poorer prognosis was associated with MCU over expression and MICU1 under expression (see Figure 1) suggesting the expression of Ca2+ uniporter subunits may play an important role in breast cancer biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As triple negative breast cancers lacking estrogen, progesterone, and EGF receptors are aggressive and resistant to current available therapies, we asked if altered mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could sensitize the highly aggressive triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell line to therapeutically relevant stresses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Despite the strong indication that the expression of the MCU and MICU1 mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter subunit genes within breast tumors would be valuable prognostic indicators for patient survival (Fig. 1), such a relationship did not manifest itself in our cell culture model using the aggressive and extensively studied MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>We were able to effectively inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by silencing endogenous MCU or by overexpression of a Ca2+ impermeant mutant of MCU and enhance influx by knocking down MICU1 or overexpressing WT MCU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to our findings in normal breast epithelial and HeLa cells, siRNA and adenoviral manipulations of uniporter activity did not readily translate into physiological phenotypes in MDA-MB-231 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>We found that modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter activity only subtly impinges on overall MDA-MB-231 cell survival and sensitivity to therapy-related stresses that rely on mitochondrial function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The lack of striking changes in the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to different cellular stresses including cytotoxicity, ionizing radiation, chemotherapy, and starvation suggest that these cells primarily utilize MCU-independent mechanisms for survival. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Our current results expand upon those from an initial report by Curry et al. who found breast tumors of basal origin have higher relative MCU mRNA expression compared to other tumor subtypes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Basal-like MDA-MB-231 cells with MCU knockdown exhibited increased apoptosis in response to ionomycin treatment that was found to act through a Ca2+-dependent, but caspase-independent cell death pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Our attempts to challenge MDA-MB-231 cells with a variety of cellular stress protocols suggest that survival and colony formation is not exquisitely sensitive to MCU modulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>We observed a modest increase in basal plating efficiency and protection from paclitaxel treatment with one, but not another, specific MCU siRNA and not after MICU1 knockdown (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>We interpret our findings to indicate MDA-MB-231 cell survival mechanisms are not dependent or only minimally dependent on MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>We were surprised that MICU1 knockdown did not show a clear phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells as it did in normal HMEC and HeLa cells similar to previous findings [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our observations that the clonogenic survival in response to ceramide depends on MICU1 in HMEC and HeLa cells, knockdown of MICU1 in HeLa and endothelial cells increases basal [Ca2+]m, prolongs [Ca2+]m transients, increases ROS production, increases the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, and decreases migration [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The increase in ceramide toxicity could be rescued by adenoviral expression of ROS scavenging enzymes showing an interdependence between elevated [Ca2+]m, ROS, and apoptotic agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Although we clearly reduced MICU1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells with our siRNA approach and facilitated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to cellular stimulation, we did not observe changes to basal mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration as measured by mt-Pericam, ROS levels, sensitivity to an array of stressors including ceramide treatment (Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>2â4) or changes in migration rate (DH, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The lack of phenotypic effects from MICU1 knockdown in our clonogenic assays may therefore be due to a deficient functional platform (i.e. unaltered basal [Ca2+]m and/or ROS levels) for these agents to elicit their effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>MDA-MB-231 cells appear to uncouple mitochondrial Ca2+ transport from other mitochondrial-responsive mechanisms as has been determined for other cell types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>MCU and MICU1 were the first of several uniporter channel subunits identified including MCUB [27], MCUR1 [28], EMRE [29], MICU2 [30], [31] and possibly MICU3 [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>How the macromolecular uniporter channel complex is expressed, assembled, and post-translationally regulated in different cells types and disease conditions remains to be discerned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the assembly of the MCU complex proteins is highly interdependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>We see that MCU knockdown decreases MICU1 protein abundance without affecting MICU1 mRNA levels but MICU1 silencing had no effect on MCU levels (Fig. 2B, C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>MCU knockout in HEK cells has been reported to reduce MCUB and EMRE protein levels, but not MICU1 abundance [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>MICU1 knockdown causes the concomitant decrease in MICU2 protein levels [29], [30], but not vice versa, uncovering a likely indirect role of MICU1 in eliminating the lower threshold of Ca2+ conductance through MCU [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Although MDA-MB-231 cell survival phenotypes fail to respond to MCU modulation, it does not exclude the possibility that other breast tumor cells may be sensitive to MCU inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Searching the BreastMark algorithm for other uniporter subunit genes as performed in Figure 1 further suggests that if protein abundance and activities of these subunits correlates with mRNA levels within tumor samples, the resulting effect on MCU activity would inversely correlate with patient outcome (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Both MCUB and EMRE have favorable hazard ratios similar to MICU1, while MCUR1 has a hazard ratio of 1.287. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>These values inversely correlate with the proposed functions of MCUB as an endogenous inhibitory subunit in MCU/MCUB heteromeric channels, EMRE as an essential factor for MCU to assemble with MICU1, and MCUR1 as a necessary member for MCU-dependent Ca2+ influx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, combinatorial searches for MCU, MICU1, and MCUB co-expression patterns yields a broader hazard ratio range to more beneficial or poorer values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>We have begun to investigate the effects of MCUB silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells and, similar to MCU and MICU1, MCUB siRNAs have little effect on the clonogenic survival at baseline or after therapy-related cellular stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In the future, it will be interesting to determine whether the predicted increase in MCU activity that we see in gene expression datasets is indeed causative for poor patient prognosis in breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The hypothesized importance of MCU activity in mitochondrial metabolism, ROS production, and adaptation to stress has been supported by our findings in HMEC and HeLa cells and in experiments using cells derived from cervical [1]â[4], prostate, and colon cancers [10] and involved in pathophysiological responses such those occurring during cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury [20] and neuronal excito-toxicity [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>MDA-MB-231 cells appear to have lost these MCU-mediated mechanisms and indicate that the requirement for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through MCU is not universal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In support of this notion, Pan, et al. recently reported that MCU knockout mice lack a robust phenotype [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Similar to our observations, MEFs isolated from these knockout animals failed to show differences in apoptotic responses to a variety of agents, including ceramide, compared to WT mice. </plain></SENT>
