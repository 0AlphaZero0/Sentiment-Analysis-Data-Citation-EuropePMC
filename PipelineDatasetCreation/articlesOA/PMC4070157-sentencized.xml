<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Background </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Dental caries is one of the major health problems in the world (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Its impact on individuals and communities as well as functional impairments and reduced quality of life are considerable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In many developing countries, treatment of dental caries in children would exceed the total child health care budget (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although different national preventive programs have significantly decreased the dental decay, caries still remain a major national public health problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Data from dental control and prevention centers shows that prevalence of untreated caries in primary dentition among 6-11 year-old US children is 25%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Almost 60% of 12 to 15-year-old children have had at least one carious tooth or a restoration and this increases to 78% by the age of 16 (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Data from surveys in Iran represent a marked decline in dental caries (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>An association between weight and oral health in children has had controversial results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>On one hand, consumption of soft drinks and fast food as well as lack of activity and exercise contributed to the increasing number of overweight individuals around the world (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Overweight children have been associated with prolonged exposure to carbohydrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Intake of refined carbohydrates especially sugars are well documented in the literature (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In a study by Willerhausen et al. 1290 elementary school children (648 boys, 642 girls) were examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The study showed that 3.6% of the children were underweight, 74.8% had normal weight, 11.9% were overweight, and 9.7% were obese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A significant association between high weight and caries frequency was observed (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, one Brazilian study concluded that there was no statistically significant association between dental caries and obesity in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (8). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although surveys on Iranians show improvements in oral health education and dental services, various regions of a country may have different dental caries frequencies compared to other parts due to different conditions and access to dental care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>No information on the association of BMI and dental caries is available from Zahedan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between BMI-for-age and dental status of primary school children in Zahedan, Iran. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Using a random cluster sampling, 12 girls and boys primary schools (classes I-V for children aged 6-11 years) in the study area with different social backgrounds were screened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>From a total of 1233 children at the beginning of the study, 20 children had chronic problems and were excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The body weights were recorded to the nearest 100 g using a standard beam balance scale (Seca). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Subjects had light dresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The scale was calibrated at the beginning of each working day and at frequent intervals throughout the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The body heights were recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm without shoes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>BMI-for-age [(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters) ²] was calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Underweight was defined as BMI-for-age &lt; 5th percentile, “normal” was defined as 5th percentile &lt; BMI-for-age &lt; 85th percentile, “at risk of overweight” was defined as 85th percentile &lt; BMI-for-age &lt; 95th percentile, and “Obese” was defined as BMI-for-age &gt; 95th percentile (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Clinical examinations were carried out by two dentists who used the WHO criteria for diagnosis of dental caries (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The DMFT (decayed, missing and filled teeth) values were also derived. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The examination was carried out using a plane mouth mirror and cotton rolls to remove any plaque or debris where necessary and recorded on special charts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>No radiographs were taken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>White spots were not considered as decayed in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Missing teeth were not marked correspondingly, since no definite statement could be made without proper anamnesis to determine whether the tooth really existed or not, or if an early extraction had taken place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>To estimate the caries frequency, the DFT (decay filling teeth) index was used for the permanent dentition since it gives a good insight into the state of decay in the patient (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Dental examinations of children were only conducted if a written consent was obtained from the parents and/or guardians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Calibration was made between two examiners. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>There have been no oral epidemiological studies determining the association between BMI and DFT in Zahedan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Considering this issue, the present study intended to provide such information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The studied subjects were 13% obese and overweight, 66% had normal weight, and 20% were underweight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our results showed a significant association between BMI-for-age and gender (more obese and overweight girls than boys; P = 0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>There was a slightly higher occurrence of carious lesions in girls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This research also revealed that only 37% children in overweight and obese groups were caries free. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Caries prevalence was substantially lower in children with increased tooth brushing (P = 0.0001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In a study by Hilgers KK et al. on 178 children aged 8 to 11 years, caries severity averages were analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the mean caries for permanent molars significantly increased with increased BMI, which is similar to our results (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In another study on 1290 elementary school children (648 boys and 642 girls) in Germany, the number of natural healthy teeth decreased with age (P = 0.001) and BMI (P = 0.0061) and was different between girls and boys (P = 0.0334). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated a significant association between caries frequency and weight in school children (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Another research on Turkish school children revealed that children with low body weight were at a higher risk of developing dental caries than overweight/obese children (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In an Iranian survey, the percentages of caries-free children (deciduous and permanent teeth) among 6 and 9 years old were reported as 13.8 and 11.5 respectively, and more than 50% of 12-year-old children had caries experience, with the decay component being the greatest cause. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Although improvement in DFT index was shown as marked decline in dental caries from DFT of 4 to 1.5 in 12-year-old children, the authors emphasized that the general level of oral health is still not satisfactory especially among children and recommended that interventions should be taken (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In another cross-sectional study in Iran, a total of 1003 children (6-11 years old) were screened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Most of the subjects were overweight and obese (16.9% and 67.1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant association between BMI-for-age and DFT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, 27.7%, 14% and 37.2% of children with normal weight, at risk of being overweight and overweight respectively, were caries free. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant association between BMI-for-age and being caries free (P = 0.0001) (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In addition, results of a study in Hamadan showed that the highest DFT was seen in normal weight and the lowest DFT in overweight children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>There was not a statistically significant relationship between high weight and caries frequency in the first and permanent dentitions (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Our study did not demonstrate a significant association between BMI-for-age and being caries free. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The results of our study showed that the number of tooth brushing sessions in a day could affect the DFT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Brushing three times was more effective than never in one day (1.09 ± 0.5 vs. 1.4 ± 1.3 respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Daily tooth brushing behaviors and age of brushing initiation with parental supervision have been reported by several studies as strong caries prevention methods (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In a research on elementary school children, prevalence of caries was substantially lower in children with increased tooth brushing (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In a prevalence study on 281 children aged 5 - 14 years, the frequency of tooth brushing and sweet consumption as well as their impacts on the prevalence of caries were studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The children who never brushed their teeth had a 40% chance of early caries, while those who brushed their teeth several times a day had a 15.3% chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The authors believed that the positive effect of tooth brushing was superior to that of a correct diet (18). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Finally, we analyzed the caries prevalence rates using DFT, but there were other factors such as cultural and hygienic habits (19) that we did not evaluate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>More studies in this regard are recommended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Determining other factors linked to dental caries is of great importance as they are temporal and geographic stability and as a tool to tailor proper health education campaigns to combat oral health problems especially among those who are in need. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate a possible association between high weight and caries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Besides numerous other risk factors, high weight can also be responsible for increased number of carious lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In future preventive programs, strategies should aim at nutrition control to avoid high weight as well as carries. </plain></SENT>
