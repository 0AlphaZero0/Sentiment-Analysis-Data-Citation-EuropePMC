Loop1 is a flexible piece of Pol&#x003bc; which has a critical role during terminal transferase and end-joining activities: it acts as a pseudo-template when the template strand is discontinuous or unavailable, whilst diffusing away if present to avoid steric clashes. Mutational analysis and inspection of the 3D structures available allowed us to identify a network of residues in charge of sensing the presence or absence of discontinuities in the template strand, which will in turn determine the final position adopted by Loop1. This network is formed by the previously uncharacterized thumb mini-loop (NSH motif) and the positively charged helix N, which contribute to the correct positioning of Loop1 and to juxtapose the discontinuous template strand during NHEJ of incompatible ends. Accordingly, single mutation of specific conserved residues in these motifs, whilst irrelevant in most of the cases for gap filling, largely affected terminal transferase and end-joining activities. Other point mutations in the &#x02018;hinges&#x02019; of Loop1, such as residues Phe<sup>385</sup> or Phe<sup>389</sup>, corroborated the flexibility requirements of this motif.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Template instruction is a general feature of most members of the human X family of polymerases, with the exception of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). TdT is the only known deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase that is strictly DNA template independent, as it is able to add nucleotides to a DNA primer molecule only in the absence of a template chain. This feature is crucial for its function in V(D)J recombination, where TdT generates variability as it creates new information (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Interestingly, Pol&#x003bc; shows hybrid biochemical properties: it has an intrinsic terminal transferase activity, but it is strongly activated by a template DNA chain to insert both deoxy- and ribonucleotides (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>The structural and functional basis of the template independence of TdT was understood with the resolution of the crystal structure of the Pol&#x000df;-like core of TdT (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A loop region between &#x003b2;-strands 3 and 4, referred to as Loop1, has a similar position in all three TdT structures and is located in a region of the DNA binding cleft that would normally be occupied by the template strand. Therefore, this loop could occlude binding of any DNA substrate possessing a template strand, explaining TdT inactivity on these substrates. On that basis, and by extrapolation of the structural model of TdT to Pol&#x003bc;, it was predicted that Loop1, specifically present in these two enzymes, could be directly responsible for their template-independent terminal transferase activity. In Pol&#x003bc;, however, Loop1 must be flexible enough to allow template-directed polymerization, being fully dispensable for gap filling (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In agreement with this prediction, when the crystal structure of Pol&#x003bc; bound to a gaped DNA was solved (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the DNA duplex was bound in the usual fashion within the DNA binding cleft, whereas Loop1 was disordered suggesting conformational flexibility. It was then clear that Pol&#x003bc; Loop1 cannot occupy the same position as that of TdT when a template strand is present. A comparison of the ends of the &#x000df;-strands flanking the loop shows that TdT's Loop1 extrudes towards the DNA binding cleft, whilst that of Pol&#x003bc; appears to turn away from the cleft. Although no crystal structure is available of Pol&#x003bc; with a single-stranded or 3&#x02032;-protruding DNA substrate, it is likely that Loop1 would then be found in the same conformation as in TdT, i.e. interacting with the primer strand, somehow mimicking a &#x02018;pseudo&#x02019; template strand. The structural evidence suggested that Loop1 in Pol&#x003bc; may adopt different conformations depending on the nature of the substrate. Studies including the Loop1 chimeras of Pol&#x003bc; (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and TdT (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) confirmed this hypothesis: replacement of the TdT Loop1 with that of Pol&#x003bc; is sufficient to allow template-dependent additions, whilst the reciprocal chimera (Pol&#x003bc; with the TdT Loop1) is much less inclined to perform template-dependent additions. The importance of this structural feature is emphasized by its possible role as a regulatory element of the most mutagenic Pol&#x003bc; activities during the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The equivalent regions in Pol&#x000df; and Pol&#x003bb; would be less likely to interfere with binding of the template strand because they have a much shorter Loop1: small enough in Pol&#x000df; to be described as a turn, and of intermediate length in Pol&#x003bb;. When Loop1 in Pol&#x003bc; is shortened to a length similar to that of Pol&#x003bb;, the altered polymerase has higher catalytic efficiency on template-containing substrates, but is incapable of template-independent synthesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Consistent with all this, Pol&#x003bb; has strongly reduced ability to catalyze template-independent synthesis, but retains the ability to perform template-instructed additions. Pol&#x003bb; Loop1 may be involved in a function somehow related to that in Pol&#x003bc;: modulation of fidelity by controlling deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)-induced movements of the template strand and 3&#x02032;-primer terminus in the transition from an inactive to an active conformation of the enzyme (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Both Pol&#x003bc; and Pol&#x003bb; have been involved in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. Compelling evidence indicates that the NHEJ pathway minimizes loss of genetic material by using any template available (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>). To achieve this, highly specialized polymerases perform &#x02018;alignment-based gap fill-in&#x02019; by dealing with two DNA ends: one providing the primer (a protruding 3&#x02032;-OH) and a second DNA molecule (with a recessive 5&#x02032;-P and a 3&#x02032;-protruding template strand) providing a template <italic>in trans</italic> (the present study does not focus on blunt or 5&#x02032;-protruding ends since these do not require specialized polymerases to be repaired). Our previous studies indicate that one Pol&#x003bc; monomer is able to bind both sides of the break at once (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). But the opportunity to act during NHEJ is dictated by the enzyme's template preference, a property that follows a gradient ranging from Pol&#x000df;, which only polymerizes on substrates with a continuous template strand; to Pol&#x003bb;, which is active in NHEJ only when the template strand is stabilized by complementarity with the primer strand; to Pol&#x003bc;, which can direct template-instructed primer extension even when there is no base pairing between the two ends; to TdT, which also acts on unpaired primer termini but does not allow the use of a template strand [reviewed in (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)]. It has been suggested that this variable degree of template dependence relies on structural differences amongst the four polymerases. In this work, we have deciphered some of these structural determinants, in particular a network of interactions for substrate recognition and end-bridging, conferring Pol&#x003bc; the unique handiness of <italic>trans</italic>-polymerizing without the help of a single base pair connection amongst the two DNA ends. This network is formed by the previously uncharacterized thumb mini-loop (NSH motif) and the positively charged helix N. The role of Loop1 during these nucleotide additions has been treated in depth here, including a highly detailed study of how Pol&#x003bc; fixes and/or orients this mobile part of the protein in accordance with the substrate on which it is polymerizing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>DNA and proteins</title><p>Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Isogen (Ijsselstein, Holland).

This subdomain could be resolved in the crystal structure of TdT, but not in that of Pol&#x003bc;. Supplementary Figure S1A shows a superimposition of the conformation adopted by Loop1 of TdT in the murine apoenzyme (PDB ID: 1JMS), modelled on the ternary structure of murine Pol&#x003bc; with gaped DNA and incoming nucleotide (PDB ID: 2IHM, wheat). In agreement with its location in the core structure, Loop1 has been implicated in the terminal transferase activity of human Pol&#x003bc; (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and in NHEJ of non-complementary ends assisted by accessory factors (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). To corroborate the importance of Loop1 for the bridging activity inherent to human Pol&#x003bc; we tested a Loop1-deletion mutant [Pol&#x003bc;-&#x00394;loop1; (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)] that lacks amino acids 369 to 385. It has been previously shown that binding of 5&#x02032;P-containing gaped substrates by Pol&#x003bc;-&#x00394;loop1 is even higher than that displayed by the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that Loop1 is dispensable and even detrimental for binding to template-containing substrates perhaps via steric hindrance (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Wild-type Pol&#x003bc; can form two different complexes when binding a 5&#x02032;P-containing 3&#x02032;-protruding substrate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The first shifted band corresponds to the binding to one DNA molecule (with the protrusion oriented as template), whilst the second band likely represents the synapsis of two DNA molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Mutant Pol&#x003bc;-&#x00394;loop1 was able to bind the downstream side of the break (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>); however, the synapsis could not be stably formed in the absence of Loop1, not even in the presence of metal and incoming nucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Moreover, the activity of this mutant was undetectable in NHEJ assays, both with complementary and non-complementary ends, even using substrates that can form two and three base pairs of complementarity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, top panel). Having shown that Loop1 is dispensable for binding the 5&#x02032;P-containing DNA as a downstream end, the defective NHEJ reaction observed can only be explained if Loop1 plays a role in the correct juxtaposition of the incoming end acting as a primer, in line with the EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) results. NHEJ by this mutant was partially recovered when using manganese as activating metal ion. However, we realized that the substrate preference for the mutant lacking Loop1 changes with respect to the wild-type enzyme: the mutant version achieves better NHEJ mediated by longer connections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lower panel; as would be expected due to the help of complementary base pairing), whilst wild-type Pol&#x003bc; strikingly prefers the shortest 3&#x02032;-overhangs over longer ones, even in the presence of manganese (3 and 4 nts; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, middle and lower panels). Therefore, Loop1 appears to be conferring the unique Pol&#x003bc; property of bridging ends with very short overhangs. This observation also implies that a minimal distance between the two gaps formed during end joining allows the optimal location, and thus performance, of Loop1. This proposal is supported by the available crystal structures of TdT and Pol&#x003bc;. Supplementary Figure S1B and C show two different versions of the superimposition described above: in (B), the DNA substrate has been modified to show a 2-nt 3&#x02032;-protruding substrate bound as a template/primer, a scenario in which Loop1 would help to maintain the orientation of the primer strand to achieve the untemplated addition of an incoming nucleotide, shown in blue; in (C), the original DNA substrate is lacking template bases A6 and T7 in order to mimic two non-complementary NHEJ substrates: the &#x02018;template end&#x02019; having a 3&#x02032; overhang of 1 nucleotide (purple) and the &#x02018;primer end&#x02019; with a 2-nt 3&#x02032;-protrusion (green). As we show here, Loop1 would fit in the space corresponding to -1 and -2 positions of a continuous template strand, and, therefore, it could be conveniently positioned to help preferential bridging of NHEJ substrates with very short overhangs.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Loop1 confers Pol&#x003bc; its NHEJ efficiency on short 3&#x02032;-overhangs.

Recent data have shown that mutation of Phe<sup>401</sup> to alanine in TdT strongly reduced the terminal transferase activity of the polymerase and, strikingly, allowed templated addition of nucleotides, turning a completely template-independent enzyme into a DNA-instructed DNA polymerase (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Our explanation of these results is that by mutating this residue the network of interactions needed to maintain a fixed orientation of TdT Loop1 is abolished, and Loop1 is now endowed with a greater degree of flexibility, as in Pol&#x003bc;, thus allowing TdT to accept a template strand. Despite the sequence conservation of this phenylalanine between TdT (Phe<sup>401</sup>) and Pol&#x003bc; (Phe<sup>385</sup>), there might not be a functional conservation, since the second phenylalanine involved in TdT (Phe<sup>385</sup>) is not present in Pol&#x003bc; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, bottom panels: left for top view, right for frontal view). To investigate this difference, we decided to mutate Phe<sup>385</sup> in Pol&#x003bc; to glycine in order to establish its putative role in the terminal transferase and NHEJ activities of Pol&#x003bc;. As a control, we firstly confirmed that elimination of the aromatic ring (by substitution of Phe<sup>385</sup> into a glycine) does not affect Pol&#x003bc;'s gap-filling activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Terminal transferase activity of mutant F385G, on the other hand, was largely abolished when compared to wild-type Pol&#x003bc; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), thus confirming that this residue has a specific role in the catalytic cycle only when a template strand is not available. Next, we tested this mutation on NHEJ assays, in which the DNA substrates contain discontinuities not only in the primer strand but also in the template strand in a position that Loop1 might help to coordinate. Interestingly, the activity of the enzyme was lower than that of the wild-type Pol&#x003bc;, but only on non-complementary ends (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, bottom panel), whose end-joining is a hallmark of Pol&#x003bc;.</p><p>Phe<sup>389</sup> is specifically conserved amongst Pol&#x003bc;s and TdTs (Phe<sup>405</sup> in murineTdT) of different species (Supplementary Figure S2A), and in both cases it could be involved in maintaining the structure of the bordering region of Loop1, thus probably affecting the shape and orientation of this motif (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, purple). Mutation of this residue (Phe<sup>405</sup>) to alanine in murine TdT abolishes terminal transferase activity and allows templated insertion of only one nucleotide on a template/primer substrate (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). We decided to mutate the equivalent human Pol&#x003bc; residue (Phe<sup>389</sup>) to leucine (the amino acid present in human Pol&#x003bb; and in some Pol&#x003bc;s from other species) to demonstrate its importance during the catalytic cycle of human Pol&#x003bc;. We also made the double mutation F389G/R387K, which could be expected to have a boosted terminal transferase activity [single mutant R387K increases this activity by up to 100-fold (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)]. Both mutants were tested for gap-filling activity and, as showed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, the double mutant was affected when compared to the wild-type Pol&#x003bc;. The expected implication of Phe<sup>389</sup> in the ability of Pol&#x003bc; to catalyze untemplated nucleotide additions was confirmed by testing the terminal transferase activity of these mutants: it was drastically abolished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), also in the case of the double mutant, which is specially noticeable since this enzyme also contains the R387K mutation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). When NHEJ activity was assayed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), the two mutants were completely negative, as expected from an affected orientation of Loop1 and the consequent lack of coordination of the DNA substrates during this kind of reactions.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>The thumb mini-loop: flexibility of Loop1</title><p>By analysing the available structures of TdT (PDB IDs: 1JMS, 1KEJ and 1KDH) we noticed that a second loop, located in the thumb subdomain, is establishing interactions with Loop1. This thumb &#x02018;mini-loop&#x02019; contains several conserved residues responsible for these interactions, amongst them the invariant Asp<sup>473</sup>, Asn<sup>474</sup> and His<sup>475</sup> in murine TdT (Supplementary Figure S2B, DNH motif). This thumb mini-loop is also present in Pol&#x003bc;, but the sequence is not strictly conserved (Supplementary Figure S2B, NSH motif). The only invariant residue is the histidine, His<sup>459</sup> in human Pol&#x003bc;. Whereas the other two residues present in the murine TdT sequence, Asp<sup>473</sup> and Asn<sup>474</sup>, are an asparagine (Asn<sup>457</sup>) and a serine (Ser<sup>458</sup>), respectively, in human Pol&#x003bc; (Supplementary Figure S2B).</p><p>In TdT, Asp<sup>473</sup> seems to be involved in maintaining the general conformation of this mini-loop through interactions with other residues in the motif (Asn<sup>474</sup>, Ala<sup>476</sup>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Asn<sup>474</sup> changes very slightly its orientation in the three TdT crystals available, but this minor movement is enough to allow different interactions in each case: in the Apo structure this residue is interacting with Glu<sup>457</sup>, a residue that is only at contact distance in the apoenzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left panel); in the NTP-bound structure, Asn<sup>474</sup> is contacting Trp<sup>450</sup> probably due to its stacking against the incoming nucleotide that slightly affects its position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, central panel); finally, in the TdT-ssDNA co-crystal, this asparagine is not making any contacts, since none of its partners is available for interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, right panel). In TdT, His<sup>475</sup> is establishing a strong network of direct interactions with Loop1, through residues Glu<sup>386</sup> and Lys<sup>387</sup> or Lys<sup>389</sup>, depending on the crystal structure studied. His<sup>475</sup> also makes direct interactions with residue Arg<sup>442</sup>. There is one TdT crystal in which part of Loop1 (corresponding to the residues involved in these interactions) is not observed in the electron density: the binary complex with incoming nucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, central panel), in which His<sup>475</sup> has rotated and now this stabilizing network is disrupted.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The thumb &#x02018;mini-loop&#x02019; (NSH motif).

The available Pol&#x003bc; structure in complex with a gaped substrate and incoming nucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) includes two monomers in the unit cell, and the two of them show different states and interactions of residue His<sup>459</sup> (the counterpart of His<sup>475</sup> in TdT): in one of the monomers it is interacting with Glu<sup>386</sup> from Loop1, perhaps mimicking the function of the His<sup>475</sup>/Phe<sup>385</sup> pair in TdT, but in the other it is contacting Asn<sup>457</sup> (the counterpart of Asp<sup>473</sup> in TdT). This interaction between His<sup>459</sup> and Asn<sup>457</sup> seems to be capturing the histidine and preventing its interaction with Glu<sup>386</sup> in Loop1, probably allowing it to be repositioned in a different conformation to allow binding of a template strand. When the template strand is not present (terminal transferase) or is discontinuous (NHEJ), His<sup>459</sup> might help in stabilizing Loop1 through alternative interactions, in a position more similar to that observed in the TdT crystals. Interestingly, when His<sup>459</sup> is interacting with Glu<sup>386</sup>, Asn<sup>457</sup> directly contacts the template strand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, monomer A). Given the predicted importance of the NSH motif we obtained mutants H459G (to abolish the function), N457D, S458N, and the double mutation N457D/S458N in order to mimic the residues present in TdT in this area.</p><p>The behaviour of these mutants in gap-filling activity (i.e. in the presence of a continuous template strand) was different in each case: mutant N457D had lower activity than the wild type on this substrate, in agreement with its observed interaction with the template strand; S458N, double mutants N457D/S458N and H459G were able to perform gap filling as the wild-type Pol&#x003bc; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). When testing terminal transferase activity, mutant S458N was the only one that displayed a similar level of activity to that of the wild-type enzyme with any of the four dNTPs. Strikingly, both the single and double mutants having the change N457D were exclusively affected in the addition of dA nucleotide units, having wild-type levels of terminal transferase activity with dC, dG and dT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The long (dA)n products produced by the wild-type Pol&#x003bc; have been interpreted mainly as the result of DNA-templated incorporation, allowed by the connection of a dA-extended PolydT (via terminal transferase) with another PolydT molecule, now acting as template [(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); see scheme in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>]. Therefore, it is very likely that mutation N457D is not affecting terminal transferase, but precludes the connection/synapsis step that is allowing template-directed incorporation of deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). This implies that the DNA ligand function of Asn<sup>457</sup> observed in a DNA gap is crucial for synapsis of complementary ends during NHEJ. Conversely, mutant H459G maintained normal levels of dA incorporation on PolydT, whilst addition of the other three dNTPs (via terminal transferase) was significantly inhibited. That would be in agreement with a role of His<sup>459</sup> in maintaining the appropriate orientation of Loop1 for terminal transferase, but it appears not to be critical for the function of Loop1 during synapsis of two complementary ends.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Mutations in the thumb &#x02018;mini-loop&#x02019; (NSH motif) of human Pol&#x003bc; specifically affect terminal transferase and NHEJ.

Interestingly, double mutant N457D/S458N, which had a wild-type behaviour on gap-filling reactions, was completely unable to perform NHEJ of both complementary and non-complementary ends.

Arg<sup>442</sup> and Arg<sup>445</sup> (present in Pol&#x003bc;, TdT, Pol&#x003bb; and Pol&#x000df; enzymes from different species; Supplementary Figure S2C) are analogous to Arg<sup>514</sup> and Arg<sup>517</sup> in human Pol&#x003bb;, which trigger both the DNA motion and the thumb loop motion (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), Arg<sup>517</sup> also controlling fidelity at least in <italic>in silico</italic> simulations (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In human Pol&#x000df;, Arg<sup>283</sup> (analogous to Pol&#x003bb; Arg<sup>517</sup> and Pol&#x003bc; Arg<sup>445</sup>) is also important for fidelity (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Arg<sup>442</sup> and Arg<sup>445</sup> in Pol&#x003bc; interact with the DNA template through a series of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), in a similar manner to the interactions established in Pol&#x003bb;. This may suggest the importance of Arg<sup>442</sup> and Arg<sup>445</sup> in maintaining the active (ternary) form of Pol&#x003bc;, via stabilization of the DNA template, especially in those situations in which the template strand is discontinuous. Arg<sup>445</sup> may participate in the active-site assembly when an incorrect nucleotide exists at the active site, as suggested by the similar fidelity checking function of Arg<sup>517</sup> in Pol&#x003bb; or Arg<sup>283</sup> in Pol&#x000df;. In a recent publication (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), molecular dynamics simulations of Pol&#x003bc; showed that Arg<sup>445</sup> affects the conformation of Loop1, and thus may be important for maintaining the Loop1&#x02013;DNA interactions that are crucial for template-independent synthesis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Pol&#x003bc; Arg<sup>446</sup> is not conserved in Pol&#x000df; or Pol&#x003bb;, where an alanine occupies the corresponding location, but it is conserved in TdT.

Arg<sup>449</sup> is interacting with the template strand and is strictly conserved only amongst Pol&#x003bc;s of different species, and not in the other three members of the family, and thus might have a special role in Pol&#x003bc;-specific functions.

As expected, mutants in Arg<sup>442</sup> were affected in their activity levels, whilst mutants in Arg<sup>445</sup> and Arg<sup>449</sup> displayed wild-type activity on this substrate. We then tested our hypothesis that the template-stabilizing function of these residues could be decisive when dealing with NHEJ substrates. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>, all the mutants were completely negative for end-joining reactions, either with complementary ends or with two different non-complementary ends, providing either a strong (C) or a weak (T) templating base (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), a situation in which the terminal transferase activity of Pol&#x003bc; can contribute to create connectivity between the two ends. These results clearly emphasize the need for a perfectly orchestrated synapsis, in which all the elements (two DNA ends and incoming nucleotide) must be in proper register for catalysis.</p><p>In order to analyse if these residues are selectively implicated in orientation of the template strand or whether they could also be implicated in interactions with other DNA substrates or amino acid motifs in the polymerase, the mutants were tested for terminal transferase addition of nucleotides on a homopolymeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) substrate (poly-dA). Strikingly, mutants R442A and R445A showed very low or undetectable levels of terminal transferase activity, in the presence of any of the four dNTPs, in comparison to the wild-type Pol&#x003bc; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>). On the other hand, mutant R442K, in which the charge of the residue is conserved but not its shape or length, and R449, which is the residue located further away from the substrate, still displayed some terminal transferase activity.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the strong phenotype of mutants R442A and R445A in a reaction not involving a template strand could be their implication in stabilizing Loop1 as a template-mimicking structure, as already predicted in the molecular dynamics studies for Arg<sup>445</sup> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis is the observation that Arg<sup>442</sup> and Arg<sup>445</sup> are conserved in TdT (Arg<sup>458</sup> and Arg<sup>461</sup>), and even though in the crystal structures available there is no direct interaction between any of these arginines and Loop1, they are forming part of a network of interactions probably affecting the final position and orientation of Loop1. As described above, there is a mini-loop located in the thumb subdomain of TdT and Pol&#x003bc;, which appears to be implicated in stabilizing Loop1 in the position of the missing template strand. Interestingly, Pol&#x003bc; residues Arg<sup>446</sup> and Arg<sup>449</sup> interact through water molecules with residue Asn<sup>457</sup> from the thumb mini-loop, which in turn interacts with His<sup>459</sup> that is contacting Phe<sup>385</sup> and/or Glu<sup>386</sup>, at the base of Loop1 in Pol&#x003bc; (Supplementary Figure S3, left panel). It is worth noting that in TdT a similar network is also found, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3, right panel.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>One of the structural features that is crucial for Pol&#x003bc; function in NHEJ is a mobile domain, named Loop1, whose 3D analysis is still insufficient due to the lack of a crystal structure corresponding to an NHEJ intermediate. Conversely, several crystal structures of TdT (the closest Pol&#x003bc; homologue) either as apoenzyme or bound to ssDNA and nucleotide substrates allowed visualization of Loop1 in a stabilized position that would interfere with the binding of a template DNA strand, but compatible with its importance for terminal transferase activity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In this study, we have made point mutations in human Pol&#x003bc; residues Phe<sup>385</sup> and Phe<sup>389</sup>, located at the bordering regions of Loop1, guided by their conservation at the primary sequence level and by comparison of the available crystal structures of TdT and Pol&#x003bc;. Phe<sup>401</sup> of TdT (corresponding to Phe<sup>385</sup> in Pol&#x003bc;) is involved in maintaining the fixed position of Loop1 via a strong stacking interaction between its aromatic ring and His<sup>475</sup> (His<sup>459</sup> in Pol&#x003bc;), located in a mini-loop at the thumb subdomain. Mutant F401A in TdT had a striking phenotype, turning a completely template-independent enzyme into a DNA-instructed DNA polymerase (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). This mutation clearly disrupted the network of interactions needed to maintain a fixed orientation of TdT Loop1, now endowed with a greater degree of flexibility as it is in Pol&#x003bc;, thus allowing TdT to accept a template strand. Mutation F385G in Pol&#x003bc;, whilst not affecting templated additions, largely abolishes the terminal transferase activity of Pol&#x003bc;, thus confirming that Phe<sup>385</sup> has a specific role in the catalytic cycle only when a template strand is not available. Similar results were reached by Moon <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> by mutating Phe<sup>385</sup> to alanine in a recent study (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Phe<sup>389</sup> is again conserved amongst Pol&#x003bc;s and TdTs (Phe<sup>405</sup>) of different species, and in both cases it seems to be involved in maintaining the shape and orientation of Loop1. Mutation of this residue to alanine in TdT abolished terminal transferase activity and allowed templated insertion of only one nucleotide on a template/primer substrate (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The expected implication of Phe<sup>389</sup> (the equivalent Pol&#x003bc; residue) in the ability of Pol&#x003bc; to catalyze untemplated nucleotide additions has been confirmed here by testing the terminal transferase activity of point mutants in this residue: it was completely abolished, also in the case of the double mutant F389G/R387K, something that is specially noticeable since this enzyme also contains the R387K mutation that, alone, boosts terminal transferase activity by 100-fold (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In a second approach to study this &#x02018;Loop1 network&#x02019;, we mutated the conserved residues in a mini-loop (NSH motif) located in the thumb subdomain. In TdT, this mini-loop (DNH motif) is interacting with Loop1 through His<sup>475</sup>, conserved in Pol&#x003bc; (His<sup>459</sup>). This mini-loop is also present in the other members of the X family, but its function is different: residues from this loop directly interact with the template strand. In Pol&#x003bc; the role of this loop is dual: depending on the substrate used and the desired conformation of Loop1, this mini-loop may interact with the template strand (through Asn<sup>457</sup>) or with Loop1 (through His<sup>459</sup>). Accordingly, the asparagine is only needed during templated additions, and was dispensable for terminal transferase activity of Pol&#x003bc;, whilst the histidine mutation had the opposite effect. We propose a regulatory function for the NSH motif of the thumb mini-loop in Pol&#x003bc;: helping to accommodate either the template strand (as in Pol&#x000df; of Pol&#x003bb;) or Loop1 (as in TdT) as suits best for each individual situation.</p><p>Regarding the downstream template binding, Pol&#x003bc; has a positively charged helix that holds the phosphate backbone by means of four arginine residues. Of this four positive charges, only two are conserved in Pol&#x003bb; or Pol&#x000df;, which contribute to fidelity via their interaction with the template of the nascent base pair (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref>). In Pol&#x003bb;, these residues seem to be involved in controlling the motion of part of the thumb occurring during the transition from the binary (E:DNA) to the ternary (E:DNA:dNTP) complex (&#x000ae;-strand 8), which has the pursued effect of bringing the template strand closer to the thumb into its final catalytic position (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). A proposal that these residues play a similar role in Pol&#x003bc; was initially supported by molecular dynamics simulations (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our results further confirm this hypothesis, both using substrates with continuous template such as DNA gaps, which are correctly configured on their own, but specifically and more drastically during stabilization of two DNA ends during NHEJ. Our results indicate that these arginines do not contribute too much to general binding to the downstream end, given that the presence of the 5&#x02032;-P group will provide the binding strength, but most likely these arginines are implicated in the bridging and positioning of the DNA substrates in a proper register to maximize efficiency and fidelity during NHEJ by Pol&#x003bc;. Based on our results with single-stranded substrates we are able to propose a second function for this arginine-containing helix: by establishing indirect interactions with the thumb mini-loop, it could be improving the stabilization of Loop1 in the case of maximal closure, i.e. during terminal transferase addition of nucleotides as well as during NHEJ reactions involving non-complementary ends. In this last scenario the involvement of the arginine helix could be dual, mediating protein&#x02013;protein as well as protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. This idea is further supported by new rounds of molecular dynamics in which these residues were individually mutated to alanine (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>): these simulations, in the first place, displayed a conformation of the template strand similar to that observed for the binary complex in Pol&#x003bb;, demonstrating <italic>in silico</italic> the effect of these positive charges in pulling the downstream part of the substrate to its correct position; secondly, the final distance between Loop1 (modelled for the simulations) and the arginine helix is unusually large, and the former is in a conformation that may hamper its interactions with the DNA substrate.</p><p>Thus, having already discussed the roles of Loop1, the thumb mini-loop and the arginine helix, during untemplated additions and also during catalysis on discontinuous substrates, it seems now clear that these three portions of Pol&#x003bc; work coordinately, and together with another residue, His<sup>329</sup>, are involved in the terminal transferase and end-joining mechanisms (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In Pol&#x003bc;, Loop1 is considered to be a highly flexible piece that could eventually adopt an indefinite number of conformations, but we argue that this is not so. At the time this manuscript was being finished for publication, a new set of crystal structures of human Pol&#x003bc;, including the apoenzyme, was obtained (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), This last one, although not showing the full conformation of Loop1 due to its flexibility, indicates that it would be anchored close to the active site, in a manner similar to that of TdT Loop1, where it would preclude binding of a template strand. The movements of His<sup>329</sup> throughout the catalytic cycle can also be observed in these structures, and they are in agreement with our predictions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), i.e. His<sup>329</sup> points towards the active site only when primer and incoming nucleotide are present, whereas in the apoenzyme and pre- and post-catalytic binary complexes (with gaped and nicked DNA, respectively), this residue is oriented outwards and is not establishing any interactions via the side chain. The apoenzyme structure also fully supports our current findings since Phe<sup>385</sup> and even His<sup>381</sup> from Loop1 are found to be interacting with the thumb mini-loop. These interactions explain the dual phenotype observed with our NSH motif mutants: Asn<sup>457</sup> is very important for NHEJ since it can interact with both His<sup>381</sup> in Loop1 and Arg<sup>445</sup> in the arginine helix, being the central connector of this network. His<sup>459</sup>, on the other hand, is mainly interacting with residues in Loop1 but not in the arginine helix, and thus its mutation would partially affect only one side of the network, primarily needed for untemplated additions.</p><p>Based on all these data, we propose that Loop1 would maintain a fixed (TdT-like) initial position in a binary complex in which the DNA substrate (either ssDNA or a double-stranded DNA end containing long [+3 nt] 3&#x02032;-protrusions and no 5&#x02032;-phosphate group) is extended via untemplated insertions; in this case His<sup>381</sup> could even act as a pseudo-template residue to help stabilize the primer terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, left panel). In contrast, when Pol&#x003bc; binds a substrate containing a continuous template strand (i.e. a gap), Loop1 would become more disordered. This would probably be due to the new Loop1&#x02013;NSH motif interaction (Glu<sup>386</sup>-His<sup>459</sup>) substituting that in the apoenzyme (Phe<sup>385</sup>-His<sup>459</sup>) and to the labile nature of other interactions keeping it in place (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, middle panel). A similar transition occurs even in the case of the smaller Loop1 present in Pol&#x003bb;: as dNTP binding induces the transition from binary to a ternary complex, &#x003b2;-strands &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b2;4 partially unravel to form Loop1, a nine-residue loop that repositions as the DNA template strand assumes its active conformation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In fact, one of the initial &#x000df;-strands is occupying the path that is filled by the template strand in the ternary complex. Finally, when Pol&#x003bc; binds two 3&#x02032;-protruding NHEJ substrates, Loop1 needs to adopt a third conformation of inherent flexibility, to accommodate and stabilize the several possible locations and lengths of the gap formed in the template strand after synapsis. Direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions with the thumb mini-loop, and indirect ones with the arginine helix, would assist Loop1 to be positioned in the correct orientation needed in each case (Supplementary Figure S3). In the specific case of non-complementary ends that form 1-nt gaps after synapsis, this network would be of special importance to keep the discontinuous template strand in frame, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> (right panel). Binding of the downstream end (through the 5&#x02032;-P group) would cause the rearrangement of the arginines in helix N, and both Arg<sup>449</sup> and Arg<sup>445</sup> would be in a perfect position to contact the thumb mini-loop at Asn<sup>457</sup>. These three residues would be in charge of stabilizing the 1-nt gap formed in the template strand, whilst His<sup>459</sup> and Ser<sup>458</sup> would contact Loop1 to keep it in the right conformation.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>The &#x02018;Loop1 network&#x02019;: regulating the terminal transferase and NHEJ activities of Pol&#x003bc; through correct positioning of Loop1.
