To date, the functional and biological significance of defensin-2 as a rickettsiastatic or rickettsiacidal antimicrobial peptide has not been addressed. In a previous study, defensin-2 transcription was shown to increase in <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> ticks challenged with <italic>Rickettsia montanensis</italic>. In the present study, the hypothesis that defensin-2 is functional as a rickettsiastatic and/or rickettsiacidal antimicrobial peptide is tested. We show that defensin-2 plays a role in reducing burden after acquisition of <italic>Rickettsia montanensis</italic> through capillary feeding.

The tick innate immune system has probably contributed significantly to their success as hosts and vectors. The tick immune system is characterized as having both cell-mediated and humoral defence components (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Kop&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Cell-mediated defence involves phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign microbes that infiltrate the hemocoel (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Eggenberger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Ceraul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) The humoral arm of the defence response is driven by soluble antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are presumably secreted from the haemocytes and fat body into the hemocoel or from the midgut epithelium. AMPs can attack invading microbes through opsonization, agglutination, and/or lysing (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Kop&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The tick midgut is the first point of contact for rickettsiae imbibed with a bloodmeal from an infected mammal. As the American dog tick, <italic>Dermacentor&#x02009;variabilis</italic>, imbibes a rickettsia-infected blood meal, genes encoding a number of AMPs and bacteriostatic factors are activated for transcription and translation, including defensin and <italic>D.&#x02009;variabilis</italic> kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Ceraul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Defensins are a ubiquitous class of AMPs that are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, virus and protozoans (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Dugan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Smith &#x00026; Nemerow, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Kop&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Tick defensins are 4&#x02013;6.5&#x02009;kDa cationic and anionic peptides with a secondary structure comprising &#x003b1;-helical and &#x003b2;-sheet structures that form a tertiary structure by way of three disulphide bonds (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Kop&#x000e1;&#x0010d;ek <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2011</xref>). Tick defensins also posses a &#x003b3;-core within the C-terminus (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2011</xref>). The &#x003b3;-core is a feature common to defensins regardless of species and is responsible for their antimicrobial activities (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">Yount &#x00026; Yeaman, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2011</xref>). The cationic charge, amphipathicity and &#x003b3;-core have been shown to mediate attraction, attachment and membrane insertion that facilitate the toroidal pore, barrel-stave or carpet mechanisms of pore-forming action by AMPs such as defensin (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">Yount &#x00026; Yeaman, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Brogden, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ticks are second only to dipterans in their importance as vectors of pathogens in humans and are the number one vector of pathogens of veterinary importance (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Parola <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Some of the most detrimental human tick-borne pathogens are members of the spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFG). SFG rickettsiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that replicate in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host cells and are transmitted by ticks. Although experimental studies suggest that there are some lethal effects associated with infection in <italic>D.&#x02009;variabilis</italic> by the aetiological agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, <italic>Rickettsia rickettsia</italic>, it is successfully acquired, maintained and transmitted both horizontally and vertically in nature (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Niebylski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that even if ticks suffer long-term morbidity as a result of infection, they can control rickettsial infections long enough to transmit the pathogens, thereby perpetuating the zoonotic cycle.</p><p>Previous studies show that challenge of <italic>D.&#x02009;variabilis</italic> with SFG <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> results in activation of defensin-1 and -2 and lysozyme (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Ceraul <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that defensin-2 is functionally active against <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic>. Experiments demonstrate that <italic>D.&#x02009;variabilis</italic> defensin-2 associates with and causes cytoplasmic leakage of <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic>. The present results suggest that defensin-2 function is one factor that limits <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> infection of the tick.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Defensin limits <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Purified <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup>), incubated with recombinant defensin, thioredoxin or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), were placed on L929 cells, allowed to infect, and collected 24&#x02009;h later. Rickettsial burden was assessed with quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). There was no significant difference between the two control treatments. The average burden in the recombinant defensin-2-treated <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> decreased by 86% when compared with the PBS-treated rickettsia (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.017) (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A). To lend biological significance to our <italic>in vitro</italic> results, a defensin-2 neutralization experiment was performed. <italic>D.&#x02009;variabilis</italic> ticks were capillary-fed anti-defensin-2 IgG at increasing concentrations or preimmune IgG at 2&#x02009;mg/ml, incubated for 1&#x02009;h, and fed 2.4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup> total <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic>. Whole tissues were harvested 24&#x02009;h post infection for RNA isolation. Rickettsial burden rose in direct proportion to the increasing concentrations of anti-defensin-2 IgG. Rickettsial burden in ticks fed 1.0&#x02009;mg/ml and 2.0&#x02009;mg/ml anti-defensin-2 IgG increased significantly more than that observed in the ticks treated with 2&#x02009;mg/ml preimmune IgG (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004 and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.043, respectively) (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B). Collectively, the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> burden assays demonstrate that the control of <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> infection seen is specific to the defensin-2 response. Interestingly, the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> burden assays, respectively, demonstrate that the growth-limiting effects of defensin-2 for <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> are specific.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Defensin-2 limits <italic>Rickettsia montanensis</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.

To address this, an <italic>in vitro</italic> lysis assay was performed and the data correlated to the live count data from the same experiments. An Imperial Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel indicated that the recombinant defensin-2 and thioredoxin proteins were relatively pure (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C). Purified <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> were incubated with defensin-2 or thioredoxin with agitation and the mixtures were separated through high-speed centrifugation into pellet and supernatant fractions. In addition, the lysis assay was performed using a synthetic defensin-2 peptide in increasing concentrations. The number of rickettsia/mm<sup>3</sup> were counted using a small aliquot from each rickettsia sample incubated with the synthetic peptide. The same samples were used to blot for cytoplasmic leakage to correlate lysis with a decrease in live rickettsia and increasing concentrations of synthetic peptide. We theorized that perforations in the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> as a result of defensin-2 treatment would cause the leakage of a cytoplasmic protein elongation factor-thermo stable (EF-Ts) into the supernatant.</p><p><italic>Rickettsia montanensis</italic> EF-Ts was first expressed in <italic>Escherichia&#x02009;coli</italic> to determine the level of cross-reactivity of our antiserum generated against <italic>Rickettsia typhi</italic> cytoplasmic EF-Ts (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>A). A higher weight molecular host protein is known to cross-react with our EF-Ts antiserum. The higher molecular weight band was shown previously to be of host origin (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Kaur <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). To support these previous observations, a lysate sample from uninfected L929 cells was subjected to Western blotting to demonstrate that EF-Ts antiserum cross-reacts with a host protein that migrates around 40&#x02009;kDa (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>B). Thioredoxin-treated <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> showed a strong EF-Ts band for the pellet, but not for the supernatant, while recombinant defensin-2-treated <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> showed an EF-Ts band in both the pellet and supernatant lanes (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>C).

Defensins from several genera possess antimicrobial activity for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, protozoa and fungi (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Tsuji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Chrudimska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Wang &#x00026; Zhu, 2011</xref>). In the present study, we showed that defensin-2 associates with <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic>, causing cytoplasmic leakage. We speculated that these antimicrobial properties of defensin-2 were responsible, in part, for the antimicrobial effect observed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Although cationic charge is one property that mediates the association between the bacterium and defensin (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Ganz, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Brogden, 2005</xref>), defensin-2, a weak anionic peptide (pI&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.14; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/compute_pi/pi_tool">http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/compute_pi/pi_tool</ext-link>) associates with rickettsia. The present study does not explore the mechanism underlying defensin-2 association with rickettsia. Our findings present the possibility that defensin-2 interacts with ligands alternative to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or that the LPS structure of <italic>R.&#x02009;montanensis</italic> is different from reported Gram-negative bacteria with respect to charge and facilitates the interaction with a weak anionic protein; however, charge does not appear to be the sole factor dictating the functional capacity of AMPs. Both cationic and anionic derivatives of dermcidin-derived peptides from eccrine sweat glands in humans possess broad range antimicrobial activity (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Steffen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Steffen, <italic>et&#x02009;al</italic>. (2006)</xref> demonstrate that the dermcidin derivative, DCL-1 (pI&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.07) requires 2&#x02009;h before <italic>E.&#x02009;coli</italic> viability decreases 100% compared with the positive control peptide LL-37, which attains 100% killing in minutes. In designing experiments for the present study, we considered the effects that extended extracellular periods of time have on the viability of an obligate intracellular bacterium; however, it is feasible that anionic peptides function at slower rates and that greater loss in rickettsial viability will be attained when exposed to defensin-2 for a time period exceeding 30&#x02009;min.</p><p>After the initial attraction and attachment, AMPs are theorized to assume their folded secondary structure (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Matsuzaki, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Marcellini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Manzo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). A transmembrane pore is thought to form through three mechanisms and appears to be peptide concentration-dependent. All mechanisms are initiated with a parallel arrangement of the AMP at the surface of the phospholipid membrane. The barrel-stave model dictates that high peptide:lipid ratios encourage insertion of AMP into the membrane (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Brogden, 2005</xref>). It is thought that the carpet mechanism works through peptide-mediated formation of micelles and that the torodial pore model is a function of peptide-induced membrane bending followed by pore formation (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Brogden, 2005</xref>). Clues about the mechanism driving pore formation by defensin-2 (anionic) may come from data for the anionic peptide DCL-1 (net charge of-2). Recent data suggest that DCL-1 folds into an &#x003b1;-helical structure in the presence of bacterial membranes, self-associates in a time-dependent manner, and may form pores through the toroidal pore mechanism (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Paulmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). This series of events is also documented for a defensin-like peptide, longicin, from the hard tick, <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic>. Similar to DCL-1, longicin remains unstructured in aqueous solution but assumes a secondary structure in membrane mimetic conditions (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Rahman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> antimicrobial assays lend support to the biological significance of defensin-2 as a rickettsiastatic or rickettsiacidal protein. We do not address defensin-2 function beyond its ability to limit rickettsial infection; however, the findings have implications for the role of defensin-2 in maintaining homeostatic commensal microflora populations. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, antimicrobial bacteriostatic/-cidal peptides play critical roles in maintaining homeostasis with microflora as well as in fighting microbes that may harm the individual (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Ryu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Endosymbionts and commensal microflora may be maintained at low levels in specific tissues to avoid detrimental physiological effects to the host (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Login <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Paredes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is unknown if activation of the midgut (local response) translates to a systemic response in the hemocoel or how this may impact colonization of hemocoelic tissues, such as the salivary glands and ovaries. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, peptidoglycan recognition protein-LB, is responsible for controlling midgut immune activation and participates in activation of the systemic response after an oral challenge with the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Erwinia carotovora carotovar-15</italic> (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Paredes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Considering this, midgut infection with rickettsia may prime hemocoelic immune effectors for an impending rickettsial invasion. In doing so, AMPs such as defensin-2 will limit transmigration of rickettsiae to the hemocoel, ovaries and salivary glands, resulting in less infection, which could have implications for transovarial or horizontal maintenance.</p><p>While the present study does not address the physiochemical mechanism of pore formation for defensin-2, we have correlated loss of rickettsial viability with defensin-2 induced membrane damage that results in the leakage of cytoplasmic contents. Future experiments will address the biochemical properties of defensin-2 as it relates to its antimicrobial function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Rickettsia and host cells</title><p>Mouse fibroblast cells (L929, ATCC&#x000ae; CCL-1) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 34&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.
