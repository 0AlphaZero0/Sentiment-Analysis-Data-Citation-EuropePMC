</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the tumor microenvironment, hypoxia is one of the crucial factors, which promote an aggressive phenotype of tumor cells and decrease the effectiveness of standard treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>There are two types of hypoxia: chronic (uninterrupted) hypoxia, which is associated with an increasing distance of proliferating cells to the vessels, and cycling (acute, interrupted) hypoxia, which is mainly caused by fluctuations in the blood flow rate [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The existence of acutely hypoxic cells in tumors was first observed several decades ago [2] and was attributed to transient changes in blood perfusion [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These preliminary observations were subsequently confirmed in spontaneous animal tumors [4], experimental tumors [5], [6], [7], and in naturally occurring human tumors [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, with the usage of pO2-tissue assessment technologies, the existence of cycling hypoxia was directly observed in human tumors [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It was estimated that tumor areas exposed to cycling hypoxia can range from 12 to 43%, (20% [3]; 35% [7]; 12% and 43% [10]), and can even be greater than the areas of chronic hypoxia in some tumors [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The presence of cycling hypoxia in tumors has direct consequences on the tumor behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Cycling hypoxia promotes spontaneous metastasis [11], [12] and the cells exposed to such conditions have even greater metastatic potential than cells exposed to chronic hypoxia [10], [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cycling hypoxia also affects the effectiveness of anticancer therapies, most predominantly radiotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Glioma cells grown both in vitro and as tumor xenografts, preconditioned with application of cycling hypoxia, are more radioresistant [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Martinive et al. (2006) [15] observed a similar effect for melanoma B16-F10, fibrosarcoma, and hepatocellular cancer cells cultured in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it seems that not only transient acute hypoxia affects the behavior of the cells constituting the tumor microenvironment, but also prolonged cycling hypoxia may lead to a selection of cells resistant to apoptosis and standard treatment modalities such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This effect may be further potentiated by increased genetic instability, which has also been attributed to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Intermittent blood flow in tumors also decreases the effectiveness of chemotherapy by limiting the delivery of drugs to tumor cells [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that cycling hypoxia may also be a factor in selecting and promoting cells with stem cell-like phenotype, presenting increased tumor-initiating capabilities and metastatic potential [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that cycling hypoxia, within the tumor mass, may not only cause resistance to conventional therapies, but may also facilitate a more aggressive phenotype of tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These suggestions have been supported by the clinical observation that higher degree of tumor reoxygenation after radiotherapy is associated with worse patient prognosis [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>There are also reports showing that individual tumors differ depending on the extent of cycling hypoxia regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Tumors that present interchangeable states of hypoxia and reoxygenation, present an increased metastatic potential [10], [12] and are more radioresistant [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Identification of these tumors would inevitably improve cancer prognosis and enable treatment of patients with therapy tailored to each individual case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Thus, identifying the molecular pathways and genes involved in promoting the aggressive phenotype of tumor cells under cycling hypoxia conditions seems crucial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Herein, we investigated the influence of cycling and chronic hypoxia on gene expression profile in three cancer cell lines, using a microarray platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The analysis indicated that cycling hypoxia exerts a similar, although weaker, influence on gene expression in cancer cells than chronic hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The main differences observed between the two types of hypoxia involved the expression of several genes such as IL-8, CXCL2, EPHA2, AREG, HBEGF, and PLAU, which are relevant to tumor progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Our results indirectly suggest that cycling hypoxia may promote an aggressive phenotype by inducing the expression of genes regulating the immune response, invasion, and proliferation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>There are two major types of oxygen kinetics detected in tumor mass, depending on time scales of oxygen fluctuations, the rapid oxygen kinetic (fluctuations within seconds and minutes) and the slower oxygen kinetic (fluctuations within hours and days). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>While the first one is relatively well-known, the latter is not precisely characterized [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a gene expression analysis in three cancer cell lines exposed to either chronic or cycling experimental hypoxia, or grown in control conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The cell lines used in this study represent three types of cancer, known to be affected by hypoxia (melanoma, ovarian, and prostate cancer). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The cycling conditions were chosen to mimic oxygen fluctuations in a slower time scale. In vivo, they occur during the remodeling of the vascular network when the hypoxic and reoxygenation periods last for hours or days [25]–[27] (for details, see Materials and Methods and the experimental setup in Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>To make sure that cells are exposed to hypoxia in this relatively short period of time, we evaluated the cell oxygenation state using a hypoxia marker, pimonidazole (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>First, we performed an unsupervised analysis with a multidimensional scaling method to delineate the main sources of variability in the whole group of samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The analysis revealed that the specific molecular profile characteristic to each cell line was the strongest factor differentiating the samples (the first and the second component), while the second factor (the third component) was the culture conditions, hypoxic vs. control culture conditions (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This observation was subsequently confirmed by class comparison analysis, which revealed that as many as approximately 19,000 probe sets (out of 19,793 being analyzed) were differentially expressed between melanoma, ovarian, and prostate cancer cells, although with such a large scale of differences, a reliable estimation is difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Chronic hypoxia influenced the mRNA expression of 8,635 probe sets, while cycling hypoxia affected the mRNA expression level of 6,132 probe sets (Table S2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) appeared to be the most hypoxia-responsive (4,616 probe sets), while melanoma cells (WM793B line) showed the weakest response to hypoxic conditions (2,088 probe sets). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In SK-OV-3 cells, approximately 3,800 probe sets were affected by hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, quantitatively, both ovarian and prostate cells were similarly affected by cycling hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The expression of 1,749 and 1,706 probe sets, respectively, was affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Again, melanoma showed a relatively low response to this treatment (648 probe sets). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Thus, we decided to analyze the gene expression profile induced by cycling hypoxia in each cell line separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>We aimed at selecting genes (FDR adjusted p&lt;0.05), which met the following arbitrarily set criteria, their expression was affected by cycling hypoxia conditions at least twice (cycling samples vs. controls FC ≥2) and not affected or reversely modulated, or significantly less modulated by chronic hypoxia (cycling vs. chronic samples, FC ≥1.5). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="679" pm="."><plain>In this study, we present a report on global gene expression analysis in three tumor cell lines subjected to experimental cycling and chronic hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="680" pm="."><plain>Since there is more and more data on the role of cycling hypoxia in tumor cell aggressiveness and resistance to therapies, we aimed at identifying the molecular response to those stressing conditions in tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="681" pm="."><plain>The unsupervised analysis of the microarray data revealed that molecular differences between the examined cell lines were the main source of variance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="682" pm="."><plain>This observation is easily explainable since each cell line comes from a single tumor, which is a unique genetic and molecular entity [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="683" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our cell lines were derived from different tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="684" pm="."><plain>Hypoxia was the second factor differentiating the samples, causing a change of expression in the range of approximately 10–23% (chronic) and 3–8% (cycling) genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="685" pm="."><plain>For chronic hypoxia, the response was much larger than that observed previously e.g., 10.3% [29], 1.5% [30], and 0.5% [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="686" pm="."><plain>The observed discrepancies may be the result of technical (data analysis methods), experimental (relatively long exposure to hypoxia), and biological (cell type) factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="687" pm="."><plain>The last one influenced not only the number of affected genes, but also gene expression patterns, which were cell line-specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="688" pm="."><plain>This observation is in line with commonly reported phenomenon of the inter-cellular heterogeneity in molecular response to hypoxia [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="689" pm="."><plain>Since the molecular response to cycling hypoxia was not largely reported, it was the focus of our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="690" pm="."><plain>The comparison between chronic and cycling hypoxia revealed that, generally, the expression profiles induced by these two types of hypoxia were similar, though the latter one had a weaker effect on the transcriptome, as manifested by a lower number of affected genes and a lower fold changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="691" pm="."><plain>In our data, the expression of known HIF1-regulated genes was less affected by cycling hypoxia than by chronic hypoxia, suggesting that HIF1 is more active during chronic hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="692" pm="."><plain>This result contrasts with previous data, which showed that acute hypoxia activates HIF1 more strongly than chronic hypoxia [14], [15], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="693" pm="."><plain>Since the aforementioned results come from analyses of cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation lasting for seconds or minutes, one may speculate that the strong HIF1 activation occurs preferentially in cells exposed to short-time cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation rather than cycle of hypoxia lasting hours or days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="694" pm="."><plain>This is supported by Weinmann et al. observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="695" pm="."><plain>Exposition of HCI H460 cells (lung carcinoma cells) to 10 cycles of hypoxia (48 h) and reoxygenation (120 h) not only did not induce HIF1-regulated genes, but also suppressed a substantial number of them [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="696" pm="."><plain>Moreover, one cannot exclude that what is actually being measured is more the effect of reoxygenation rather that cycling hypoxia itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="697" pm="."><plain>The limitations in interpretations of the data associated with cycling versus chronic hypoxia and reoxygenation are, at least, partially caused by the lack of a defined experimental in vitro model of cycling hypoxia [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="698" pm="."><plain>A systematic microarray or PCR analysis at various time points of experimental cycling hypoxia would provide additional information on this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="699" pm="."><plain>Our experimental model did not allow us to identify a gene set more significantly affected in all three cell lines by cycling hypoxia rather than by chronic hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="700" pm="."><plain>This finding may be explained by two facts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="701" pm="."><plain>Firstly, gene expression profiles induced by cycling hypoxia did not differ much from those induced by chronic hypoxia, and, secondly, the cell line-specificity was relatively high in cycling hypoxia-responsiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="702" pm="."><plain>Thus, we decided to select transcripts separately for each cell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="703" pm="."><plain>The numbers of identified genes differed between the cell lines and were consistent with the intrinsic hypoxia-responsiveness of the analyzed cells, with SK-OV-3 being the most responsive and WM793B the least. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="704" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of genes selected for prostate cancer and melanoma cells presented a relatively low expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="705" pm="."><plain>However, the expression of most of them were above the background noise level, which, based on Gaussian mixture decomposition method [34], was estimated to be 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="706" pm="."><plain>qRT-PCR analysis also confirmed the calculation since the results obtained for HMGB, its expression ranged between 15.3 and 52.74 in SK-OV-3 cells, was validated by this method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="707" pm="."><plain>Among the most induced genes selected for SK-OV-3 cells, some were involved in the regulation of proliferation such as E2F7 and some genes belonged to the EGF pathway, either ligands (AREG, HBEGF, and EREG) or its target gene (EPHA2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="708" pm="."><plain>All of them encode for proteins known to play a role in cancer progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="709" pm="."><plain>E2F7 is involved in resistance to therapy [35], while EPHA2 is overexpressed in a substantial number of tumors and promotes metastasis by stimulating tumor cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="710" pm="."><plain>The AREG protein guarantees tumor cell self-sufficiency in generating growth signals, limitless replicative potential, and resistance to apoptosis [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="711" pm="."><plain>EREG prognostic value has been demonstrated [38], while HBEGF was shown to regulate tumor cell metastatic phenotype [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="712" pm="."><plain>Some of the aforementioned genes (AREG and HBEGF), together with AREGB, were also induced by cycling hypoxia in PC-3 cells, though AREG was not confirmed by qRT-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="713" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EPHA2 was upregulated in WM793B under cycling hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="714" pm="."><plain>The fold changes for the aforementioned genes were relatively low, though, for HBEGF and EPHA2, the results were statistically significant in qRT-PCR analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="715" pm="."><plain>The preferential regulation of the EGF pathway by cycling hypoxia was also observed in GSEA, which showed a predominance of gene sets associated with EGF in cycling samples subjected to hypoxia, especially in ovarian and prostate cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="716" pm="."><plain>Since the EGF pathway is generally involved in establishing and maintaining the malignant phenotype, our results suggest that this pathway may contribute to cycling hypoxia-related adverse effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="717" pm="."><plain>GSEA also confirmed that exposition to hypoxia and reoxygenation affected the NFκB and AP1 signaling pathways, which have been previously shown to be involved in cellular response to transient/acute hypoxia [40], [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="718" pm="."><plain>The other group of genes induced by cycling hypoxia in SK-OV-3 cells comprised transcripts of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL8, IL6, and IL1A and chemokine such as CXCL2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="719" pm="."><plain>CXCL2 was also slightly more induced by cycling hypoxia than by chronic hypoxia in PC-3 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="720" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in melanoma cells, its expression was significantly suppressed under cycling hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="721" pm="."><plain>All these genes are known to play a role in cancer biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="722" pm="."><plain>The predominance of the regulation of immune response genes by cycling hypoxia in melanoma and ovarian cancer cells was also evidenced by GSEA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="723" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in ovarian cancer cells, sets of genes regulating adhesion, migration, and invasion as well as proliferation and cell cycle proved to be more responsive to cycling than to chronic hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="724" pm="."><plain>However, the flow cytometry analysis did not show any differences in cell cycle either in samples subjected to chronic or cycling hypoxia compared to control samples (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="725" pm="."><plain>In contrast to SK-OV-3 and PC-3 cells, the melanoma cell line appeared to be the least responsive to cycling hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="726" pm="."><plain>Gene expression was rather suppressed than stimulated in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="727" pm="."><plain>The fold changes were also relatively low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="728" pm="."><plain>Moreover, out of the six validated genes, qRT-PCR only allowed us to confirm the differential expression of EPHA2 and CXCL2. EPHA2 has a significant role in melanoma biology as an oncogene and pro-malignant protein [42], while CXCL2 is a neutrophil attractant. CXCL2 down-regulation is related to inhibition of neutrophil accumulation and their survival [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="729" pm="."><plain>Thus, EPHA2 and CXCL2 potential role in cycling hypoxia-induced melanoma progression is worth further investigation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="731" pm="."><plain>We selected 240 probe sets representing approximately 190 genes, which presented a variable, though consistent response to hypoxic conditions in all the three cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="732" pm="."><plain>The gene set contains both well-known hypoxia-responsive genes and, more interestingly, some genes that were not linked to hypoxic stimulus or genes for which hypoxia-responsiveness is not well established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="733" pm="."><plain>The first group consists of the most common hypoxia markers: CAIX, GLUT1, and VEGF as well as glycolytic genes (ALDOC, ENO2, HK2, and PFKP), and others (BNIP3, ADM, NDRG1, RNASE4, and MXI1), which appear in most of the previously identified hypoxic signatures [30], [44]–[47], including those selected under severe hypoxia [29], [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="734" pm="."><plain>Their elevated expression may be treated as a validation of our experimental setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="735" pm="."><plain>The novel, most modulated hypoxia-responsive genes detected in our study are TAF9B and ARRDC3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="736" pm="."><plain>These genes encode proteins that, among other functions, play roles in processes that presumably help the cell to survive hypoxic and stress conditions by regulating its viability, transcription repression (TAF9B, [49], and energy expenditure (ARRDC3, [50]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="737" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our data confirmed the involvement of certain genes, which have been modestly reported so far, in hypoxia response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="738" pm="."><plain>These include previously identified HIF-1 target genes such as ANKRD37 [47], STC-2 [51], and STC-1 [52], [48], as well as COL5A1 induced by hypoxia in the ventricle [53], ZNF395 regulated by hypoxia in glioblastoma [54], and TMEM45 in hematopoietic stem cells [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="739" pm="."><plain>Some of them have also been shown to be involved in cancer progression such as STC1 [56] and ZNF395 [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="740" pm="."><plain>Most of the aforementioned genes were highly induced by hypoxia in the analyzed cell lines and, in conjunction with the known hypoxia genes, they could be used as putative universal hypoxia signatures for further analysis and validation in clinical material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="741" pm="."><plain>Prognostic values of some hypoxic signatures based partially on in vitro data were already successfully validated in clinical material [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="742" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a huge study by Starmans et al., (2012) suggested that hypoxia-regulated genes may constitute a part of prognostic signature rather than be significant as individual molecular prognostic markers [60]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="743" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our global gene expression analysis of three tumor cell lines exposed to cycling and chronic hypoxia revealed substantial similarities in the molecular profiles induced by these two different experimental hypoxic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="744" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we have selected genes and indicated processes, which seem to be preferentially regulated by cycling hypoxia and reoxygenation, but which are not regulated or weakly regulated by chronic hypoxia in selected tumor cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="745" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the identified genes were relatively cell line-specific, induction of some EGF pathway-related transcripts in the analyzed cell lines suggests that this molecular pathway may be involved in the tumor cell response to cycling hypoxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="746" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, they may mediate cycling hypoxia-induced tumor aggressiveness, though, due to the lack of established models of cycling hypoxia, caution in data interpretation is recommended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="747" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these genes as well as newly reported more universal hypoxia-responsive genes are worth further validation. </plain></SENT>
