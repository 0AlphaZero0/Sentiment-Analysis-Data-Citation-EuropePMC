</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules of 18 to 24 nucleotides generated by a sequential processing of long RNA transcripts by two specific RNAse III proteins: Dicer and Drosha [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Studies performed during the past decade have led to the discovery of many miRNAs in almost all organisms [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Over 8000 predicted miRNAs from plants, animals and viruses are currently described in miRBase, the reference database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression trough the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>They play key roles in many biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation as well as apoptosis and have been shown to be involved in a number physiopathological processes [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Analysis of cartilage-specific Dicer-knock-out (KO) mice [5] revealed a crucial role of miRNAs in cartilage development and integrity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, a comprehensive identification of miRNAs expressed in cartilage and bone and their precise role is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Recent studies highlighted the role of some miRNAs in endochondral ossification [6], chondrocytes differentiation [7], regulation of bone remodeling [8] and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and functions [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, miRNA expression profiling performed on bovine articular cartilage suggested their involvement in mechano-transduction pathway and in the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In line with their role in cartilage maturation and bone development, miRNAs are now recognized as key players in osteoarthritis (OA) physiopathology [13, 14] and may prove to be involved in other osteoarticular diseases [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For example, it has been demonstrated that mir-27b regulates a protein involved in MEC turn-over, the Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), in both normal and OA human chondrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This result suggest that an abnormal expression of mir-27b may contribute to OA development [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, some miRNAs have been identified as biomarkers for pathological conditions including OA [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Most recently, there has been growing interest in using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to catalog small RNAs in a variety of tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to use short-read NGS technology (SOLID™, Life Technologies) to establish a comprehensive repertoire of miRNA expressed in either equine cartilage or subchondral bone and to investigate their potential role in equine osteochondrosis (OC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This juvenile osteoarticular disease leads to joint swelling, stiffness and varying degrees of lameness [18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>OC is one of the most prevalent developmental orthopedic diseases in equine population and constitutes a major concern in terms of animal welfare as well it economic impact [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Its etiology and pathology are still unclear, due to the confusion regarding the definition of the disease and the lack of understanding of primary lesions formation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Clearly, there is a need for a better understanding of OC molecular physiopathology in order to refine nosological entities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Here, we analysed undamaged cartilage and subchondral bone from healthy (healthy samples) and OC-affected (predisposed samples) foals, with and without an experimental mechanical loading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This was performed with the aim of exploring the role of miRNAs in the constitutive defects associated with OC development, as well as in regulating mechano-transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This work made it possible to define, for the first time to our knowledge, the comprehensive epiphyseal cartilage and subchondral bone miRNome, including about 300 new putative miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we highlighted miRNAs associated with both OC status and mechanical loading, suggesting that miRNAs may be involved in OC physiopathology as well as in the cellular response to biomechanical stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Some differentially expressed miRNA identified by our work may later prove to be valuable diagnostic biomarkers that could help refining the nosological entities. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We provide a comprehensive repertoire of miRNAs expressed in both cartilage and bone samples collected in vivo. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they were found to be modulated between healthy and OC-affected horses, providing support for the hypothesis that these sequences do not account for experimental artifacts, but rather may represent genuine miRNAs or smallRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Such a large number of new putative miRNAs may be due to the lack of studies and data specifically targeting cartilage and bone miRnome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Equine osteochondrosis is the most common developmental osteoarticular disorder in equine populations leading to pain and lameness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Primary lesions are thought to results from a focal disruption of endochondral ossification, leading to cartilage retention into subchondral bone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that primary lesions result from an initial dyschondroplasia associated with an impaired differentiation of chondrocytes [22, 33] whereas other studies have supported the hypothesis of an initial disruption of canal blood supply leading to the formation of necrotic cartilage areas [34–36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Here, our miRNome analysis agrees with the hypothesis of a constitutive defect leading to impaired cartilage maturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our study was focused on undamaged samples collected on stifle from healthy foals and foals affected by OC lesions on hock. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Differential analysis highlighted 49 and 41 modulated miRNAs in cartilage and bone, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, several gene mapping programs have been initiated worldwide in different breeds and several quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions have been identified (for review see [37]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>On these regions, two were found to contain a new miRNA differentially expressed in cartilage (new-eca-mir-696 and new-eca-mir-754) and one overlap with the location of eca-mir-1249, which has been shown to be modulated in bone (Additional file 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In cartilage, predicted target genes were found associated with known functions and mechanisms involved in maintenance of cartilage integrity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>For example, the balance between catabolic and anabolic processes plays a critical role in cartilage homeostasis [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that several miRNAs including mir-140, mir-199a, mir-193 and mir-29a/29b may be involved in cartilage anabolic and catabolic regulation by regulating the expression of key genes involved in those process such as MMP13, Adamts-5 or Col2A1 (for review see [39]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Following these results, our data suggest that differentially expressed miRNAs regulate genes involved in macromolecule metabolism and protein folding and transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This may also reflect a modification of cartilage turn-over in OC foals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, chondrocyte energy metabolism plays a major role in chondrocyte development, maturation and mineralization process [40–42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Likewise, actin cytoskeleton, which plays a major role in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation [43], was highlighted in our data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of miRNAs expression in OC predisposed foals may alter pathways crucial for cartilage maturation, leading to an abnormal extracellular cartilage matrix synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, extracellular matrix changes were observed in OC-affected horses, often associated with a disruption of cartilage canals [33, 44–46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Thus, our findings are consistent with a role of miRNAs in cartilage genetic susceptibility to equine OC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Likewise, in bone, miRNAS target genes were found associated with functions essential for bone development and remodeling, as well as bone cell differentiation and activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>For instance, energy production and metabolisms are undoubtedly essential for proper bone tissue development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Indeed, ATP is essential for osteoclasts to generate the acidic environment required for solubilization of the alkaline salts and digestion of the organic bone matrix [47], and is involved in osteoblast differentiation and activation [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In addition, several studies have demonstrated that Rab GTPases, a family of proteins involved in membrane traffic, play an key role for osteoclasts function, in particular for the polarized transport of acidic vesicles of the endocytic/lysosomal pathway required for formation of the ruffled border (for review see [49]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Likewise, lipids, especially cholesterol, are essential for osteoblasts and osteoclasts development (for review see [50]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the known role of miRNAs in the control of bone remodeling (for review see [8]) and their involvement in key regulation pathways of bone formation and remodeling such as BMP-signaling pathway (mir-133, mir-135) [51] and Wnt-signaling pathway (mir-29a) [52], miRNA predicted targets were found to be involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways (FGF, TGFb, IGF1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>An essential role of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone remodeling has also recently emerged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>For example, ZFP521 acts as a co-factor of Runx2 and the Runx2/ZFP521 balance regulates bone homeostasis [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>ZNF384 regulates expression of type I collagen, counteracts BMP2-enhanced osteoblast differentiation as well as PTH induced MMP-13 expression [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Our data supports a role of miRNA in a constitutive bone defect associated with a predisposition to OC, including impaired bone remodeling and bone cells homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of miRNAs in mechanotransduction pathways in bone and cartilage, samples were subjected to a 24-hours experimental loading treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis between unloaded and loaded samples made it possible to identify modulated miRNAs in cartilage and in bone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Regulation of mechanotransduction pathways in articular cartilage by miRNAs was previously suggested in a study performed with bovine articular cartilage [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>This study allowed for the identification of additional miRNAs (mir-17-3p, mir-874-3p) as well as 17 new ones involved in response to mechanical stress. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, based on the miRNome, equine OC appears to be associated with combined cartilage and bone defects, in good agreement with our previous preliminary proteomics findings [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanisms linking cartilage and bone defects remain to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cartilage and subchondral bone serve as a functional unit to maintain joint homeostasis and a disruption or modification of either of these two tissues may lead to the remodeling of the other (for review see [56]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, factors involved in this interaction remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are secreted in both tissues and may able to take part in the communication from cartilage to bone and from bone to cartilage through the synovial fluid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In fact, miRNAs are present in synovial fluid and their expression is modified in pathological situations such as OA [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We observed miRNAs differentially expressed between healthy and OC cartilage and bone, some of which should constitute relevant OC biomarkers in synovial fluid and, to a lesser extent, in plasma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Finally, there is no evidence indicating that identified defects could alone be sufficient to induce OC lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Since biomechanical constraints are thought to trigger the development of focal lesions, we also explored the hypothesis of an impaired response to biomechanical constraint and some mild differences could be observed between healthy and predisposed samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether these differences may reflect a constitutively impaired response to biomechanical constrains or may reflect changes in ECM structure and biomechanical properties, consequently modifying mechanical signal transduction and leading to a slightly different outcome. </plain></SENT>
