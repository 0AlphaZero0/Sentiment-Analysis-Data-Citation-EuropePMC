</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extracellular nucleotides function as intercellular messengers and cause various physiological or pathological responses upon binding to purinoceptors on the target cells (Burnstock 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis and thrombosis and are released by the pro‐platelets of megakaryocytes (Malmgren 1986; Siess 1989; Lemons et al. 1997; Vischer and Wollheim 1998; McNicl and Israels 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Upon stimulation, platelets secrete ATP and ADP, which facilitate platelet aggregation through distinct signaling pathways: ATP binds to the P2X1 receptor and initiates rapid Ca2+ influx followed by platelet shape change, leading to platelet activation induced by low concentrations of collagen (Clifford et al. 1998; Gachet 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ADP binds to the P2Y1 receptor, causing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, shape change, and initiation of aggregation (Fabre et al. 1999; Gachet 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>ADP also binds to P2Y12 receptor and the resultant decrease in cAMP potentiates the aggregation and secretion induced by all known platelet agonists such as thrombin, collagen, and serotonin (Gachet 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thus, purinergic chemical transmission plays a crucial role in platelet activation and their receptors are potential targets for antithrombotic drugs (Hollopeter et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In spite that the function of purinoceptors in platelets is understood well, the mechanism of how platelets store nucleotides is far less understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Platelets contain two types of secretory granules, the α granules and dense granules (Da Prada et al. 1982; Njus et al. 1986; McNicl and Israels 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While α granules contain mainly polypeptides such as fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, growth factor, and protease inhibitors, dense granules contain a high concentration of ATP and ADP (up to ~0.7 mol/L) as well as serotonin and divalent cations (Da Prada et al. 1982; Njus et al. 1986; McNicl and Israels 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that dense granules contain a vacuolar type proton pump that acidifies the interior of the granule (Dean et al. 1984). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Serotonin is actively transported into the granules through vesicular monoamine transporter coupled with the ΔpH established by the proton pump (Wilkins et al. 1978; Carty et al. 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In analogy to serotonin transport, it has been speculated that secondary active transporter is involved in nucleotide storage in the granules; however, studies to demonstrate this possibility were all unsuccessful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>An alternative hypothesis is that the multidrug resistant associated protein 4 (MRP4/ABCC4), a member of ABC‐type drug transporter family, is involved in the vesicular storage of nucleotides in platelets since this protein transports various anionic compounds at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (Jedlitschky et al. 2004, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>MRP4 is present in dense granules and the platelet membrane vesicles transport cyclic GMP, cyclic AMP, and ADP upon incubation with ATP in a vanadate‐sensitive fashion (Jedlitschky et al. 2004, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, because MRP4 is polyspecific in nature and recognizes structurally unrelated compounds as substrates, it is difficult to explain how MRP4 can selectively accumulate ATP and ADP in the granules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT, SLC17A9 protein) is the latest member of SLC17 anion transporter family that localizes to various ATP storage organelles such as chromaffin granules and synaptic vesicles (Sawada et al. 2008; Larsson et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>VNUT actively transports various nucleotides using the membrane potential (Δψ; inside positive) that is established by vacuolar proton ATPase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The ATP uptake requires a low concentration of Cl− (of about 4 mmol/L) and is inhibited by Evans blue, 4,4′‐diisothiocyanostilbene 2,2′‐disulfonic acid (DIDS), and keto acids such as acetoacetate, which are common inhibitors for the SLC17 transporter family (Sawada et al. 2008; Juge et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>ATP and ADP with chelated divalent cations are the preferred transport substrates of VNUT (Miyaji et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, very recent studies have shown that secretion of ATP from PC12 cells, purinergic neuronal cells, T cells, biliary epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, macrophages, pancreatic β cells, and lung cancer cell line were impaired in VNUT knock down, indicating that VNUT is of primary importance for vesicular storage and release of nucleotides (Sawada et al. 2008; Tokunaga et al. 2010; Sathe et al. 2011; Larsson et al. 2012; Takai et al. 2012; Geisler et al. 2013; Sakaki et al. 2013; Sesma et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we investigated the possible involvement of VNUT in the vesicular storage and release of nucleotides in platelets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>How nucleotides are stored in platelets is a long‐standing question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have conducted a series of experiments to examine the possible participation of VNUT in the storage process using human platelets and a line of human megakaryoblastic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>We found that VNUT is localized in the intracellular granules containing serotonin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>As serotonin is highly concentrated in the dense granule, the result indicates localization of VNUT in the dense granules of platelet (Da Prada et al. 1982). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Platelet membrane vesicles took up ATP in bafilomycin A1, Evans blue, and glyoxylate‐sensitive manners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Such kinetic features and substrate specificity are similar to those of purified VNUT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Background of minor ATP binding to membrane preparation and observed inhibitor profile indicates more than 50% of ATP uptake is estimated as VNUT‐driven transport. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>In addition to histochemical and biochemical evidence, we also showed that the release of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells was decreased by inhibition of VNUT activity and suppression of VNUT gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Apparent molecular weight of VNUT immunological counterpart of platelet (~80 kDa) was higher than that of MEG‐01 counterpart (62 kDa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>However, the migration position of platelet VNUT was shifted to ~55 kDa upon mild heat treatment in the presence of SDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that platelet VNUT may be tightly associated and complexed with other proteins in the platelet membrane so as to form a complex in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Upon mild heat treatment, the complex may be dissociated and VNUT protein is electrophoresed to the standard position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>The effect of N‐glycosidase F suggests that platelet VNUT is glycosylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Collectively, all of these results constitute evidence that VNUT plays a central role in nucleotide accumulation in dense granules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies on isolated dense granules suggest that V‐ATPase acts as a primary proton pump for the generation of an inside positive electrochemical gradient of H+ (ΔμH+, a sum of ΔpH and Δψ), which is used for serotonin uptake (Johnson et al. 1978; Carty et al. 1981; Wilkins and Salganicoff 1981; Fishkes and Rundnick 1982). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Likewise, ATP uptake through VNUT in platelets seems to be coupled to V‐ATPase and uses ΔμH+ for the uptake of nucleotides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Thus, platelet dense granules may possess molecular machineries for the accumulation of transmitters that are essentially the same as those in the secretory vesicles of neurons and neuroendocrine cells (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The ΔpH and Δψ of platelet dense granules were evaluated with radiolabeled methylamine and through thiocyanate distribution and is estimated to be 1.1–1.6 and 30–40 mV, respectively (Johnson et al. 1978; Wilkins and Salganicoff 1981; Fishkes and Rundnick 1982). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Since VMAT transports serotonin with a counterflow of 2H+ (Wilkins and Salganicoff 1981), this electrochemical gradient accounts for a 500‐ to 7000‐fold concentration gradient of serotonin across the granule membrane and, therefore, is sufficient for the storage of serotonin in the dense granules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>As to nucleotide transport, VNUT utilizes Δψ to transport negatively charged ATP (Sawada et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Under a Δψ of 40 mV, the ATP anion can be concentrated ~100‐fold, providing an explanation how intragranular ATP concentrations can reach ~700 mmol/L from a bioenergetics view (Omote et al. 2011; Omote and Moriyama 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>In any event, the model presented here for the energy coupling of serotonin and nucleotides in dense granules explains quantitatively the vesicular storage of these compounds (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) is associated with dense granules and transports nucleotides into granule using Δψ that is established by V‐ATPase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>VNUT is thus involved in nucleotide release and that is inhibited by glyoxylate, a VNUT inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="phy2-2-e12034-g6"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>MRP4 is another candidate for the transporter involved in the accumulation of ADP in dense granule (Jedlitschky et al. 2004, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>MRP4‐driven ADP transport may be hampered by ADP production through hydrolysis of its own ATP hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In MEG‐01 cells, VNUT is expressed in MRP4‐ and cellubrevin‐positive dense granules and inhibition of VNUT expression by RNAi treatment reduced ATP release, whereas MRP4 protein expression level was not affected (Fig. 4C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In addition, kinetic properties of ATP uptake such as inhibitor sensitivity and Cl− dependence are identical to those of VNUT (Figs. 3, 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Thus, MRP4 expression is not correlated with vesicular ATP uptake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that although MRP4‐driven ADP transport may occur under physiological conditions, its physiological relevance for vesicular nucleotide storage is less significant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>One of the important findings of this study is that glyoxylate acted preferentially on VNUT and not on VGLUT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Recently we have shown that VGLUTs possess anion binding site(s) and that upon the binding of Cl−, VGLUTs become fully activated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Ketone bodies such as acetoacetate at mmol/L concentrations compete with Cl− and hence, reversibly inhibit transport activity (Juge et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Since acetoacetate‐evoked reversible inhibition of VGLUT occurs in vivo and the level of acetoacetate can be metabolically controlled, glutamatergic neurotransmission can be artificially and reversibly suppressed (Juge et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>VNUT is also activated by Cl− and the activation can be reversibly inhibited by acetoacetate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of a similar anion binding site(s) on VNUT and that vesicular ATP secretion may be regulated metabolically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>The effect of glyoxylate on the vesicular transport as well as secretion fully supports this possibility. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>One of the unique features of platelet dense granules is the presence of a high concentration of ADP (Holmsen 1958; Da Prada et al. 1982; Njus et al. 1986). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of the nucleotides in dense granules are ADP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Other secretory granules contain 10% ADP at the most (Zimmermann 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Taking the energy coupling in the dense granule presented here into consideration, the presence of a high concentration of ADP in dense granule is unexpected because VNUT almost equally recognizes ATP and ADP as substrates and the concentration of ADP in the cytoplasm is far less than that of ATP (Holmsen 1958). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Thus, how ADP accumulates in the dense granules is an open question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>One of the possibilities is that ADP is formed within the granules after storage; in other words, ATP is transported in through VNUT and is then hydrolyzed to ADP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it is noteworthy that dense granules also contain relatively high concentration of polyphosphate, which is synthesized inside granules and released along with ADP and serotonin and also acts as a novel transmitter to facilitate clotting (Smith et al. 2006; Müller et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of polyphosphate in platelets are unknown at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the synthesis of polyphosphate and formation of ADP inside granules is linked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that MEG‐01 cells secrete appreciable amount of ATP and ADP in a Ca2+‐dependent manner (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Suppression of VNUT gene expression equally suppressed secretion of ATP and ADP without affecting cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratios (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>These results strongly suggest that MEG‐01 cells also store high concentration of ADP in the vesicles and intragranular ADP is somehow endogenously produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Although it is unknown whether MEG‐01 cells contain appreciable amount of polyphosphate, the cells may provide suitable experimental system to analyze molecular mechanism by which platelets store and secrete high concentration of ADP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Further studies in particular identification of polyphosphate in MEG‐01 cells and, if present, coupling of formation of ADP and polyphosphate will be necessary. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we demonstrated that VNUT played an essential role in vesicular nucleotide transport and release in platelets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Identification of glyoxylate as a reversible inhibitor of VNUT provides a lead for the development of selective modulators of VNUT activity to control nucleotides release in vivo. </plain></SENT>
