</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Down syndrome (DS) (MIM 190685), is the most frequent genetic cause of mental retardation, resulting from the presence of three copies of genes located on chromosome 21 and the most common chromosomal disorder in newborns with prevalence of 1/700 live births. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Advanced maternal age is the only well-documented risk factor for nondisjunction of chromosome 21.[1] In spite of high prevalence, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic nondisjunction are not yet understood, and much research have been done on factors that influence the rate of chromosome nondisjunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The relationship between chromosomal nondisjunction and folate metabolism has drawn attention in the past decade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Folate and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) are both involved in many complex biochemical reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A deficiency in cellular folates and methyl-donors may be associated with abnormal DNA methylation, defective chromosome recombination, and abnormal chromosome segregation.[2] James et al.[3] were the first to propose the hypothesis that altered DNA methylation patterns resulting from abnormal folate metabolism may increase DNA hypomethylation in centromeric DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Several published papers emphasized that folate metabolism is modulated by genetic factor like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MTHFR, methionine synthase (MTR) and MTR reductase (MTRR) genes and dietary folate and B vitamin supplements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>MTHFR is the most studied enzyme and responsible for the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate, which is a key single-carbon donor that takes part in nucleotide synthesis; remethylation of homocysteine to methionine; S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) synthesis; and the methylation of DNA, proteins, neurotransmitters, and phospholipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Reduced MTHFR activity results in an increased requirement for folic acid to maintain normal homocysteine remethylation to methionine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In the absence of sufficient folic acid and/or dysfunctional MTHFR, intracellular homocysteine accumulates, methionine synthesis is reduced, and methylation reactions are interrupted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Increased homocysteine and decreased methionine cause decreased SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio, which takes part in DNA methylation.[4] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The MTHFR gene (OMIM 607093) has been mapped at short arm of chromosome 1 (1p36.3) and more than 40 polymorphism have been described in MTHFR, but C677T (rs1801133) is the most common[5] in which a cytosine is replaced by thymine at 677th position (alanine →valine in protein). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>C677T mutation was shown to render the enzyme thermolabile and homozygotes (T/T) and heterozygotes (C/T) had about a 70% and 35% reduced MTHFR enzymatic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Frequency of mutant T allele differs in various ethnic and geographical populations of the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, the allele frequency ranges from 0.20 to 0.55 in Europeans and from 0.04 to 0.38 in Asian populations.[67891011] C677T polymorphism has been reported as a risk factor for several diseases and/or clinical conditions including neural tube defects (NTD),[12] orofacial clefts,[13] cardiovascular diseases[5] and cancer.[14] Several studies have been published that aim to evaluate the role of maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphism as a risk factor for DS pregnancy[415161718192021] but very few studies are carried out to evaluate MTHFR C677T polymorphism in DS cases as a risk factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze C677T polymorphism in DS cases and control group. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The wild type allele C is not cut by the enzyme and yields a 198 bp fragment after amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The T allele, on the contrary, creates a site for HinfI leading to its digestion and producing two bands of 175 and 23 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>As the 23 bp fragment is not resolvable in the gel, occurrence of the 175 bp fragment is taken to indicate the presence of T allele. Figure 1 illustrates the genotypes (CC and CT) in DS cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We performed two different types of statistical analyses: First, a comparison of allele frequencies between case and control individuals (C and T alleles); and second, a comparison of the frequencies of the three genotypes (CC, CT, and TT genotypes) among case and control individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A summary of allele and genotype frequencies of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in DS cases and controls given in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The frequency of mutant MTHFR T allele was 0.09 in DS cases and 0.1 in controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Genotype frequencies in controls were 0.81, 0.17, and 0.02 for CC, CT and TT, respectively and 0.81 and 0.19 for CC and CT, respectively in DS cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>TT genotype was not observed in any DS case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Analyses of allele and genotype frequencies of MTHFR C677T polymorphism have revealed nonsignificant difference between cases and controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>As is evident from the Table 1, while C is the dominant allele in the controls as well as the cases, the proportion of T allele in the DS cases (9%) is nearly similar to the proportion of T allele in the controls (10%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The OR for T allele in cases against controls has been calculated (OR = 0.915; 95% CI: 0.331-2.53; P = 0.864) and showed no association between T allele and DS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>CC genotype percentage (81.25) was similar in both controls as well as DS cases, whereas against 17.19% (11/64) CT in controls, there were 18.75% CT (6/32) in the DS cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The heterozygous genotype differences were observed between case and controls; therefore, OR has been also calculated for CT versus CC genotypes between DS cases and controls (OR = 1.091; 95% CI: 0.36-3.2; P = 0.876). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Although TT genotype was not observed in case samples, but we calculated OR for TT versus CC (OR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.26-16.76; P = 0.480). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJHG-20-142-g003"/></table-wrap></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Several studies performed on human cell cultures, in vivo studies in humans and studies involving animal models have demonstrated that folate depletion from the media, or inadequate folate dietary intake, result in DNA hypomethylation, chromosome breakage, and aneuploidy.[23] For this reason, it has been postulated that impairments in folate and homocysteine metabolism due to genetic polymorphisms of folate metabolic enzymes could predispose women to abnormal chromosome segregation and act as risk factors for a DS pregnancy.[3] Since 1999, several epidemiological studies have been performed on mother of DS, aimed at evaluating the role of folate and homocysteine pathway gene polymorphisms in the risk of a DS offspring and several associations have been observed.[34172425] MTHFR C677T variant due to less enzymatic activity leads to hypomethylation of centromeric DNA, which may be the major cause of missegregation of chromosomes during meiosis and results in trisomy 21.[4] Hassold et al.[26] analyzed polymorphism of MTHFR and MTRR maternal genes in trisomy of several chromosomes and compared the distribution of genotypes to those of control populations and observed a significant increase in the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in mothers of trisomy cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Several population-based studies and experiments with animal models have shown that periconceptional multivitamin/folic acid supplementation has a strong protective effect during early stages of embryo development, resulting in a significant reduction in the occurrence of development defects, including NTD, congenital heart defects, limb defects, and orofacial clefts.[27] Low or inadequate intake of folic acid are involved in the disruption of methionine metabolism, because methylenetetrahydrofolate, the primary form of folate in the circulation, acts as the carbon donor for homocysteine remethylation to yield methionine and tetrahydrofolate.[28] Therefore, genes that participate in homocysteine/folate metabolism are attractive candidates for investigation of the mechanisms underlying the protective role of folic acid in birth defects and DS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The impact of folic acid intake on pregnancy outcome, however, is modified by polymorphisms in both the maternal and fetal genes that code for enzymes involved in folate metabolism.[27] Data on the genotype and allele frequencies of MTHFR C677T polymorphism in DS mothers compared to non-DS mothers are numerous and show significant differences, but reports regarding distribution of MTHFR mutant allele and genotype frequencies in DS individuals are very few.[192930313233] Several clinical and experimental studies have hypothesized/reported that patients with DS have disturbed one-carbon metabolism.[23] t-Hcy, vitamin B-12 and folate are metabonutritional factors directly related to this metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>These factors along with the associated genetic polymorphisms might aggravate the age related mental retardation in DS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Guéant et al.[34] have reported that carriers of the MTHFR 677T allele DS individuals had a lower IQ than those carrying the corresponding wild genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The influence of MTHFR 677T allele may correspond to decreased remethylation of homocysteine due to reduced activity of MTHFR, eventually accentuated by reduced availability of vitamin B12 cofactor of MTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>None of the other genetic polymorphisms of the one-carbon metabolism influenced the level of mental retardation in DS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>High homocysteine concentration impairs DNA repair in hippocampal neurons, promotes apoptosis, hypersensitivity to exitotoxicity and oxidative stress, and it potentiates the neurone toxicity of beta-amyloid peptide, the proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein.[35] In addition to the over expression of cystathionine beta synthase (CβS) due to three copies of CβS genes in DS cases, another phenotypic abnormality related to chromosome 21 genes is the over expression of amyloid precursor protein, which confers a predominant role to the pathway of amyloid precursor protein in the neurodegeneration in DS dementia.[36] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This study failed to reveal any association between C677T polymorphism and risk of being DS child, but we conclude that this SNP might be responsible for low IQ, severe mental retardation, dementia, neurodegeneration and other DS symptoms in severe conditions in comparison to CC DS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>DS individuals with TT genotype might be particularly sensitive to the status of folate and several B vitamins and should be supplemented for personalized nutritional recommendations especially for folate, B-6 and B-12 vitamins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, as there was no statistical difference in genotype distribution between cases and controls, we suggest that the analysis of MTHFR genotyping for C677T polymorphism alone need not be considered to find out whether there is a genetic risk for development of DS, polymorphisms of other folate/homocysteine pathway genes like CβS and replication factor C, which are located on chromosome 21 should be studied as a risk factor along with the MTHFR gene. </plain></SENT>
