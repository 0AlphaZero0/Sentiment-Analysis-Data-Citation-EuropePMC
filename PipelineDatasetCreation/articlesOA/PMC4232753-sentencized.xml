</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although serological evidence suggests H3N8 canine influenza virus (CIV) has been circulating in U.S. dogs since as early as 1999 [1], it was not until 2004 that the virus was isolated from Florida racing greyhounds exhibiting signs of infectious respiratory disease [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early phylogenetic analyses showed CIV, an influenza A virus in the family Orthomyxoviridae, to be closely related to contemporary equine influenza viruses (EIV) of the Florida Clade 1 sublineage [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the emerging CIVs, ten amino acid substitutions within the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, and polymerase proteins were identified [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unlike other horse-to-dog EIV transmission events in which dogs have been only incidentally infected [4, 5], CIV represents a new threat to canine health, as the virus rapidly spreads to naïve dogs throughout the racing track circuit [2, 6], animal shelters [2, 7, 8], and boarding facilities [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Despite successful experimental transmission of EIV and CIV in both horses and dogs [10–13], host restriction is currently being maintained in naturally-infected animals [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CIV isolates sequenced between 2005 and 2008 share the same ten amino acid substitutions originally identified in early Florida CIV, as well as an additional nine amino acid substitutions among the influenza proteins [14] (three within the HA alone). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that CIV continues to evolve from both its canine and equine influenza predecessors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Given its vital role during influenza infection, it is not surprising that the HA protein of influenza A virus is the main target for antibody attachment and virus neutralization [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Five antigenic regions (A–E) have been identified in the HA subtype 3 (H3) HA1 subunit protein of human and equine influenza viruses [17–21], and mutations within these antigenic regions have been associated with immune escape or antigenic drift [22], which can result in vaccine failure and increased host susceptibility to influenza infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that antigenic drift has epidemiological impact when four or more amino acid substitutions are located within at least two of these antigenic regions [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Antigenic drift has been reported in human H3 influenza viruses [19, 21], with influenza strains clustering into antigenic groups over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, influenza A H3N2 viruses isolated from humans between 1968 and 2003 formed 11 distinct antigenic clusters [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Equine influenza viruses, in contrast, clustered into only three antigenic groups over the same time period [23], while antigenic drift has yet to be detected or described in CIVs isolated from dogs [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>With the widespread use of a recently developed killed CIV vaccine [26], continual molecular evaluation of circulating CIVs is clearly necessary for monitoring antigenic drift. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as CIV emerged only within the last decade, it is important to continually monitor its genetic diversity and whether geographically distinct viral lineages are evolving [2, 3, 14, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the HA nucleotide and protein sequences of the published set of CIVs, as well as the newly isolated CIVs from CIV-epidemic and endemic U.S. regions, we are able to further describe the evolution of CIV since it first emerged in 2004, and report amino acid variations within potential antigenic sites that could possibly result in the first clustering of antigenically distinct CIVs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Since the emergence of CIV nearly 10 years ago, the virus has circulated in a number of dog populations, most notably in dogs residing in humane shelters [2, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Indeed, CIV is routinely isolated from such facilities [8, 14, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Whether this is because there are actually more CIV infections in shelter dogs compared to non-shelter dogs or there is more surveillance in this particular population is a matter under current study [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the frequent isolation of CIVs in shelter dogs presents a unique opportunity to characterize genetic evolution and antigenic variation of a relatively novel influenza A virus “in situ.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Results from these studies and others [14, 27] suggest that CIV might be diverging into two regionally distinct lineages: Colorado and New York. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the recent New York viruses and the one South Carolina isolate appear to cluster separately from CIVs isolated in Colorado and Wyoming (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a number of CIV lineages have not been isolated recently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>For example, isolates from a Wyoming animal shelter (A/canine/WY/86955/2007 and A/canine/WY/86033/2007) are not clustered with any of the newer Colorado isolates (Fig. 1), while, instead, recent Colorado CIVs are clustered with viruses isolated from dogs residing at other animal shelters located within Colorado. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Despite the possible geographical divergence of CIV, the separate lineages might be due rather to temporal mutations, as the Colorado CIVs were isolated in 2009 and 2010, before the New York CIVs were isolated in 2010 and 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>However, giving more weight to the regional divergence claim is the fact that the South Carolina CIV, which most resembles the New York CIVs, was isolated in 2009, before the Colorado CIVs were isolated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The MEME analysis found five sites in the HA coding region undergoing episodic diversifying selection: 107, 169, 216, 453, and 464. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Three of these sites (AA residues 107, 169, and 216) are located on the HA1 protein (HA sites 1 through 328), including one site located in an potential antigenic region, while two of these (residues 453 and 464) are on the HA2 protein (residues 330 through 550). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The single likelihood ancestor counting method also identified 464 as undergoing positive selection pressure, suggesting that there are indeed amino acid changes occurring within the highly conserved HA2 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Although residue 107 was not identified by single likelihood ancestor counting analysis as undergoing selection pressure, substitutions at site 107 were reported in 2008 as a replacement of serine in the conserved EIV and early Florida CIV isolates by a proline in the A/canine/Jacksonville/2005 strain [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Site 107 appears to be part of a peptide region (AA residues 105-140) that might stimulate proliferation of T helper cells [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Isolates substituting serine at position 107 change the amino acid from one with a polar uncharged side chain to either one with a secondary amine (proline) or one with a hydrophobic side chain (leucine). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>However, recent isolates from both New York and Colorado show a leucine substitution at this site instead. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>With eight amino acid substitutions within three potential antigenic regions, antigenic drift might also be occurring for the newer CIV isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to note that E124 (site A) was only observed in two of the viruses isolated after the Wyoming 2006 outbreak (A/canine/CO/231256/2007 and A/canine/WY/86033/2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Other mutations seen in only a few isolates included two clinical samples from the Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with I242T (A/canine/CO/3/2006 and A/canine/CO/224766/2006) and two shelter CIVs with K172E (A/canine/SC/89215/2009 and A/canine/NY/13693247/2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Despite these transient mutations, it appears that five consistent substitutions have occurred in the Colorado and New York isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In antigenic site D, two amino acid substitutions (N216H and V223I) were identified in the New York isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Also within site D, another substitution (F174Y) was seen in the CIVs isolated from the Colorado shelter during 2009–2010, while within antigenic site E, two amino acid residue mutations were seen in New York isolates (H75Q and P262T). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>These consistent mutations among CIV isolates, despite passage number and culture system, suggest that CIV is indeed evolving and not an artificial result of in vitro selection pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Additionally, as the analyses presented here are based on genomic and antigenic sites described for human and equine H3 influenza A viruses [17–21], it is possible that the CIV HA has different antigenic regions that have yet to be defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>More research on CIV is warranted to confirm the structure of the CIV HA protein, map antigenic regions associated with virus neutralization and antigenic drift, and further investigate antigenic variation leading to CIV immune escape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Finally, one limitation of our study was the possible degradation of nasal swab samples between collection, transport, and processing, as well as the fact that sequencing directly from nasal swabs has, thus, far been unsuccessful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>As samples were stored on-site at humane shelters before being shipped to the Colorado State University laboratory, infectious virus might have been compromised, which could account for our low number of isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Future studies utilizing virus isolation might want to find a quicker, yet practical, protocol for sending samples to the laboratory soon after collection. </plain></SENT>
