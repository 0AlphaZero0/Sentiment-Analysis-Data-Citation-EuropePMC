</text></title><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), which is also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the family of polyglutamine (polyQ)-dependent disorders1, 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The maladies that comprise this group result from abnormal expansions in the polyQ region of different proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PolyQ diseases also include Huntington's, Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy, Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy and five more SCAs2, 3, 4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SCA3, considered to be the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world, is caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in the ATXN3 gene that is normally 12–42 repeats in length, but is expanded to ~52–84 repeats in diseased individuals1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>PolyQ expansion occurs in the protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase (DUB) that is involved in protein quality control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 protects mammalian cells against various forms of stress5 and serves a protective role against toxic polyQ proteins in Drosophila6, 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>How pathogenic expansion of the polyQ region of ataxin-3 causes SCA3 is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There is presently no cure for this disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Reducing the levels of disease proteins improves degeneration in various animal models of proteinopathies, including polyQ diseases3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Consequently, a potential therapeutic strategy for SCA3 entails reducing the levels of the ataxin-3 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This concept is supported by recent work that used viral-mediated delivery of RNA-interference (RNAi) constructs to reduce levels of ataxin-3 protein in mouse brain18, and alleviated SCA3-like pathology in one study19. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of degradation of the ataxin-3 protein is not clear1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Most cellular proteins are degraded by being post-translationally modified with the small protein ubiquitin, which targets them for proteasomal degradation20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here, we present evidence that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 is not necessary for its proteasomal degradation, and find that the turnover of this polyQ protein is regulated by Ubiquitin-Binding Site 2 (UbS2) on its N terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>UbS2 mediates the interaction of ataxin-3 with the proteasome-associated proteins Rad23A and Rad23B21, 22, 23, 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>According to our studies, this interaction prevents the proteasomal turnover of ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Our findings describe a precise molecular target through which to enhance the degradation of ataxin-3 protein for SCA3 therapeutics, perhaps by designing molecules that bind UbS2 and prevent its interaction with Rad23A/B. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="S3"><title><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Ataxin-3 does not require ubiquitination to be degraded </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Previous reports presented evidence that the turnover of normal and pathogenic ataxin-3 (figure 1A) depends on the proteasome1, and we showed that ataxin-3 protein is ubiquitinated in mammalian cells, in mouse brain and in Drosophila7, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, one would expect ataxin-3 to be degraded by becoming ubiquitinated and thus targeted for the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Yet, while the role of the proteasome in ataxin-3 degradation is well supported1, it is not entirely clear that ataxin-3 needs be ubiquitinated in order to be degraded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To examine this possibility, we used a version of ataxin-3 whose lysine residues are mutated into the similar but non-ubiquitinatable amino acid arginine (K-Null). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We do not detect ubiquitinated species with K-Null ataxin-3 in cultured mammalian cells (figure 1B) or in Drosophila (figure 2B, as well as other supportive data published by us7, 27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Mutating all of the fifteen lysine residues of ataxin-3 into arginines does not affect its subcellular localization in mammalian cells, or disrupt its ability to cleave ubiquitin chains in reconstituted systems in vitro27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Lysine-less ataxin-3 retains some of its functions: similarly to the wild type version of this DUB, the K-null variant is able to somewhat suppress neurodegeneration in Drosophila, although this function cannot be enhanced by its own ubiquitination in order to reach the full protective effect of ubiquitinatable ataxin-37. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We first examined the turnover of K-Null ataxin-3 protein compared to its wild type counterpart in cultured cells. Figure 1C summarizes cycloheximide (CHX)-based pulse-chase studies, where we observe that the turnover of K-Null ataxin-3 is not slower than that of WT ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In fact, based on quantification of data from multiple western blots, K-Null ataxin-3 might be degraded slightly more quickly than the normal version of this DUB in cells (figure 1C, 360 min time point; 1D, 120 min time point). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Both WT and K-Null ataxin-3 proteins are stabilized in cells by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Figure 1D), a finding that is in accordance with previous reports that ataxin-3 turnover in cells is proteasome-dependent1, 25. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to investigate whether K-Null ataxin-3 accumulates in vivo in an intact organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We utilized the Gal4-UAS system30 to express ataxin-3 constructs throughout the fly7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We generated flies that express WT, K-Null or K-117 (the lysine predominantly ubiquitinated in vitro and in mammalian cell culture27) ataxin-3 by using the ubiquitous Gal4 driver sqh-Gal431, 32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We compared fly lines that express the various ataxin-3 transgenes at similar mRNA levels, according to quantitative RT-PCR (figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>As shown in figure 2B, K-Null ataxin-3 protein does not accumulate compared to WT or K-117 ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Together, results in figures 1 and 2 lead us to conclude that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 is not absolutely necessary for its degradation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Since ubiquitination of ataxin-3 does not appear to be necessary for its turnover (figures 1 and 2), we wondered whether protein-binding domains of this DUB are involved in its degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Several domains on ataxin-3 enable its direct interaction with other proteins (figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Starting at the N-terminus, first is UbS1 on the catalytic domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>UbS1 binds ubiquitin and is necessary for the catalytic activity of ataxin-323. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Next is UbS2, which binds ubiquitin as well as Rad23A and Rad23B21, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Rad23A/B facilitate substrate protein degradation by reversibly associating with the proteasome33, 34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Previous structural work focusing on the catalytic domain of ataxin-3 indicated that mutating the amino acid tryptophan (W) at position 87 disrupts the ability of UbS2 to interact with the isolated ubiquitin-like domain of Rad2321, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Through an in vitro pulldown assay that utilized recombinant, full-length ataxin-3 and Rad23A, we confirmed that mutating W87 into an alanine residue diminishes the ability of these two proteins to interact (supplementary figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We also verified in mammalian cell culture that this mutation reduces the capacity of an otherwise normal, full-length ataxin-3 to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Rad23A and Rad23B (supplementary figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Mutating UbS2 does not abrogate the catalytic activity of ataxin-323 or affect its subcellular localization (supplementary figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>In the C-terminal half of ataxin-3 are three ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which bind ubiquitin chains at least four moieties long29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal portion also contains an arginine-rich region that binds the AAA ATPase protein VCP (also known as p97)35, 36, 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>VCP functions at least in part as a proteasomal shuttle protein33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Mutating one or more of the arginine residues of the VCP-binding site of full-length ataxin-3 into histidines or alanines has been demonstrated to disrupt its interaction with VCP in reconstituted systems in vitro and in mammalian cells35, 36, 37. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Because ataxin-3 binds to proteins that associate with the proteasome, we examined whether UbS2 or the VCP-binding site regulates its stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>For the experiments described in figure 3A–3F, we utilized ataxin-3 constructs that do not contain lysine residues in order to eliminate any potentially confounding effects from ubiquitination at this stage of our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, mutating UbS2 (denoted as UbS2*; mutation is W87A unless noted otherwise) markedly reduces ataxin-3 steady-state protein levels in cultured mammalian cells (figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Mutating the VCP-binding site (denoted as VCP*) does not consistently alter steady-state protein levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In most experimental repeats we did not detect a difference in the steady-state levels of K-Null ataxin-3 with the VCP-binding site mutated compared to versions with intact VCP-binding, as shown in figure 3A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>There were a few instances where the levels of ataxin-3 with mutated VCP-binding were lower, as summarized by the quantification of multiple blots in figure 3A, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Mutating both UbS2 and the VCP-binding site has an effect similar to that observed when only UbS2 is mutated (figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The studies in figure 3A were conducted in HeLa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A similar effect is observed in HEK-293 cells (supplementaey figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The effect from mutating UbS2 does not result from differences at the mRNA level, as those levels are not significantly different (figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, the difference in steady-state levels depends on the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Inhibiting proteasomal activity with MG132 equalizes the levels of ataxin-3 protein with mutated UbS2 to those of ataxin-3 with intact UbS2 (figure 3C and supplementary figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Two other amino acid residues important for UbS2 are tyrosine (Y) at position 27 and phenylalanine (F) at position 2821, 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Mutating those amino acids also leads to reduced steady-state levels of ataxin-3 protein in cultured cells (figure 3D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the turnover rate of ataxin-3 with intact or mutated UbS2 by using CHX-based pulse-chase assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>As shown in figure 3E, ataxin-3 protein with mutated UbS2 is turned over markedly more rapidly than ataxin-3 with intact UbS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Mutating only the VCP-binding site does not significantly affect turnover (figure 3F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>CHX-based analyses are consistent with steady-state examinations, indicating that UbS2 inhibits ataxin-3 degradation in cells, while VCP-binding does not appear to have a significant effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we focus the rest of the studies in this report on UbS2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>As already stated, for experiments in panels 3A–F we used K-Null ataxin-3 that contains intact or mutated UbS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We next investigated whether the protein levels of ataxin-3 with all of its lysines present are also regulated by UbS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Mutating UbS2 in an otherwise normal ataxin-3 dramatically reduces its steady-state protein levels (figure 3G) and turnover (figure 3H), similar to what we observed with non-ubiquitinatable ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results from mammalian cell culture indicate that UbS2 inhibits the proteasomal turnover of non-pathogenic ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S5"><title><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>UIMs of ataxin-3 have an opposite effect to UbS2 on turnover </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>For ataxin-3 to be degraded by the proteasome, it needs to come into contact with this cellular machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>One possibility through which this interaction could occur would be through ataxin-3 ubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>However, our results argue against ubiquitination being necessary for ataxin-3 degradation (figures 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Another mechanism that could bridge ataxin-3 to the proteasome could be the poly-ubiquitin binding UIMs of this polyQ protein, which could bind ubiquitinated proteins targeted for the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We mutated a conserved serine residue in each UIM of non-pathogenic ataxin-3 into an alanine, disrupting its interaction with ubiquitin chains26, 29, 38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Results in figure 4 indicate that the UIMs regulate the turnover of ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Mutating all three UIMs counteracts the degradative effect of UbS2 mutation both at the steady-state level (figure 4A and supplementary figure 4) and turnover rate (figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the UIMs of ataxin-3 have a positive effect on its cellular turnover. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Two proteins that bind ataxin-3 directly at UbS2 are Rad23A and Rad23B21, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined whether Rad23A/B affect ataxin-3 protein levels in cultured cells by using RNA-interference (RNAi). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of endogenous Rad23A or Rad23B through different, non-overlapping siRNA constructs noticeably decreases levels of Rad23A or Rad23B protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Next, we examined the significance of UbS2 in ataxin-3 protein levels in Drosophila. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>We generated new transgenic fly lines that express non-pathogenic ataxin-3 with mutated UbS2 and selected lines that express WT and UbS2* ataxin-3 transgenes at similar mRNA levels, as well as ones that express the UbS2* variant more strongly (figure 5A). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The degradation of most short-lived, abnormal and misfolded proteins in eukaryotic cells is accomplished by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>In this pathway, proteins destined for the proteasome are tagged post-translationally with ubiquitin chains, which enable their recognition by proteasome-associated ubiquitin-binding proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Once bound to the proteasome, these ubiquitinated substrates are deubiquitinated and ultimately degraded20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In our search to determine how the disease protein ataxin-3 is degraded, we collected evidence that the turnover of this polyQ protein does not require its own ubiquitination: ataxin-3 that does not become ubiquitinated is degraded similarly to its wild type version in cells and does not accumulate in vivo in Drosophila. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P26"><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>According to a previous report, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP may ubiquitinate ataxin-3 as well as other polyQ proteins to target them for degradation39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we previously showed that ataxin-3 is ubiquitinated in mammalian cells and in Drosophila7, 26, 27, 28, and that ubiquitination directly and dramatically enhances its deubiquitinase activity7, 26, 27, 28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, recent work indicated that CHIP ubiquitinates ataxin-3 to modify its catalytic activity during the process of substrate ubiquitination, where ataxin-3 and CHIP cooperate to enhance CHIP substrate degradation26, 27, 28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CHIP knockout mice do not show accumulation of ataxin-3 protein, and knockdown of CHIP in Drosophila does not detectably impact ataxin-3 protein levels7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Based on these previously published findings and our present results, we propose that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 serves to regulate its DUB functions, rather than directly dictate its proteasomal turnover. This is not to say that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 might not enhance its turnover under some circumstances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>What our results indicate is that ataxin-3 does not need to be ubiquitinated to be degraded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Other proteins have been reported to be degraded by the proteasome in the absence of their own ubiquitination, including p21/CiP140, calmodulin41, thymidylate synthase42, tau43, etc.44. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P27"><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>We found that ataxin-3 degradation is regulated by its UbS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Mutation of this domain accelerates the turnover of ataxin-3 in cells and leads to markedly lower levels of this protein in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The general structural organization of the catalytic domain of ataxin-3 appears to not be impacted by mutating residue W87 of UbS2, according to previously published NMR studies21, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The localization of full-length ataxin-3(UbS2*) in cultured mammalian cells is not different from versions of this protein with intact UbS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Full-length ataxin-3 with mutated UbS2 is capable of cleaving ubiquitin chains in vitro23, and this site is dispensable for the ubiquitination-dependent activation of ataxin-3 that we have reported previously23, 26, 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, mutating UbS2 does not detrimentally impact ataxin-3’s folding and localization, or abrogate its basic catalytic activities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P28"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>UbS2 binds directly to Rad23A/B21, 22, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Rad23A and/or B in cultured cells leads to significantly lower levels of ataxin-3 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Importantly, Rad23 knockdown in Drosophila leads to lower levels of pathogenic ataxin-3 and ameliorates retinal degeneration caused by this protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Based on our collective results, we propose a model for ataxin-3 degradation whereby its UIMs bind ubiquitinated proteasome substrates and “bring” this protein quality control DUB into the proximity of the degradative machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Once near the proteasome, the interaction of ataxin-3 with Rad23 prevents it from being degraded, perhaps because the direct binding of this polyQ protein to Rad23 is stronger than its association with the proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>If ataxin-3 does not bind Rad23, it is then degraded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P29"><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Our finding that UbS2 controls ataxin-3 degradation is of critical importance to SCA3 therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The structure of the N-terminal half of ataxin3, including UbS2, has been solved by NMR spectroscopy and its interaction with the ubiquitin-like domain of Rad23 has been modeled at this level21, 22, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We propose that this structural information be utilized to generate compounds that bind ataxin-3 at UbS2 and inhibit its interaction with Rad23 in order to increase the degradation rate of pathogenic ataxin-3 in SCA3 patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P30"><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The work that we presented might be also of significance to diseases other than SCA3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Rad23A is reported to also interact directly with ataxin-745, mutations in which cause SCA74. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It would be of interest to determine if Rad23A inhibits the degradation of ataxin-7, similar to its effect on ataxin-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a recent study by Coulson and colleagues46 provided convincing evidence that ataxin-3 restricts the transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>PTEN is considered a viable therapeutic target for various malignancies47, 48. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of ataxin-3 degradation that we presented leads us to suggest that enhancing the turnover of this enzyme could conceivably be utilized for cancer therapeutics: lowering ataxin-3 levels would be expected to increase the levels of PTEN. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P31"><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Lastly, our findings suggest additional complexity in basic mechanisms of protein quality control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The general view of proteasome-associated proteins is that they enhance the degradation of client proteins with which they interact34, 49, 50. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our data propose that some proteasome-associated proteins, e.g. Rad23, can also inhibit, not just enhance, protein turnover. This novel finding suggests that proteasome shuttles need not always function in one direction, and expands the overall understanding of how individual components perform during protein quality control. </plain></SENT>
