<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MiR-146a is one, of a small number of miRNAs, whose expression is strongly induced following challenge of cells with bacterial endotoxin, and prolonged expression has been linked to immune tolerance, implying that it acts as a fine-tuning mechanism to prevent an overstimulation of the inflammatory response. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Innate immunity is the critical first line of defense against invading microbial pathogens, and is the primary effector of the inflammatory response and initiator of the adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microbial pathogens are recognized by several families of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that interact with conserved molecular structures that are broadly conserved on most microorganisms, which are known as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These interactions trigger a cascade of intra-cellular signaling that results in the induction of transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons (IFNs). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The best characterized PRRs in regards to their microbial ligands, downstream signaling, and the effectors that are induced are undoubtedly members of the toll receptor family (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Other families include the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors and Nod-like receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Downstream signaling following stimulation of these receptors is intricately regulated by a huge variety of extra-cellular and intra-cellular mechanisms involving kinases, phosphatases, transcriptional co-activators, membrane proteins, and trafficking molecules, among others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Recently, a novel post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by small RNA species known as microRNAs (miRNAs) has been added to the list of important regulators of PRR signaling (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>IRAK1 and TRAF6 are molecular targets of miR-146a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>After the primary transcript of miRNA-146a is generated by RNA polymerase, the primary miRNA is processed by Drosha in the nucleus to produce a short hairpin pre-cursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) transcript, which is then shuttled into the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Further processing in the cytoplasm by Dicer produces the final mature 22-basepair dsRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This mature miRNA complex is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The seed-sequence binds to complimentary sequences in the 3′untranslated region (UTR) of its target mRNA transcripts, such as IRAK1, and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This results in translational repression of IRAK1 and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-05-00578-g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs were first identified in 1993 by the laboratory of Victor Ambros (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>They found that a 22 nucleotide long RNA, transcribed from the lin-4 gene, could bind to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the lin-14 messenger RNA (mRNA) of C. elegans through Watson and Crick complementary base-pairing and thereby inhibit the translation of the mRNA into a functional protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>At first thought to be an idiosyncrasy of this particular species, miRNAs were soon discovered to be present in a wide assortment of vertebrate species and cell types and it has become evident that these molecules exhibit important functions in the post-transcriptional regulation of protein synthesis (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Mature miRNAs are transcribed as pre-cursor transcripts either as independently or polycistronic clusters, or as introns of coding genes (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Their expression is generally highly regulated in tissue- and development-specific expression patterns, implying an important contribution to cell-type specific protein expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Due to their mode of function, miRNAs are especially well suited to be part of auto-regulatory feed-back loops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In particular cases, they are able to directly target their own regulators, thereby being able to “fine-tune” their own expression (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs interact with their target genes by binding to complementary sequences in the 3′UTR of the target mRNA(s), see Figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Most important for efficient binding is the continuous base-pairing of the “seed-region,” which is represented by miRNA nucleotides 2 → 8 in the 5′ region (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In most animals, however, the overall base-pairing is imperfect leading to inhibited protein synthesis that is mediated by either translational repression and/or a promoting effect on mRNA deadenylation and decay. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The discovery of hundreds of experimentally verified miRNAs in mammals (http://www.mirbase.org/) has highlighted the importance of miRNA-dependent mechanisms as pervasive regulators of the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Since on average each miRNA is able to repress hundreds of target mRNAs (10, 11), computational analysis predicts that as much as 30–60% of mammalian genes may be controlled by these molecules (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>By targeting a plethora of mRNAs, miRNAs can regulate multiple pathways and biological processes simultaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, many miRNAs have now been found to not only participate in these large-scale processes but also to “fine-tune” the accurate levels of their target genes in a wide assortment of cells and tissues (13, 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The first indication that miRNAs may play a role in the immune response originated from work that showed the selective expression of several miRNAs in cells of the immune system (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Since then, numerous studies have revealed important physiological roles for miRNAs in the regulation of both the innate and adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In particular miR-146 and miR-155 are negative regulators of immune-related signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>MiR-155 and miR-21 have been shown to regulate immune tolerance and miR-223 and miR-150 play functional roles modulating the translation of transcription factors that are essential for the development of specific immune lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, their altered expression has been associated with pathological conditions of the immune system, including hematologic cancers and autoimmunity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>One miRNA that has been determined to play a central role in immune responses, particularly the innate immune response, is miR-146a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Its importance was recently confirmed in a miR-146a knock-out mouse model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In addition to developing autoimmunity, these mice are hyper-responsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and demonstrate an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response when challenged with endotoxin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aged knock-out mice develop tumors in their secondary lymphoid organs and undergo myeloproliferation, suggesting that miR-146a regulates proliferation in immune cells (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this latter finding, miR-146a-deficient mice develop myeloid malignancies due to chronic dysregulation of NF-κB signaling (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-146a deficient mice develop many of the same abnormal hematopoietic phenotypes described in a subset of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with 5q-syndrome in which a segment of chromosome 5q is deleted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This observation is quite interesting because miR-146a resides on chromosome 5q33.3 and because miR-145 and miR-146a expression is reportedly lost in the CD34+ bone marrow-derived progenitor cells of many MDS patients with 5q-syndrome (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In addition, in vitro knockdown of miR-146a in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can recapitulate many of the phenotypic abnormalities observed in 5q-syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies suggest a role for miR-146a as a tumor suppressor and in controlling the proliferation capabilities of immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This involvement in cell growth and division likely leads to the high frequency with which alterations in expression is associated with malignancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Similar to miR-155, miR-146a expression is enriched in regulatory T (Treg) cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Knock-out of miR-146a expression in the Treg cells of mice leads to a fatal breakdown of tolerance and results in a CD4+ helper T lymphocyte (Th1)-mediated immunopathology that is dependent on interferon gamma (IFN-γ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-146a’s targeting of the expression of Stat1, a member of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription family of transcription factors that is involved in upregulating genes in response to interferon stimulation, is necessary for the in vivo suppressor function of Tregs (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>T effector subsets were also deficient for miR-146a in this model and were shown to produce higher levels of IFN-γ and to contribute to the pathogenic Th1 response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Further work utilizing lineage-specific ablation of conditional alleles is necessary to clearly define the role of miR-146a in different lymphocyte subsets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the central role prescribed to miR-146a in innate immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We particularly focus on the role played by miR-146a in the regulation and signaling mediated by one of the main PRRs, TLRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we also discuss the role of miR-146a in several classes of autoimmune pathologies where this miRNA has been shown to be dysregulated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Toll/IL-1 receptors are the best studied family of PRRs and were among the first pathways to be investigated for possible modulation by miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In human beings, there are 11 TLR homologs (TLR-1 to TLR-11), each specifically expressed with respect to cell type, and with unique extracellular or cellular domains that have the ability to recognize a wide variety of ligands (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>TLRs initiate the innate immune response by activating several signaling pathways that depend on adapter molecules, specifically, MyD88 (MyD88 signaling pathway) or the domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-beta, TRIF, also known as TICAM1 (TRIF signaling pathway). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Consequently, these adapter molecules mediate the downstream activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), members of the interferon regulatory factor family and activator protein-1 (AP-1), which contribute to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, type 1 IFNs (IFNs such as IRF3 and IRF7) and anti-viral proteins (21, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The MyD88 pathway, which leads to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK, is used by most of the TLRs except for TLR3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>TLR3 (and also TLR4) possess the ability to utilize the TRIF signaling pathway (23, 24). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Sufficient signaling by the TLRs is required for the effective clearance of pathogens but unrestrained TLR response can also be deleterious to the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TLR-mediated inflammatory response must be tightly controlled and the intricate regulatory potential afforded by miRNAs and miR-146a in particular is, therefore, highly pertinent to the physiological operation of this type of innate immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In this section, we discuss three particular scenarios by which miR-146a is intimately involved in the control of the mammalian innate immune response mediated by TLRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This includes:(i).The regulation of miR-146a expression by TLR-signaling.(ii).The direct regulation of TLRs by miR-146a.(iii).The regulation of TLR-signaling components/molecules by miR-146a. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="S2-1"><title><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The regulation of miR-146a expression by TLR-signaling </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The regulation of miRNA expression by TLR-signaling has been well documented with a wide assortment of miRNAs exhibiting altered expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a consensus has emerged that regardless of the TLR-stimulus utilized, the various screening platforms employed, or the cell types used, the induction of two miRNAs in particular, miR-146a and miR-155, are particularly prominent suggesting roles in the pathways downstream of TLR stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The first set of evidence contributing to the role of miR-146a in innate immunity was acquired from work performed on the human monocytic THP-1 cell line in response to LPS stimulation or treatment with the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>LPS, a TLR4 agonist, was found to rapidly induce the expression of miR-146a, which was then shown to act as a negative feed-back regulator of molecules in the same signaling system used for its own induction in an effort to dampen the magnitude of the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>MiR-146a has been shown both in vitro and in vivo to directly target two serine/threonine kinases, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), that become associated with the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) upon stimulation and are partially responsible for IL-1-induced upregulation of NF-kB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>This binding results in the suppression of the expression of NF-κB’s target genes such as the interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and TNF alpha (TNF-α) (8, 16, 25–28) (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>MiR-146a negatively regulates signal transduction pathways leading to NF-κB activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Upon activation of a cell surface receptors, such as TLR4 belonging to the TLR family, a molecular cascade including TRAF6 and IRAK1 leads to IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and to NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>NF-κB activation induces transcription of many genes, including pri-miR-146a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Once translocated to the cytoplasm and loaded onto the RISC complex, mature miR-146a contributes to the attenuation of receptor signaling through the down-regulation of IRAK1 and TRAF6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fimmu-05-00578-g002"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The induction of miR-146a by LPS, in response to TLR4-signaling, is dependent on NF-κB and the miR-146a promoter contains several putative binding sites (~3) for this transcription factor (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Other TLR-agonists that have been shown to induce miR-146a expression, although to a lesser extent than LPS, include Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist), peptidoglycan (TLR2 agonist), and flagellin (TLR5 agonist) (8, 29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the infection of murine macrophages with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces miR-146a to negatively regulate the RIG-I anti-viral pathway by targeting not only IRAK2 and TRAF6, but also IRAK1, and in doing so suppressing the production of type-I interferon (i.e., IFNα) (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>MiR-146a has also been shown to target STAT-1 and IRF-5, both of which are involved in the type I interferon response pathway (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, low levels of miR-146a in lupus patients correlate with higher levels of interferon and with worse clinical manifestation (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the aforementioned studies strongly depict an extensive role for miR-146a in innate immunity as a dominant, negative regulator of the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Studies have also prescribed a role for miR-146a in endotoxin-induced tolerance (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Endotoxin tolerance is the hypo-responsive state of monocytes to subsequent challenge to LPS, following a period of prolonged LPS exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>This particular tolerance is often necessary to prevent aberrant inflammation due to continuous exposure to bacterial components, such as those emanating from commensal microflora at epithelial surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Experiments with THP-1 cells have shown that miR-146a levels increase following LPS exposure (TLR4-signaling) and negatively correlate with TNF-α levels as the cells develop a state of LPS tolerance (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Importantly, tolerance induction requires miR-146a up-regulation and the transfection of exogenous miR-146a is sufficient to induce endotoxin tolerance, even in the absence of LPS-priming (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the knock-down of miR-146a diminishes the effects of LPS tolerance (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Subsequent work confirmed these findings and showed that miR-146a was necessary for LPS-induced cross tolerance to several different TLR-ligands (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-146a is important for innate immune tolerance in the neonatal intestine because it targets IRAK1 and thereby prevents apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells following exposure to bacteria (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>As a whole, these studies support the key notion that although miR-146a is induced by TLR-signaling, its key role may be to serve as a dominant negative feed-back regulator to prevent uncontrolled inflammation in response to persistent bacterial exposures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Two additional mechanisms of TLR4/LPS-signaling induced, miR-146a-mediated, endotoxin tolerance have been reported (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Firstly, miR-146a was shown to be involved in the binding of the transcriptional repressor encoded by the RELB gene to the promoter region of TNF-α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The binding of RelB (NF-κB member) results in the generation of a facultative heterochromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The depletion of miR-146a alone is not sufficient to reverse the compact nature of the chromatin resulting in the persistence of endotoxin tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>It is only when both the RELB and miR-146a are depleted that the tolerance appears to be reversed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Secondly, miR-146a has also been shown to regulate the translational repression of TNFα. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This is believed to be mediated through miR-146a preventing the interaction of the RNA-binding protein effector argonaute-2 (Ago2) and RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4), both members of the translational repressor (miRNA/RISC) complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the previous themes, the treatment of A549 lung epithelial cells (and also a range of other lung-associated cells including airway epithelial BEAS2B cells, primary human airway epithelial cells and primary human airway smooth muscle cells) with high levels of IL-1β rapidly increases miR-146a and suppresses the IL-1β-induced chemokines, IL-8 and RANTES (32, 33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in A549 lung cells, this negative feed-back inhibition was only apparent at high IL-1β concentrations suggesting a potential role for this miRNA-mediated mechanism during severe inflammation (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The induction of miR-146a by IL-1β is mediated by both a mechanism involving NF-κB and also dependent on a JNK-1/2-mediated mechanism (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>More in depth analysis of the mechanism of miR-146a induction using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that although NF-κB is involved in the transcription of pri-miR-146a, the MAP kinases, ERK-1/2, and JNK-1/2 pathways appear to regulate the post-transcriptional processing of the mature miR-146a (34). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have established a critical role for miR-146a in inflammation and immunity where it primarily appears to operate as a dominant negative regulator of the vertebrate innate immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>This miRNA appears to “fine-tune” or “dampen” the innate immune response to possibly prevent an uncontrolled inflammatory response that may lead to the exacerbation of the initial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>MiR-146a mainly operates in this manner through the targeting for down-regulation NF-κB upstream molecules IRAK1 and TRAF6, of the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, leading to a concerted decrease in the production of various inflammatory mediators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Despite numerous studies that show the induction of miR-146a by pro-inflammatory mediators most notably of the TLR-signaling mechanism, there is still incomplete evidence regarding its precise role, mechanism of action, and the potential landscape of target genes regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Also relatively understudied is whether miR-146a is similarly induced by other vertebrate PRRs involved in innate immune signaling such as the signaling mediated by RIG-I-like receptors, AIM2-like receptors and Nod-like receptors, and also whether miR-146a serves a similar purpose in these pathways as it does in TLR-signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Although most studies on miR-146a function have been focused on investigating the TLR pathway and cells involved in inflammation, it is undoubtedly expressed in numerous other cell types and here may be involved in a further range of context-specific functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Usage of the miR-146a−/− transgenic mouse (16, 17) will aid in unraveling these, as will investigating the role of this miRNA in the pathogenesis of human diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>It will then be an important next step to determine whether manipulating the levels of expression of miR-146a, as well as its targets, has therapeutic benefits. </plain></SENT>
