The aim of this study was to examine the importance of muscle in regulating ANGPTL4 in response to exercise. We sampled muscle biopsies and serum before, immediately after, and 2 h after 45 min of ergometer cycling. Sampling was done before and after a 12&#x02010;week training intervention in controls and dysglycemic subjects. Moreover, fat biopsies were taken before and after the training intervention. The regulation of ANGPTL4 was also investigated in several tissues of exercising mice, and in cultured myotubes. ANGPTL4 levels in serum and expression in muscle were highest 2 h after exercise in both groups. Whereas ANGPTL4 was higher in muscle of exercising controls as compared to dysglycemic subjects, the opposite was observed in serum. In exercising mice, <italic>Angptl4 </italic>mRNA showed both higher basal expression and induction in liver compared to muscle. <italic>Angptl4 </italic>mRNA was much higher in adipose tissue than muscle and was also induced by exercise. We observed two mRNA isoforms of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> in muscle and fat in humans. Both were induced by exercise in muscle; one isoform was expressed 5&#x02010; to 10&#x02010;fold higher than the other. Studies in mice and cultured myotubes showed that both fatty acids and cortisol have the potential to increase <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> expression in muscle during exercise. In conclusion, <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> is markedly induced in muscle in response to exercise. However, liver and adipose tissue may contribute more than muscle to the exercise&#x02010;induced increase in circulating ANGPTL4.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="precis"><p>The Production of ANGPTL4 is markedly induced in skeletal muscle in response to exercise.

Skeletal muscle can synthesize and secrete several hundred proteins (Bortoluzzi et al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Henningsen et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Norheim et al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Proteins that are expressed, synthesized, released by myofibers, and exert either paracrine or endocrine effects, are classified as &#x0201c;myokines&#x0201d; (Pedersen and Febbraio <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Although skeletal muscle hypertrophy and regeneration may enhance myokine secretion for a long period (Ambrosio et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Norheim et al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Shan et al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), acute muscle fiber contraction can induce myokine secretion rapidly, as shown for IL&#x02010;6 (Pedersen and Febbraio <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>ANGPTL4 is a multifunctional signal protein synthesized by most tissues (Grootaert et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). It is involved in regulation of angiogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and cell differentiation (Grootaert et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Several studies show that ANGPTL4 inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for hydrolysis of plasma triacylglycerols (TG) to monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids (FFAs) (Yoshida et al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Mandard et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Desai et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Grootaert et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). ANGPTL4 may also stimulate adipose tissue lipolysis, and thereby release of glycerol and FFAs to the circulation (Yoshida et al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Mandard et al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Thus, the net effect of ANGPTL4 will represent a shift of FA oxidation derived from lipoproteins toward FAs originating from adipose tissue. Furthermore, ANGPTL4 is positively associated with body fat mass (Smart&#x02010;Halajko et al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Expression of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> is increased via different peroxisome proliferator&#x02010;activated receptors (PPARs) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in hepatocytes and adipocytes (Kersten et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Koliwad et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Grootaert et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Studies on cultured human myotubes show that secretion of ANGPTL4 is stimulated by fatty acids (FAs) as well as the PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>&#x02010;specific activator GW501516 (Kersten et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Staiger et al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Robciuc et al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The impact of exercise on <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> expression during exercise is not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that ANGPTL4 is an exercise&#x02010;responsive myokine regulated by circulating factors (Kersten et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Kersten et al. (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) reported that the plasma concentration of ANGPTL4 after endurance activity is less enhanced in subjects given oral glucose, and Catoire et al. (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) demonstrated in a human one&#x02010;legged exercise study a stronger induction of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> mRNA in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg. The inhibitory effect of glucose on <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> transcription is probably caused by increased release of insulin, causing suppression of lipolysis and reduced plasma FFA concentration (Kersten et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of plasma FFA on skeletal muscle ANGPTL4 expression might be counteracted by the activation of AMPK&#x02010;activated kinase (AMPK) in exercising muscle. To our knowledge, it is not known if ANGPTL4 produced in skeletal muscle mainly act on the local tissue or whether the protein also convey an endocrine effect.</p><p>The main aim of this study was to examine the importance of skeletal muscle in regulating circulating ANGPTL4. We also investigated if transcription of ANGPTL4 in skeletal muscle is regulated solely via PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> or if additional exercise&#x02010;related factors such as glucocorticoids may play a role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the National Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics North, Troms&#x000f8;, Oslo, Norway.

Abnormal glucose metabolism was defined as fasting glucose &#x02265;5.6 mmol/L and/or impaired glucose tolerance (2&#x02010;h serum glucose &#x02265;7.8 mmol/L). The participants were subjected to a combined strength and endurance training program for 12 weeks, including two endurance bicycle sessions (60 min) and two whole&#x02010;body strength&#x02010;training sessions (60 min) per week. Each endurance session started with a 10&#x02010;min warm&#x02010;up at three different workloads, corresponding to 50% (4 min), 55% (3 min), and 60% (3 min) of VO<sub>2</sub>max. A 45&#x02010;min bicycle session at 70% of VO<sub>2</sub>max was performed before and after the 12&#x02010;week training period as an acute work challenge.</p><p>A carbohydrate&#x02010;rich meal was provided 90&#x02013;120 min before the exercise test included bread, cheese, jam, and apple juice, providing 23% of estimated total daily energy expenditure, on average 2475 KJ. Tests were performed in the morning, so the standardized meal was the only intake after overnight fast. A few subjects were tested in the afternoon (at the same time of day before as well as after 12 weeks of training) and had the standardized meal as their only intake during the last 4&#x02013;5 h.

A single subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy in the periumbilical region was taken ~30 min after the bicycle session, before as well as after 12 weeks of training. Subcutaneous adipose biopsies were obtained from 13 controls and 11 dysglycemic subjects before as well as after 12 weeks of training.</p><p>Biopsies from <italic>m. vastus lateralis</italic> were immediately transferred to RNA&#x02010;later (Qiagen, Limburg, the Netherlands), kept overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, and transferred to &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Subcutaneous biopsies were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further processing.

Optical density was determined using a microplate reader (Titertec Multiscan Plus; EFLAB, Helsinki, Finland) set to 450 nm. Standard curves for ANGPTL4 and cortisol were generated with a 4 parameters logistics curve&#x02010;fitting method (MyAssays.com). One subject with extremely high levels of ANGPTL4 in serum (80&#x02013;225 ng/mL) was excluded from the ANGPTL4 analysis. FFA plasma levels were determined using a Maxmat PL multianalyzer (Maxmat, France) with reagents (Catalog # D07940/D07950, DIALAB, Wiener Neudorf, Austria).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary human myoblasts from <italic>m. obliquus internus abdominis</italic> of healthy kidney donors were isolated (Haugen et al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Myoblasts at passage 5 were proliferated on collagen I&#x02010;coated dishes in DMEM/Ham's F12 1:1 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing glutamax (Life Technologies), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 g/mL streptomycin, 5 mmol/L glucose, 10% FBS, 70 pM insulin, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, and 2 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma&#x02010;Aldrich).

C57BL/6 male mice were housed in a temperature&#x02010;controlled (22&#x000b0;C) facility with a strict 12&#x02010;h light/dark cycle. Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane before EDTA plasma was collected, and euthanized by cervical dislocation prior to harvest of muscles. Plasma and tissue samples were frozen immediately on dry ice and in liquid nitrogen, respectively, and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Six&#x02010;month&#x02010;old mice were exposed to treadmill exercise (TSE Systems, Germany) prior to sampling of EDTA plasma, calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus), perirenal fat, and liver. To avoid stress&#x02010;related responses, the mice were gradually habituated to treadmill running before a final strenuous exercise session. The first session included 2&#x02010;min free walk on the treadmill with low speed. The next six sessions followed an identical warm&#x02010;up pattern including a speed of 0.10 m/s for 2 min and 0.15 m/s for 8 min. In session 3&#x02013;7, the mice additionally ran at 0.25 m/s for 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min. The last session ended with an additional final graded increase in speed from 0.25 to 0.35 m/s for a 5&#x02010;min period. A platform placed behind the running band enabled the mice to rest from running. Running was encouraged by up to five gentle electrical shocks (0.3 mA) within one exercise session. Mice that after five shocks still sat on the platform were defined as exhausted and removed from the treadmill. All exercise sessions were performed between 2 pm and 4 pm with no food withdrawal prior to exercise. Blood and muscle samples were taken immediately after the final exercise. Control mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were housed in similar cages as the trained mice (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and were handled equally except for the exercise regimen.</p><p>Four&#x02010;month&#x02010;old mice on a standard chow diet were given intragastric gavage of 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (Sigma # C4888) or 300 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L GW501516 (150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L solved in 0.5% CMC; 5 mg/kg) (Bindesboll et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).

Both healthy normal weight controls (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and overweight dysglycemic subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 13) participated in the training intervention. Twelve weeks of training significantly increased aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max) by approximately 17% and insulin sensitivity as measured by the glucose infusion rate during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp by approximately 30% in both groups (T.

We also provide evidence suggesting that ANGPTL4 from muscle has limited impact on the serum level and show that muscle and adipose tissue contain two identical <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> mRNA isoforms.</p><p>One of the aims of this study was to investigate the contribution of skeletal muscle to the serum levels of ANGPTL4. Others have shown that muscle mRNA as well as fasting plasma levels of ANGPTL4 were enhanced in response to endurance exercise, especially after 4&#x02010;h recovery (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We also show that acute exercise increases ANGPTL4 mRNA levels in muscle and protein in serum. In addition, we now provide evidence suggesting that ANGPTL4 from muscle has a minor impact on the serum level compared to adipose tissue and the liver. Firstly, we show that the induction of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> expression is more pronounced in skeletal muscle from exercising healthy controls as compared to overweight dysglycemic subjects, whereas the opposite is observed in serum, suggesting that other organs than skeletal muscle might be responsible for regulation of circulating ANGPTL4 in response to exercise. In mouse experiments, we demonstrate that <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA is induced in response to exercise in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver, and show that liver and adipose tissue have a higher basal expression of <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA levels compared to skeletal muscle. Also, we show that the <italic>Angptl4</italic> mRNA induction in response to exercise is higher in the liver as compared to muscle. However, the fact that skeletal muscle accounts for about 40% of body mass in a lean individual might make it an important contributor to blood levels of ANGPTL4, although it has low <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> expression in muscle tissue. Thus, it is possible that skeletal muscle might be a more important source of circulating ANGPTL4 in subjects with more muscle mass and less adipose tissue. In our human exercise study, the group with the most adipose tissue exhibits the highest basal serum levels of ANGPTL4 and the highest induction of circulating ANGPTL4 in response to exercise. It has also been suggested that the liver is the main contributor to circulating ANGPTL4 during fasting (Dijk and Kersten <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Our data suggests that this is also the case in response to exercise.</p><p>The fact that during a one&#x02010;legged exercise intervention <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> mRNA expression was more induced in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg suggests that circulating factors can induce ANGPTL4 transcription in skeletal muscle (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The plasma levels of FFA are known to increase during acute exercise and are hypothesized to increase transcription of ANGPTL4 in skeletal muscle after PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> activation (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Studies on cultured human myotubes have revealed that secretion of ANGPTL4 is stimulated by FAs as well as a PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>&#x02010;specific activator (Kersten et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Staiger et al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Robciuc et al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In our study, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence for a robust increase of <italic>Angptl4</italic> transcription by PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> in mouse skeletal muscle. We demonstrate by gavage feeding mice that a PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>&#x02010;specific ligand enhances muscle <italic>Angptl4</italic> transcription in vivo. We also show that the FFA&#x02010;induced <italic>Angptl4</italic> expression was reduced in myotubes by an inhibitor specific for PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>, but not by inhibitors directed against PPAR<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and PPAR<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>.</p><p>Several circulating factors are increased in response to acute exercise in addition to FFAs. One of the hormones that are known to be increased in response to exercise is the glucocorticoid cortisol (Nieman et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Because it has been shown that ANGPTL4 is a direct GR target in hepatocytes as well as in adipocytes (Koliwad et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), one of the aims of this study was to investigate if human myotubes also respond to glucocorticoids by increasing <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> expression. We show that the serum concentration of cortisol is indeed increased in response to acute exercise. We also show that <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> transcription is elevated in cultures of primary human muscle cells incubated with the GR ligand, dexamethasone, comparable to the effects of dexamethasone on primary rat hepatocytes and human adipocytes (Koliwad et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). A recent study showed that circulating ANGPTL4 is not elevated by exercise when glucose is consumed (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, both the plasma level of FFAs and cortisol are reduced when glucose is ingested during exercise (Nieman et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and may thus both explain some of the suppressive effects of glucose on circulating ANGPTL4 (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> mRNA in muscle can be regulated by the cortisol&#x02010;GR axis during acute exercise.</p><p>One function of ANGPTL4 may be to inhibit the uptake of FAs derived from lipoproteins by regulating LPL activity in skeletal muscle during exercise (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Interestingly, Catoire et al. (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) suggested that during a one&#x02010;legged exercise intervention <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> mRNA expression was more increased in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg because of the counteracting effect of AMPK on <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> transcription. The repression of ANGPTL4 production and hence enhanced LPL activity might promote use of circulating TG in the exercising muscle (Catoire et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We show in our human exercise intervention that acute exercise induces both <italic>LPL</italic> and <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> transcription in skeletal muscle to a higher degree in control subjects as compared to the dysglycemic subjects. However, the serum levels of ANGPTL4 were more increased after exercise in the overweight dysglycemic subjects than in the controls. Because the relative contribution of skeletal muscle to circulating ANGPTL4 during exercise remains unknown, it is difficult to predict in which group ANGPTL4 has the largest inhibitory effect on LPL activity. Coexpression of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> with <italic>LPL</italic> in skeletal muscle might suggest that ANGPTL4 acts mainly via local inhibition (Dijk and Kersten <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Future studies should address the relative contribution of skeletal muscle to circulating ANGPTL4. Thereby, it would be possible to evaluate the inhibitory potential ANGPTL4 may have on LPL activity during exercise.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that ANGPTL4 produced in skeletal muscle during and after exercise has limited impact on the serum protein level and probably acts mostly in local tissue. Our data also indicate that FFAs and cortisol increase transcription of <italic>ANGPTL4</italic> in muscle during exercise via activation of PPAR<italic>&#x003b4;</italic> and GR.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hilde Nebb for access to experimental materials, Anne Randi Enget and Christin Zwafink for technical assistance, Harald Carlsen for donation of mice, Ansgar Heck and Birgitte Nellemann are for taking the biopsies, and Kristoffer J Kolnes, Daniel S Tangen, Tor I Gloppen, Torstein Dalen, H&#x000e5;vard Moen, Marius A Dahl, Guro Gr&#x000f8;the, Egil Johansen, Katrine A Krog, &#x000d8;yvind Skattebo and Eirin N Rise for being responsible for and helping out on different aspects of the human strength and endurance intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
