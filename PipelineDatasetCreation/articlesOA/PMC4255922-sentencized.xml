</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The cblC defect (ORPHA 79282; MIM 277400) is an inborn error of intracellular cobalamin (cbl) metabolism caused by mutations in the MMACHC gene, which is located on chromosome 1p34.1 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Due to the defective MMACHC gene product, methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin cannot be synthesized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since methylcobalamin is the essential cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase, the defect causes an impairment of the remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine (Met). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Adenosylcobalamin is cofactor for the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a critical enzyme in the degradation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Biochemical markers for the disease are elevated total Hcy (tHcy) in plasma and MMA in plasma and urine in the presence of low plasma Met concentrations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Approximately 90% of reported patients with the cblC defect present with the severe, infantile, early-onset form of the disease [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Characteristic clinical manifestations of the infantile onset cblC defect are feeding difficulties and failure to thrive, developmental delay, microcephaly, seizures and muscular hypotonia, decreased visual acuity due to pigmentary retinopathy and nystagmus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of the late-onset cblC defect is probably higher than presently reported since in many cases the diagnosis may be missed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The early-onset form of the cblC defect is associated with the frameshift mutation c.271dupA in Europeans, with the c.331C &gt; T nonsense mutation in the French-Canadian, Acadian and Cajun populations, and with the c.609G &gt; A nonsense mutation in the Han Chinese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The c.394C &gt; T nonsense mutation is encountered most frequently in late-onset patients from Portugal, Italy, Arabian and Asian countries, while the c.482G &gt; A missense mutation has been reported in single patients from Europe [5,6] and China [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the c.394C &gt; T mutation might result in a truncated protein with residual function thus explaining its association with late rather than early onset disease. MMACHC mRNA expression studies showed that cell lines harbouring the c.394C &gt; T mutation had significantly higher levels of transcript compared to cells carrying mutations associated with early-onset disease [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In patients who are compound heterozygous for e.g. a missense mutation and c.271dupA, the phenotype seems to be predominantly determined by the “milder” mutation [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In two large series of cblC patients reported in the literature, 26% [3] and 11.4% [4] of the patients – the great majority with disease onset in the first year of life - died. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In survivors, neurological and eye disease progressed despite treatment [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Even in infants diagnosed by newborn screening and treated early in life, neurological and eye disease progresses and long-term neurocognitive outcome is significantly impaired [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the above cited series, onset was classified as late in six out of 60 patients [3], with first symptoms between age four and fourteen and in ten out of 88 patients [4] with onset between &gt; twelve months and 13.5 years respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Other late-onset cases have been presented as case reports or small series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations in late-onset patients are significantly different from the early-onset form and very heterogeneous [4] and thus late-onset disease may be underdiagnosed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The aims of this report are to i) systematically review published data on the clinical spectrum of the late-onset cblC defect; ii) evaluate treatment approaches, biochemical and clinical response and general outcome; iii) illustrate the types of clinical presentation; iv) discuss ways to diagnosis and highlight clinical signs which should prompt the consideration of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) beyond infancy. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes the clinical spectrum of the late-onset cblC defect and adds three new cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The review of thirty-nine reported cases with disease onset &gt;12 months identifies age-associated patterns and reveals that late-onset cblC disease cannot be considered a homogeneous clinical entity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>A distinct group of young children present with a rather uniform disease with HUS and PAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The course in these children has mostly been rapidly progressive and outcome was deleterious in four out of six children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>HUS was the most frequent symptom in children under six years. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>From school age and through adolescence the pattern of the disease changes and becomes dominated by psychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline and ataxia with HUS, neuropathy/myelopathy, macrocephaly and seizures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In adults, thrombosis, neuropathy, myelopathy and dementia are the most prominent features accompanied by glomerular pathologies other than HUS and psychiatric symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Macrocytosis or macrocytic anaemia are not consistently reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>At all ages, the disorder may present with acute or insidious onset, and show sudden deterioration as well as long stable phases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic mechanisms behind this severe multisystemic disease have not completely been elucidated at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However it has been shown that demyelination in the cblC defect (and most probable also in acquired vitamin B12 deficiency) seems associated with low levels of S-adenosylmethionine resulting from the impaired remethylation of Hcy to Met [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Met deficiency may also be involved in the impairment of cognitive development by hampering methyl group transfers essential for the synthesis of creatine [35], regulation of gene expression, nucleotide metabolism and many other metabolic pathways [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Acute encephalopathic features and long-term neurotoxicity have also been attributed to high MMA levels in the brain especially since the hypothesis of extensively high concentrations of dicarboxylic acids in the brain due to a “trapping” mechanism has been developed [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>MMA is also known to be involved in chronic renal failure [38] by altering and impairing mitochondrial energy metabolism [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Vascular disease and thrombosis have initially been attributed to isolated elevation of tHcy concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>However, with the observation of HUS as specific clinical pattern of the cblC defect -which has not been observed in classical homocystinuria, a disease causing high levels of tHcy and Met- it has been suggested that the specific involvement of small vessels causing HUS may result from combined high tHcy and low Met concentrations [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It is also of note that the characteristic eye disease frequently encountered in the early-onset cblC defect with retinopathy and loss of visual acuity differs significantly from the eye involvement in classical homocystinuria and may therefore not be explained by isolated high tHcy concentrations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Due to the wide age distribution at disease onset (1.3-44 years; mean: 15; median 12 years) and the variable clinical phenotypes paediatricians, as well as adult physicians (e.g. neurologists, nephrologists, psychiatrists, immunologists, haematologists and haemostaseologists) are involved in the clinical and diagnostic workup of late-onset cblC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Like in other rare IEM, time between onset of disease and diagnosis in most cases is extremely long and a subgroup of reported patients even died without diagnosis [13,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Since paediatricians have historically covered the field of IEM, adult physicians sometimes are not too familiar with IEM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>However, the late-onset cblC defect presents with many of the classical “textbook pictures” for IEM such as unclear alterations of consciousness and general status, unexplained progressive or intermittent neurological disease, unexplained thromboembolism, weight loss and loss of appetite, or a systemic disease involving more than one organ system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Additionally, history often reveals siblings or other family members having suffered or even died from a similar or “unknown” systemic disease, pointing towards the genetic origin of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Reduction of the diagnostic delay by raising awareness for IEM and lowering the threshold for metabolic investigations would be of significant benefit for the patients, because in contrast to the majority of early-onset cblC patients, most late-onset patients respond to treatment with significant improvement not only of biochemical parameters but also of clinical manifestations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Earlier initiation of treatment could potentially ameliorate the frequently reported neurological sequelae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the establishment of adult metabolic clinics and/or close cooperation of metabolic specialists with general paediatricians and adult physicians are a medical need. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In a large series of 88 patients with the cblC defect (including 10 late-onset patients), a male to female ratio of 1.93 was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Since the late-onset group in this series encompassed five females and five males, the uneven distribution is determined by the early-onset subgroup [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In the reports summarized here, the male to female ratio of 0.7 indicates that in contrast to the early-onset form, the late-onset form of the cblC defect is more frequently reported in females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, both the series reported by Fischer et al. and the present sample carry high risk of selection and reporting/publication bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Therefore the observed gender differences need to be confirmed by samples generated e.g. from the recently installed European network and registry for homocystinurias and methylation defects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ehod-registry.org/)">https://www.ehod-registry.org/)</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is no evidence that females in general might have a milder disease course. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Reports on two pairs of brothers [10,28] and one pair of sisters [20] clearly demonstrate a significant variation of clinical symptoms between siblings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Furthermore Boxer et al. report the case of a 42 year-old male with late-onset cognitive impairment and his sister who had died from severe, early-onset, progressive neurological disease at age seventeen [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The three new exemplary cases illustrate the spectrum of late-onset cblC disease in the adolescent/adult; underline the long delay from first symptoms to diagnosis, and demonstrate both the impressive response to treatment and the sequelae associated with delayed diagnosis in this disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that diagnosis by NBS and initiation of early treatment might result in complete prevention of disease symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>However, since experience with NBS for cblC [8] is very limited, this question requires future research efforts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Acute and chronic psychiatric symptoms either isolated or accompanied by involvement of other organs or on basis of impaired neurodevelopment have been described in a large number of IEM in adolescents and adults [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Since awareness for rare IEM presenting beyond infancy is still limited also in psychiatric specialists, many patients remain undiagnosed and without specific treatment for years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Generally, indicators for metabolic workup in patients with psychiatric symptoms are fluctuation of symptoms and especially aggravation of disease during catabolism, association with systemic and/or neurological disease and abnormalities (e.g. white matter alterations) revealed by imaging studies of the central nervous system [22,39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In patients with predominantly neurological manifestations such as myelopathy and neuropathy, clinicians often feel reminded of diseases associated with e.g. alimentary vitamin B12 deficiency, especially when macrocytosis or macrocytic anaemia accompany neurological disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, as soon as normal cobalamin concentrations in blood are measured, the hypothesis is often dismissed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>To avoid this pitfall, the measurement of MMA in urine or in case of impaired renal function also in plasma, completed by measurement of tHcy in blood must be highlighted as the most precise method to detect any functionally relevant “vitamin B12- associated problem” [40,41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>For several years, extensive tHcy measurement had been recommended on basis of an assumed association of mildly elevated tHcy concentrations with major common diseases such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, thrombosis and stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Recently, tHcy assessment has been disregarded in many settings due to the failure of large epidemiological studies to prove these associations for the general population [42-44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Consecutively, even in young, otherwise healthy adults with thrombosis, or in early onset dementia, it might well be that tHcy is not assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It must be kept in mind that this approach will lead to a significant number of patients, encompassing not only cblC patients but also individuals with other IEM causing hyperhomocysteinemia (e.g. classical homocystinuria) being missed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>One positive exception in this regard is the recent guideline for the workup in patients with atypical HUS, which addresses intracellular disorders of cobalamin metabolism as a differential diagnosis [45]. </plain></SENT>
