Several new actinoporin isoforms with molecular weights of 18995.5 to 19398.7
Da exhibiting a high hemolytic activity were isolated from the tropical sea
anemone <italic>Heteractis crispa </italic>using a combination of liquid
chromatography techniques. The actinoporins were demonstrated to occur as
mono-, di-, and trimers in aqueous solutions. The sequences of the genes
encoding actinoporins were identified, and the amino acid sequences of the new
polypeptides belonging to the Hct-A actinoporin family were obtained. The new
acinoporins differ in their isoelectric points, the number and localization of
charged amino acid residues at the functionally important N-terminal fragment
of the molecule, as well as in the charge of a tetrapeptide (amino acid
residues 74&#x02013;77) involved in an electrostatic interaction with the
cytoplasmic membrane. A recombinant actinoporin, rHct-A2, with a molecular
weight of 19141 Da, pI of 9.64, and hemolytic activity of 4.0 &#x000d7; 104 HU/mg,
was obtained. The conductivity of the ion channels formed by rHct-A2 in the BLM
was demonstrated to be similar to that of the native actinoporin from
<italic>H. crispa</italic>. The obtained data expand knowledge on the
structural and functional relationships of actinoporins and contribute to our
understanding of the functioning mechanism of these molecules, which is the
basis for the development of compounds with a high biomedical potential.
Currently, they are considered as models for obtaining antitumor,
antibacterial, and cardiac-stimulating agents.

The reason for the close attention paid by researchers to sea anemones, marine
coelenterates, is their toxins that are complex mixtures of biologically active
compounds of a protein nature. Neurotoxins (modulators of Nav, ASICs and Kv ion
channels), proteinase inhibitors differing in their structure and mechanism of
action, and actinoporins belonging to the &#x003b1;-pore-forming toxin
(&#x003b1;-PFT) family are of great interest for future use as pharmacological
agents [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Actinoporins have a unique spatial structure that allows
them to exist both in the water-soluble and in membrane-bound states and
determines their ability to bind to sphingomyelin- containing membranes and to
form ion channels or pores in them [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A
wide range of pharmacological activities exhibited by these polypeptides, such
as anti- tumor, anti-parasitic, dermatonecrotic, and cardiac stimulatory [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]
activities is associated with the pore formation. It was found that EqtII
actinoporin from <italic>Actinia equina </italic>at a concentration of
0.1&#x02013;1 nM has a cardiotoxic effect, but at higher concentrations it
stimulates platelet aggregation [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].
Tenebrosins (actinoporins from <italic>A. tenebrosa</italic>) at low
concentrations (~ 10-9 M) were demonstrated to also act as cardiac stimulants
[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EqtII and Bc2 actinoporins from
<italic>Bunodosoma caissarum </italic>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were found to be effective anticancer agents affecting
fibrosarcoma and glioblastoma [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
Recently, using HeLa, THP-1, MDA-MB-231, and SNU-C4 cells, we demonstrated that
RTX-A actinoporin from <italic>Heteractis crispa</italic>, at nontoxic
concentrations, exhibits antitumor effect and suppresses the
epidermal-growth-factor-induced tumor transformation of JB6P+Cl41 mouse
epithelial cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This effect was
found to be due to the induction of p53-independent apoptosis and inhibition of
the activity of the oncogenic nuclear factors AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B.
</p><p>
In recent years, &#x003b1;-pore-forming toxins from sea anemones have been used to
develop pharmaceutical drugs on the basis of immunoconjugates of actinoporins
with ligands, such as monoclonal antibodies, hormones, or growth factors, whose
action is directed at the cytoplasmic membranes of tumor and/or parasitic cells
[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this regard, investigation of the
molecular basis of the actinoporin pharmacological effects seems to be of
interest.
</p><p>
This work continues the structural and functional studies of actinoporins. It
describes the isolation of actinoporins from the <italic>H. crispa </italic>sea
anemone, identification of the sequences of the genes encoding them, production
of recombinant analogues, and investigation of some aspects of the mechanism
for interaction of actinoporins with biological targets.
</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><p>
Reagents from the following companies were used in the study: Reanal, Hungary;
Whatman, UK; ICN Biochemicals, Sigma, Invitrogen, and Thermo Scientific, USA;
Fermentas, Lithuania; Merk, Germany; Kriohrom, SibEnzyme, Helicon, and Evrogen,
Russia.
</p><p>
<bold>Biological material</bold>
</p><p>
<italic>H. crispa </italic>sea anemones were collected in the intertidal zone
of the South China Sea during a scientific expedition on the Akademik Oparin
research vessel in 2007. The species of the sea anemone were identified by E.E.
Kostina (Institute of Marine Biology, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy
of Sciences, Vladivostok, Russia). The sea anemone samples were frozen and
stored at &#x02013;20 &#x000b0;C.
</p><p>
<bold>Isolation and purification of polypeptides</bold>
</p><p>
Preparation of an aqueous extract and precipitation of the total fractions of
water-soluble proteins with acetone (63%) were performed as described
previously [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All manipulations were
performed at 4 &#x000b0;C.
</p><p>
Ion exchange chromatography of the polypeptides was performed on a CM-32
cellulose column (2.6 &#x000d7; 50 cm) equilibrated with a 0.01-M ammonium acetate
buffer, pH 6.0, with a linear concentration gradient of NaCl (0&#x02013;0.5 M,
total volume of 2 L) in the working buffer. The elution rate was 20 mL/h; the
fraction volume was 5 mL.
</p><p>
Gel filtration of the polypeptides was conducted on a Superdex Peptide 10/30
column equilibrated with a 0.1-M ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, using FPLC
(AKTA System Pharmacia, Sweden). Elution was performed at a rate of 3 mL/min.
The fraction volume was 1.5 mL.
</p><p>
HPLC of the polypeptides was performed on a Nucleosil C18 reversed phase column
(4.6 &#x000d7; 250 mm) equilibrated with 10% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid using an Agilent 1100 chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, USA). Elution
was performed with a concentration gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 90% in
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at pH 2.2 for 60 min. The elution rate was 0.5
mL/min. A Concentrator 5301 vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany) was used
for the evaporation of acetonitrile.
</p><p>
The protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; bovine serum albumin was used as a
standard.
</p><p>
<bold>Cloning of actinoporin genes</bold>
</p><p>
cDNA was synthesized based on the total mRNA isolated from tentacles of the
<italic>H. crispa </italic>sea anemone [14]. Nucleotide sequences encoding
mature actinoporins were amplified using the gene-specific primers
5&#x02019;-TCGTTACc/aATGATA-3&#x02019; (<italic>hct_sign</italic>) and
5&#x02019;-GATTCTCTATTTGTCTTC-3&#x02019; (<italic>hct_notransl</italic>)
constructed with the Vector NTI 8 software (Invitrogen, USA) based on the
sequences of known actinoporin genes. The primers were synthesized at Evrogen
(Moscow, Russia). PCR was performed on a GeneAmp&#x000ae; PCR System 2700
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) under the following conditions: 94
&#x000b0;C for 5 min; followed by 28 cycles of 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 59 &#x000b0;C for
45 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 45 s; followed by 72 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. PCR fragments
(650 bp) were isolated from agarose gel with a DNA Extraction Kit (Thermo
Scientific, USA) and cloned into pTZ57R/T using a T/A cloning system (Thermo
Scientific, USA). Recombinant plasmids were transformed into DH5
<italic>Escherichia coli </italic>cells. Clones were selected using moderately
blue selection on a LB medium containing X-Gal and IPTG. The presence of a
desired insert in selected clones was determined by colony PCR with standard
primers.
</p><p>
<bold>Determination and analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences</bold>
</p><p>
Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Determination of the nucleotide sequences of inserts was
performed on an ABI3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences were analyzed using the Vector NTI 8 software package (Invitrogen,
USA).
</p><p>
<bold>Expression of actinoporin genes</bold>
</p><p>
To generate an expression construct, an actinoporin encoding a DNA fragment was
amplified using Vent DNA polymerase (SibEnzyme, Russia) and the gene-specific
primers: <italic>hct-a(f)</italic> (5&#x02019;-GGCTTTAGCTGGTACAATTATCGCGGGTGCA-
3&#x02019;) and <italic>hct-a(r) </italic>(5&#x02019;-CCCCAAGCTTAGCGTGAGATCTT AATTT
GCAGTAT-3&#x02019;). To preserve the endopeptidase site and to insert correctly
the gene into the pET-41a(+) vector (Novagen, USA), the 5&#x02019;-end of the
forward primer was added with dGMP, and the reverse primer was introduced with
the restriction site for HindIII, combined with the stop codon, and with four
additional nucleotides for efficient restriction enzyme activity. PCR was
conducted under the following conditions: 94 &#x000b0;C for 5 min; then 30 cycles
of 94 &#x000b0;C for 30 s, 65 &#x000b0;C for 45 s, and 72 &#x000b0;C for 45 s; followed
by 72 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. pTZ57R/T with the <italic>hct-a2 </italic>gene insert
was used as the template. The PCR fragment was treated with the HindIII
restriction enzyme and cloned into the pET-41a(+) vector at the PshAI and
HindIII restriction sites. Recombinant plasmids were isolated and sequenced.
Plasmids with the correct insert were used to transform Rosetta (DE3)
<italic>E. coli </italic>cells by electroporation on a Multiporator device
(Eppendorf, Germany). The transformed cells were cultured in a 2xYT medium
containing antibiotics kanamycin (50 &#x003bc;g/mL) and chloramphenicol (34
&#x003bc;g/mL) overnight, after which the culture was grown in a volume of 100 mL
until a absorbance A<sub>600</sub> = 0.5&#x02013;0.6. To induce expression, IPTG
was added (Fermentas, Lithuania) to the final concentration of 0.1 mM and the
cells were further grown at 30 0C for 3 h to obtain a fusion protein in soluble
form. The cells were then centrifuged (8000 rpm) and washed with a 1&#x000d7; PBS
buffer.
</p><p>
<bold>Isolation of recombinant actinoporin</bold>
</p><p>
Cells containing the fusion protein were re-suspended in 1&#x000d7; PBS (1 : 5 by
volume) and sonicated on a Sonopuls HD 2070 device (Bandelin Electronic,
Germany) to destroy the cell membrane. After centrifugation (10000 rpm), the
cell lysate was loaded onto a Ni<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>-CAM agarose, incubated
for 10 min (4 0C) with constant stirring for the binding of the fusion protein
to the carrier. To remove cell lysate proteins, Ni<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>-CAM
agarose with the fusion protein was washed with a buffer solution (50 mM
NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and then
with an enteropeptidase reaction buffer solution (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 2
mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0). The fusion protein was added with enteropeptidase
(New England BioLabs, UK) in the amount of 1 enzyme unit per 20 &#x003bc;g of the
fusion protein, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature with constant
stirring overnight. After sedimentation of Ni<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>-CAM
agarose by centrifugation at 3000 rpm, the recombinant actinoporin containing
the fraction was collected and incubated with STI agarose to remove
enteropeptidase.
</p><p>
<bold>Electrophoretic analysis </bold>
</p><p>
Electrophoresis was performed according to the Laemmli method [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in vertical plates (9 &#x000d7; 12 &#x000d7; 1
mm) in a 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS). Molecular weights were estimated using a PageRuler&#x02122; Unstained
protein ladder (a set protein markers, 10&#x02013;200 kDa, (Fermentas,
Lithuania)).
</p><p>
<bold>Mass spectrometric analysis</bold>
</p><p>
The molecular weights of the polypeptides were determined on an Ultraflex III
TOF/TOF (time of flight) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Time of
flight mass spectra was recorded in the linear and reflector modes.
</p><p>
<bold>Hemolytic activity</bold>
</p><p>
The hemolytic activity was detected in mouse erythrocytes in a medium
containing 0.9% NaCl. The hemoglobin level in the supernatant was measured
spectrophotometrically at 540 nm after preliminary rapid cooling of the
reaction mixture and its centrifugation to precipitate erythrocytes and their
shadows. The amount of protein causing 50% hemolysis of red blood cells in 1 mL
of 0.7% suspension at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min was taken as one hemolytic unit
(HU).
</p><p>
The results processed according to the variation statistics rules using the MS
Office Excel 2007 software package are presented as the mean values of six
independent experiments &#x000b1; standard deviation. The statistical significance
of the differences among the indicators was assessed by the ANOVA one parameter
test.
</p><p>
<bold>Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence</bold>
</p><p>
The amino acid sequence of the recombinant actinoporin N-terminal fragment was
determined on a Procise 492 cLC automatic solid-phase protein sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s program using a
protein sample on the PVDF membrane. The recombinant protein was transferred
from a polyacrylamide gel to a 0.45 &#x003bc;m PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA) in a
buffer solution containing 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol, 0.1% SDS,
pH 8.3, at 26 V and 60 mA, overnight, using a Mini Trans-Blot&#x000ae; camera
(Bio-Rad, USA). The membrane was stained with 0.04% Coomassie Brilliant Blue
G-250 in 10% (by volume) glacial acetic acid and then washed free of dye with
50% (by volume) methanol and dried in a thermostat at 37 &#x000b0;C.
</p><p>
<bold>Preparation of bilayer lipid membranes</bold>
</p><p>
Bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) were formed on the 0.25 mm aperture of a Teflon
cup by the Muller method [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] using a 1%
solution of monoolein in n-heptane containing predetermined concentrations of
sphingomyelin. Aqueous phase: 0.1 M or 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5.
Actinoporins RTX-A (5 ng/mL) and Hct-A2 (50 ng/mL) were added to the aqueous
phase until the BLM formation.
</p><p>
<bold>Measurement of BLM electrical characteristics</bold>
</p><p>
The current through the BLM was measured by a VK2-16 high resistance
voltmeter-electrometer in the membrane voltage clamp mode using silver/silver
chloride electrodes (asymmetry potential of 2.3 mV). Current recording at the
amplifier output was performed by means of a KPS-4 potentiometer.
</p><p>
<bold>Homology modeling of actinoporins</bold>
</p><p>
Actinoporins spatial structure models were generated by homology modeling using
the SWISS-MODEL web server [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and
Swiss-PdbViewer software [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The
spatial structure of StnII sticholysin (PDB ID 1GWY)
[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]
from the <italic>Stichodactyla helianthus </italic>sea
anemone, received from the Protein Data Bank, was used as a prototype in
constructing the model [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Evaluation
of the electrostatic properties of the molecular surface in the Amber ff12
force field and visualization of the structures were performed using the MOE
software [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>
According to published data, native actinoporins are usually isolated from the
aqueous extracts of whole animals and their further purification is carried out
by a combination of various methods of liquid chromatography
[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
In this study, to isolate individual actinoporins, their
precipitation from an aqueous extract of the <italic>H. crispa
</italic>(<italic>=Radianthus macrodactylus</italic>) sea anemone with acetone
and separation of the components of the total protein sample by cation exchange
chromatography, FPLC gel filtration, and RP-HPLC were used.
</p><p>
<italic>Figure 1A </italic>presents the elution profile of the total protein
sample obtained by chromatography on CM- 32 cellulose. The polypeptides of
fraction 2 had a high hemolytic activity, and those of the fractions 1 and 3
had a lower activity. The fraction 2 polypeptides were rechromatographed under
the same conditions. Subsequent purification of actinoporins was performed by
gel filtration (<italic>Fig. 1B</italic>). In result the hemolitic active
fractions containing 50 to 500 &#x003bc;g of the protein were obtained. According
to the electrophoretic analysis, these fractions contained polypeptides with a
molecular weight of about 19&#x02013;20 kDa. The polypeptides of fractions
1&#x02013;3 were subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a Nucleosil C18 column
(<italic>Figs. 1C&#x02013;E</italic>, respectively). Based on this, both
fractions of the homogeneous polypeptides (<italic>Fig. 1D</italic>) and
fractions containing several polypeptides (<italic>Figs. 1C, E</italic>) with a
molecular weight of 18995.5 to 19398.7 Da, according to the mass spectrometric
analysis, were obtained. Obviously, actinoporins in the combined fractions are
presented as multiple isoforms with very similar physicochemical properties,
which is likely the reason for the peak broadening during chromatographic
separation of polypeptides.

Previously, from <italic>H. crispa</italic>, we isolated and characterized
actinoporins RTX-A, RTX-S, and RTX-SII as well as identified the sequences of
the genes and deduced amino acid sequences for 18 actinoporins of the Hct-S
family that contain the N-terminal serine residue
[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
The experimental values of the molecular weights of the
isolated actinoporins range from 18995.5 to 19398.7 and are consistent with the
calculated values for the Hct-S family (from 19338 to 19518 Da) that indicates
the existence of many actinoporin isoforms not only at the genomic or
transcriptomic, but also at the translational levels. The presence of lower
intensity signals in the regions of 38543 and 57950 m/z in the mass spectra
demonstrates that actinoporins exist in aqueous solutions likewise in the form
of dimers and/or trimers, respectively, which is consistent with the
experimental data obtained previously for StnII from <italic>S. helianthus
</italic>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
</p><p>
It should be noted that the absence of the first two N-terminal amino acid
residues is a distinctive feature of the primary structure of RTX-A actinoporin
isolated from <italic>H. crispa </italic>(19273 Da)
[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to the calculated molecular
weights of actinoporins of the Hct-S family (from 19338 to 19518 Da) and the values
determined for actinoporins by MALDI TOF mass spectrometry (18995.5 to 19398.7
Da), the existence of another family of actinoporins with smaller molecular
weights and, probably, with an alanine residue at the N-terminus of the
molecule, may be assumed.
</p><p>
<bold>Cloning of actinoporin genes</bold>
</p><p>
To determine the sequences of the genes encoding mature actinoporins of the
<italic>H. crispa </italic>sea anemone, the forward (<italic>hct_sign</italic>)
and reverse (<italic>hct_notransl</italic>) primers were constructed. The
<italic>hct_sign </italic>primer was constructed on the basis of the signal
sequence analysis of known actinoporins, and the gene-specific reverse<italic>
hct_notransl </italic>primer was constructed on the basis of previously
obtained information on the 3&#x02019;-untranslated region of <italic>rtx-a
</italic>and <italic>rtx-sii </italic>from <italic>H.
crispa </italic>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
</p><p>
With the use of PCR, cloning, sequencing, and analysis of PCR fragments, 17
sequences of the actinoporin genes were obtained, five of which encoded
actinoporins of the new Hct-A family (Hct-A2&#x02013;Hct-A6), and 12 were
actinoporins of the Hct-S family established by us previously (<italic>Fig.
2</italic>) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The identity of the
nucleotide sequences ranged from 93 to 99%, and that of amino the acid

The calculated molecular weights of the actinoporins of the Hct-A and Hct-S
families ranged from 19158 to 19518 Da, which corresponds to the native

All members of the Hct-A and Hct-S
families are highly basic polypeptides; the calculated values of their
isoelectric points are in the range of 9.10&#x02013;9.74, which is typical of
actinoporins from <italic>H. crispa, </italic>as well as of the majority of
well-known members of actinoporins from other species of sea anemones.
</p><p>
According to the obtained data, a number of actinoporin isoforms encoded by
multigene families are synthesized in the tentacle tissue of <italic>H. srispa

Actinoporins
differ by single amino acid substitutions (<italic>Fig. 2</italic>), most of
which are located in the functionally important amphiphilic N-terminal fragment
of the molecule (1&#x02013;27 aa) that is involved in the pore formation and is
associated with the &#x003b2;-core by the highly charged S/KRK30 loop [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All actinoporins are characterized
by a high conservation of amino acid residues within the aromatic
phosphorylcholine (POC) membrane binding site (104&#x02013;137 aa) as well as the
Lys77 residue localized in the loop connecting the &#x003b2;5- and &#x003b2;6-strands
(76&#x02013;79 aa). This residue, as demonstrated for EqtII, is involved in the
monomers oligomerization [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

<bold><italic>In silico </italic>analysis of charged amino acid residues in the
area of interaction of actinoporins with the membrane</bold>
</p><p>
To date, it has been established that the molecular mechanism of pore formation
is based on the electrostatic attraction between a positively charged
actinoporin molecule and the oppositely charged cytoplasmic membrane and on the
specific interaction between the POC binding site and the phosphorylcholine
head of sphingomyelin [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Subsequent conformational
rearrangement of the N-terminal fragment of the molecule leads first to its
transition to the water-lipid interface and then to its inclusion into the
membrane hydrophobic core. The process is accompanied by oligomerization of
three, or four, or nine monomer molecules [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
</p><p>
To determine the localization of the functionally important sites of
actinoporins of the Hct-A family (Hct-A2&#x02013;Hct-A6), models of their spatial
structures were built. The crystal structure of StnII (PDB, 1gwyA) with the
highest resolution of 1.71 A (sequence identity ranging from 90.29 to 99.43%)
was used as a prototype. The resulting 3D actinoporin structure models contain
12 &#x003b2;-strands, which form the &#x003b2;-core, and two &#x003b1;-helices located
at the N- and C-termini of the molecule. The antiparallel &#x003b2;-strands are
connected to each other and to the &#x003b1;-helices by different-length loops
(<italic>Fig. 3</italic>), which are included into the membrane interface
during the pore formation [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The RMSD
value for 175 C&#x003b1; atoms of the model relative to the prototype was 0.27 A.

In this study, an analysis of variations in charged residues in the area of
interaction of the actinoporins with the membrane was performed. Mapping the
molecular surface of these molecules with the changes in their electrostatic
properties demonstrated that despite high conservation of the location of
charged residues in the structure of the actinoporins, the 74&#x02013;83 loop
connecting the &#x003b2;5- and &#x003b2;6-strands contains a variable region
(<italic>Figs. 2 </italic>and <italic>3</italic>). According to cryoelectron
microscopy, this loop is localized, like the POC binding site, on the surface
of the contacts between the actinoporins and the lipid interface and plays an
important role both in the recognition and in interaction with the membrane
[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Substitution of the neutral Thr
residue with the positively charged Arg residue at position 77 and the
negatively charged Asp with Asn at position 76 in three members of the
Hct-A4&#x02013;Hct-A6 family was demonstrated to increase significantly the
positive charge density in this region (<italic>Fig. 3</italic>). In our
opinion, this should lead to a strong electrostatic interaction of both this
loop and the adjacent, highly charged, &#x0201c;pseudorigid&#x0201d; SRK loop
(28&#x02013;30 aa) with the membrane surface. Obviously, these are electrostatic
interactions that facilitate, in turn, the conformational reorganization of the
N-terminal fragment and its subsequent dislocation and integration into the
membrane.

<bold>Obtaining of recombinant actinoporin and study of its properties</bold>
</p><p>
A large number of actinoporin isoforms in a single producer species creates
certain difficulties in producing homogeneous polypeptides in an amount
sufficient in order to conduct structural and functional studies. In order to
obtain individual actinoporins, conditions for the expression of their genes in
a bacterial system were selected and a scheme of their isolation in the
recombinant form was developed.

To generate a construct expressing the actinoporin gene, the pET system was
chosen; in particular, the pET-41a(+) plasmid vector designed for <italic>E.
coli </italic>expression of target proteins fused with a carrier protein,
glutathione S-transferase (GST). Based on the sequences of genes encoding
mature actinoporins of the Hct-A family, the gene-specific primers
<italic>hct-a(f) </italic>and <italic>hct-a(r)</italic> flanking the
<italic>hct-a2 </italic>gene at the 5&#x02019;- and 3&#x02019;-termini,
respectively, were constructed. The recombinant pTZ57R plasmid containing the
<italic>hct-a2 </italic>gene was used as a template for PCR. A 550 bp fragment
was obtained using PCR that was inserted into the plasmid at the PshAI and
HindIII sites. Recombinant plasmids with the desired insert were used to
transform the Rosetta (DE3)<italic> E. coli </italic>strain. The recombinant
actinoporin was obtained as a GST-fused protein with a polyhistidine tag
(GST&#x02013;His6&#x02013;rHct-A2). According to the electrophoretic analysis, the
molecular weight of the fusion protein was slightly above 50 kDa (<italic>Fig.
4</italic>), which is consistent with the calculated data (~52 kDa).
GST&#x02013;His6&#x02013;rHct-A2 was also detected in the culture medium, but in
smaller quantities. IPTG concentration of 0.1&#x02013;1.0 mM had practically no
effect on the recombinant protein yield. The recombinant rHct-A2 actinoporin
with a molecular weight of approximately 20 kDa was isolated from the cell
lysate by affinity chromatography under native conditions (<italic>Fig.
4</italic>). The actinoporin yield was 4 mg/L, on average. The N-terminal amino
acid sequence (15 aa) was determined by sequencing that fully corresponded to
that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The calculated molecular weight of
rHct-A2 was 19141 Da, and the isoelectric point was 9.64. The hemolytic
activity of rHct-A2 was 4.0 &#x000d7; 104 HU/mg, which is comparable to that of
actinoporins both from <italic>H. crispa </italic>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and from other species of sea anemones

Based on the analysis of the recombinant actinoporin channel activity on the
monoolein : sphingomyelin (1 : 3) BLM, it was found that rHct-A2 at a
concentration of 50 ng/mL causes discrete current fluctuations in the membrane,
which indicates the formation of conductive structures in the membrane &#x02013;
ion channels (<italic>Fig. 5A</italic>). The most probable conductivity value
of the rHct- A2-induced channels in 0.1 M NaCl at pH 7.5 was 180 &#x000b1; 30 pS,
which corresponds to the conductivity of the channels formed by native RTX-A
(<italic>Fig. 5B</italic>).
</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>
According to pharmacological studies of actinoporins, their biological activity
is determined by a nonspecific effect that leads to an increase in the membrane
permeability, which can stimulate a variety of toxic effects in cells. In fact,
an increase in the actinoporin-induced cell permeability leads to profound
changes in the morphology of the cell and its organelles, cell fragmentation
[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], as well as to an increase in cell
size and to cell death [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Structural and functional studies of
actinoporins, as well as many other toxins, are ultimately aimed at determining
their pharmacological activity and therapeutic potential. Currently,
&#x003b1;-PFTs of sea anemones are considered as models for the designing of
anticancer, antibacterial, and cardiac-stimulating agents [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These natural, unique compounds may find successful
application as pharmaceuticals (or the basis for developing drugs) in a
combined therapy of cancer diseases and/or various cardiac and cytological
pathologies.
