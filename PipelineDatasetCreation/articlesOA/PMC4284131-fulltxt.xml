We present a family with a previously reported deletion (c.5186_5188delAGA, p.K1729del).

The proband, III.15, is a 52-year-old male who first noted difficulty running as a teenager. This progressed in his early twenties, at which point he could not rise from a squat. In his early thirties he noticed atrophy of his quadriceps, and in his late forties he required a cane to ambulate. He came to our attention at the age of 51 years. On neurological examination, he showed weakness in his arms on wrist flexion and extension as well as finger flexion and extension, while in the lower extremities he exhibited hip flexion, knee extension, and severe ankle dorsiflexion and large toe extensor weakness. He had atrophy of the quadriceps and anterior compartment of the leg. His quadriceps atrophy and wrist and finger flexion weakness were reminiscent of sporadic IBM (sIBM). Muscle MRI of the lower extremities showed asymmetric atrophy and fatty replacement of the vastus intermedius and vastus medialis (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>B). This type of asymmetry is typical of sIBM.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Particularly worrisome to the patient was that his rate of worsening had significantly increased over the past several years, and he had new onset of hand weakness over the past few years. Interestingly, his family tree (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>A) suggested that other family members might also be affected with muscle disease.</p><p>To further characterize the phenotype in this family, additional family members underwent neurological examination at our institution (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C) (summarized in Table<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref>). Subject III.9 is a 62-year-old man who first developed difficulty walking at the age of 10 years. He was able to play baseball in high school but was not a fast runner. He noted in his early thirties that his gait was stable when wearing boots that provided ankle support. Exam showed wrist drop and finger extension weakness (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>C). He had a left gastrocnemius muscle biopsy, for which we only have a report, which notes that there was a small number of necrotic but no regenerating fibers. There was no inflammation and no vacuoles.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical features</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">III.7</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">III.9</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">III.13</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">III.15<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">*</xref></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IV.15</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age at examination</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">51</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age of onset of symptoms</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Early teens</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Early teens</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Late thirties</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mid teens</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">None yet</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flat smile</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Yes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;Hanging Big Toe&#x0201d;

In the index patient, we have demonstrated T-cell predominant inflammatory infiltrates surrounding and invading nonnecrotic fibers and increased MHC-I staining. We have also observed red-rimmed vacuoles and positive staining for TDP-43, p62, and phospho-Tau (SMI-31)-positive protein aggregates. A recent study by Brady et al. found that in biopsies in which vacuoles were present, the combination of a specific pattern of p62 staining, and increased MHC-I staining yielded a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% for IBM, demonstrating the utility of this particular stain as a diagnostic marker.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This case, though, demonstrates that some inherited myopathies may also yield similar findings on muscle biopsy and emphasizes the importance of the clinical exam.</p><p>Genetic testing provided the definitive diagnosis, confirming the pathogenic mutation in <italic>MYH7</italic>. The mixed clinical presentation as well as the pathology findings raises the remote possibility that the index case suffers from both Laing distal myopathy and sporadic IBM. The co-occurrence of an inflammatory myopathy with an inherited myopathy has been previously reported<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and we have seen other sporadic IBM patients with inherited neuromuscular diseases, including FSHD (pers. comm.). In order to determine whether our patient had IBM in additional to Laing distal myopathy, further investigations to identify protein aggregates labeled for SMI 31 and p62 in this and other distal myopathies with rimmed vacuoles would be helpful. These issues notwithstanding, this case report highlights the need to consider genetic muscle disease in patients with an atypical IBM history and phenotype (in our case, positive family history, weakness onset before the age of 45, and wrist/finger extensor weakness greater than flexor weakness) even in the context of classic IBM pathology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Elizabeth
