</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Building design can have a substantial effect on occupant health and energy use through ventilation strategy, yet we are just beginning to understand the potential microbial community dynamics affected by building design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the interrelationships between occupancy, ventilation strategy, and airborne microbial community composition through time in university classrooms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Commercial spaces are often operated so as to be unventilated overnight and on weekends (unoccupied times) in the name of energy efficiency, and this study is the first to identify the remnant microbial signature of under-ventilated classrooms overnight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Passive overnight ventilation, mimicked by the night-flushed treatment in this study, is an energy-efficient way to simultaneously cool building mass and avoid overnight and weekend microbial community stagnancy. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microorganisms are ubiquitous in the built environment; not only do they cover virtually all surfaces we contact, they also cover our skin and are abundant in the air we breathe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More than 106 bacterial cells per m3 are present in both outdoor and indoor air (Kembel et al., 2012), but our understanding of the factors that drive the composition of these assemblages in the built environment is nascent (Hospodsky et al., 2012; Womack et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sources of airborne bacteria in the built environment are not well known but include humans, pets, soils, and plants, both as direct sources and indirectly from dust perturbations (Bowers et al., 2011a,2011b, 2012; Täubel et al., 2009; Womack et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Bacterial communities in outdoor air are highly ephemeral and can change over short periods of time with climatic conditions (Fierer et al., 2008; Rintala et al., 2008; Womack et al., 2010), but the influence of outdoor air variability on indoor air bacterial communities is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Previous research has indicated that human occupancy increases the airborne bacterial load and leaves a distinctly human microbial signal inside of buildings (Hospodsky et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2012), and natural ventilation does influence airborne bacterial community composition in the absence of active human occupants (Kembel et al., 2012), but we currently have little understanding of the relative influences of ventilation and human occupancy on bioaerosols in modern buildings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Nor do we have an understanding of the degree of connectivity between indoor and outdoor airborne microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Architectural ventilation design choices have long been recognized to influence human health and productivity (Fisk, 2000; Mendell and Smith, 1990; Seppänen and Fisk, 2002; Sternberg, 2009; Wargocki et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the United States, health and productivity losses attributable to commercial ventilation systems have been estimated in the tens of billions of dollars (Fisk, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Building ventilation in the United States was estimated to consume approximately 1.75 exajoule (4.1% of total US buildings' energy use) in 2010, and that number increases by an order of magnitude when heating and cooling are included (U.S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Department of Energy, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Our improved understanding of the energy implications of ventilation design choices has impacted modern architectural design (Brown and DeKay, 2001; Li et al., 2007; Sternberg, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous microbiological research into the effects of indoor ventilation choices, however, has largely focused on known allergens and disease-related microorganisms, but little is known about how ventilation design influences microorganisms in a community context. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Whole microbial communities have historically been problematic to study due to their immense diversity and to a propensity in the field of microbiology to focus on easily culturable microbial species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This has changed considerably in recent years given rapid advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies that allow the generation of relatively comprehensive microbial community data from environmental samples (Caporaso et al., 2012; Hamady et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>One of the implications of a community-based perspective is the increased understanding that the vast majority of microorganisms on and around humans are not pathogens, but are rather commensals and even mutualistic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While these methods have been widely applied to relatively high-biomass microbial habitats like soil and aquatic environments, application in indoor air research has been slower, partly owing to ultra-low microbial biomass available for DNA assay from airborne indoor samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Several groups (e.g., Hospodsky et al., 2012; Kembel et al., 2012) have effectively applied 454 pyrosequencing to study indoor air samples using various collection methods, but temporal resolution has consistently been a limiting factor in indoor bioaerosol community surveys. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We conducted an extensive study over a 9 day period in a University of Oregon classroom building to assess the relative influences of natural ventilation and human occupancy on airborne bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Our sampling regime was designed for relatively fine temporal resolution that allowed us to observe microbial community changes throughout each day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We employed barcoded Illumina amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes to capture a comprehensive look at airborne bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="?"><plain>Specifically, we aimed to answer three questions: (i) What is the degree of connectivity between indoor and outdoor airborne bacterial communities? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="?"><plain>(ii) are differing choices in ventilation strategy associated with detectable temporal changes in indoor airborne bacterial community composition? and (iii) is classroom occupant load predictive of indoor airborne bacterial community composition? </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This study illustrates the highly interrelated nature of two major drivers of indoor airborne microbial community composition: human occupancy and ventilation strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Both have previously been implicated individually (Hospodsky et al., 2012; Kembel et al., 2012), but they have not been studied together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Our results show that, while occupancy does increase a human signal in the detectable airborne community, indoor air tends to closely mirror outdoor air in a well-ventilated space regardless of occupancy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Human occupancy in buildings resuspends settled dust, and humans also shed substantial bacterial biomass during normal activity (Hospodsky et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2012), but the present study indicates that this human-associated contribution to the total detectable airborne microbial community is perhaps less important than ventilation strategy and air source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Occupancy in this study was a significant but relatively weak predictor of airborne community composition and was most obvious when considering only human-associated genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This was somewhat diminished by the fact that the three focal human-associated genera in this study never accounted for more than 38% (mean = 7.8%) of observed sequences in occupied rooms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Ventilation source alters microbial communities, regardless of ventilation rates, in a hospital setting (Kembel et al., 2012), but mechanical ventilation in a hospital employs more stringent air filtration than in typical commercial buildings, including university buildings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The building in the present study was designed to utilize unfiltered natural ventilation supplemented by mechanically filtered supply air; this use of unfiltered air was apparent in the close resemblance between outdoor and indoor airborne communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic diversity of indoor and outdoor air was indistinguishable throughout the sampling period and followed a remarkably similar pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Although comparable phylogenetic diversities certainly do not equate to identical communities, 88% of the most common indoor species were also the most common outdoor species, and these tended to fluctuate together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Given this strong coupling between indoor and outdoor airborne microbial communities, it is also likely that seasonal variation in outdoor bioaerosols (Bowers et al., 2012) as well as indoor dust (Rintala et al., 2008) would be reflected in bioaerosols indoors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Localized seasonal weather patterns, however, dictate ventilation strategies, and our results indicate that ventilation strategy influences indoor/outdoor bioaerosol connectivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Ventilated indoor spaces have long been recognized as more beneficial to human health and productivity than relatively stagnant spaces, and this has been variously attributed to comfort, humidity, reduced accumulation of indoor aerosol pollution, and reduced contact with human-associated disease-causing agents (Fisk, 2000; Mendell and Smith, 1990; Seppänen and Fisk, 2002; Sternberg, 2009; Wargocki et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence even points to a link between exposure to outdoor biodiversity and reduced early development of asthma and allergies (Ege et al., 2011; Hanski et al., 2012; Heederik and Von Mutius, 2012; Perzanowski et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Modern design principles often incorporate passive natural ventilation as a means of effecting energy-efficient air turnover, and our results suggest a microbial community corollary from this approach. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Ventilation strategy and human occupancy in a university building were shown to influence indoor airborne bacterial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In this hybrid-ventilated building, indoor air closely mirrored outdoor air in terms of bacterial community composition over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>When rooms were unventilated, vestige outdoor airborne microbial communities were detectable even after communities in adjacent, ventilated rooms changed along with outdoor air. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Well-ventilated spaces are desirable from a health and productivity standpoint, and while human occupancy does result in a human-associated airborne microbial fingerprint, room ventilation can affect microbial community turnover so as to more closely resemble outdoor air. </plain></SENT>
