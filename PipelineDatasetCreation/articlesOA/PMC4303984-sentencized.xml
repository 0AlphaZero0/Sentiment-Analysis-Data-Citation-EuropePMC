</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represent a promising new group of anticancer agents for the treatment of patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These include erlotinib and gefitinib and it has been demonstrated that a group of mutations centered at the ATP-binding pocket of EGFR confer sensitivity to these agents by enhancing the binding of the TKI at the expense of ATP.1–3 The majority of these sensitizing mutations are a group of deletions in exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21, the L858R mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, for nearly all patients who initially respond, resistance develops and the disease progresses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This is often associated with the appearance of the T790M resistance mutation in EGFR.4,5 This mutation causes resistance by increasing the binding affinity of ATP compared with the TKI.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that plasma DNA from patients with cancer contains DNA originating from the tumor.7–10 Comparison of sensitizing EGFR mutations found in biopsies and plasma DNA from the same patients has been performed and demonstrates varying degrees of correlation.11–14 The plasma DNA offers an opportunity to monitor the presence of EGFR mutations during the treatment of patients with lung cancer and to identify the emergence of resistance mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been demonstrated in a few patients with different types of cancer (including a single patient with lung cancer) that the amount of sensitizing mutation as well as the development of the T790M resistance mutation can be identified by sequencing the plasma DNA.15 Detection of resistance mutations in plasma may prove to be of major importance in the clinical setting, because patients may benefit from adjustments in the treatment regimen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we monitored EGFR mutations during treatment with erlotinib in a group of patients with NSCLC, all of whom demonstrated sensitizing EGFR mutations in plasma DNA before the initiation of treatment with erlotinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the T790M resistance mutation was absent from the pretreatment sample but appeared in some but not all patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Among patients with lung cancer, it has been shown that the effect of treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib is highest if the tumor cells have specific mutations in EGFR.1,2,17 In the current study, we examined EGFR mutations in plasma samples collected during erlotinib treatment from 23 patients with lung cancer in whom EGFR mutations were identified in the blood sample taken before the initiation of treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Plasma DNA was isolated from the blood samples and analyzed for 42 different EGFR mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Examination of the serially collected blood samples revealed several interesting findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>One of these was that the amount of the mutated tumor DNA in the first blood sample taken after erlotinib treatment decreased for 22 of the 23 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>This suggests that erlotinib already has an effect at this early stage of treatment in the majority of these patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>All 23 patients with lung cancer with mutated EGFR DNA in the pretreatment blood sample ultimately developed disease progression during treatment with erlotinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the blood samples taken during erlotinib treatment revealed considerable variation but also similarities among the patients, and 3 major groups could be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had a T790M mutation combined with the sensitizing EGFR mutation, 6 patients had the sensitizing mutation in the absence of the T790M mutation, and 8 patients had neither the sensitizing nor T790M mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study demonstrated that the T790M mutation was not present in the blood before treatment with erlotinib in any of the 23 patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations noted in the pretreatment blood sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to studies performed by another group, in which the T790M mutation was found in 35% of tumors with sensitizing EGFR mutations that were EGFR inhibitor-naïve.18 To the best of our knowledge, the reason for this apparent discrepancy is currently unclear, but might be caused by differences in sample material and/or the sensitivity of the assays used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The ability to generate quantitative data for the EGFR-mutated plasma DNA allowed us to demonstrate that the appearance of the T790M mutation during treatment always was associated with an increase in the amount of the original sensitizing mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the T790M mutation continued to increase in all 9 patients until progression of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to those patients who did not develop the T790M mutation, in whom there was no trend toward an increase in the original sensitizing EGFR mutation noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Further research should be performed to identify the relevant mutations in these patients and follow them using blood samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Once the T790M mutation was detected, it was identified in all subsequent blood samples from that patient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the T790M mutation can appear as a secondary mutation in tumor cells already harboring a sensitizing EGFR mutation.5 In the blood samples from those patients with the T790M mutation, the amount of T790M and EGFR-sensitizing mutations increased in parallel for some but not all patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>A likely explanation is that apart from the tumor cells with both sensitizing and T790M EGFR mutations, some of the patients had residual amounts of tumor cells that only possessed the sensitizing mutation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Patients with T790M-mutated tumors have been characterized as a subgroup whose prognosis is relatively favorable with an indolent type of disease progression.19 This is in agreement with the results from the current study among a limited number of patients, in whom we demonstrated that the median time to disease progression more than doubled compared with the patients without T790M mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, when examining the appearance of the T790M mutation in the serial blood samples, we demonstrated that the mutation can be detected in the plasma DNA up to 344 days before disease progression is clinically evident by RECIST criteria (range, 15-344 days before). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The ability to detect T790M might be important for the identification of those patients who are eligible for treatment with emerging new third-generation inhibitors that target T790M-mutated EGFR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study demonstrated that examination of a plasma sample allows for the quantitation of EGFR mutations and that EGFR resistance mutations may be detected well in advance of disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>These findings may have implications for the identification of patients who might benefit from an altered treatment strategy when T790M resistance is already identified in the blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Future studies in a larger patient cohort will indicate whether these patients might benefit from TKIs or other agents that also inhibit the T790M-mutated EGFR. </plain></SENT>
