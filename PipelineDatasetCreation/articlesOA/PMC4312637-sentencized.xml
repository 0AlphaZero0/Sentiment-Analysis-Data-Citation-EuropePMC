<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>α-Amylases are important class of industrial enzyme finding wide scale applications in food, textile, paper, detergent, analytical chemistry, beverage, and pharmaceutical industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Demand for α-amylase is projected to further increase in coming years due to its use in diverse industrial sectors [1–5]. α-Amylases from wide range of sources with distinct characteristics are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Yet search continues for novel α-amylase to increase the realm of processes where it can be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In this context, isolation and screening of extremophilic organisms for α-amylase of desired trait is a contemporary research area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Halophiles, a class of extremophiles growing under saline conditions, offer source of enzymes which not only are salt stable but also can function under conditions of alkaline pH, high temperature, and low water activity [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The use of halophilic α-amylase in bioprocesses presents the advantage to obtain optimal activities at high salt concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Halophilic α-amylases also might be particularly resistant to organic solvents because they work under condition where water activity is low. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Halophilic amylases have been reported from extreme halophiles such as Natronococcus amylolyticus [9]; Haloferax mediterranei [10]; Haloarcula hispanica [11]. Halomonas meridiana [12]; Chromohalobacter sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>TVSP 101 [13]; Nesterenkonia sp. strain F [14] are moderately halophilic bacteria reported to produce halophilic amylase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In general the production level of amylases in halophiles is very low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Conditions have been optimized in case of Halomonas meridiana [12], Halobacillus sp. strain MA-2 [15], and Bacillus sp. strain TSCVKK [16] for enhancing the yield, yet maximum 3.2 U/mL could be attained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Another aspect covered in this study is immobilization of α-amylase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The immobilization of enzymes on solid support offers several advantages over the free enzyme, including easy recovery from the reaction medium, reusability, possibility of operation in continuous reactors, enhanced stability, and catalytic efficiency [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>There have been many reports on immobilization of α-amylase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Some examples involve reactive polymer films [18], magnetic nanoparticles [19], mesoporous silica thin films [20], and adsorption on zirconia [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In recent years, nanostructured materials such as nanoporous media, nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanoparticles have emerged as amazingly effective enzyme support/matrix [22–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>They provide the highest possible surface area for immobilization, enabling very high loading of enzyme on the support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This results in surprisingly high enzyme activities per unit volume [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Amylase producer halophilic bacteria Marinobacter sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>EMB8 was isolated during screening of Indian saline habitats [27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It was used for synthesis of industrially useful maltooligosaccharides [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>With the above viewpoints, production optimization for competitive yields and immobilization for efficient application of α-amylase from Marinobacter sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>EMB8 were attempted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Bacterial growth and enzyme production are greatly influenced by the nutritional factors (carbon and nitrogen sources, metal ions, etc.) and physical factors (pH, temperature, inoculation volume, and incubation time). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A systematic investigation for effect of these factors on α-amylase production by Marinobacter sp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>EMB8 has been undertaken in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We herein also attempted to immobilize the halophilic Marinobacter sp. α-amylase on silica nanoparticles to obtain an active, stable, reusable preparation for effective starch hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>It was immobilized on silica nanoparticles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The choice of silica as a matrix for immobilization was dictated by the fact that they are chemically inert and biocompatible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Also, silica nanoparticles can be easily functionalized [42, 43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The immobilization was carried out by using two different approaches, that is, (i) simple adsorption and (ii) covalent coupling by using glutaraldehyde. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The results are shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The adsorption method was not very effective as only 12% immobilization efficiency was attained and most of the activity came out in washing as unbound enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This was not surprising as α-amylase is loosely bound through weak forces and washing leads to enzyme leaching in the washing fractions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Covalent coupling placed the enzyme firmly on the silica nanoparticles and about 3.5-fold more immobilization efficiency was attained at 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The optimum immobilization efficiency was enhanced by 1.0- to 2.0-fold by glutaraldehyde functionalization in case of cholesterol oxidase immobilization on silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles [43]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The free amino group present on enzyme can readily couple with aldehyde to form imine [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The covalent coupling using glutaraldehyde fixes enzyme strongly to the support preventing the chances of leaching. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Immobilization was carried out in presence of substrate starch, product maltose, neutral protein feeder BSA, and halophilic protein protectant betaine to protect the structure of α-amylase and subsequent activity loss during immobilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Results in Figure 6 show that maltose and starch protected the α-amylase and helped 11% and 24% increase in immobilization efficiency, as compared to that of control (in absence of any protectant). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This effect can be attributed to the fact that starch as substrate may have bound to active site and protected the part from denaturation during glutaraldehyde coupling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Maltose is also a product, albeit less effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Varying concentration of starch as protectant showed that 0.5% (w/v) was sufficient to give maximum protective effect. </plain></SENT>
