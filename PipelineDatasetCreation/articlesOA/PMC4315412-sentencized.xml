</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) is a major sign of cardiac adaption to high blood pressure and the most common cause of cardiac hypertrophy [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Due to the high prevalence of arterial hypertension, LVH will soon become the most common risk factor for cardiac failure worldwide [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, independent of blood pressure, LVH alone profoundly affects morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is still poorly understood why only one part of hypertensive patients develop LVH over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Family and population studies demonstrated that LV mass variation is clearly influenced by genetic factors [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This is also supported by genetic analysis of inbred rat models, including hypertensive rat strains [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Reactivation of fetal gene expression patterns has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in common cardiac diseases in adult life including LVH [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Thus, increased wall stress and neurohumoral activation are discussed to induce the return to expression of fetal genes after birth in LVH [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The switch from adult α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform to fetal β-MHC isoform is a well-known process during cardiac hypertrophy [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Reinducing glucose metabolism under low oxygen supply in hypertrophied hearts is a further example for cardiac adaption processes [13,14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In the presented work we aimed to test whether fetal gene expression programs are linked to the genetic predisposition to LVH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We performed genome-wide gene expression analysis in a genetic rat model of LVH, i.e. the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP), and in the normotensive rat strain Fischer (F344). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>SHRSP is a well-established model of polygenetic hypertension and hypertensive organ damage, including LVH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>F344 was chosen as an inbred normotensive contrasting rat strain to SHRSP, because F344 exhibit a significantly lower cardiac mass compared to the historical comparator, i.e. Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) [15] and might be therefore more informative in comparison to SHRSP than WKY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, F344 is recommended by the National Institute on Aging and the National Centre for Toxicological Research in the US as a reference strain in aging studies including cardiovascular investigations [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Consequently, F344 was used as comparative strain for an earlier genetic quantitative trait linkage (QTL)-mapping study in a complementary project [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on their contrasting phenotype we tested the hypothesis that the fetal expression patterns between day 20 of development (E20) and week 14 in adult animals show differences between SHRSP and F344. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>By using this novel approach we aimed to identify potential candidates that are involved in the development of LVH. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>We aimed to identify differences in fetal-adult cardiac expression programs by contrasting two informative rat strains. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>Efcab6 and Kcne1 showed the highest gene expression in SHRSP at week 14 and a strong up-regulation during SHRSP development in comparison with both normotensive control strains in qPCR gene expression determination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>Efcab6 showed 82% and 76% higher expression in adult SHRSP than in adult F344 and WKY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>Efcab6 encodes for EF-hand calcium binding domain 6 and belongs to the large and diverse calcium regulating EF-hand superfamily; the EF-hand calcium binding motif was identified with functional importance in heart diseases in earlier studies [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>Efcab6 is a poorly described transcript and was identified earlier in human as DJBP an oncogene binding partner [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>A functional role of Efcab6 was not described to our knowledge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>Kcne1 showed in SHRSP and WKY an increase of gene expression during development but a decrease in F344 by comparing qPCR results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>Maximum expression values in SHRSP at week 14 were at least about two fold higher than in the two normotensive strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>The influence of Kcne1 in heart failure was previously reported [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>The strong regulation of Kcne1 resulting in high expression in week 14 may point out to an important adaption process during LVH development in SHRSP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>The further detected candidate gene Ephx2 was previously reported as a promising candidate for cardiac hypertrophy in rodents and patients [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>Elevated Ephx2 expression values were associated with heart failure in rats [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>However, in cardiac tissue of heart failure patients Ephx2 expression was found to be down-regulated [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in our work Ephx2 gene expression was at least about 40% lower in SHRSP than in the control strains F344 or WKY, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, earlier studies identified Ephx2 as interesting drug target in heart failure [31,32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>Its influence on epoxyeicosatrienoic acids homeostasis has been suggested to modulate cardiac function but the mechanism is still not completely understood and needs to be clarified in further studies [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>The latter is important, since our study does per se not allow differentiating whether the identified candidates are primarily, i.e. causative, involved in the development of LVH or whether they are related to cardiac adaption processes resulting in larger heart size in SHRSP [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, differentially expressed genes could be still a general sign for genomic strain differences without relevance for cardiac hypertrophy development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>The basis of our study is the phenotypical difference between F344 and SHRSP in blood pressure and heart weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>In this regard it is important to consider the well-known influence of elevated blood pressure on gene regulation [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>Thus, differences in cardiac gene expression in adult animals might occur as secondary changes in response to the elevated blood pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study is therefore needed where the effect of blood pressure on the target genes, e.g. by reducing blood pressure in SHRSP to the same level as F344, could be investigated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>As a limitation of our study gene expression was measured in total LV tissue in adult and in whole heart samples of fetal E20 animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>Thus, we did not differentiate between right and LV tissue in E20 animals, although it should not be dismissed that the hemodynamic exposure of cardiac ventricles in E20 animals is per se quite different from the adult animals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>In light of the fact that both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts play an important role in LVH development and cardiac remodelling [35–37] our data do not allow distinguishing expression profiles between the two cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although the left ventricle is the primary and main target for hypertensive end organ damage, differences in gene expression profiles between cardiac tissues from the ventricle and atria have been reported earlier in addition to differences between cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblast [38–41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>We used only Hprt as house-keeping gene in qPCR analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>Although Hprt is an established house-keeping gene in cardiac gene expression studies [42,43] and our data demonstrated only a low variability of Hprt expression between the analyzed strains and age groups, the use of additional house-keeping genes could have increased the validity of our analysis [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>A further limitation is related to the fact that we measured heart weight and gene expression on two time points only, i.e. state E20 and week 14 as development time points of late gestation age and young adulthood, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>In this regard it is of interest, that a high cardiac metabolic gene expression including mitochondrial biogenesis genes and glucose transporter Glut-1 in rats at gestation age of E20 with a subsequent decrease has been reported [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>The chosen time distance might also be an explanation for the observation that a significant differential expression of the known markers for cardiac development like Myh6 and Myh7 were missed in our analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>Furthermore we could detect strain dependent difference in developmental regulation for Acta1 and Mlycd. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>The expression of these fetal genes may therefore be influenced by factors including cardiac mechanical influences that differ between the two analyzed rat strains [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless we could verify representative markers for transcriptional changes in cardiac development in both strains [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>The regulation of Nppa and F344 specific genes are discussed in the S1 Discussion Appendix. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="501" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, in this work we report a new approach to identify candidate genes for cardiac hypertrophy by analyzing both gene expression differences between strains with contrasting cardiac phenotype in combination with a comparison of cardiac fetal-adult gene expression patterns in the same strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>We thus identified Efcab6 as new potential candidate gene for the LVH phenotype and confirmed earlier published candidate genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>The functional relevance of the identified candidate genes for LVH needs to be tested in future studies, to exclude the possibility that their observed expression difference is solely related to a genetic inter-strain difference without functional relevance for LVH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Further validation and functional experiments are necessary to confirm these targets and new mechanisms related to cardiac hypertrophy. </plain></SENT>
