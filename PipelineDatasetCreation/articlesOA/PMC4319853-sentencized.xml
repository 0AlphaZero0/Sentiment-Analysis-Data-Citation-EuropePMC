</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Heavy metal pollution is a major environmental problem facing the modern world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Essential heavy metals such as copper and zinc are necessary for a wide range of physiological processes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Copper, for example, serves as a vital component of electron-transfer reactions mediated by proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, elevated concentrations of essential as well as non-essential heavy metals can result in growth inhibition and toxicity symptoms of most plants [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Some non-essential metals (e.g. cadmium) are potentially highly toxic even at low concentrations [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The characteristic feature of toxicity symptoms in the presence of excessive amounts of heavy metals is the inhibition or disruption of enzyme systems and the induction of oxidative stress [2,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In order to maintain the correct concentrations of essential metal ions and to minimize the damage from exposure to hazardous metal ions, plants have evolved a complex network of homeostatic mechanisms to control the uptake, accumulation, trafficking and detoxification of metals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For the need of agricultural practice and phytoremediation of metal-contaminated soils, a variety of studies have been made to investigate the mechanisms of plant metal homeostasis and tolerance at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The best described mechanism involves the intracellular metal chelation by a series of Cys-rich peptides such as glutathione (GSH), phytochelatins (PCs) and metallothioneins (MT) [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a number of genes encoding specific membrane transport proteins such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, cation diffusion facilitators (CDF) and copper transporters (COPT) have been found to mediate heavy metal uptake and transport in plant [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Metal transport, chelation and sequestration formed a synergic network to maintain the proper delivery and distribution of metal ions in plant cell, resulting in a basic level of metal tolerance [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Loss of one of these critical processes leads to plant hypersensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation is a key step in this network for the response to metal exposure or metal deficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, the gene regulatory mechanism in plant metal homeostasis is largely unknown [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, growing evidence has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) function as key regulators in the alleviation of plant metal stresses [2,13–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>miRNAs are a recently discovered class of small (19–24 nucleotides in length), non-coding RNAs that regulate mRNA or protein level either by promoting mRNA degradation or by attenuating protein translation [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The role of plant miRNAs was initially reported to be involved in a wide range of biological processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis and several developmental and physiological processes [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recently, increasing evidences indicate that miRNAs also play critical roles in regulating plant response to biotic and abiotic stress including heavy metals stress [18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For example, Osa-miR604 functions in the regulation of Cd tolerance through directing degradation of lipid transfer protein (LTP) mRNA [21]; Several works suggest a strong link between miR398, miR397, miR408, and miR857 and Cu homeostasis [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Although some miRNAs have been well elucidated in previous studies, more miRNAs were supposed to participate in plant response to heavy metal stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Thus, large-scale detailed analysis of miRNAs and their targets involved in heavy metal stress may provide a new insight into understanding of plant heavy metal stress response mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Paeonia ostii is one of the most important horticultural crops in the world due to its striking ornamental and medicinal values. Paeonia ostii belongs to the Moutan subfamily which comprises eight wild species including Paeonia cathayana, Paeonia jishanensis, Paeonia qiui, Paeonia ostii, Paeonia rockii, Paeonia decomposita, Paeonia delavayi and Paeonia ludlowii [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Among all the wild species, Paeonia ostii was proved to be highly tolerant to copper stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As a wild species and its close relation with other cultivars, Paeonia ostii can be a preferred candidate to perform sRNA sequencing and analyze their role in copper stress response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, no systematic studies of small RNA in Paeonia ostii have been conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The focus of this work is to analyze miRNAs as well as their targets involved in Paeonia ostii Cu homeostasis and tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It will extend the current view on the molecular understanding of miRNA-guided regulation of plant heavy metal adaption. </plain></SENT>
