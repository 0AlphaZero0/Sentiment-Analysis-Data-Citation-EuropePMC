<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show how our developed GeneTiles software can improve RNAseq analysis approaches by more confidently identifying a large set of markers upon infection with these bacteria. For analysis of RNAseq data currently, software programs such as Bowtie2 and Samtools are indispensable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, these programs that are designed for a LINUX environment require some dedicated programming skills and have no options for visualisation of the resulting mapped sequence reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Especially with large data sets, this makes the analysis time consuming and difficult for non-expert users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have applied the GeneTiles software to the analysis of previously published and newly obtained RNAseq datasets of our zebrafish infection model, and we have shown the applicability of this approach also to published RNAseq datasets of other organisms by comparing our data with a published mammalian infection study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have implemented the DEXSeq module in the GeneTiles software to identify genes, such as glucagon A, that are differentially spliced under infection conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of our RNAseq data, this has led to the possibility to improve the size of data sets that could be efficiently compared without using problem-dedicated programs, leading to a quick identification of marker sets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our previous research, we have used zebrafish larval infection models to study the transcriptome response to infection by several pathogens (Ordas et al. 2011; Stockhammer et al. 2010; van der Vaart et al. 2013; van Soest et al. 2011; Veneman et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have tested the response of zebrafish larvae to infection by the opportunistic bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis as a model for biomaterial-associated infections that are often caused by this species in clinical practise (Boelens et al. 2000; Broekhuizen et al. 2008; Busscher et al. 2012; Zaat et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These studies have led to a high throughput model that resulted in a large set of RNAseq data sets highlighting a new bottleneck in our research: the fast and user-friendly analysis of large datasets that can be easily visualised for comparative purposes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the analysis of our former transcriptome data sets, there was a need for specialised scripting languages to quickly find good marker genes for the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We used an existing visualisation program, Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al. 2011), that shows the data solely along a line representing the genome, thereby requiring zooming in to view the aligned reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>IGV and many other open source visualisation programs, such as MapView (Bao et al. 2009), Tablet (Milne et al. 2010), GenoViewer (Laczik et al. 2012) and BamView (Carver et al. 2013), also require the user to scroll or manually search for other genes to bring these into focus; and an overview of a selection of genes based on alignment results is not available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Finally, most of these data visualisation programs do not allow the export of presented visual results, other than taking screenshots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In our previous analysis of RNAseq data, we were reliant on manual counting of reads as guided by the IGV viewer (Veneman et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we used the transcriptome data set obtained from the zebrafish high throughput screening system for S. epidermidis infection (Veneman et al. 2013) as a case study to optimise and automate the data analysis pipeline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Using the resulting software package, we also went further and added a larger RNAseq data set from Mycobacterium marinum infection data for comparisons of specificity of the transcriptome responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We also integrated the DEXSeq algorithm that can be used to give an estimate of probability of the occurrence of differential splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This has led to the identification of genes that are differentially spliced after a microbial infection in zebrafish larvae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Finally, we wanted to include a comparison with whole organism infection data in other vertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, there are still few available RNAseq data for this that can be mapped on Ensembl genome data; and as a result, we have only been able to compare our zebrafish infection data with the RNAseq data from a bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) model as published by Scholey et al. 2013 (Scholey et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, the results are sufficient to show that our approach makes also such interspecies comparisons of RNAseq datasets very easy and this can quickly lead to conclusions on conserved immune responses, even in comparisons between very different fish and mammalian infection models. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>When using GeneTiles, the complete data processing pipeline, including the used parameters, is available for download. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This enables the user to perform the same analysis locally or try small modifications (for bioinformaticians). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Here, we give a quick list of the used programs and their function within our current pipeline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A detailed explanation including the used parameters is available in Online Resource 2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In order of use in GeneTiles:Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) is used to align the reads in the fastq file to the genome (obtained from Ensembl). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Bowtie2 generates SAM files that contain the reads together with the location on the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Upon multiple hits, the best quality hit is selected or upon a tie of multiple best hits, the reads are randomly distributed (the manual of Bowtie2 is referred to for other default behaviour).Samtools (Li et al. 2009) is used to convert and compress the SAM files into a binary BAM file.Samtools is furthermore used to sort the reads in the BAM files based on the aligned read location in the genome, resulting in a sorted BAM file.The BAM files is indexed to be able to quickly find the aligned reads based on a location in the genome, i.e. to be able to quickly search the BAM file. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The index is saved as a BAI file.Using the available annotation from Ensembl, we can search the BAM file for reads within a gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>All reads that at least partially fall within the gene exon and intron regions are counted once. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>This is done with a python script which consists of the combination of HTseq and pysam (Anders et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The output of this script is a tab-separated file (tsv) containing the read counts per gene.We used DESeq, an R-script, to perform statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>DESeq is used to normalise the reads using a DESeq scaling factor, computed as the median of the ratio, for each gene, of its read count over the geometric mean across samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Then variance and average of the measurement compared to the control is expressed as a P value, by calculating the dispersion per gene using DESeq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The size factors, as well as the P values, are stored in ‘tsv’ files.Using scripts, similarly as in step 5, also the input files for DEXSeq can be generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>DEXSeq requires:A ‘gtf’ file containing the experiment design.For all samples, a ‘txt’ file containing the counts obtained for the mapping data in the .SAM files.Genome annotation (from Ensembl) in a ‘gff’ file. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Scripts to obtain these files are also available in the Supplement.8.Using DEXSeq, another R-script perform a more complex statistical analysis; we can look at the reads within exons and compare the variance and average per exon between measurement and control groups of the samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>DEXSeq uses binning, where exons are cut into bins, based on known exon boundaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>When a read overlaps multiple bins, it is counted in each bin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Per bin, based on the annotation, two comparisons can be made, a comparison between the same exon bins in different samples (groups) and a comparison between an exon bin and its neighbour exon bins within the same group of samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Note that, therefore, DEXSeq requires at least two groups containing at least two samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Based on both comparisons, a likelihood test is performed resulting in a P value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>More details are available in Anders et al. 2012 (Anders et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The output of size factors and P values are stored as ‘tsv’ files.9.Using a script, all tsv files are combined into an excel file available for download, e.g. per experiment, chromosome, per filtered results of most significant reads or highest ratio between measurement and control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In addition, an index is built for fast visualisation online (closed source). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Through the website of Wikipathways [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Download_Pathways">http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Download_Pathways</ext-link>], the SVG images were downloaded on the GeneTiles server. Using Javascript, on the client side and within the SVG images, the gene boxes are given a background colour based on a user selection, e.g. P value or ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>For this, the genes and/or proteins are matched to their Ensembl references on the selected genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In addition, also the human pathways are searched for find homologs of genes using Ensembl biomart. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>RNAseq data, containing tens of millions of reads, is mostly processed using scripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>After processing, a selection of reads is analysed using RNAseq viewers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Directly browsing the processed RNAseq data is difficult due to the large dynamic range of length scales of reads (50 bp), exons (~200 bp), introns (~3 kb), genes (~20 kb) and chromosomes (~65 Mb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Using a minimal size of 1 pixel per read, a computer screen allows only for ~50 kb to be visible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In addition, most RNAseq viewers show introns at the same scale as exons, which in most experiments means that 90 % of the visible sequence data does not display aligned reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>We created an online viewer, GeneTiles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetiles.com/">www.Genetiles.com</ext-link>), that does allow for browsing all the aligned reads, while eliminating almost completely the need for user intervention (such as zooming in). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The genes in a chromosome are visible as tiles in a 2D array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The tile colour and intensity are a measure of the significance of the number of reads of experiment versus control, indicating changes in expression levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>When a tile is selected, the gene is loaded underneath, scaled to fit the width of the screen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In a schematic view, all introns are shrunk to a fixed short length to visualise the aligned reads in a graph above the exons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>To accomplish fast browsing, all reads are indexed on the server directly after data processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>This indexed data is also available for download to apply custom filtering in Excel or other programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The export functions of the tiles and genes as scalable vector graphics makes it easy for the user to modify the final visualisation for publication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title><text><SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Workflow </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Automated analysis of RNAseq data using GeneTiles does not need any programming steps anymore in a Linux environment by the user and performs directly a visualisation of the differentially expressed data, making it easier to interpret. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>To validate this new software package, RNAseq data from zebrafish bacterial infection experiments was obtained from Veneman et al. (2013) and used as the initial test model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>All programs used by Veneman et al. (2013) are implemented, and more visualisation and export options are added in a server-based environment (Fig. 1, Online Resource 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the analysis pipeline of GeneTiles represents a combination of the previously described tools that have been previously shown to be useful for RNAseq analyses (Hatem et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This makes it very manageable because it reduces the amount of high-end computers required in the research group for alignment and analysis, as all calculations are performed on the server. To start the analysis, the user can choose between various genomes that have been imported from Ensembl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the fastq files will be uploaded, followed by the option to analyse the data as single-end or paired-end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The files will be aligned automatically, after which the control or measurement treatment can be chosen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) will normalise the data, and subsequently DEXSeq (Anders et al. 2012) will extract differentially expressed bins that indicate differential splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>A table containing the differentially expressed genes or visualisations containing tiles or individual genes can be exported at this point.Fig. 1Pipeline of RNAseq data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The diagram shows the workflow of the data analysis starting at the raw fastq files until the final visualisation performed automatically by the GeneTiles server. The analysis pipeline is an open source and available in the Supplement </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>With respect to the use of Bowtie2 aligner, we want to point out that it will fail to map reads spanning exon-exon boundaries to the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This problem could be solved using a splice aware aligner based on Bowtie2, such as Tophat2 (Kim et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>This option will be included in a future version of the GeneTiles package. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>However, Tophat2 is more computationally intensive and depends on the correct predictions of splice sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the analysis without the splice aware aligner, as used in this paper, will remain present. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Different analysis methods </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Considering that the RNA samples of the S. epidermidis infection experiments were paired-end sequenced, we had the possibility to explore the added value of paired-end over single-end sequencing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It can be noted that a the number of differentially expressed genes does not give an estimate of the reliability of the data; however, considering the high quality of RNAseq data, it can be assumed that adding an extra biological sample provides more relevant information than analysing a smaller group of samples by paired-end sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Our data support this assumption since we found only a slight increase of 23 % in the differentially expressed genes when performing paired-end analysis in the four S. epidermidis-infected samples, using a P value of 0.05 as cut-off filter.Fig 2Comparing single- and paired-end RNAseq analysis. a The different sample sizes (N = 1–4) for analysis are visualised. b The total number of the differentially expressed genes with a fold change larger than 2 or smaller than −2 and a P value smaller than 0.05 (solid grey bars) or an adjusted P value smaller than 0.05 (patterned dark bars). c The light grey circles of the Venn diagrams show the total number of the differentially expressed genes for all the sample sizes with a fold change larger than 2 or smaller than −2 and a P value smaller than 0.05 as shown in (b), and the overlap of the differentially expressed genes compared to the N = 4 paired-end data set. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we analysed the number of the differentially expressed genes with all possible options regarding samples sizes (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>We found a set of 359 differentially expressed genes when only analysing one sample with a P value of 0.05 and compared this large set of genes to our reference set of 203 genes (resulting from the analysis of paired-end sequence data of all four samples) (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>This comparison shows a rather small overlap of only 23.7 % (single-end) and 27.6 % (paired-end). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>As expected, this overlap increases, and therefore, the number of false-positives decreases when adding more samples (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In order to provide a statistically more stringent analysis of the differentially expressed genes, we have also included, in the GeneTiles software, a tool for minimising false discovery based on the algorithm of Benjamini and Hochberg 1995 (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995), using the implementation of DESeq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The resulting adjusted values show far more stringent results (Fig. 2b) but generally confirm the limited value of performing paired-end sequencing as compared to the added value of adding more biological controls. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The previous comparison as shown by Veneman et al. (2013) was based on a single biological replicate of M. marinum-infected zebrafish embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We used this single replicate and added 5 more independent biological replicas, which led to a total of 6 replicas of M. marinum, 4 replicas of S. epidermidis-infected zebrafish embryos and a total of 9 replicas of non-infected control samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>As found before (Veneman et al. 2013), S. epidermidis infection elicits a much smaller transcriptional host response of immune-related genes compared to M. marinum (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, the total number of the differentially expressed genes was increased since several genes were previously not found to be significantly regulated by S. epidermidis where they do show a response in this analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Another finding is the high induction of genes upon M. marinum infection compared to the S. epidermidis-infected samples (Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>An explanation could be that the M. marinum bacterium is a natural fish pathogen, and therefore, it is better recognised as intruder. S. epidermidis in large quantities is also pathogenic for fish; however, since it is not a natural pathogen, it could not be very well recognised as well as M. marinum. For instance, we now observe a high induction of the leptin B gene (lepb) upon infection with S. epidermidis (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In this case, the difference with the previous study is caused by errors in the automated annotation of probes in the micro-array used in Veneman et al. (2013), which was used as benchmark for the RNAseq analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The high expression of lepb found in M. marinum-infected samples is in line with the results earlier described by Wieland et al. 2005 (Wieland et al. 2005), where they found a higher mycobacterial load in the lungs of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice.Fig. 3An overview of the differentially expressed genes. a The GeneTiles output shows a much larger set of genes with a P value smaller than 0.05 with the M. marinum-infected samples compared to the S. epidermidis-infected samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The described toolbox for RNAseq data analysis offers two different levels of support in an integrative setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>First, the software combines several programs needed for open source RNAseq analysis such as Bowtie2, Samtools, the ‘R’ statistical package, DESeq, DEXSeq, HTseq and pysam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>These programs are placed in a pipeline (script) that runs these programs in the required order, with correct in- and output settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Second, the processed data is visualised in a user-friendly way and made available for export with a choice of quantitative settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The advantages and ease of the use of this combined toolbox is demonstrated by analysis of the previously published RNAseq datasets from zebrafish and cow infectious disease models, as well as the new RNAseq data of a zebrafish mycobacterial infection experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This resulted in a highly confident innate marker set for systemic innate immune response to infection by pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species in zebrafish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the data is viewable in a pathway view using the pathways stored at WikiPathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In this way, it was also possible to quickly determine the effect of the number of replicates and the evaluation of potential false positive results, as is the case for the analysis of differential splicing using the DEXSeq algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Comparing our experiences with our previous analyses (Veneman et al. 2013) and the re-analyses performed here, we can estimate that we have saved several months of working time while obtaining far superior output files that could be rapidly compared to the new RNAseq data sets also from other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The data analysed in this study is available at the GeneTiles website for further analysis and as demonstration material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This makes it possible to rapidly evaluate new immune markers in the datasets described in this paper but also can be used to identify new markers based on other search criteria. </plain></SENT>
