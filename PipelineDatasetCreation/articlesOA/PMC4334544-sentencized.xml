</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During ecological speciation, divergence along the genome has been observed to be heterogeneous in numerous taxonomic groups [e.g., [1–4]]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Typically, the average genome-wide divergence is low, interspersed with regions of exceptional differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, studies describing divergence patterns across the genome have found regions of exceptional differentiation to be either numerous and small [4] or few and large [5, 6], the latter sometimes referred to as ‘genomic islands’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A variety of explanations have been proposed for the observed heterogeneity in genomic divergence, including stochastic processes such as genetic drift, but also deterministic mechanisms such as locus-specific reduction of gene flow in the vicinity of genes causing reproductive isolation, hitchhiking around selected variants, or variation in recombination and mutation rates [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Generally, genetic drift, population expansion, migration, and other demographic events affect the whole genome, whereas natural selection modified by local environmental differences impact only those regions of the genome that affect the respective phenotypes and fitness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is not known whether or not genomic patterns such as the variation of divergence and recombination along the genome tend to follow a predictable evolutionary trajectory as populations proceed along a speciation continuum [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We investigated the early phase of divergence using lake-river stickleback population pairs varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>If divergence patterns are driven by locus-specific effects of gene flow and divergent selection, the extent of divergence is expected to be more localized than widespread, in line with the “island view” [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These regions might hold “speciation genes” maintaining reproductive isolation between species including genes underlying a fitness reduction in hybrids [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, “divergence hitchhiking”, the accumulative effect of selectively advantageous loci, predicts a positive correlation between genomic divergence and island size progression [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation posits that the lack of differentiation across most of the genome is due to shared ancestral polymorphism rather than ongoing gene flow [10, 11], whereas regions of high differentiation represent regions influenced by selection at linked sites [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Such a hitchhiking pattern may be caused by both advantageous (positive selection) and deleterious alleles (background selection). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if adaptation alone (assuming some degree of geographic separation) shapes the genomic landscape, population genetic processes unrelated to the extent of overall genomic differentiation govern divergence patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Disentangling such alternative scenarios is a crucial yet challenging step in understanding the genomics of divergence, especially in parapatry where the current and historic extent of migration and gene flow contribute to the overall genomic patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We tested predictions inherent to the different scenarios explaining genomic patterns of divergence using whole-genome sequencing data of replicated population pairs of three-spined sticklebacks varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Five population pairs were sampled from connected lakes and rivers from the United States (Us), Canada (Ca), Norway (No), and from two sites in Germany (G1 and G2; Fig. 1 and S1 Table). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As ice sheets covered these regions during the last glaciation, these populations represent recent colonization events (~12 000 years ago). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Both lake and river populations are derived from marine ancestors that became landlocked during de-glaciation, and in which ecotype differentiation between watersheds has occurred repeatedly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Some phenotypic traits such as feeding morphology [13], brain development [7], and parasite resistance [14] seemingly differentiated in parallel with habitat (i.e. lake and river) suggestive of local adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, experimental studies have shown evidence for local adaptation to lake and river habitats mediated by parasites [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Hence, contrasting the differentiation between populations from distinct ecosystems permits us to study the onset of divergence, which might eventually lead to complete reproductive isolation (i.e. speciation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we scan genomic divergence patterns and evaluate differences and commonalities across a wide geographic sampling of parapatric population pairs to uncover the relative importance and interaction of evolutionary factors like drift, selection, and recombination during adaptive divergence. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="sec002a"><title><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Lake and river population pairs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>One consistent difference between lake and river habitats is that lake fish posses a higher parasites diversity than parapatric river fish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>From previous work on three-spined sticklebacks, lakes and rivers in Northern Germany are known to harbour distinct parasite communities [14, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Despite the relatively low sample size for individual locations in this study (n = 12–17), this ecological difference between lakes and rivers is here confirmed on a broader geographic scale (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>From each of the ten sampled populations, six stickleback genomes were sequenced using a combination of paired-end and mate-pair libraries on the Illumina HiSeq platform to an average genomic coverage of 26-fold (S2 Table). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Instead of sequencing many individuals with low coverage, a small number of genomes per population was chosen to be sequenced to high coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This approach takes advantage of the greater resolution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs; evaluated in greater detail in a companion paper [17]) plus increased genotype accuracy within each individual to decipher the divergence mechanisms acting towards an apparent repeated differentiation between lake and river fish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Besides evaluating allele frequencies, the high individual sequence coverage permits us to infer haplotypes and examine recombination patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>After stringent quality filtering, we accessed 297,437,667 bp from the 20 autosomes (380,547,835 bp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>SNP density varied from 3 to 10 SNPs per kilobase (kb) within each population (S3–S4 Tables). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>For each of the five parapatric comparisons, pairwise genome-wide averages of divergence (FST) ranged from 0.10 to 0.28, disclosing a varying degree of differentiation in the ascending order of Us, G2, No, G1, and Ca (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The parapatric pairs emerge as repeated independent differentiation events (neighbor joining tree, Fig. 1A) except for the German populations, despite belonging to different draining systems (North Sea versus Baltic Sea). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Due to low land levels and historically varying water levels, water bodies and connections across Northern Germany have most likely fluctuated over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Thus the two lake and river population pairs in Germany (G1 and G2) might have been originally connected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Because of this, G1 and G2 share some postglacial history, common ancestral variation, and divergence while currently the two water systems are physically separated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Specifically, studies on the German system have proposed parasite communities as a promising candidate mediating divergent selection, pointing out their role in local adaptation [15, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As a further global perspective of this hypothesis, we find a signal of isolation-by-adaptation (partial mantel test: r = 0.622, P = 0.0007) shown by a significant association of genome-wide FST and parasite community (jaccard distance of parasite sums across individuals, counts were 4th square root transformed) while correcting for geographic distance (geodetic distance between GPS coordinates of each sampling location). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>As we detected isolation-by-adaptation at a spatial scale beyond which gene flow occurs, this signal might be most likely caused by a loose linkage between locally adapted loci and the genome-wide neutral regions [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This result suggests a role of parasites for the local adaptation of freshwater stickleback populations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>However, as freshwater systems have been subject to recurrent water-level changes during de-glaciation, the spatial context at different stages of population divergence might have fluctuated over the years affecting demographic history of the populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge that estimates of FST based on allele frequencies can vary depending on samples size [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>To reduce variation of estimates between populations we kept the samples size constant at 12 alleles per populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our analysis did not rely on per site estimates but instead on averages of FST over larger regions (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of sample size on our power to describe genomic patterns, detect outlier windows, and define divergent regions in the three following ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>(i) We tested the accuracy of our FST estimates at individual loci by comparing them to estimates based on a larger sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The 183 loci used for validating the genotypes (see above) were also used to genotype a larger population sample (n = 26–59 per population) to validate allele frequencies and resulting FST estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>For all population pairs, the FST estimates based on the sequencing approach with 6 individuals per population (12 alleles) had a significant positive correlation with the FST estimates from the Golden Gate assay using at least 26 individuals (Pearson correlation, r = 0.85, P&lt; 10-16, df = 241, S4 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>(ii) We tested the consistency of window FST estimates across the whole range of potential FST values by jack-knifing samples (S5 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>On average, jack-knifed values (comparing 10 alleles per population) had 95% confidence intervals of 0.039 up to a maximum of 0.175. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Windows with high FST values (&gt;0.75) had even narrower confidence intervals (average of 0.027 and maximum of 0.088). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>These results support the notion that pronounced differences (“near-” and “post-fixation”) can be more reliably detected using our sample sizes than more settled differences (“pre-fixation” regime). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>(iii) We tested our ability to detect known candidate genes, which highly differentiate between marine and freshwater populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>For this we utilized previous sequencing data available for a marine population from Denmark [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Our genome scan based on FST estimates averaged across 10 kb windows reliably detected windows overlapping ATP1a1 [50], a well known candidate gene for physiological adaptation to osmotic differences on linkage group I, in all 6 pairwise European marine-freshwater comparisons (S6 Fig.). Eda, the major gene (linkage group IV) underlying the reduction of lateral plate number frequently observed in freshwater populations [51], was detected in 5 out of the 6 pairwise European marine-freshwater comparisons (S7 Fig.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>As expected G1_L, a lake population showing phenotypic variation at this trait did not show significant differentiation in the Eda region, in which two of the six sequenced individuals were fully plated and carried the same haplotype as the fully plated marine fish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This is in line with a simulation demonstrating that sampling 12 haplotypes yields between 67–95% power compared to a gold standard, while notably, sampling fewer individuals has the greatest impact in the “pre-fixation” regime (a beneficial allele is starting to rise in one population) compared to “near-fixation” and “post-fixation” regimes (a beneficial allele is nearly or completely fixed in one population) [52]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>TD in these regions was compared to the genome-wide average of each respective population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>A 5% threshold was applied to classify divergent regions into four mutually exclusive categories: background selection if TD dropped below the threshold in both parapatric populations, adaptation in lake or river if TD dropped below the threshold only in the respective population, and reduced gene flow if TD appeared neutral (not below the threshold). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Comparing the utilization of population specific thresholds for each pairwise comparison with the utilization of the same overall averaged threshold for all populations resulted in minor differences in absolute numbers of regions in different categories. </plain></SENT>
