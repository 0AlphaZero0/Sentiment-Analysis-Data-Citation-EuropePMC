</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) causes pancreas disease (PD) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) characterized by necrosis of the exocrine pancreas, cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It was first reported in 1984 [2] and later characterized as a member of the family Togaviridae [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Salmonid alphavirus has a positive sense, ssRNA genome which is approximately 12 kb [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The genome is a capped and polyadenylated positive strand RNA made of two open reading frames (ORFs) that encode structural and nonstructural proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Non-structural proteins are encoded by the 5′ end while structural proteins that form the envelope glycoproteins and the capsid are coded by the 3′ end [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have shown that type I interferon (IFN) inhibits the replication of SAV-3 in TO-cells [6] which has stimulated further interest to elucidate the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFNs in salmonids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Antiviral responses generated in response to viral infection are essential for the survival of the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the assembly of an antiviral response starts at cellular level during which programmed intrinsic cell responses are initiated in a process termed ‘cell-autonomous immunity’ [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Chief among responses that remodel the cell’s transcriptome in response to infection is the IFN cytokine family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These cytokines induce pleiotropic biological effects by producing profiles of gene repertoires that serve as powerful signals for marshalling host defenses against microbial invasion in host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As pointed out by MacMicking [7], IFNs induce the expression of a broad spectrum of genes as part of an antimicrobial program designed to combat infection in all nucleated cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although named after their ability to interfere with virus replication in treated cells, IFNs have immunodulatory, cell differentiative, anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative effects on cells [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In higher vertebrates, examination of recently identified IFN inducible genes (ISGs) using a systems biology approach reveal a highly diverse but integrated host defense program dedicated at protecting the interior of a vertebrate cell [7,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>While these studies have opened new insights on the role of type I IFN responses in protecting mammalian cells against viral infections, studies in teleosts fish are still in their early stages and as such little is known on protective mechanisms of different ISGs on fish cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Hence, to gain a global insight on type I IFN pathway related genes expressed in fish cells, we used a RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN and SAV-3 infection in TO-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this study we wanted to find out whether TO-cells, a continuous cell line originating from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) headkidney cells characterized to possess dendritic/macrophage like properties, would express the same profile of genes as those generated from mammalian phagocytic cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>By comparing the profile of ISGs generated from type I IFN treated cells with SAV-3 infected cells, we wanted to find out whether SAV-3 infection would produce the same profile of genes comparable to those produced by type I IFN treatment in TO-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The transcriptome presented herein shows that type I IFN induces the expression of a broad spectrum of ISGs and that SAV-3 is a potent inducer of type I IFN responses in TO-cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first report on the use of RNA-seq to study IFN responses in fish cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Although several computer based de novo assembly tools (e.g. Trans-AbySS, Oasis, SOAP2denovo and Trinity) have been developed, only the trinity program was used for sequence assembly in this study given that several studies have shown that Trinity is a powerful tool that has proved to be useful for annotating transcriptomes for different vertebrate species across taxa [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Compared to other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full length transcripts from RNA-seq data without a reference genome with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments [12] and as such Trinity was considered to be a better tool for use in TO-cells given the limited number of annotated genes that would serve as reference genes in salmonids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Using Trinity, this study demonstrates that short reads from illumina RNA-seq can be assembled into protein sequences used to identify DEGs in fish cells that can be matched to orthologous genes found in mammals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Among the TLRs, only TLR3 and TLR8 that are sensors of nucleic acids released in the endosomal compartments of macrophages and DCs [14] were upregulated, which augments the notion that TO-cells possess macrophage/dendritic cell like properties [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Unlike TLRs, RLRs comprising of MDA5, RIG-I and LGP2 are primary sensors of the 5′-triphosphate RNA expressed by viruses in the cytoplasm [15] and their upregulation in the case of SAV-3 infection in TO-cells supports the consensus view that they bind to the 5′-ppp-RNA expressed by alphaviruses during replication [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>While TLRs use the MyD88/TRIF adaptor, RIG-I and MDA5 uses the IPS-1 adaptor in their downstream signaling [17], which was also upregulated in this study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Of the four upregulated IRFs, expression of IRF3 and IRF7 was higher than IRF1 and IRF2 suggesting that IRF3 and IRF7 played a major role in inducing type I IFN responses in TO-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In additions, these findings suggest that IRF3 and IRF7 regulate the TLR3 and TLR8 pathways which is in line with observations in mammalia where it has been shown that IRF3 and IRF7 are master regulators of TLR3 and TLR8 pathways [14]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies show that despite SAV-3 induces a strong IFN response, the virus replicates vividly in TO cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>When cells are pre-treated with recombinant IFN, 4 to 24 hrs prior to infection, with recombinant IFNα TO cells are protected against virus induced cytopathic effects and virus replication is inhibited [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with observations made for other alphaviruses in mammalia showing that pretreatment with IFN inhibits alphavirus replication of in-vivo [56,57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>For SAV-3 it is not understood why the virus can replicate in vitro under strong IFN responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Studies in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), another alphavirus, show that virus replication is resistant to IFN inhibition once replication is established [58] and it was shown that CHIKV uses the nsP2 to suppress the antiviral effect of IFN by interfering with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway enabling the virus to replicate in the presence of IFN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>TO-cells used in this study were not pretreated with IFN prior to SAV-3 infection and concordant with previous findings once infection was established, IFN released through downstream signal transduction had no inhibitory effects in the subsequent replication of the virus [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Although we did not determine the mechanisms used by SAV-3 to circumvent the IFN antiviral effects produced by downstream signal transduction, several studies have shown that alphaviruses use different mechanisms to block the antiviral effects of IFN once infection is established [59,60]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Based on data presented here and our previous findings [6], it can be concluded that TO-cells pretreated with IFNα (4-24hrs) before infection inhibit SAV-3 replication while the IFN response induced from the SAV-3 infection is not sufficient to inhibit virus replication [6]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Similar observations have been made for other alphaviruses [61,62] and several other viral families [63-67] in which virus infection has been shown to downregulate the expression of several genes regulating cellular transcription during virus replication as a survival strategy leading to persistent infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>For example, Gorchakov et al. [61] have shown that replication of Sindbis virus downregulates major cellular processes such as the transcription and translation of mRNAs in infected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>In their studies, they noted that inhibition of cellular mRNA transcription is a critical phenomenon used by viruses to suppress the expression of cellular stress inducible genes in vertebrate cells as a survival strategy to enhance their replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Hence, this would account for the downregulation of a large proportion of genes linked to cellular, biological and molecular functions in TO-cells that were only infected by SAV-3 (TO-VS-SAV3) and not those treated with IFN (TO-VS-IFN) in this study. </plain></SENT>
