</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The protozoa in the genus Cryptosporidium are important parasitic pathogens causing water and food contamination leading to diarrhoeal disease [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Waterborne outbreaks occur globally and have been linked to recreational water exposure and drinking water consumption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Contamination of the waters has been shown to be due to human (wastewater) and animal (livestock and wildlife) sources [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Clinically, cryptosporidiosis may cause profuse and long-lasting (usually 1–2 weeks, ranging from a few days to 4 weeks) but usually self-limiting diarrhoea with abdominal cramping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Chronic or systemic infections are reported in immunodeficient patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Treatment is usually symptomatic, with no licensed specific therapy in the EU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Repeat infections elicit some degree of immunity [1,4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To date, around 30 species in the genus are identified.Disease in humans is predominantly caused by Cryptosporidium (C.) parvum and hominis [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>While C. parvum infects a broad spectrum of mammals, C.hominis has a human infection cycle [2,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The oocysts of the parasite represent the infective form which can survive and remain infective for many months outside a host, particularly in moist and cool environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Oocysts can survive in river sediments and rivers were demonstrated to have acted as transfer medium from livestock to public water supplies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The pathogen is not sensitive to chlorine disinfection as applied in drinking water treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Transmission takes place by oral ingestion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The incubation period is 2–10 days and infected persons can excrete the pathogens for several months after symptoms have stopped [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In Germany, by federal law all diagnostic laboratories are obliged to notify the local public health departments of patients with stool tests positive for Cryptosporidium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Between 900 to 1.400 cases have been reported annually between 2008 and 2012 in Germany. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Outbreaks resulting in notification were restricted to households or community settings [8]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In late May and early June 2013, extreme river flooding in Eastern Germany began after several days of heavy rain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The river Saale, a tributary of the river Elbe and navigable for inland water transport, overflowed the floodplain and parts of the city centre of Halle (inhabitants 230,000), Saxony Anhalt, Germany. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The flooding peaked on 5th June and the city council declared the state of disaster from 3rd to 8th June. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The flooding was considered the worst since 1890. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>It affected central parts of the sewage piping system and damaged sewage pumps in several locations along the river and the floodplain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A central sewage collector tunnel running along the river bank normally removes the wastewaters to a treatment plant northwards and downriver of the city centre. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Numerous emergency spillways allow direct efflux from the tunnel into the river in case of extremely high water levels e.g. after heavy rainfall or in case of flooding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The floodplain bisecting the city represents the central recreational area for the urban population of Halle and includes playgrounds, ponds, parks and sports facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Bathing, although officially not approved, is very common at a river beach and other locations, and children have easy water access to the normally gently flowing stream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The area was polluted by the floods and consequently closed to the public for cleaning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The area was reopened to the public in stages from mid-July on and the beach use resumed during the last week of July. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The summer holidays in Halle started on 15 July 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A period with much sunny and hot summer weather lasted from early July until end of August 2013, likely encouraging the use of the recreational areas in the reopened floodplain. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>During calendar weeks 32 and 33 (5–18 August), 2013, 24 cases of cryptosporidiosis were notified in the city of Halle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>By comparison the annual average in years 2008–12 in Halle was 9 cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This increase was simultaneously detected by the local health department in Halle and by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin, the federal level public health institute in Germany, through application of electronic routine cluster algorithm for outbreak detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>An outbreak investigation team was formed and included public health professionals from the local health department, expert microbiologists for drinking water and recreational water from the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) in Bad Elster, an expert parasitologist from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and epidemiologists from the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>An outbreak case was defined a case as a resident of Halle with gastroenteritis (diarrhoea or vomiting or abdominal cramps) and Cryptosporidium-positive stool (microscopy or antigen detection) with disease onset weeks 27 through 47 and who did not stay outside Halle for more than 7 out of the 2 to 14 days incubation period . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Secondary outbreak cases were defined as cases with reported contact to persons with diarrhoea in either their household, kindergarten or school during the two weeks prior to onset of symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The local health authorities published a press release calling on individuals with diarrhoea to see their doctor for stool sampling. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The objective of the case–control study was to test the main hypothesized sources/modes for infection with cryptosporidiosis: activities in the floodplain, visits to swimming pools and such pools where oocysts where detected, the consumption of tap and mineral water and visits to the zoo in the 14 days before symptom-onset. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We recruited primary cases and controls among kindergarten children because this subgroup represented 39/80 (49%) of all primary cases until the start of the study on 5 September. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Also they were considered to be approachable comparably quickly via day-care centres. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This was calculated using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp LP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In accordance with article 25, section 1, of the German Infection Protection Act of 2001, a formal ethical review process and approval was not required for this investigation of an ongoing outbreak. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We describe the largest recognized outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Germany, which occurred in the city of Halle (Saale) and comprised 167 notified cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The true size of the outbreak probably was much larger since many patients probably did not see a doctor and did not undergo laboratory testing for Cryptosporidium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The outbreak began 6 weeks after the peak of an extensive river flooding which in the city inundated the whole floodplain as well as some adjacent streets and also affected and damaged the sewage systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>PCR confirmation was obtained for all but 8 (7%) of 114 samples recorded as positive for visual fluorescent antibody testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The ability of PCR to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium in samples negative for visual analysis was not determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We did not exlude these cases as the case definition was based on microscopy and antigen testing which are the most frequently used methods in primary diagnostics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological investigations provide evidence for exposure from human activities in the areas affected by the flood waters, including numerous playgrounds and the river beach, as a primary risk factor of infection of children – the most affected group in this outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Repetitive water samples, taken two weeks to three months after the peak of the outbreak and in different locations, showed Cryptosporidium oocysts in the inner-city river, in some sites in very high concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>It appears plausible that children contracted infection when playing, bathing and also eating there. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>However, we did not ask what they did specifically in the floodplain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>However, interpretation of the case–control study is limited by the fact that exposure information was recorded differently among cases and controls (telephone and online) and it is not certain that the identified risk factors apply for other persons in the same way as for kindergarten children (study) group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Based on preliminary results, local health authorities also released a notification of the risk in the floodplain (13 September) while the online questionnaire was still accessible (until 16 September), however only two controls and zero cases answered to the questionnaire or got interviewed after 13 September. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>As Cryptosporidium oozysts were shown to being able to survive long periods in river water sediments, our findings cannot explain if the high concentrations of Cryptosporidium oocysts detected up to five months after the flooding, were exclusively caused by the preceding flooding or if ongoing sewage seepage or spills in a city with ongoing Cryptosporidium transmission contributed to this. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In any case, the oocyst counts measured at several spots (particularly no. 3–6 in the map) correspond to concentrations in open waters which according to WHO guidelines suggest pollution by wastewater [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In an analysis from a different river in German, Kistemann et al. detected median oocyst counts of only 4 oocysts/100 l (range 0–28) [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The involvement of wastewater in the aetiology of this outbreak is additionally supported by the nature of C. hominis which is almost entirely confined to humans [21-23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>However, evidence of the environmental findings is limited as species identification based on PCR-amplification in samples from the river water was not successful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Thus, source tracking to the river was limited to the findings of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, discrepancies between microscopic and molecular water sample investigations have been reported frequently [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>To date, gastrointestinal disease outbreaks after river flooding in Central Europe usually have much smaller impact on public health than in countries with lower water and sanitation standards [25,26] and, waterborne outbreaks, even after flooding events were extremely rare in Germany [20,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The outbreak in Halle started about two weeks after public reopening of the previously closed floodplain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This could explain the outbreaks’ beginning two months after the flood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, while most faecal pathogens may have died on the dried out floodplain during the period of very hot and dry weather in July 2013, Cryptosporidium oocysts have been described to survive several months particularly but not exclusively in moist environments [7,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The sodden and only slowly drying lawns of the floodplain parks likely provided such conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Infection has been described to occur after ingesting only 10 – 30 oocysts [29,30] and the concentrations detected in the river water close to the river beach and other locations in Halle were comparably high [4,31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Decreasing case numbers coincide with the end of the summer holidays (23 August) and of the sunniest period which may underline the causative role of bathing in the river and/or ingestion via wet or muddy hands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>It is questionable if the late public advice to restrain from bathing (13 September, week 37) based on our findings had a strong influence on decreasing case numbers as the bathing weather ended at this time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>We need to consider that the participants were not asked what precisely they did in the floodplain (e.g. bathing, eating, playing) and our findings do not provide information on what the exact mechanism of transmission actually is. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Mason et al. report an outbreak caused by drinking water where &lt;1 oocyst per 100 litres (size of water samples in our investigation) were detected in the drinking water [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Therefore, despite lack of evidence for tap water involvement in from initial patient interviews, we included this hypothesis in the case–control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>However, the results provide no evidence for a causative role of tap water in this outbreak. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The Halle zoo was not overflowed by the flood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, one of its exits leads directly to recreational areas in the floodplains, so that visits to the zoo and to the floodplain can be could easily combined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>From the parasitological perspective, a causative role of the zoo would appear more likely if the relevant species here had not been C. hominis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>We did not find any evidence for food vehicles playing a role in this outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Swimming pools have been frequently indicted as sources of infection during outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis [33-35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Moreover, pool-to-pool transfer of oocysts by diarrhoeal swimmers has been described [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Whether the contaminated swimming pools in Halle were additional sources of infection remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In the case–control study among children, bathing in these pools was not associated with cryptosporidiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>However, pools may have played a role for transmission to adults in this outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Pool closures based on active sampling for oocysts and subsequent hygiene measures may have prevented additional gastroenteritis cases and shortened the outbreak. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Even in countries with high standards of sanitation, river flooding can cause epidemics of gastroenteritis, when sewage systems overflow and pollute and water ways used by humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Severe flooding events have become more frequent in recent years and their frequency will probably further increase in Germany and other European countries due to climate change and stream straightening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Extreme water events such as flooding have been shown to be causative for the transmission of a number of waterborne diseases [37,38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Also, the risk of gastrointestinal illness related to coastal and freshwater swimming was reported to be increased after heavy rainfall [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Evidence from this outbreak investigation suggests practical recommendations with regards to bathing within urban areas and preventive measures after river flooding: Particularly in urban areas, possible area and water contamination with persistent pathogens such as Cryptosporidium should also be considered and particularly open surface waters used for bathing should be tested also for parasites before re-opening to the public. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>River bathing sites should not be located near or closely downstream of potential sewage spillways, even if those are only operational on occasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>After flooding and during gastrointestinal outbreak situations of waterborne pathogens, sewage systems should be investigated for possible leakages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In addition, the efforts to keep persons with diarrhoea or with little children who show such symptoms from using public swimming pools should be enhanced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In outbreak situations, swimming pools should be regularly evaluated for evidence of parasite oocysts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found that physician ordering and laboratory routine testing schemes for Cryptosporidium are not very standardised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Thus validity of disease surveillance and outbreak detection based on laboratory detection is limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The molecular methods for detecting Cryptosporidium species and subtypes from environmental samples should be established in Germany. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>More research data on presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in open surface water after heavy rains and in normal situtations is needed to better understand relevance for health threats after similar events. </plain></SENT>
