</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) belongs to a family of genes which encode for lipoproteins that are likely involved in the transport and metabolism of lipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Unlike others in this gene family, APOL1 possesses a signal sequence that allows for it to be exported out of the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Once extracellular, APOL1 associates with HDL particles and may play a role in programmed cell death [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>While they confer protection against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, genetic variants in the APOL1 region of chromosome 22 have been identified as major determinants of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in African Americans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The two most common high-risk variants of APOL1, G1 and G2, are only seen among individuals of West African descent, with approximately 12% of African Americans having two high-risk variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these high-risk variants are virtually nonexistent among Asians, Europeans, and Hispanics [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have now shown that, compared to those with zero or one high-risk variant, the presence of two high-risk variants is associated with advanced kidney disease in the setting of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [3], hypertension-attributed nephropathy [5] and HIV-associated nephropathy [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>High-risk APOL1 is also associated with progression of established CKD, independent of diabetes status [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Less is known about the relation of APOL1 and early kidney damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown associations between having two 2 high-risk APOL1 variants and prevalent high ACR [8] and very high ACR [9] among populations with largely preserved eGFR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, importantly, not all African Americans with two high-risk variants develop incident [10] or progressive CKD [7], suggesting that a “second hit” may be required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This second hit may be environmental, including infectious factors (as in the case of HIV associated nephropathy), as well as factors related to socioeconomic status (SES) or comorbid disease burden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have found that adjustment for SES attenuates observed disparities in kidney-related outcomes between African Americans and whites, suggesting that factors related to low SES contribute to the excess risk of advanced CKD and ESRD seen among African Americans [11,12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Some studies have found that low SES correlates more strongly with CKD/ESRD among African Americans than whites, further supporting the notion of environmental contributions to racial disparities [13-15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>There are many possible mechanisms through which SES could contribute to these disparities, and several models have been proposed [11,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For example, limited availability of healthful foods in the neighborhoods of many low SES African Americans could lead to poor dietary patterns [17,18], which could ultimately affect CKD risk-- particularly given the growing body of evidence supporting that dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables could be kidney protective [19-21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in understanding genetic contributions to racial disparities in CKD, questions still remain, including the relation of genetic factors to the variation in GFR among populations largely free of established CKD [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the possible role of gene-environment interactions in determining early kidney disease among African Americans has not been well-explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether genetic factors, environmental factors (SES), or their interaction are associated with markers of renal dysfunction among persons without established CKD in an urban population of predominantly low income African Americans. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Few other studies have examined the association of APOL1 with milder forms of kidney disease and findings have varied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Foster, et al. [10] performed a prospective study examining a cohort of African Americans with no CKD at baseline and found an increased risk for eGFR &lt; 60 and progression to ESRD among those with the high-risk genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Friedman, et al. [8] found a 3-fold increased risk of eGFR &lt; 60 and microalbuminuria associated with high risk APOL1 among nondiabetic African Americans in a cross-sectional study; however, this association did not persist among persons with diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Freedman, et al. [9] examined these cross-sectional relationships in relatives of patients with non-diabetic ESRD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>They found a significant association between APOL1 and macroalbuminuria, but not with microalbuminuria or eGFR &lt; 60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In aggregate, these studies and ours suggest that high-risk APOL1 variants may be more strongly associated with advanced and progressive kidney disease than with early disease, arguing for a primary role of APOL1 as a progression rather than initiation factor in CKD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Recent advances have swung the pendulum of research and clinical thought regarding the etiology of racial disparities in kidney disease towards the role of genetic contributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The results of our study suggest that genetic factors may not fully explain these disparities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In this sample largely free of CKD, a large proportion of individuals with early kidney damage were among those without high-risk APOL1 variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Rather, diabetes and/or hypertension were prevalent among the majority of participants with early kidney damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the highly significant association between high-risk APOL1 and kidney disease among African Americans in multiple recent studies [3,4,7,10], it may not be the only contributor to early kidney disease in this population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Other factor(s), including those related to and influenced by SES, may be the primary initiators of CKD among African Americans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In our study, for example, we found that only about a third of individuals with elevated ACR had high-risk APOL1 variants, however, the overwhelming majority had hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early CKD identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, may offer the greatest opportunity for reducing CKD disparities among minority and low income populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Our finding of greater odds of eGFR &lt;75 among the lowest compared to the higher income group is consistent with prior studies implicating SES as a major predictor of early kidney disease among African Americans [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our analyses of other indicators of SES were generally consistent with the income analyses, except our finding of no association between access to care measures and eGFR &lt; 75. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Here, reverse causality was possible, as individuals in poor health (ie. with reduced kidney function and other chronic illnesses) may be more able to obtain public health insurance and may seek care more often than healthier persons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>There are multiple possible mechanisms through which low SES could lead to increased risk of kidney disease, most of which have yet to be thoroughly investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Aside from its potential impact on receipt of high quality health care, there are less obvious mechanisms, related to the social environment and psychosocial impact of low SES that may contribute as well [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Future studies are warranted elucidating pathways between low SES and kidney disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The limitations of our study should be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>First, its cross-sectional design disallows direct causal inferences regarding the associations examined, and thus, longitudinal studies of this kind are needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Second, despite our stratifying participants around an annual income of $14,000, our study population was largely comprised of low income individuals, which may have influenced our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Third, we lacked complete data on some variables included in our sensitivity analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Finally, our relatively low event rate for early kidney damage did not allow adjustment for multiple covariates, or more granular analyses of income levels; and unmeasured confounders, particularly of the association of income and early kidney disease, are likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Our power to detect statistically significant differences was limited in some of our models (Additional file 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>We included adjustment for a parsimonious set of variables despite the low event rate, and found that this did not substantially alter the point estimates of our univariate models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>While our findings can serve to generate hypotheses, larger studies more representative of all African Americans are warranted addressing these relationships among well-characterized populations with a greater range of kidney disease. </plain></SENT>
