</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Camellia oleifera Abel. is a shrub or small tree native to China (Mondal, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It has been cultivated in south-central and southern China for more than 2,000 years primarily for edible oil extracted from seeds (Wei et al., 2012; Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Commonly known as tea oil or camellia oil, it is comprised of 67.7–76.7% oleic acid, 82–84% unsaturated fatty acids, 68–77% monounsaturated fatty acids, and 7–14% polyunsaturated acid, which is similar to the composition of olive oil (Ma et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Additionally, tea oil has been used for a wide range of cosmetic and medicinal purposes (Lee and Yen, 2006; Cheng et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>There has been increasing demand for producing camellia oil in China (Wei et al., 2012; Liao et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpls-06-00189-g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The production of C. oleifera increased to more than 3.7 million hectares in China (Kong et al., 2013), however, the increased production area still did not meet the demand for tea oil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This is largely due to conventional cultivars having low oil yield ranging from 105 to 225 kg ha-1 (Zhuang, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To improve tea oil yield, the National Engineering and Technology Research Center of Camellia Oil at the Hunan Academy of Forestry in Changsha, Hunan, China initiated a breeding program focusing on germplasm evaluation and new cultivar development of C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 20 new cultivars have been developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Tea oil yield of the new cultivars ranged from 450 to 750 kg ha-1 (Zhuang, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Camellia oleifera is self-sterile, which is caused by prezygotic late-acting self-incompatibility (Liao et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, all cultivars are genetically highly heterozygous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Methods currently used for C. oleifera breeding include conventional hybridization and selection of individuals from progenies with high oil content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Because C. oleifera will neither flower and nor bear fruit in the first 4–5 years, full bloom and seed production occurs in 5–7 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As a result, breeding of C. oleifera is a long and time-consuming process, requiring 7–10 years to develop a new cultivar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>After multiple regional trials, new cultivars are propagated vegetatively through grafting or rooting of cuttings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The propagated plants require additional 2–4 years to reach the fruiting stage; therefore, there is a critical need for improving breeding efficiency of C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Marker-assisted selection is an indirect selection method in which a trait of interest is selected based not on the trait itself, but on a marker related to it (Collard and Mackill, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The assumption is that the marker used for trait selection associates at high frequency with the genes of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Due to the genetic linkage, marker-assisted selection is particularly useful for traits that are expressed late in development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Recently, a C. oleifera EST library was constructed (Tan et al., 2006), and microsatellite markers for the genus Camellia were also reported (Qiang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, there are still no morphological, cytological, or molecular markers related to oil yield in C. oleifera, and no any markers have been used for its breeding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (EC 4.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>1.39, Rubisco) should be an important biochemical marker as it can comprise up to 50% of the total soluble protein in plant leaves (Ellis, 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Rubisco is the key regulatory enzyme catalyzing CO2 fixation and ribulose diphosphate oxygenase reaction dual function, which determines net photosynthesis (Andersson and Backlund, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The holoenzyme of Rubisco is composed of eight small subunits (SSU, 14–15-kDa) encoded by a nuclear multigene family (rbcS), and eight large subunits (LSUs, 52-kDa) encoded by a single gene (rbcL) in the multicopy chloroplast genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>SSU precursors are processed during entry into the chloroplast and then assembled with the LSUs to yield the Rubisco holoenzyme (Ichikawa et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The rbcL gene is highly conserved, while rbcS is less conserved (Manzara and Gruissem, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Recent molecular phylogenetic analysis, however, revealed that positive selection in the rbcL gene of terrestrial land plants is quite a common phenomenon (Kapralov and Filatov, 2007; Galmes et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Since plant breeding is considered a man-made evolution (Jauhar, 2006; Ghai, 2009), we assumed that long-term selection of C. oleifera cultivars for high oil yield could lead to enrichment in the abundance of transcript of Rubisco genes for enhancing photosynthetic efficiency and increasing oil biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This is based on the notion that the reducing power, ATP, and a range of metabolites derived from photosynthesis support high rates of fatty acid synthesis (Rawsthorne, 2002; Bates et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Thus, Rubisco subunit genes could be molecular markers for improving breeding efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Rubisco rbcL and rbcS genes, however, have not been isolated from C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since Rubisco activity is directly related to photosynthesis, it is possible that net photosynthetic rate could be a physiological marker for detecting seed yield and increased oil production. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to (1) clone and identify rbcL and rbcS genes from C. oleifera; (2) analyze rbcL and rbcS expression in three cultivars that differed in seed and oil yields; (3) examine net photosynthetic rates of the three cultivars; and (4) determine if there were any relationships among rbcL and rbcS gene expressions, net photosynthetic rates, and oil yield. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The primary photosynthetic CO2 reduction reaction, the binding of CO2 to the acceptor-molecule ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, is catalyzed by the enzyme Rubisco (Andersson and Backlund, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Rubisco is the most abundant soluble protein in the plant leaf (Ellis, 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Increasing photosynthesis has been shown to increase crop yield (Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Raines, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Photosynthesis provides the source of carbon and the reducing power and ATP for de novo fatty acid synthesis, and increased carbons enhance the rate of fatty acid synthesis (Rawsthorne, 2002; Bates et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In the search for potential molecular markers that might help improve C. oleifera breeding efficiency for high oil yields, Rubisco genes could be a subject of interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The present study isolated Rubisco subunits rbcL and rbcS genes from C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>As illustrated in Figure 5, rbcL amino acid sequence of C. oleifera is 100 and 99% homologous to its relatives C. taliensis (Yang et al., 2013) and C. sinensis (GenBank accession number: YP_007317256), respectively and is more than 90% homologous to other higher plant species, which supports the conclusion that the rbcL gene is highly conserved (Manzara and Gruissem, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>In addition to the identified active sites and transcription processing site in the Co-rbcL, the Co-rbcL protein also included eight cysteine residues at positions of 84, 172, 192, 221, 247, 284, 427, and 459. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The Cys pairs 172 to 192 and 449 to 459 can create disulfide bridges within each LSU, while Cys 247 is thought to bridge between two adjacent subunits (Cohen et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Residue Asp473 was proposed to serve as a latch responsible for placing the large-subunit carboxy-terminus over loop 6 and stabilizing the closed conformation required for catalysis (Duff et al., 2000); however, it is not essential for catalysis but for CO2/O2 specificity (Satagopan and Spreitzer, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Lysine 334 is thought to play a specific role in stabilizing the transition state intermediates of both the carboxylation and oxygenation reactions, thereby facilitating the reaction of the enefiolate with the gaseous substrate (Parry et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of rbcS of C. oleifera is only slightly above 75% homologous to the other plant species (Figure 6), indicating that rbcS is less conserved than rbcL (Manzara and Gruissem, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Based on SOPMA prediction (Combet et al., 2000), the protein includes 22.16% of α helix, 24.43% of β sheet, 6.25% of β turn, and 47.16% of random coil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the Co-rbcS precursors appeared to be processed to mature protein during entry into the chloroplast, and the processing site was postulated to occur between residues Gln(Q)52 and Cys(C)53 using ChloroP 1.1 Prediction Server6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Three-year field studies showed that the highest seed yield was produced by the C. oleifera cultivar Xianglin 14 (Figure 2A), which also produced the highest amount of oil (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Hengchong 89 had the lowest seed yield and was also the lowest in oil production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Xianglin 1 had a similar seed yield as Hengchong 89; however, its oil yield was significantly greater than Hengchong 89, suggesting that long-term selection for oil yield may result in cultivars also differing in fatty acid biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Subsequent real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the level of Co-rbcL expression in Xianglin 14 was substantially higher than Xianglin 1; and Xianglin 1 was significantly greater than Hengchong 89 (Figure 7B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of rbcS in Xianglin 14 and Xianglin 1 were similar, but their expressions were much greater than Hengchong 89 (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Examining leaf photosynthesis showed that PN were significantly higher in Xianglin 14 than Xianglin 1; and Xianglin 1 was higher than Hengchong 89 (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Pearson’s correlation analysis demonstrated that Co-rbcL expression levels were significantly correlated with oil and dry seed yields at P &lt; 0.001 level as well as with fresh yield at P &lt; 0.01 level; while Co-rbcS expression was only correlated with oil yield at P &lt; 0.01 level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The PN was correlated with oil yields at P &lt; 0.001 level and dry seed yields at P &lt; 0.05 level (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Co-rbcL and Co-rbcS, particularly Co-rbcL, could potentially be molecular markers for early selection of higher oil producing cultivars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the selection should also take the net photosynthetic rate into consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The incorporation of Co-rbcL and Co-rbcS markers into breeding programs could allow early recognition of potential high oil production cultivars and could significantly shorten tea oil plant breeding time and increase breeding efficiency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The interest in the relationships of Rubisco activity, Rubisco proteins, and/or their mRNAs with crop yield dates back to the 1970s (Frey and Moss, 1976; Murthy and Singh, 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Some contradictory reports on the relationship of photosynthesis and crop yield in company with suggestions that the crop is a sink and not photosynthesis limited (Kuo et al., 1980; Loza-Tavera et al., 1990; Evans, 1998; Borras et al., 2004) have led to the view that improving photosynthesis is unlikely to increase crop yield (Borras et al., 2004; Sinclair et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Information regarding improving photosynthesis to enhance crop yield became limited, even though traditional breeders have been continuously working on the improvement of photosynthesis and other economically important traits for yield increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The reappraisal of the importance of photosynthesis for yield enhancement has been a more recent event (Long et al., 2006; Fischer and Edmeades, 2010; von Caemmerer and Evans, 2010), which is based on at least three lines of evidence: first, leaf photosynthesis increase resulted from CO2 enrichment generally leads to increased crop yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Second, C4 plants have greater rates of photosynthesis and produce more biomass per unit of intercepted sunlight than C3 plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Third, the introduction of dwarf genes into rice and wheat for effectively capturing light significantly increased the fraction of biomass in grain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Several recent publications have documented photosynthesis improvement in enhancing corn, rice, soybean, and wheat yields (Long et al., 2006; Fischer and Edmeades, 2010; Zhu et al., 2010; Parry et al., 2011; Ainsworth et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis also showed that positive selection in the rbcL gene of higher plants is common (Kapralov and Filatov, 2007), and Rubisco kinetics is quite variable among plant species (Flood et al., 2011; Galmes et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, two transplastomic tobacco lines with functional Rubisco from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus had higher rates of CO2 fixation per unit of enzyme than the control plant (Lin et al., 2014), suggesting that Rubisco activity and regulation should be targets for improving plant productivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>We consider our study as a part of the effort on the recognition of the importance of photosynthesis for yield improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The continuing and long-term selection of high seed and high oil yields in C. oleifera could lead to enrich the abundances of transcripts of Rubisco genes that enhance photosynthetic properties, photosynthetic efficiency or capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Since the foremost breeding goal has been selecting cultivars with high oil production, the selective action may also enhance fatty acid biosynthesis, thus improving crop oil yield (Long et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2010; Parry et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the fact that Rubisco determines photosynthetic efficiency, and photosynthesis is the source of carbon and reducing power and ATP for de novo fatty acid synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The present study may also suggest that genes related the biosynthesis of oil could be enriched by the selection (Zeng et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In addition to investigating mechanisms underlying the enhanced Co-rbcL and Co-rbcS expression, further studies are warranted to examine if some oil biosynthesis genes are also highly expressed in ‘Xianglin 14’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the identified Rubisco genes, particularly Co-rbcL could potentially be molecular markers for improving breeding efficiency in C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first report of Co-rbcL and Co-rbcS in C. oleifera, a tree species producing high-quality edible oil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Analyzing the gene expression and net photosynthetic rates of three cultivars differing in oil production showed that oil yields were highly correlated with the expression levels of Co-rbcS and Co-rbcL in particular as well as net photosynthetic rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Co-rbcL and Co-rbcS could potentially be molecular markers for early selection of high oil production cultivars of C. oleifera. </plain></SENT>
