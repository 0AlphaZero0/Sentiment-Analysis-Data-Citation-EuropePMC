</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Duckweed, a novel aquatic bioenergy crop, has attracted widespread attention in recent years [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Duckweed is the simplest and smallest flowering aquatic plant that not only has a longer growing period but also grows faster than most other plants including field crops [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The growth rate of duckweed can reach 12 g/m2/day dry weight [5], and its yield has been documented to reach 55 tons/hectare/year dry weight in warm regions [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Depending on the duckweed species and the growing conditions applied, the starch content of duckweed ranges from 3% to 75% [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Duckweed also displays a significant ability to remove nutrients from sewage and has been applied for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its high starch accumulation and low lignin content are characteristics that are useful for bioethanol production [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Duckweed has been successfully converted to ethanol [11-13] and butanol [14] in recent years, indicating that it would be a good candidate feedstock for bioenergy production. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The use of plant growth regulators is a common and efficient method to manipulate plant growth and yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Reports have shown that ‘Atlantic’ potato yields increase 15% after the application of a mixture of gibberellic acid, indole-butyric acid, and kinetin [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The foliar treatment of soybean plants with uniconazole increased the total biomass and seed yield by 8% and 18%, respectively, compared to the control [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, we used plant growth regulator to improve the starch and biomass yield of duckweed for bioethanol utilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We systematically screened more than 20 types of plant growth regulators, including auxins, cytokinins (CKs), abscisic acid (ABA), and gibberellins (GAs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>One of the main findings of the screening was that uniconazole could simultaneously increase starch and biomass accumulation of duckweed under eutrophic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Uniconazole, a plant growth retardant, has been extensively applied in plants to increase tolerance and improve quality [17-19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has potential advantages and various functions, including enhancing plant dry weight [20,21], increasing carotenoid and chlorophyll content in wheat and cucumber [22,23], and regulating endogenous hormones levels [24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms by which uniconazole regulates endogenous hormone and chlorophyll content is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology [26,27] is significant for the study of non-model plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of large-scale, high-throughput gene expression studies, as well as the sequencing of entire transcriptomes and genomes, are being conducted in some plants due to the advent of NGS technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It is difficult to research metabolic pathways in non-model plants using conventional biological techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, NGS technologies can detect millions of transcripts and can be used for the study of metabolic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These techniques have been applied to investigations in some non-model plants [28,29], especially for successful study using transcriptome analysis to analyze metabolic pathways in duckweed [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the chlorophyll and endogenous hormone biosynthetic pathways using NGS technology combined with biochemical assays and net photosynthetic rates to understand the process of biomass and starch accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This analysis provides a large amount of information for further development of duckweed as a bioenergy crop. </plain></SENT>
