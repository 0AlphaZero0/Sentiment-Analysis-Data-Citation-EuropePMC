</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Approximately 70% of all newly diagnosed patients present with local advanced or metastatic disease and require systemic chemotherapy.1 Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are typically treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the development of novel targeted therapies, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor due to drug resistance and tumor recurrence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Understanding the critical molecular mechanisms underlying the development of chemoresistance in NSCLC is an important issue for developing novel and effective therapeutic strategies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a family of short endogenous noncoding RNAs, play critical roles in cell growth, differentiation, and the development of various solid and hematological malignancies.2 Recently, miRNAs have emerged in NSCLC as both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.3 These findings suggest that miRNAs are a promising technology for the development of therapeutic targets for lung cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, there is little evidence of miRNA-mediated signaling networks that regulate cancer progression and drug resistance in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Currently, the launch of an antiprogrammed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody represented a significant breakthrough for patients with advanced solid tumors.4 Strikingly, blockade of PD-L1 induced durable tumor regression and prolonged disease stabilization in patients with advanced NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This successful immunotherapeutic strategy is a next-generation approach to the treatment of PD-L1-positive NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although many studies have focused on the relationship between PD-L1 and immune escape, there are limited data on constitutive upstream signaling pathways of PD-L1, independent of immunoinhibitory activities in the NSCLC microenvironment.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Here, we show the biological and clinical function of PD-L1 expression in chemoresistant NSCLC through the miRNA regulatory cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We identify a miR-197, a NSCLC prognostic marker, has a pivotal role in platinum-based chemotherapy resistance by analyzing clinical specimens of NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further investigations show that PD-L1 can serve as a putative biomarker of the miR-197/CKS1B/STAT3-mediated pathway in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical significance of the miR-197/PD-L1 network in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To identify miRNAs that regulate chemoresistance, we conducted a high-throughput miRNA microarray on a cohort study of primary NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues (Figure 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients who received four or more courses of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy after postoperative recurrence were divided into two groups (responder (n = 17) and nonresponder group (n = 12)) (Supplementary Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>After analysis of variance of miRNA microarray signal expression from the tumor and adjacent normal tissues of the two groups, 17 miRNAs (6 upregulated miRNAs and 11 downregulated miRNAs in nonresponder's tumors) exhibited significant expression changes (Supplementary Figure S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Next, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) validation of tumor samples from the two groups (Supplementary Figure S1a) showed that five miRNAs (miR-197, miR-181c, miR-21, miR-210, and miR-1260) exhibited significant expression changes (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure S1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of the expression of these miRNAs in lung cancer prognosis, we first examined their clinical relevance to patient survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we identified miR-197 and miR-1260 expression as favorable lung cancer prognostic markers for overall survival (Supplementary Figure S1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>From the differentially regulated putative miRNA prognostic biomarkers, we focused on the tumor suppressor miRNAâmiR-197. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We validated this finding using qRT-PCR for miR-197 in the lung tumors and adjacent normal tissues of the cohort study (Figure 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>An analysis of miR-197 expression levels in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines revealed that miR-197 was significantly suppressed in lung cancer cell lines compared with a normal bronchial cell line, BEAS-2B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed that the expression of miR-197 in drug-resistant cell line PC14/cisplatin (CDDP) was lower than that in the parental lung cancer cell line PC14 (Figure 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In agreement with the qRT-PCR analysis, in situ hybridization with a miR-197-locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe revealed reduced miR-197 expression in the sample of nonresponders compared with responder samples (Figure 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that miR-197 might functionally regulate the therapeutic response in addition to its association with treatment benefits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we focused on the role of miR-197 in regulating chemoresistance in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To determine whether miR-197 plays a role in lung cancer progression and chemoresistance, we transiently transfected LNA-miR-197 or pre-miR-197 into four independent lung cancer cell lines-A549, PC9, PC14, and PC14CDDP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the knockdown of miR-197 induced significant resistance to CDDP and paclitaxel (TXL) in the four independent lung cancer cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-197 sensitized the drug response of these compounds in vitro (Figure 1f). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Stable knockdown of miR-197 promotes malignancy in vitro </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Having demonstrated the suppression of miR-197 expression in NSCLC, we sought to evaluate the other roles of the miRNA in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We constructed a Tough Decoy (TuD) vector expressing a miR-197-TuD strategy for A549 and PC14 cells, which has previously been used for miRNA blockade,6 to stably suppress miR-197 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We also established PC14CDDP cells with cytomegalovirus promoter-mediated overexpression of miR-197 (PC14CDDP-miR-197). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In miR-197 sensor assays, to confirm stable miRNA expression, we observed that the luciferase activity of A549-miR-197-TuD and PC14-miR-197-TuD cells was significantly increased compared with each negative control cell line and mutated sensor vector, indicating that miR-197 expression in these cell lines was functionally repressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The activity of PC14CDDP-miR-197 cells was significantly reduced, indicating that miR-197 expression of the cells was functionally activated (Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Next, we evaluated the effects of miR-197 on cell growth, cell invasion, cell migration, and spheroid initiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation analysis suggested that decreased or increased miR-197 levels did not affect cancer cell growth (Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Conversely, miR-197 loss of function enhanced the invasion and migration rates of A549 and PC14 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>PC14CDDP cells stably overexpressing miR-197 exhibited suppressed invasion and migration rates compared with that of controls (Figure 2c,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated A549-miR-197-TuD, PC14-miR-197-TuD, and PC14CDDP-miR-197 cells for their ability to form tumor spheres. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A549-miR-197-TuD and PC14-miR-197-TuD generated two to threefold more spheres than the corresponding control cells, and the spheroid initiation of PC14CDDP-miR-197 cells was repressed compared with that of control cells (Supplementary Figure S2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>PC14-miR-197-TuD cells expressed high levels of various lung cancer initiation-related genes, particularly ABC transporter genes; in contrast, PC14CDDP-miR-197 cells repressed the expression of these genes compared with that in control cells (Supplementary Figure S2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results of all of these experiments suggested that miR-197 could regulate not only drug resistance but also malignant phenotypes in lung cancer cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>To validate the role of miR-197 as a regulator of lung cancer progression in vivo, we examined the effects of PC14-miR-197-TuD on tumorigenicity and chemoresistance using lung cancer xenograft models established by direct intrathoracic injection (left lung) into scid mice.7 To facilitate the monitoring of miRNA knockdown cells in vivo, we cloned PC14-miR-197-TuD or PC14-TuD-NC cells that were stably transfected with pLuc-Neo plasmid DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Based on bioluminescence imaging, PC14-miR-197-TuD-luc cells enhanced tumorigenic ability 28 days after implantation compared with that in negative control cell-transplanted mice (Figure 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Notably, mice-bearing PC14-miR-197-TuD-luc tumors exhibited prominent pulmonary metastases, whereas few visible metastases were observed in mice transplanted with control PC14-TuD-NC-luc cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Histological analyses revealed that knockdown of miR-197 could promote pulmonary metastasis of this lung cancer cell line (Figure 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the weight of the lungs was significantly increased in the miR-197-attenuated group (Figure 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Next, to explore whether the downregulation of miR-197 affected the chemoresistance of PC14 cells to CDDP in vivo, tumors were initiated in scid mice, followed by the intraperitoneal injection of 3âmg/kg CDDP once a week for 3 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight days after implantation, the tumors formed from PC14-miR-197-TuD-luc (n = 10) mice were significantly increased compared with those from mice-bearing PC14-TuD-NC-luc tumors (n = 10) on bioluminescence imaging (Figure 3d,e; P = 0.016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, mice-bearing PC14-miR-197-TuD-luc tumors exhibited poor survival (Figure 3h; P = 0.036). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicate that miR-197 plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and chemoresistance in vivo. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>miRNAs regulate gene expression by repressing translation or promoting the degradation of their target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>To strategically identify direct miR-197 target genes, we first performed messenger RNA (mRNA) microarray analyses of A549, PC14, and PC14CDDP cells that were transiently transfected with either pre-miR-197 or LNA-miR-197 and their controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We observed that 1,037 predicted target genes exhibited altered expression levels consistently across the three different lung cancer cell lines (fold change â¥1.2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Next, we selected 18 highly predicted target genes using the computational algorithm TargetScan (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org">http://www.targetscan.org</ext-link>) that were significantly regulated by miR-197 (average fold change of three cell lines â¥2) (Supplementary Figure S3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Through qRT-PCR validation of 36 highly predicted target genes (Supplementary Figure S3b), we identified five candidates: catenin delta-1 (CTNND1), ER lipid raft associated 2 (ERLIN2), CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B), centrosomal protein of 55âkDa (CEP55), and PD-L1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The 3â² untranslated regions (UTRs) of these genes were conjugated with luciferase for reporter assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>PD-L1 is one of the genes significantly regulated by miR-197 that does not possess the predicted binding sites in the 3â² UTR of the in silico database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the 3â² UTR of CTNND1, ERLIN2, CKS1B, and CEP55 mRNA harbored sequences complementary to the miR-197 seed sequence (Supplementary Figure S4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To verify whether CTNND1, ERLIN2, CKS1B, CEP55, and PD-L1 are direct targets of miR-197, we cloned each 3â² UTR into the vector downstream of luciferase open reading frame. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In addition, to validate target specificity, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis of the 3â² UTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>When we cotransfected A549 cells with each of the five cloned UTRs and pre-miR-197, we observed a consistent reduction in the luciferase activity of the 3â² UTR of CTNND1, ERLIN2, CKS1B, and CEP55, but not PD-L1 (Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>By contrast, cotransfection of pre-miR-197 with the mutated forms of the 3â² UTRs resulted in no significant change in luciferase activity (Supplementary Figure S4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Among these direct target genes, only CKS1B was reported to regulate cell motility, chemoresistance, and cancer progression.8,9,10 We hypothesized that CKS1B is an important target of miR-197 through its effects on chemoresistance in lung cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To address this hypothesis, we performed experimental validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of CKS1B expression by pre-miR-197 was confirmed, and the transient transfection of LNA-miR-197 significantly increased CKS1B expression in three lung cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR (Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To explore whether the biological functions of miR-197 were indeed attributable to the direct targeting of CKS1B signaling, we conducted small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based silencing of CKS1B and assessed cells for cell proliferation, chemoresistance, invasion, and migration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we observed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CKS1B resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and sensitized the response of three lung cancer cell lines to CDDP and TXL (Figure 4câf). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the major function of the miR-197/CKS1B axis in NSCLC is the regulation of lung cancer progression and chemoresistance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Based on the analysis of the mRNA microarray, we observed that in lung cancer cells, miR-197 regulated the expression of PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1), a member of the B7 family of costimulatory/coinhibitory ligands expressed in various tissues (Supplementary Figure S3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Because of the 3â² UTR assay, we hypothesized that miR-197 might indirectly target PD-L1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored the regulatory link between miR-197 and PD-L1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Previously, a constitutive oncogenic pathway has been reported to drive PD-L1 expression through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in lymphoma cells.11 In addition, STAT3 signaling is known to be a downstream target of CKS1B activation in multiple myeloma cells.9 We hypothesized that CKS1B regulates PD-L1 expression by activating STAT3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the effect of modulating CKS1B on PD-L1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Consequently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CKS1B inhibited phosphorylated (p)-STAT3 (Tyr705) and PD-L1 protein expression with no remarkable effect on STAT3 in western blots (Supplementary Figure S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PD-L1 is an important downstream target of CKS1B activated by STAT3 in the miR-197 signaling cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>To close the link between STAT3 and the induction of PD-L1 expression, we used PD-L1 reporter constructs containing promoter regions to determine the ability of STAT3 to bind to the PD-L1 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The PD-L1 5â² sequence (â319âbp upstream to +56âbp downstream) includes a potential STAT3 binding site (TTCN2-4GAA)12 (Figure 4g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The cotransfection of STAT3-siRNA and PD-L1 promoter vector resulted in a 0.66 (Â±0.1)-fold reduction in PD-L1 promoter-driven luciferase expression compared with control siRNA. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that a novel signaling pathway, the miR-197/CKS1B/STAT3 axis, has the ability to promote cancer progression in chemoresistant NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Previous evidence has indicated that miR-197 is dysregulated in lung cancer,13 thyroid cancer,14 tongue cancer,15 and pancreatic cancer,16 strongly suggesting a general function of miR-197 in different types of tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other researchers have reported that the downregulation of miR-197 has the potential to contribute to multidrug resistance in colon cancer cells17 and head and neck cancer cells,18 implying that miR-197 plays an essential role in regulating several signaling pathways, including tumor progression and chemoresistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that miR-197 regulates lung cancer drug resistance and tumor progression by directly targeting the cyclin-dependent kinase CKS1B as well as by indirectly targeting the transcription factor STAT3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Notably, we discovered that the CKS1B/STAT3 axis is the most powerful signaling pathway regulated by miR-197 because of the activation of various oncogenic target genes, including Bcl-2, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that STAT3 signaling has an important role in tumor initiation in various types of cancers.19 Therefore, phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by miR-197/CKS1B signaling may also promote cancer stem cell phenotypes in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrated that the miR-197/CKS1B/STAT3-mediated signaling drives tumor PD-L1 expression, allowing it to function as a biomarker for this cascade in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>PD-L1 is a T-cell coinhibitory molecule expressed in various types of cancers that leads to the immune escape of tumor cells.5 Indeed, previous reports have suggested that PD-L1 protein expression might be associated with worse prognoses in NSCLC.20 Recent strategies targeting the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), have demonstrated tremendous efficacy in early phase clinical trials enrolling NSCLC patients.4 Although many studies have focused on the relationship between PD-L1 and immune escape, there are limited data on the prevalence and prognostic role of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been demonstrated that PD-L1 expression is driven by constitutive oncogenic signaling pathways in some tumors, such as glioblastomas.21 However, it is unclear whether a specific upstream signaling pathway of PD-L1 independent of immunoinhibitory signals in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that PD-L1-targeted therapy might be a reasonable therapeutic strategy for NSCLC because PD-L1 is regulated by the miR-197/CKS1B/STAT3-mediated signaling cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed a significant correlation between miR-197 and PD-L1 expression in a validated cohort study (n = 177, P = 0.026). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Presently, the evaluation of PD-L1 positivity by conventional immunohistochemistry is not well defined.22 Therefore, the correlation between miR-197 and PD-L1 also suggests that miR-197 expression can act as a surrogate biomarker of PD-L1 in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our finding that miR-197 can regulate chemoresistance, our results further suggested that PD-L1 is a biomarker of the miR-197/CKS1B/STAT3-mediated cascade in NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Although it has been recently reported that PD-L1 expression is enhanced after cytotoxic drug treatment in breast cancer23 and melanoma cells,24 the mechanisms of biological interaction between PD-L1 and chemoresistance are unclear. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the glutathione S-transferases Mu (GSTM) gene clusters are also located in this region.27 GSTs play an important role in cellular defense because they are involved in the detoxification of many carcinogens from smoking and facilitate their excretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>A reported 38 and 67% of Caucasians carry a deletion in both alleles of the glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) gene, resulting in the total absence of GSTM1 enzyme activity; the GSTM1 null genotype confers an increased risk of lung cancer.28,29 To date, we have considered that genetic changes such as gene deletions and loss of heterozygosity in this region might induce smoking-induced lung cancer development and downregulation of miR-197. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In addition to transcriptional regulation, other mechanisms could contribute to deregulated miRNA expression, including chromatin deletions/amplifications, translocations, DNA methylation, promoter silencing, and deficient posttranscriptional processing. </plain></SENT>
