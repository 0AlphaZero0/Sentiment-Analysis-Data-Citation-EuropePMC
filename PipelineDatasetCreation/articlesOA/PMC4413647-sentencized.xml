</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Androgen receptor (AR), a ligand dependent transcription factor plays pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous male malignancy [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While majority of prostate cancers are initially androgen dependent and respond to androgen ablation therapy, most patients eventually recur with more aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR signaling is reactivated even in the absence of androgen stimulation [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Besides AR signaling, hyper-activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the mRNA 5′ cap-binding protein of cap dependent translation promotes exquisite transcript-specific translation of key mRNAs that are indispensable in PCa initiation, progression and metastases [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is dependent on serine 209 phosphorylation by MAPK-interacting kinases 1/2 (MNK1/2) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of MNK and hyper-activation of eIF4E are common in hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate tumors and correlates with poor clinical outcome [6-10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the molecular networks in androgen dependent and independent PCa has revealed direct targeting of the translational machinery, precisely eIF4E to be beneficial in the treatment of CRPC [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus, a strong rationale exists for identifying new drugs that can simultaneously target both AR and eIF4E for treating advanced PCa. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBA), a family of compounds that inhibit the P450 enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) exert potent anticancer and growth inhibitory effects in human breast/prostate cancer cells and xenograft models [12-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Series of RAMBA related compounds referred to as “Novel Retinamides” (NRs) which are novel structural analogues of ATRA and 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) have been designed and synthesized in our laboratory [12-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that these NRs inhibit the growth of triple negative, estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α) and Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by blocking MNK initiated eIF4E activation [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we explored the effect of NRs to simultaneously target AR signaling and MNK activated eIF4E translation initiation in androgen sensitive and CRPC cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our data reveal that NRs are capable of inhibiting the growth and progression of PCa by directly targeting both AR signaling and eIF4E translational machinery via enhancing AR and MNK degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which in turn led to inhibition of downstream events that promote cell growth, proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis evasion, invasion and metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Our findings establish for the first time that agents such as NRs, which simultaneously inhibit activation of both AR and eIF4E to suppress growth and progression in genetically diverse PCa cells at pharmacologically feasible concentration, are novel therapeutics for treatment of both androgen-sensitive and castration resistant PCa. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of NRs on PCa cell growth, androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3, C4-2B) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells were treated with NRs (VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -146, -147, -148, -152, -153), VN/14-1, ATRA, 4-HPR, Casodex, Abiraterone acetate (AA) (Zytiga) and MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) (Figure 1) and assessed for cell viability by MTT assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We found that NRs, particularly VNLG-145, -147, -152 and -153 inhibited the growth of PCa cells with a GI50 value 1.5 - 5.5 μmol/L (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The growth inhibitory potential of these NRs were more potent than that observed for VN/66-1, our previously established lead RAMBA; VN/14-1, the parent RAMBA from which the new NR series (VNLG-145, -146, -147, -148, -152, -153) were derived; clinically relevant retinoids (ATRA and 4-HPR) and almost comparable to that of the FDA approved PCa drugs (Casodex, AA, MDV3100). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicated that the growth inhibitory effect of NRs in PCa cells was significantly much higher (12-30 fold) compared to that in immortalized untransformed prostate cells signifying that NRs are differentially sensitive towards untransformed and malignant prostate cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The other NRs (VNLG-146 and -148) did not display any notable growth inhibitory effect or differential sensitivity (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the effect of NRs on colony forming ability of PCa cells, indicated that lead NRs in addition to inhibiting cell viability were also able to inhibit PCa colony formation (Figure 2A and B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We next evaluated the growth inhibitory potential of NRs, specifically VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -147, -152, -153 that showed promising growth and colonization inhibitory potential in prostate cancer cells in comparison with casodex, AA and MDV3100 in LNCaP cells that were resistant to MDV3100 treatment (MR49F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed that NRs significantly inhibited the growth of these resistant cells with a GI50 value ≅ 3.5 – 7.5 μmol/L, which was several times more potent than that observed for the FDA approved drugs Casodex or AA (GI50: 43.65 and 27.54 μmol/L respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We also note that Enzalutamide had no significant effect up to a concentration of 100 μmol/L (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Since the importance of AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation in PCa development and progression has been reported, several strategies to target the respective signaling pathways have been developed [3,20,24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>However, simultaneous targeting of AR signaling and MNK facilitated eIF4E activation- the major signaling pathways involved in PCa development, progression, and transition from androgen dependence to androgen resistant form, to develop proof-of-concept small molecule inhibitors as potential PCa therapeutics has not yet been shown [9,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that our proprietary novel retinamides can simultaneously inhibit both AR signaling and MNK facilitated eIF4E translation initiation and impede growth and progression of in androgen dependent (LNCaP) and castration resistant (C4-2B, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, NRs also block AR expression, activity and cell growth in cells that are resistant to enzalutamide treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Our data collectively suggest that NRs may be promising novel therapeutics for patients with advanced prostate cancer and those resistant to enzalutamide treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Androgen-AR signaling has a critical role in prostate cancer development and progression in part through transcriptional regulation of AR responsive genes [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies have validated that AR splice variants, especially the most dominant variant AR3 which lacks a portion of ligand binding domain contributes to the transition of prostate cancer from androgen dependent to castration resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>While constitutively active AR3 might itself facilitate PCa cell growth and progression, it may even depend on full-length AR to execute AR transcriptional activity and cell growth effects [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In the present study, NRs treatment downregulated the expression of full-length AR (in LNCaP, C4-2B and 22Rv1); splice variant AR3 (in 22Rv1); and the AR responsive protein, PSA in genetically diverse PCa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NRs also dramatically reduced DHT induced AR transcriptional activation in LNCaP and MR49F, the enzalutamide resistant LNCaP cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In mechanistic studies identifying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR down-regulation in LNCaP cells, treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor did not have any effect on VNLG-152 induced AR down-regulation, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 largely restored VNLG-152 induced AR decrease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, CHIP or MDM2 individually or in combination abrogated VNLG-152 mediated fAR degradation, suggesting that NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR down-regulation in LNCaP cells involved degradation of the active AR protein via proteasomal degradation through the activation of E3 ubiquitin ligases CHIP and MDM2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Our finding that AR is degraded through CHIP is consistent with the degradation of nuclear receptors where ubiquitination has been demonstrated to signal receptor degradation [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Involvement of MDM2 in promoting AR ubiquitination and degradation has also been reported in a number of studies [27-29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Lin et al. demonstrated that AR ubiquitination is impaired in MDM2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to MDM2-intact MEFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Although our work confirms a role for MDM2 and CHIP in degrading AR, the primary E3 ligase responsible for degrading AR in response to VNLG-152 and the molecular mechanisms underlying their preference are not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In addition to AR signaling, the role of MNK mediated cap dependent translation in PCa development and progression has been established in recent years [24,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Initiation of cap dependent translation primarily involves the assembly of eIF4F initiation complex comprising of eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A on the 5′ cap of mRNA [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Of all the members of the translation initiation complex, eIF4E expression and activity is considered crucial as this is the only protein that binds directly to the mRNA cap structure [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Indeed, overexpression of eIF4E alone has been shown to contribute directly to cellular transformation [4,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The transforming properties of eIF4E have been linked to its ability to promote translation of genes involved in proliferation and survival including that of c-Myc, cyclin D1, growth factors (fibroblast growth factor 2, FGF2 and vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and Mcl-1 [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is sternly dependent on phosphorylation at serine 209 residue by MNK1/2 which increase the affinity of eIF4E for 5′ cap of mRNA.4 Both MNK and p-eIF4E are found to be up-regulated in various cancers [19,32-34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Bianchini et al. demonstrated that eIF4E phosphorylation by MNKs supports protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and proliferation in prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Furthermore combined deficiency of MNK1 and 2 has been demonstrated to delay tumour development [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In the present study, NRs treatment dramatically reduced the expression of MNK1, MNK2, and peIF4Eser209 without affecting total eIF4E expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and clinically relevant retinoids-ATRA and 4-HPR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs, the critical activators of eIF4E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Degradation of MNKs by VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to 5′ mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation initiation [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The results of the present work are consistent with the earlier report by Ramalingam et al. who demonstrated that NRs induce MNK degradation and block eIF4E phosphorylation in triple negative and Her2-overexpressing breast cancers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Constitutive AR signaling and/or eIF4E mediated translation initiation favors translation of key genes involved in oncogenesis [4,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Abrogation of both these pathways may block translation of sub-set of genes indispensable for maintaining growth and survival in PCa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the functional consequence of AR and MNK knockdown on LNCaP cell proliferation provides proof-of-principle for the importance of AR and MNK mediated signaling in upholding growth and survival of PCa cells, and also authenticates that AR and MNK are the prime target of NR (VNLG-152) for mediating growth inhibitory effects in PCa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The biological significance of NRs mediated dual inhibition of AR and MNK mediated signaling pathways is further indicated by enhanced cell death and inhibition of cell growth, cell colonization, migration and invasion in PCa cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Several studies in the past have elicited a direct role of AR and eIF4E translation initiation in regulating cell cycle progression [19,23,36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Blocking of AR expression has been demonstrated to induce strong cell cycle arrest [37,38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Results from the present study also show that NRs induce cell cycle arrest at G1/S (VNLG-152) or G2/M (VNLG-145, -147, -153) phase with accompanied decrease in the expression of cyclin B and cyclin D1 that are associated with G1/S and M phase cell cycle transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Besides inducing cell cycle arrest, NRs treatment also induced caspase dependent apoptosis in PCa cells through increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that synchronized dual inhibition of AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation by NRs in PCa cells results in blockade of cell cycle progression and induction of caspase dependent apoptosis which is in line with the earlier reports that demonstrate that targeting AR or MNK in PCa cells results in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (19,37,38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In the highly metastatic PC-3 cells which are also AR negative, NRs treatment also impaired cell migration and invasion, the late stage events essential for tumour metastasis [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>The anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects of NRs were associated with reappearance of E-cadherin and down-regulation in the levels of N-cadherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Earlier, Graff et al. [40] demonstrated that cells with reduced levels of eIF4E had reduced invasiveness and experimental metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Li et al. [41] showed that knockdown of eIF4E significantly inhibited invasion of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>These reports suggest that elevated eIF4E expression is a positive regulator of invasion, and that NRs inhibit migration and invasion, the late stage carcinogenic events in the AR negative PC-3 cells by impeding MNK dependent eIF4E translation initiation that is chiefly responsible for translation of various key genes associated with invasion and metastasis [4,30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study identiﬁes for the first time novel retinamides that can simultaneously inhibit both AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation in prostate cancer cells (Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Most intriguingly, our proprietary NRs were able to block AR activation and cell growth in PCa cells resistant to Enzalutamide treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>NRs also displayed inhibitory and anti-cancer effects in PCa cells in order far more potent than FDA approved PCa drugs, established MNK inhibitors and clinically relevant retinoids, with nominal effects on immortalized untransformed prostate cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results suggest that novel retinamides that function as dual inhibitors of AR and MNK signaling in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa have great potential as novel therapeutics for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. </plain></SENT>
