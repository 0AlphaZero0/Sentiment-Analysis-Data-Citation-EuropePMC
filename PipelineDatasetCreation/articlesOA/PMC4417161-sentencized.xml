</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotes have three essential nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases, abbreviated as Pols I, II and III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pol I functions in the nucleolus, transcribing repeated 45S ribosomal RNA genes whose precursor transcripts are then processed into the 18S, 5.8S and 25–28S RNAs of ribosomes (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pol II transcribes thousands of protein-coding genes and thousands of noncoding RNAs with diverse functions (4,5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pol III transcribes tRNAs, 5S ribosomal RNA, a subset of retrotransposons, and multiple regulatory RNAs (6–8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In plants, two additional multisubunit RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, evolved as specialized forms of Pol II (9), generating noncoding RNAs that guide cytosine methylation and transcriptional silencing of transposons, repetitive elements and a subset of genes (10–12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Pols I, II and III have been studied in greatest biochemical detail in yeast, which includes structural analyses using X-ray crystallography and/or cryo-electron microscopy (13–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Yeast Pol I has 14 subunits, Pol II has 12 subunits and Pol III has 17 subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Available evidence indicates that Pol I and Pol III subunit compositions, as determined in yeast, are highly conserved in eukaryotes as diverse as mice, humans and trypanosomes (17–21), although complete subunit compositions have not been determined in most cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Plant Pols IV and V have 12 subunits like Pol II, from which they evolved (9,22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Within the five multisubunit RNA polymerases of eukaryotes, or within the sole RNA polymerase of archaea, are homologs of the ß′, ß, α and ω subunits that comprise bacterial RNA polymerase (23–25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The two largest subunits of Pols I through V are homologs of ß′ and ß; these interact to form the catalytic center for RNA synthesis (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic homologs of the two bacterial α subunits are Rpb3 and Rpb11, in the case of Pols II, IV and V or AC40 and AC19, in the case of Pols I and III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>AC40 and AC19 are named by virtue of their approximate masses in budding yeast (∼40 and ∼19 kDa, respectively) and their polymerase affiliations, using nomenclature introduced by Chambonet al. (27), with polymerases A, B and C being equivalent to Pols I, II and III (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In humans, the POLR1C and POLR1D genes encode orthologs of yeast AC40 and AC19, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Mutations in either of these genes can cause the craniofacial disorder, Treacher-Collins Syndrome (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The eukaryotic homolog of the bacterial ω subunit is Rpb6, a subunit that is common to Pols I, II, III (30,31) as well as Pols IV and V in plants (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Rpb6 is named according to a different nomenclature system in which budding yeast Pol II subunits are named in order of size, from largest to smallest; thus, Rpb6 is the sixth-largest subunit of Pol II (in yeast; not necessarily in other eukaryotes). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>All five eukaryotic nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases have a core set of 12 subunits that share homology with proteins in Archaea, indicative of a common ancestry (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Among these are five subunits that are common to Pols I, II and III and are encoded by the same genes: Rpb5, Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10 and Rpb12; by convention, the Pol II-specific Rpb(n) names are generally used for these common subunits (30,32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The common use of Rpb6, Rpb8, Rpb10 and Rpb12 by eukaryotic RNA polymerases extends to Pols IV and V in plants (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, this is not the case for Rpb5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter referred to as Arabidopsis), Pol IV makes use of the same Rpb5 protein as Pols I, II and III, but a different gene, NRPE5 encodes the subunit used primarily by Pol V (9,33,34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In plants, the prefix NRP denotes ‘nuclear RNA polymerase’, with E, as the fifth letter of the alphabet, denoting Pol V, by extension of Chambon and colleagues’ Pol A, B, C naming system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In maize, the ortholog of Arabidopsis NRPE5 is used by both Pols IV and V and is thus named NRP(D/E)5, whereas two distinct NRPB5 subunit variants (NRPB5a or NRPB5b) are used by Pol II (22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Subunits that are homologous, but not identical, among eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases include the A12.2, Rpb9 and C11 subunits of yeast Pols I, II and III, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A12.2 is named in yeast to reflect Pol I-specificity and mass in kilodaltons, Rpb9 is named according to Pol II-specificity and subunit order, and C11 is named according to Pol III-specificity and mass in kilodaltons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These subunits are important for enzyme accuracy and processivity, possessing RNA cleavage activities that allow for removal of misincorporated nucleotides or rescue from stalling via polymerase backtracking (35–38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the case of Pol II, the RNA cleavage activity of Rpb9 is tuned by transcription factor TFIIS, which shares sequence and structural similarity with Rpb9 (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, two genes encode Rpb9 orthologs, and either variant can assemble into Pols II, IV or V (9,39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, despite being 92% identical in amino acid sequence, genetic evidence indicates that the alternative ninth subunits, or their genes, are not redundant in the context of Pols II or V (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, maize Pols IV and V make use of a unique ninth subunit, NRP(D/E)9 that is distinct from two NRPB9 variants used by Pol II (22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In yeast Pols I, II or III, orthologous sub-complexes are formed by A14–A43, Rpb4–Rpb7 and C17–C25 heterodimers, respectively (13–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These stalk-like sub-complexes protrude from the main bodies of the enzymes adjacent to the RNA exit channels (41,42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis and maize, the Pol II NRPB4–NRPB7 sub-complex is paralogous to, but distinct from, the corresponding sub-complexes of Pols IV and V (9,22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This stems, in part, from the fact that the 4th subunit of Pols IV and V, NRP(D/E)4 differs from the NRPB4 subunit of Pol II, in both Arabidopsis and maize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in Arabidopsis, gene duplication and sub-functionalization gave rise to distinct NRPB7, NRPD7 and NRPE7 genes used by Pols II, IV and Pol V, respectively (9,43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in maize, the seventh subunits of Pols IV and V are encoded by the same gene, NRP(D/E)7, which is distinct from the Pol II NRPB7 gene (22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The preceding discussion illustrates the fact that RNA polymerase subunit gene duplications have given rise to unprecedented polymerase diversity in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This includes the emergence of Pol IV and Pol V, whose subunit compositions vary in different plant lineages and whose functional diversification is ongoing (9,22,40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Thus far, the subunit compositions of RNA polymerases I and III in plants have not been defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>To fill this gap in our understanding, we affinity-purified Arabidopsis Pol I and Pol III and identified their subunits using mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Homologs of all 17 yeast Pol III subunits, and of 12 of the 14 yeast Pol I subunits, were identified via a combination of homology searching and mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>As with Pols II, IV and V, alternative versions of several subunits are utilized by Pol I or Pol III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, alternative AC40-like proteins are used by Pol I or Pol III, reflecting a functional diversification that occurred in a common ancestor of Arabidopsis and other species of the plant family, Brassicaceae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To simplify functional and structural comparisons between Pols I and III and other polymerases, we introduce a subunit nomenclature system, based on the yeast Pol II subunit numbering system, in which the 12 homologous subunits of all five nuclear nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases bear the same numbers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Recombinant proteins subjected to immunoprecipitation included subunits unique to Pol I (NRPA3, NRPA9, NRPA13), subunits unique to Pol III (NRPC3, NRPC7, NRPC9a, NRPC9b), subunits common to Pols II, IV or V (NRPB9a, NRPB9b, NRPB11), subunits common to all five nuclear polymerases (NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6a, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6b, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8a, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8b, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)10), or the unique common subunit of Pols I and III, NRP(A/C)11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The anti-NRPC7 antibody cross-reacted with a protein of the expected size in samples resulting from immunoprecipitation of tagged NRP(A/C)11, NRPC3, NRPC7 (Figure 2, lanes 2, 4, 13, 18) or the common subunits, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6a, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6b, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8a, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8b, and NRP(A/B/C/D/E)10 (Figure 2, lanes 8–10, 14, 16), consistent with all of these subunits being present in Pol III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, NRPC7 was not detected in immunoprecipitated FLAG-NRPC9a or FLAG-NRPC9b (At4g07950 or At1g01210, respectively) samples (Figure 2, lanes 6 and 15), despite LC-MS/MS evidence showing that NRPC7 and NRPC9 are present in purified native Pol III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>A possibility is that fusion of the FLAG epitope to the amino terminus of NRPC9a or NRPC9b interferes with Pol III assembly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Immunoblots revealed the presence of NRPA3 in samples immunoprecipitated using tagged NRP(A/C)11, NRPA3, NRPA9, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8b, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)10, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6b, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6a, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)8a or NRPA13 (Figure 2, lanes 2, 3, 5, 8–10, 14, 16, 20) indicating that all of these proteins are present in Pol I, confirming the mass spectrometry results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>As a control, we probed immunoblots with an antibody against NRP(D/E)2, the second-largest subunit of both Pol IV and Pol V (9,55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>NRPD2 is detected in NRPB6a, NRPB6b, NRPB8a, NRPB8b, NRPB9a, NRPB9b, NRPB10 and NRPB11 IP samples, confirming previous studies demonstrating that these subunits are common to Pols II, IV and V (Figure 2, lanes 7, 8–12, 14, 16) (9,34,39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In the case of subunits 6, 8, and 10, the current study shows that these proteins are also common to Pols I and III. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Conversely, NRP(D/E)2 was not detected in immunoprecipitated NRPA3, NRPC3, NRPC7, NRPA9, NRPC9a, NRPC9b or NRP(A/C)11 samples, consistent with these being Pol I or Pol III-specific subunits not present in Pols IV or V. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays of Figure 2 support the mass spectrometry results of the current study, as well as our prior studies of Pol II, IV and V subunit compositions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The Arabidopsis genome includes NRPC9b, NRPB7-like, NRPB10-like and NRPB12-like subunits whose peptides have not been detected in Pols I, II, III, IV or V. RT-PCR assays for NRPB10-like (encoded by locus At1g61700) and NRPB12-like (At1g53690) revealed that both genes are differentially expressed in different organs or at different times in development (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>By contrast, NRP(A/B/C/D/E)10 and NRP(A/B/C/D/E)12 (abbreviated as NRPB10 and NRPB12 in Figure 3A), are constitutively expressed (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that different subtypes of one or more of the five polymerases may assemble in specific organs, specific cell types, or at different times in development, by using the variant forms of the tenth and twelfth subunits, despite not being detected in our studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>We also asked whether the putative alternative subunits, NRPC9b (At1g01210), NRPB7-like (At4g14520) or NRPB12-like (At1g53690), associate with one or more of the five polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>FLAG epitope-tagged versions of the proteins were overexpressed using the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter, which is active in virtually all cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>We then tested whether or not the tagged proteins co-immunoprecipitate with catalytic subunits of Pols I, II, III, IV or V (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The recombinant NRPC9b, NRPB7-like and NRPB12-like proteins were all detected following immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 3B, top panel), indicating that the recombinant proteins were expressed in the transgenic plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>However, unlike NRPE5, NRPA9 or NRP(B/D/E)9a controls, none of them co-immunoprecipitated the second-largest subunits of Pol I, II, III, IV or V (Figure 3B, middle and bottom panels), making their polymerase associations (if any) unclear. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into how our findings in Arabidopsis might extend to other plants, we performed BLASTp searches using Arabidopsis Pol I-specific and Pol III-specific subunits to identify homologous genes in other plant species, including monocots (maize, rice, Brachypodium), dicots (grape, cottonwood, castor bean, and the crucifer (Brassicaceae) family) and the moss, Physcomitrella. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>At least one homolog of each subunit is present in each of these species or groups (Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Two yeast C34 paralogs are encoded by maize and Brachypodium, two yeast C82 paralogs are apparent in grape, two paralogs of yeast C31 are observed in poplar (as in Arabidopsis), and two paralogs of both yeast A34 and AC40 are encoded by the rice genome (Supplementary Table S3; for proteins alignments, see Supplementary Figures S2–S8, S12–13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses reveal that the NRPA3 and NRPC3 subunits of Arabidopsis each group with orthologous proteins of related species within the family Brassicaceae, of which Arabidopsis is a member, indicating that the functional divergence of AC40-like proteins for differential use by Pol I or Pol III occurred in a common ancestor (Figure 4A; see Supplementary Table S4 for gene ID information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>This common ancestor apparently arose after the divergence of monocots and dicots, and after the divergence of different lineages within dicots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>However, there are plant species outside of the Brassicaceae that have more than one AC40-like protein encoded by their genomes, including rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max), and millet (Setaria italica). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In each of these species, the paralogs are more similar within each species than between species, indicative of relatively recent duplication events independent to each lineage (Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses of the NRPC14 family (yeast C53 homologs) reveals that multiple paralogs (as many as four) occur in diverse plant species, including dicots such as Arabidopsis (and related Brassicaceae species), grape (Vitis vinifera), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), beans (Proteus vulgaris, G. max) or tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as well as monocots that include maize (Zea mays), rice (O. sativa), millet (S. italica) or Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon) (Figure 4B; see Supplementary Table S5 for gene ID information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In some cases, the C53 paralogs of a species are distinct, associated with unique branches of the neighbor-joining tree that are supported by strong bootstrap values; this is the case for each of the two NRPC14 paralogs in Brassicas (e.g. A. thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Brassica rapa, Capsella rubella), a branch for one of the NRPC14 subtypes present in monocots (e.g. Z. mays, O. sativa, B. distachyon, S. italica), distinct branches for the NRPC14 paralogs in poplar and soybean, and a branch represented by mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens) C53 orthologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Other plant paralogs are not clearly resolved from C53 of budding yeast, fission yeast or Drosophila (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, both NRPC14 subtypes are detected in Pol III (see Table 1), suggesting that multiple subtypes of NRPC14 may also incorporate into Pol III in other plant species. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Arabidopsis orthologs of all 17 yeast RNA polymerase III subunits and 12 of the 14 predicted Pol I subunits were identified in our study (see Table 1), extending to plants the conclusion that RNA polymerases I and III are similar in composition throughout eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Subunits of Pol I we did not detect are those orthologous to yeast A14 (NRPA4 in our nomenclature) and Rpb12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>In the case of Rpb12, its lack of detection by mass spectrometry is likely due to its small size and limited tryptic peptide profile given that Rpb12 is common to Pols I, II and III in yeast and other eukaryotes, as well as to Pols IV and V in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of A14, no clear ortholog was detected in the A. thaliana genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In fact, A14 orthologs differ considerably in sequence even among yeast species, such that sequence homology and hidden homology search algorithms, including BLAST, PSI-BLAST, Delta-BLAST or HHpred, do not identify high confidence homologs in more distantly related eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Thus, the identity of the NRPA4 subunit in Arabidopsis (and other plants) is a question not answered by our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The possibility that there is no NRPA4 subunit seems unlikely, given the structural conservation of the stalk-like sub-complexes formed by NRPA4–NRPC7 (a.k.a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>A14–A43), NRPB4–NRPB7, NRPC4–NRPC7 (a.k.a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>C17–C25) in Pols I, II and III, respectively of yeast, and the corresponding Rpo4–Rpo7 sub-complex of archaeal RNA polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>However, in yeast, Rpb4 is not absolutely essential (unlike Rpb7) (56,57), providing some basis for entertaining the possibility that plant RNA polymerase I might somehow function without an NRPA4 subunit. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Our current study, and our previous studies of Pols II, IV and V (9,22), shows that the use of alternative forms of numerous RNA polymerase subunits is commonplace in Arabidopsis (see Table 2), unlike yeast in which single genes encode each RNA polymerase subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>However, plants are not unique in this regard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>For instance, trypanosomes express more than one Rpb5, Rpb6 and Rpb10 variant (20), with Pol I utilizing variant forms of the fifth and sixth subunits distinct from those used by Pols II and III (17,20,58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>In humans, several Rpb11 homologs are encoded by the genome, although only one is known to assemble into Pol II (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Humans also have alternative RPC32 proteins that participate in functionally distinct forms of Pol III; one that is ubiquitous and essential and the other that is tissue-specific and important in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and tumors (60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Likewise, alternative ninth subunits, and alternative second subunits, utilized by Pols II, IV and V in Arabidopsis and maize, give rise to functionally distinct RNA polymerase subtypes in plants (22,40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>For Arabidopsis subunits NRP(A/B/C/D/E)6, 8, 10 and 12, commons to Pols I through V, and for Pol III-specific subunits NRPC9 and NRPC14, there are alternative subunit variants, some of which we have identified in affinity-purified polymerase samples by mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Whether the alternative forms of the subunits generate redundant, or functionally distinct, polymerase subtypes will require further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The most surprising finding of our study pertains to the orthologs of yeast AC40 and AC19, which are common to Pols I and III in yeast, humans and other eukaryotes examined to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>As expected, the AC19 ortholog, named NRP(A/C)11 in our nomenclature system, is shared by Pol I and III in Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>However, two AC40 orthologs are expressed in Arabidopsis, which we have named NRPA3 and NRPC3 due to their differential incorporation into Pol I or Pol III, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Mutations disrupting NRPA3 or NRPC3 are lethal when homozygous, indicating that both genes are essential and non-redundant (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>At the amino acid level, Arabidopsis NRPA3 and NRPC3 are 71% identical, such that there are numerous amino acid changes that could potentially contribute to the divergence of Pol I- and Pol III-specific forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>However, alignment of Arabidopsis NRPA3 and NRPC3 with their orthologs in related species of the Brassicaceae family identified eight amino acid positions that distinguish NRPA3 from NRPC3 (Figure 5A; see also Supplementary Figure S14, in which these eight amino acid positions are enclosed in rectangles). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Three correspond to amino acids (Proline 253, Glycine 254 and Aspartate 269) that are adjacent to one another in the yeast AC40 crystal structure (14,15) and are also adjacent to the conserved arginine (position R271 of yeast AC40) whose mutation in human AC40 (POLR1C) is associated with Treacher-Collins Syndrome (Figure 5B and C) (29,61,62). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In the yeast Pol I crystal structure (Protein Data Bank structure 4C2M, (14)), this patch of amino acids in AC40 contacts the Pol I-specific A34.5 subunit (Figure 5E), suggesting that differences at these conserved positions in NRPA3 and NRPC3 of Arabidopsis (and related species) are good candidates for specifying Pol I- versus Pol III-specific interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>By contrast, amino acid differences in NRPA3 versus NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast Y84 or I63 are less likely to be critical because these positions interact with Rpb12 and AC19 in yeast AC40 (Figure 5F), which are subunits common to Pols I and III in yeast and Arabidopsis (with the caveat that Rpb12 association with Pol I was not confirmed by mass spectrometry in our study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Amino acid differences in NRPA3 and NRPC3 at positions corresponding to yeast I72, Q93 or R293 are also potential candidates for mediating Pol I versus Pol III-specific interactions, as these positions make polymerase-specific contacts, such as with the A135 catalytic subunit of Pol I (Figure 5G and H). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Treacher-Collins Syndrome can be caused by mutations in the human orthologs of yeast AC40 or AC19, suggesting that impaired activity of Pol I, Pol III or both, is responsible for the impaired craniofacial development associated with the disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The fact that Arabidopsis, and related species, has evolved distinct AC40 orthologs for assembly into Pol I or Pol III, coupled with the fact that these proteins each have the conserved arginine whose mutation is linked to Treacher-Collins Syndrome (see Figure 5B), provides an intriguing opportunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>By conducting site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved arginine in the NRPA3 or NRPC3 proteins, to mimic the changes in human afflicted with Treacher-Collins Syndrome, Pol I- versus Pol III-specific phenotypes might be disentangled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>If so, Arabidopsis may prove to be a useful model system for understanding AC40 subunit functions relevant to a devastating human genetic disorder. </plain></SENT>
