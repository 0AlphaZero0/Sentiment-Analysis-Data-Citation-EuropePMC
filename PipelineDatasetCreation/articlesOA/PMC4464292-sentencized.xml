</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Exposure to potential human carcinogens and possible subsequent occurrence of cancer is of major concern for the safety of man and his environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For decades, the 2-year rodent carcinogenicity assay has been the ultimate model for evaluating the carcinogenic potential of substances (EU, 1988[14]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In general, this test is indicated by positive results obtained in an in vitro screening battery, usually followed by subsequent positive in vivo follow-up genotoxicity tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The 2-year carcinogenicity assay, however, has several scientific drawbacks as the tested doses are unrealistically high and important interspecies differences exist, thus questioning human relevance of data obtained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a substantial number of false positive results (i.e. identified as carcinogens in the rodent cancer bioassay but actually proven non-carcinogens for humans) are generated (Ennever et al., 1987[12]; Gold and Slone, 1993[18]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ethical and economic obstacles relate to the use of large numbers of animals, high doses and long duration times, and large costs (Ferdowsian and Beck, 2011[16]; Doktorova et al., 2012[7]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, regulatory requirements for in vivo testing of various compounds differ substantially worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In Europe, for example, in vivo testing of cosmetic products and their ingredients is prohibited because of the implementation in Directive 76/768/EC of strict testing and marketing bans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Both have been taken over in the actual cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009 (EU, 2009[15]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Exemptions can only be claimed when the tested compound is equally in use in other consumer and industrial products for which animal testing may be necessary to ensure compliance with the legal frameworks applicable to these products (EC, 2013[9]) e.g. cosmetic products are generally also subject to the horizontal REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals) requirements, which impose testing of a large amount of chemicals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although only for high production volume chemicals carcinogenicity testing is required, and this still will involve a large number of animals (SCCP, 2006[36]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the development of assays/strategies able to identify carcinogens in a shorter timeframe, at a lower cost and preferably not using animals presents a huge challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Different approaches have been proposed, among which the use of genetically modified animals, the incorporation of histopathological data derived from repeated-dose toxicity studies, and toxicogenomics as an endpoint combined with in vivo treatment or in vitro cell culture exposure (Bercu et al., 2010[3]; Doktorova et al., 2012[7]; Magkoufopoulou et al., 2012[29]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A toxicogenomics approach allows investigation of the entire genome response to toxicant effects and is an acknowledged strategy for discovering the mode of action of compounds and for identifying potential biomarkers of exposure and toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It also allows to quantify and validate biomarker signatures (Bercu et al., 2010[3]; Van Hummelen and Sasaki, 2010[38]; Waters et al., 2010[40]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the recently ended EU framework 6 project, carcinoGENOMICS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.carcinogenomics.eu">www.carcinogenomics.eu</ext-link>), had as final goal the development of an organ-specific battery of mechanism-based in vitro tests, accounting for various modes of carcinogenic action, using "omics" technologies coupled with in vitro cell systems from rat and human origin (Vinken et al., 2008[39]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The project was conveyed in two phases and during the first one (Phase I) the best performing liver-, kidney- and lung-derived in vitro models were selected mostly based on "omics" responses generated from a well-defined set of 15 model compounds causing genotoxicity and carcinogenicity (Doktorova et al., 2013[8]) (Table 1(Tab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>1)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The choice of the compounds was based on several strict criteria including diversity and selectivity, biochemical and biophysical properties, and availability of toxicological information (Vinken et al., 2008[39]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>With regard to the liver-based in vitro models, which were used to evaluate the 15 prototypical compounds, the human hepatoma cell line HepaRG generated the best performing gene classifier, differentiating DNA-reactive from DNA non-reactive mechanisms (Doktorova et al., 2013[8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the second phase of the project (Phase II), an additional number of 15 carefully selected compounds (thus resulting in a total of 30 analyzed compounds, shown in Table 1(Tab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>1)) were tested using HepaRG cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The chemical selection for the second phase of the project was mostly focused on human relevance, e.g. whether the compounds are known human carcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The global study results are reported here, including the classification performance and assessment of the interlaboratory reproducibility in three independent laboratories of three blindly tested compounds: as a prototypical genotoxic (GTX) carcinogen Benzo(a)pyrene was used, as a non-genotoxic (NGTX) carcinogen Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate and as a non-carcinogen (NC) Clonidine hydrochloride were used, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>At the gene level, the results of the ANOVA analysis showed that after 24 h and 72 h of exposure, 440 genes and 353 genes (Figure 1(Fig. 1)), respectively, were significantly deregulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Most GTX carcinogens were separated from the NGTX carcinogens and NC, irrespective of the time of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>A survey of the involved pathways, however, revealed more carcinogen-specific processes after 72 h of exposure in comparison to 24 h of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the most prominent changes after 72 h of exposure consisted of upregulation of genes involved in apoptosis, DNA-repair and DNA damage (Figure 1(Fig. 1)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Also increased oxidative stress, intra- and intercellular transport and metabolism were demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Downregulated genes were mostly involved in cellular metabolism and xenobiotic biotransformation, probably reflecting a dedifferentiation response as a result of GTX exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In comparison, after 24 h of exposure, these downregulated genes were associated with amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which may be interpreted as a dedifferentiation trigger, whereas the upregulated genes were involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, immunity and defense and oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The latter may be explained as a cell cycle progression and general stress response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of exposure, the DNA damage response appeared not yet activated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Consequently for analysis at the pathway level, emphasis was laid on data generated from samples after 72 h of exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The results showed that all GTX grouped together as such providing a better discrimination of GTX from NGTX and NC in comparison with the results obtained at the gene level (Figure 2(Fig. 2)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>A pre-selection with respect to the top 30 significant pathways showed that p53-dependent DNA damage was among the most affected and differentially expressed processes (Figure 3 A(Fig. 3)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In Figure 3 (Fig. 3)B, modulation of the p53 signaling pathway by the 30 prototypical compounds is presented as an example of a discriminative pathway. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The last part of the analysis focused on the interlaboratory reproducibility among the three laboratories for the three blindly tested compounds (D, E and F) which were part of the original set of 30 compounds. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In the first one, SVM was applied as algorithm and compound D was by the three laboratories unequivocally classified at all time-points as a GTX carcinogen (Figure 6(Fig. 6)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Compounds E and F were classified as either NGTX or NC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The ability of a chemical to induce cancer is traditionally assessed by a 2-year rodent carcinogenicity assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Although this assay is far from ideal, for the time being it is the most commonly used model for human cancer risk assessment (EU, 2008[13]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Approaches to at least partially substitute the necessity for in vivo testing are ongoing and among the different strategies proposed, toxicogenomics is a promising methodology (Benfenati et al., 2009[2]; Bercu et al., 2010[3]; Doktorova et al., 2012[7]; Magkoufopoulou et al., 2012[29]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the combination of transcriptomics with short-term in vivo exposure has been proposed by several teams (Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2005[11]; Nakayama et al., 2006[33]; Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2008[10]; Fielden et al., 2008[17]; Uehara et al., 2008[37]; Matsumoto et al., 2009[30]; Doktorova et al., 2011[6]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Majorly involved discriminative pathways are DNA damage, cell cycle progression, oxidative stress and detoxification response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Interpretation of transcriptomics data derived from in vitro exposure studies is even more challenging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the performance of the gene classifier generated following exposure of HepaRG cells to 30 prototypical GTX, NGTX carcinogens and NC was assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The choice of the in vitro model was based on a previously performed study (Phase I of the project) in which the HepaRG model was chosen among 5 commonly-used liver-based in vitro models as the system able to generate the best discriminative gene classifier (Doktorova et al., 2013[8]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The results shown here were generated to obtain a gene classifier based on a larger group of compounds as such covering more diverse mechanisms of action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>After analyzing the global gene expression data of the 30 compounds by using several statistical approaches including cross validation and classification analysis, a slightly higher misclassification rate in comparison to the initial test set was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This could be attributed to the fact that inclusion of additional compounds diversified the pool of involved mechanisms of action and might as such have lead to a slightly lower correct prediction rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, diversification usually contributes to the generation of a more reliable gene classifier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Additionally, some difficulties associated with the selection of appropriate test compounds should be acknowledged, especially when human relevance is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite the slightly higher misclassification rate, DNA damage remains the most characteristic pathway after exposure of the cells to GTX carcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the normal reaction of cells upon disruption of DNA integrity following chemical exposure consists of the activation of a number of downstream targets including tumor suppressor p53 and murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) (Lu, 2010[28]; Oliver et al., 2011[34]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Further, the effect is transferred onto a number of target genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA repair and several others associated with the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and response to stimuli (Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2005[11]; Ellinger-Ziegelbauer et al., 2008[10]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Indeed these genes were found deregulated following GTX insults by the majority of the selected compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This finding provides an opportunity for developing in vitro assays aimed at identifying genotoxicants in particular. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The second class of investigated chemicals consists of NGTX carcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Unlike most GTX carcinogens, which directly or indirectly affect DNA, NGTX carcinogens do not bind to DNA, yet these substances can cause cancer in animal models and possibly also in humans (Hernandez et al., 2009[22]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in this study the tested NGTX carcinogens showed to act through various processes such as endocrine modification, immune suppression, inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication and apoptosis, epigenetic modifications, tissue-specific toxicity and general inflammatory/stress responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Some of the GTX carcinogens as well as some NC, however, often induce these events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>For example, TRI is classified in this study as a NC, but induces peroxisome proliferation, a feature typically attributed to NGTX carcinogens (Rodricks et al., 2010[35]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Therefore, discrimination was possible mostly based on the GTX-specific pathways such as DNA damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>As NC, being predominantly liver toxicants, were equally involved in the above described processes, they clustered together with the NGTX. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>It has to be pointed out, however, that the current separation of selected prototypical chemicals into classes is liable to change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>An interesting example in this regards is FB1, which is currently classified as being NGTX, but the incubation of methanolic extracts of Fusarium cultures with DNA in the presence of rat liver S9 proteins results in the formation of DNA adducts (Bever et al., 2000[4]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility exists that compounds present in Fusarium fungi might alkylate DNA and exert GTX properties (Bever et al., 2000[4]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, HQO is classified as a GTX according to our study as it shows genotoxicity or chromosomal aberrations in rodent bone marrow cells but evidence for any genotoxic effect in vivo is rather weak and the responses are only marginally positive (McGregor, 2007[31]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a NGTX mode of action of HQO is proposed that involves exacerbation of a spontaneously occurring rodent renal disease and chronic progressive nephropathy (McGregor, 2007[31]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The misclassification of the compounds into the different toxic classes might be one of the causes for the slightly higher misclassification rate when the second set of chemicals has been added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Indeed, this set of compounds had a less clear-cut mechanism of action than the chemicals of the first part of the project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Also it remains difficult to discriminate between compounds that might share some mechanism of action e.g. GTX versus NGTX versus NC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Apart from the classification performance of the HepaRG model (up to 88 % correct prediction), the transferability and reproducibility of the model among different laboratories were assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>These parameters represent major steps in the validation of any test method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In this study, it was found that the interlaboratory reproducibility was situated within a range of 20-35 % overlap of the AUC of the top ranked transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The most reproducible results among the three laboratories were those that were obtained after exposure to the GTX compound D. The classification exercise of the 3 coded compounds, when used as a validation set, resulted in a high correct prediction rate for the GTX carcinogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Indeed compound D was correctly identified as a GTX and recognized as BaP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The two other blinded compounds could not be predicted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>These results were overall reproducible among the three laboratories. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the HepaRG model is a promising tool for identification of genotoxicants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The assay, however, could not discriminate between NGTX carcinogens and NC and in its present form cannot be regarded as an alternative to carcinogenicity testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Currently, the standard in vitro assays for the detection of genotoxicants produce an unacceptably high number - up to 70 % and more - of irrelevant positive results (i.e. low specificity), meaning that compounds are in vitro identified as being genotoxicants whereas in vivo they are not genotoxic (Kirkland et al., 2005[25]; 2011[27]; Kirkland and Fowler, 2010[26]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This leads, for example in the case of candidate-pharmaceuticals, to follow-up confirmatory in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity testing which is not only expensive and consumes a lot of animals but it also slows down the development process of new chemical entities (Goodsaid et al., 2010[19]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In the case of cosmetics, for which confirmatory in vivo tests are no longer possible in Europe as from July 2013 (EU, 2009[15]), interesting compounds such as UV-filters and preservatives could erroneously be considered genotoxic, and thus restricted or even rejected (Ates et al., 2013[1]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In such a case, identification of “not being a genotoxicant” as shown in this study, could be a valuable result to be added in a weight of evidence approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, in order to increase the reliability of this in vitro approach more reference compounds are needed in order to represent the high diversity of mechanisms involved in genotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This approach could in particular be of interest to be used in a tired testing strategy to obtain additional mechanistic information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This type of strategy is under investigation by the pharmaceutical industry in the USA to de-risk false positive results obtained in standard genotoxicity testing batteries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Its application is already under discussion with the US Food and Drug Administration (Goodsaid et al., 2010)[19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>As shown in this study, genotoxicants could be clearly identified using HepaRG cells as in vitro exposure model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A positive aspect of applying a toxicogenomics approach is the generation of detailed information on the mechanism of action of the tested compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In addition, the use of human-based cells also contributes to more reliable results since interspecies differences are avoided. </plain></SENT>
