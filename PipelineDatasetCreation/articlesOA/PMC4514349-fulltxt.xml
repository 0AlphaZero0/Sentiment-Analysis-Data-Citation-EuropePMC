Despite its heterogeneous nature, the different types of AMLs are still managed by standard induction chemotherapy for those who can tolerate it in the beginning. For the elderly and infirm patients, however, this approach leads to unacceptably high induction mortality rate. This article reviews past and current efforts searching for low-intensiveness treatments for the elderly and infirm patients who cannot tolerate the standard induction regimen. Volasertib, currently in Phase III clinical trials in combination with cytarabine, is reviewed as a promising agent for this patient population with AML, from the viewpoints of potential compliance and efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>volasertib</kwd><kwd>acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>management</kwd><kwd>induction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematological disorder characterized by proliferation of immature cells.

All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide have been shown to be very effective as frontline treatments in patients presenting with white cell counts &#x0003c;10,000/mL. This subset of AML can be considered one of the first cancers for which targeted therapy has been used successfully. Cure has been achieved in a significant proportion of patients in this group. Identification of this subset has allowed us to tailor the treatments to this type of AML and laid the foundation for our approach to AML, which is increasingly recognized, genetically, as a very heterogeneous disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetics and epigenetics in AML: understanding the heterogeneity of AML</title><p>Cytogenetic evaluation has been the cornerstone of risk stratification, but 50% of patients have &#x0201c;normal cytogenetics&#x0201d;, making this one the largest subsets of all AML patients.<xref rid="b7-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Further classification of these patients has been increasingly pursued both for prognostic reasons and for better identification of patients who will benefit from targeted therapies.<xref rid="b9-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The advent of molecular diagnostics has increased our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of this disease.

Induction chemotherapy for AML patients who can tolerate intensive treatment generally consists of combinations of an anthracycline with cytarabine. Various trials have been conducted to add additional drugs to this combination, but none of them showed any significant benefit to change the clinical practice.<xref rid="b23-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Studies conducted on changing the dose of cytarabine or anthracycline (daunorubicin versus idarubicin) did not show any consistent benefit. As a result, a single regimen has become the standard of care that is widely used.<xref rid="b24-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> A recent study comparing daunorubicin 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> to 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in patients younger than 60 years of age showed the superiority of the higher dose, and this regimen is increasingly being used in the community.<xref rid="b26-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A similar study comparing a higher dose to the conventional dose of daunorubicin showed that the higher dose achieved better responses in elderly patients.<xref rid="b27-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The goal of induction treatments is to achieve a complete remission (CR). The latter is traditionally defined as bone marrow blasts &#x0003c;5% and recovery in blood counts with absolute neutrophil count of &#x0003e;1,000/mL and platelets &#x0003e;100,000/mL. The rate of CR in younger patients with the high-dose daunorubicin/cytarabine combination approaches 70% after one cycle of induction as compared to 50%&#x02013;60% CR rates with the standard dose of daunorubicin.</p><p>Many more trials were conducted with varying doses of cytarabine. However, 100&#x02013;200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cytarabine daily for 7 days as continuous infusion is considered the conventional dose along with daunorubicin or idarubicin for the first 3 days. Higher doses of cytarabine have been tested. Although some studies have suggested relapse-free survival (RFS) benefit, large randomized studies have not shown an OS advantage. The common practice is still a conventional dose of cytarabine for induction in both the young- and the older-aged patients.<xref rid="b28-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><sec><title>Older adults</title><p>The induction treatment of AML in elderly patients, which generally refers to those older than 65 years of age, is much more complicated, although this is the more commonly seen patient population with this disease. In patients who can tolerate intensive chemotherapy, induction with high-dose daunorubicin and cytarabine has been shown to be beneficial in achieving CR. Unfortunately, most patients are not eligible for induction therapy due to age and performance status. Large cooperative group studies carried out by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), and the UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) showed that the probability of 2-year survival in elderly patients undergoing intensive treatment is only approximately 20%&#x02013;25%, with CR rates after induction of approximately 40%&#x02013;50%. The high rate of induction mortality (15%&#x02013;19%) might be one reason for the poor outcomes. These survival data again included only patients who were considered to be well enough to receive intensive treatments.<xref rid="b29-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Various prognostic models are being developed to help us choose patients for induction therapy as induction therapy still offers the best chance of achieving remission in patients who can tolerate it.<xref rid="b32-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>In addition, it is well known that older age has been associated with a decrease in the number of patients with favorable cytogenetics, from 30% to only 7%, and doubling of complex cytogenetics, from 6% to 12%. As a result, the 5-year survival is only 13% compared with 57% in the youngest age group.<xref rid="b34-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This means that therapeutic agents such as volasertib that work across different cytogenetic risk groups are expected to offer an advantage in the treatment of AML in elderly patients because current agents are frequently ineffective in the complex cytogenetic group (refer section on &#x0201c;Consolidation therapy&#x0201d;).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Consolidation therapy</title><p>In patients who achieve CR after induction therapy, lack of additional treatments invariably leads to relapse of disease in almost all patients.<xref rid="b35-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Ever since the Cancer and Leukemia Group B presented the landmark results in 1994 showing superiority of high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m<sup>2</sup>) versus intermediate dose (400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) versus low dose (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), it has become the standard of care in most practices. This high dose is given every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5.<xref rid="b36-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Newer studies with lower doses (1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) have shown similar benefit with less toxicity. Therefore, lower doses can also be used in consolidation treatment. The number of cycles is not clearly established, although it is common to give three to four cycles.<xref rid="b37-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>Consolidation therapy in elderly patients who tolerated induction and are eligible to receive intensive therapy again is probably best limited to one to two cycles of consolidation, with 1.0&#x02013;1.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> of cytarabine over 4&#x02013;6 days in each cycle. Another option can be as per the recent Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) 98 trial documenting the superiority of the ambulatory arm. This regimen consisted of an anthracycline (idarubicin 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or daunorubicin 45 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 1 day and 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cytarabine every 12 hours for 5 days each month for 6 months.<xref rid="b38-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Postremission management should include discussions of allogeneic stem cell transplant in all patients with intermediate or poor risk of disease, classified as such per the new ELN guidelines. Age alone need not be an exclusion criterion, with most transplant centers routinely considering transplants up to the age of 70 years. The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index has been shown to be a good predictor of outcomes based on pretransplant comorbidities.<xref rid="b39-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pitfalls of standard chemotherapy</title><p>As noted earlier, AML is a disease of the elderly population, with more than half of all patients being above 65 years of age. Unfortunately, the disease biology appears to be different in the elderly, with higher chance of antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), higher chance of multidrug resistance, and poor performance status. An evaluation of patients enrolled under the SWOG trials showed that patients older than 66 years of age had a 20% chance of mortality within 30 days, and this mortality rate was even higher for patients over the age of 75 years. This high mortality was seen even in patients with good performance status.<xref rid="b40-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Therefore, alternative low-intensiveness therapies were vigorously sought.</p><p>It is also widely recognized that patients enrolled in clinical trials comprise a selected group of patients, and it is likely that the outcomes would be worse if the same intensive treatments were applied to those in the general population. Patients treated on a clinical trial are likely to be given curative intent treatment and their outcomes are likely to be better. This might not be extrapolated to the general population as it is likely that patients in that age group have comorbid conditions. These patients with comorbid conditions are frequently excluded from clinical trials.<xref rid="b41-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A recent Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare review of outcomes of patients with AML showed that 60% of patients are not offered any of the standard recommended options of chemotherapy, including hypomethylating therapy.<xref rid="b42-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Thus, the availability of newer agents that are better tolerated might change this approach in clinical practice even in the elderly or in patients with comorbid conditions who are routinely deemed unfit for any treatments. At least four options are currently available or are being studied, as described in the following sections.</p></sec><sec><title>Low-dose Ara-C</title><p>For the elderly and infirm patients deemed unable to tolerate the standard induction chemotherapy with an anthracycline and cytarabine combination, low-dose cytarabine (low-dose Ara-C or LDAC) is better than supportive care. This was shown in a Phase III trial in 2007 comparing LDAC and hydroxyurea (HU).<xref rid="b43-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In this trial, LDAC offered 18% CR rate compared to only 1% in the HU arm (<italic>P</italic>=0.00006). Most importantly, those who received LDAC had OS advantage relative to HU recipients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44&#x02013;0.81; <italic>P</italic>=0.0009). LDAC is commonly used for this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypomethylating agents in AML</title><p>Azacitidine and decitabine are approved in the USA for the treatment of MDS. Decitabine is also approved in the European Union for the newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML in patients aged &#x0003e;65 years or for those who cannot tolerate standard induction chemotherapy. These agents are well tolerated, and the response rates are only slightly better as compared to the best supportive care plus low-dose cytarabine in most patients. Patients with low blast counts in the range of 20%&#x02013;30% appear to benefit more from these agents as compared to patients with a very high disease burden. These are good results as compared to available chemotherapy options. In addition, patients with complex cytogenetics and <italic>TP53</italic> mutations are especially suited for such option given their poor response to conventional chemotherapy.<xref rid="b44-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> A Phase III study compared decitabine with supportive care or LDAC in patients aged 65 years or older with newly diagnosed AML in the poor- or intermediate-risk category.<xref rid="b45-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The CR and CR without platelet recovery (CRp) were 17.8% versus 7.8% (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4&#x02013;4.8; <italic>P</italic>=0.001).

The regulatory domain consists of one to two polo-box domains (PBDs). The PBD(s) inhibit the catalytic domain when there is no binding of phosphopeptide. On binding to the phosphopeptide of a phosphoprotein, the PBD releases the kinase domain, allowing it to bind or dock its substrate, thus setting off the signal transduction cascade.

Patients received a single 1-hour infusion of volasertib every 3 weeks (Q3W). The doses received ranged from 12 mg to 450 mg. Side effects were all mainly hematological and were reversible. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) started to appear when the dose was escalated to 300 mg. DLT mainly included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and febrile neutropenia. The most common drug-related adverse events were anemia (total: 22%; grade 3: 8%), neutropenia (total: 15%; grade 3/4: 14%), thrombocytopenia (total: 14%, grade 3/4: 14%), and fatigue (total: 15%, grade 3: 2%). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was initially determined to be 400 mg Q3W. However, during the expansion cohort, three out of ten patients had DLT. After dose de-escalation to 350 mg, there were again three out of five DLTs. Therefore, the recommended dose for Phase II was 300 mg.

In the monotherapy arm, 29 patients (age range: 26&#x02013;84 years, median: 71 years) were evaluated. Adverse effects were reported in eight patients, which were considered drug related (27.6%). The most common drug-related adverse effects were anemia (10.3%), thrombocytopenia, epitaxis, and nausea (6.9%). Grade 3/4 drug-related adverse effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, mucositis, pneumonia, fungal pneumonia (grade 5), and neutropenia. DLTs were grade 4 pneumonia, fatal fungal pneumonia that arose in a patient receiving 150 mg of volasetib, and one case of grade 3 mucositis (at 400 mg). MTD was not reached at 500 mg. In the combination arm, MTD was determined to be 350 mg at Day 1 and Day 15 Q4W, with Ara-C given at 20 mg bid, subcutaneously, on Days 1&#x02013;10. No drug interaction was observed after administration of Ara-C with volasertib. The combination with Ara-C is safe and well tolerated too.

In the colon cancer model, volasertib had similar efficacy at a total weekly dosage of 50 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained when animals received 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of volasertib intravenously once a week whereas tumors in the control group were progressively larger, volasertib given at 20 mg/kg for two consecutive days per week for 5 cycles resulted in tumor regression. Volasertib delayed tumor growth in NSCLC. Furthermore, it was effective in inhibiting the taxane-resistant colon cancer model as well. Examination of the tumor tissue after volasertib treatment found a 13-fold increase in mitotic figures in the tumor compared to the control in a colon cancer model 24 hours later. Apoptosis, as demonstrated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, increased 4.5 folds compared to tumor treated with vehicle only. When a mouse bearing the colon cancer was given a single dose of 35 mg/kg, a much higher tissue concentration of volasertib is reached (maximum of 32 &#x003bc;M 8 hours versus 7 &#x003bc;M 1 hour after administration).

The melanoma patient who showed PR was administered the 300 mg once Q3Wdosage. The patient had received cisplatin and dacarbazine followed by radiation therapy, before failure of ipilumumab occurred. The PR started from Cycle 2 and lasted till Cycle 9 (progression-free survival [PFS]: 207 days). One patient with urothelial cancer had PR from Cycle 2 to Cycle 16. This patient had a dose reduction to 300 mg from Cycle 2 onward after adverse effect was noted on getting 450 mg in Cycle 1. The patient was restarted on volasertib after tumor resection and received a total of 39 cycles; PFS was 403 days. This patient was also heavily treated with neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin with surgery on diagnosis, and then paclitaxel, capecitabine with investigational agent after recurrence. The third patient with PR was administered 300 mg of drug (decreased after the first course from 400 mg) for her ovarian cancer. She had a total of four cycles and PFS of 148 days. After recurrence, this patient received six cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel with CR, four cycles of cisplatin intraperitoneally, six cycles of liposomal doxorubicin, letrozole, and topotecan before volasertib. It is also noted in this trial that one NSCLC patient at 300 mg dose had stable disease as the best response for 550 days. This patient had no response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and then to taxotere, with progressive disease in both occasions. Forty percent of these patients had stable disease as the best overall response and 48% had clinical benefit.</p><p>In a separate Phase I study performed in 59 Asian patients,<xref rid="b76-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> two more PRs were documented.

Exploratory analyses comparing survival of patients in the same cytogenetic groups treated in the two arms showed benefit in adding volasertib. Of note, this trial was originally not powered to show the survival benefit. On the basis of these promising results, a Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial comparing LDAC with LDAC and volasertib in 660 patients (POLO-AML-2, NCT01721876) was initiated. Results are expected in early 2016.</p><p>As stated herein, Plk1 is an essential kinase in the cell cycle. Plk1 is overexpressed in a variety of neoplasms. Overexpression of Plk1 in tumors has been linked to poor outcomes. Volasertib is a specific inhibitor of Plk1; the question is whether volasertib is more effective in treating cancers that express higher levels of Plk1 than in treating those that express lower levels. The latest study<xref rid="b77-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">77</xref> using bone marrow biopsies from AML patients, leukemia cell lines, immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines, and non-neoplastic cell lines treated with Plk1 inhibitor, however, showed uniform suppression of proliferation, followed by apoptosis regardless of Plk1 expression levels. Therefore, volasertib is more likely to offer an advantage for those patients whose uncontrolled cell proliferation in neoplasms poses the most serious threats to survival, eg, patients with AML having high leukocyte counts. The other side of the coin is that volasertib could cause some other unintended consequence if proliferation of normal cells is tightly suppressed too. It is difficult to link the cell proliferation status with efficacy in other tumor types at this time due to the small number and variety of neoplasms studied in these early-phase clinical trials.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>AML assumes an aggressive course and is rapidly fatal if left untreated. It is unfortunately more common in the elderly population, with median age of diagnosis being above 65 years. Although most clinical trials show that elderly patients benefit from intensive treatment, it is likely that most patients in these trials comprise a very selective group of patients and it is unlikely that these studies are representative of the patients in the general population. This notion is supported by a recent SEER/Medicare analysis, which shows that 60% of patients older than 66 years of age were not offered any treatment.<xref rid="b42-ott-8-1761" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Despite intensive search for alternative, low-intensiveness regimens for the elderly and infirm patients unable to tolerate the standard treatment, the ideal regimen that adds benefit to single agent cytarabine proved to be elusive. In addition, the safety and tolerability of various chemotherapy drugs continues to be the biggest hindrance to the treatment of AML. Volasertib offers a newer approach to the treatment of AML. The promising results seen in a Phase II study with very favorable safety profile in both the AML studies and the solid tumor trials make this one of the exciting drugs in the pipeline for the treatment of AML. The Phase III volasertib trial results will, hopefully, provide an answer shortly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Lynsey Ekema, Master of Science Medical Illustration Instructional Design and Development, Georgia Regents University, for her expert assistance in illustrating the cell cycle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ott-8-1761">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ott-8-1761"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ferrara</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Schiffer</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute myeloid leukaemia in adults</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2013</year><volume>381</volume><issue>9865</issue><fpage>484</fpage><lpage>495</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23399072</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ott-8-1761"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Estey</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in older patients</article-title><source>J Clin Oncol</source><year>2007</year><volume>25</volume><issue>14</issue><fpage>1908</fpage><lpage>1915</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17488990</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ott-8-1761"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Estey</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute myeloid leukemia: 2013 update on risk-stratification and management</article-title><source>Am J Hematol</source><year>2013</year><volume>88</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>318</fpage><lpage>327</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23526416</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ott-8-1761"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>D&#x000f6;hner</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Estey</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name><name><surname>Amadori</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/><collab>European LeukemiaNet</collab></person-group><article-title>Diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia in adults: recommendations from an international expert panel, on behalf of the European LeukemiaNet</article-title><source>Blood</source><year>2010</year><volume>115</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>453</fpage><lpage>474</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19880497</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ott-8-1761"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grimwade</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The importance of diagnostic cytogenetics on outcome in AML: analysis of 1,612 patients entered into the MRC AML 10 trial.
