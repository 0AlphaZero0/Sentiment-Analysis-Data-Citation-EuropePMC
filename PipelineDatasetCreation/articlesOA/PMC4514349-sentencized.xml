<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increased proliferation leads to cytopenias, which commonly present with neutropenia leading to infections, thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding complications, and anemia presenting as dyspnea on exertion or at rest.1 The incidence of AML increases with age, with the median age of diagnosis being 65–70 years.2 The cytopenias and the elderly age at presentation complicate the treatment with standard induction, showing very poor survival at 2 years.2 Even for patients of younger age (&lt;60 years), the standard-of-care treatments have not changed significantly for the better in the past. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal evaluation has long played an important role in risk stratification of AML patients.4 On the basis of whether patients have abnormal cytogenetics or according to the types of abnormal cytogenetics in the leukemia blasts, AML is stratified into four different risk groups: Favorable, Intermediate I, Intermediate II, and Adverse risk groups.4 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Induction therapies are similar in all patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, postremission care may vary, with allogeneic stem cell transplant being the preferred option in poor and some intermediate risk groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The favorable-risk AML patients generally are expected to do well with postremission consolidation chemotherapy alone.5,6 Acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is characterized by translocation (15:17) in most patients and variant translocation involving chromosome 17 in others, is a unique subset and is treated differently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide have been shown to be very effective as frontline treatments in patients presenting with white cell counts &lt;10,000/mL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This subset of AML can be considered one of the first cancers for which targeted therapy has been used successfully. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cure has been achieved in a significant proportion of patients in this group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Identification of this subset has allowed us to tailor the treatments to this type of AML and laid the foundation for our approach to AML, which is increasingly recognized, genetically, as a very heterogeneous disease. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic evaluation has been the cornerstone of risk stratification, but 50% of patients have “normal cytogenetics”, making this one the largest subsets of all AML patients.7,8 Further classification of these patients has been increasingly pursued both for prognostic reasons and for better identification of patients who will benefit from targeted therapies.9 The advent of molecular diagnostics has increased our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity of this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The most recent European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines now incorporate the mutational status of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in FLT3 (encoding fms-related tyrosine kinase 3), CEBPA (encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha), and NPM1 (encoding nucleophosmin) into risk stratification considerations, which allows us to better direct care specifically to the intermediate-risk group for AML.3 Other than identifying the driver mutations of disease, another advantage of identifying these mutations might be in the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although it has not been validated for all mutations yet, NPM1 mutation has been shown to be useful in monitoring MRD.10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>NPM1 is the most common mutation detected in AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It is found in 25%–30% of all AML patients and in 45%–50% of patients who are cytogenetically normal (CN).11 This mutation has been well documented to confer chemosensitivity and is generally considered to be a good prognostic marker.12 Although it is widely accepted to be a valid good prognostic marker in all age groups, some emerging data suggest that in patients older than 65 years of age, this mutation might not have as good outcomes.13 If confirmed, alternative treatment practices might need to be considered even with this mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Present practice withholds allogeneic transplant in patients with this mutation regardless of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The concurrent presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation also leads to poor outcomes in NPM1-mutated patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>FLT3-ITD mutations are present in approximately one-third of all CN-AML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Presence of such mutations is widely accepted to confer poor outcome in AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The allelic burden of this mutation seems to be important prognostically as well, with high allelic burden having worse outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the importance of lower burden is still a matter of controversy.9 A different insertion point at the tyrosine kinase domain, hence labeled as FLT3-TKD, also confers a worse outcome.14 Multiple drugs are being investigated as potential inhibitors of FLT3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>So far, however, the results have been with varying success.15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>CEBPA is a less common mutation as compared to NPM1 and FLT3-ITD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It confers better prognosis, although only double mutations can be considered significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This mutation is also commonly seen in association with NPM1 or FLT3-ITD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The outcome might be different when it is associated with FLT3-ITD.9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>DNMT3A [encoding DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha] mutations are seen in approximately one-third of all CN-AML patients.16 These mutations appear to confer worse outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>There are, however, some conflicting studies on the effects in younger patients.16,17 In a recent study, younger patients who had this mutation appeared to have benefited from increasing doses of anthracycline.18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>IDH1 and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2) are mutated in approximately 25% of CN-AML patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Although the prognostic significance is still debated,18 availability of targeted therapy inhibiting these mutations might allow us to better treat these patients if ongoing studies show a favorable outcome.19,20 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) and ASXL1 mutations are less common mutations in AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Both appear to be more common with increasing age among AML patients. ASXL1 mutations appear to confer a poor outcome,9 and the prognostic significance of the TET2 mutation is still controversial, with studies showing conflicting results on overall survival (OS).21,22 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The standard-of-care treatment for AML includes an upfront induction therapy, followed by a risk-adapted consolidation therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Induction chemotherapy for AML patients who can tolerate intensive treatment generally consists of combinations of an anthracycline with cytarabine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Various trials have been conducted to add additional drugs to this combination, but none of them showed any significant benefit to change the clinical practice.23 Studies conducted on changing the dose of cytarabine or anthracycline (daunorubicin versus idarubicin) did not show any consistent benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As a result, a single regimen has become the standard of care that is widely used.24,25 A recent study comparing daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 to 45 mg/m2 in patients younger than 60 years of age showed the superiority of the higher dose, and this regimen is increasingly being used in the community.26 A similar study comparing a higher dose to the conventional dose of daunorubicin showed that the higher dose achieved better responses in elderly patients.27 The goal of induction treatments is to achieve a complete remission (CR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The latter is traditionally defined as bone marrow blasts &lt;5% and recovery in blood counts with absolute neutrophil count of &gt;1,000/mL and platelets &gt;100,000/mL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The rate of CR in younger patients with the high-dose daunorubicin/cytarabine combination approaches 70% after one cycle of induction as compared to 50%–60% CR rates with the standard dose of daunorubicin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Many more trials were conducted with varying doses of cytarabine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, 100–200 mg/m2 of cytarabine daily for 7 days as continuous infusion is considered the conventional dose along with daunorubicin or idarubicin for the first 3 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Higher doses of cytarabine have been tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Although some studies have suggested relapse-free survival (RFS) benefit, large randomized studies have not shown an OS advantage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The common practice is still a conventional dose of cytarabine for induction in both the young- and the older-aged patients.28 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Older adults </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The induction treatment of AML in elderly patients, which generally refers to those older than 65 years of age, is much more complicated, although this is the more commonly seen patient population with this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In patients who can tolerate intensive chemotherapy, induction with high-dose daunorubicin and cytarabine has been shown to be beneficial in achieving CR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, most patients are not eligible for induction therapy due to age and performance status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Large cooperative group studies carried out by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG), and the UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) showed that the probability of 2-year survival in elderly patients undergoing intensive treatment is only approximately 20%–25%, with CR rates after induction of approximately 40%–50%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The high rate of induction mortality (15%–19%) might be one reason for the poor outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>These survival data again included only patients who were considered to be well enough to receive intensive treatments.29–31 Various prognostic models are being developed to help us choose patients for induction therapy as induction therapy still offers the best chance of achieving remission in patients who can tolerate it.32,33 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is well known that older age has been associated with a decrease in the number of patients with favorable cytogenetics, from 30% to only 7%, and doubling of complex cytogenetics, from 6% to 12%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>As a result, the 5-year survival is only 13% compared with 57% in the youngest age group.34 This means that therapeutic agents such as volasertib that work across different cytogenetic risk groups are expected to offer an advantage in the treatment of AML in elderly patients because current agents are frequently ineffective in the complex cytogenetic group (refer section on “Consolidation therapy”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></SecTag><sec><title><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Consolidation therapy </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In patients who achieve CR after induction therapy, lack of additional treatments invariably leads to relapse of disease in almost all patients.35 Ever since the Cancer and Leukemia Group B presented the landmark results in 1994 showing superiority of high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2) versus intermediate dose (400 mg/m2) versus low dose (100 mg/m2), it has become the standard of care in most practices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This high dose is given every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5.36 Newer studies with lower doses (1.5 g/m2) have shown similar benefit with less toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lower doses can also be used in consolidation treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The number of cycles is not clearly established, although it is common to give three to four cycles.37 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Consolidation therapy in elderly patients who tolerated induction and are eligible to receive intensive therapy again is probably best limited to one to two cycles of consolidation, with 1.0–1.5 g/m2 of cytarabine over 4–6 days in each cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Another option can be as per the recent Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) 98 trial documenting the superiority of the ambulatory arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This regimen consisted of an anthracycline (idarubicin 90 mg/m2 or daunorubicin 45 mg/m2) for 1 day and 60 mg/m2 of cytarabine every 12 hours for 5 days each month for 6 months.38 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Postremission management should include discussions of allogeneic stem cell transplant in all patients with intermediate or poor risk of disease, classified as such per the new ELN guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Age alone need not be an exclusion criterion, with most transplant centers routinely considering transplants up to the age of 70 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index has been shown to be a good predictor of outcomes based on pretransplant comorbidities.39 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>As noted earlier, AML is a disease of the elderly population, with more than half of all patients being above 65 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the disease biology appears to be different in the elderly, with higher chance of antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), higher chance of multidrug resistance, and poor performance status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>An evaluation of patients enrolled under the SWOG trials showed that patients older than 66 years of age had a 20% chance of mortality within 30 days, and this mortality rate was even higher for patients over the age of 75 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>This high mortality was seen even in patients with good performance status.40 Therefore, alternative low-intensiveness therapies were vigorously sought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>It is also widely recognized that patients enrolled in clinical trials comprise a selected group of patients, and it is likely that the outcomes would be worse if the same intensive treatments were applied to those in the general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Patients treated on a clinical trial are likely to be given curative intent treatment and their outcomes are likely to be better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This might not be extrapolated to the general population as it is likely that patients in that age group have comorbid conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>These patients with comorbid conditions are frequently excluded from clinical trials.41 A recent Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) and Medicare review of outcomes of patients with AML showed that 60% of patients are not offered any of the standard recommended options of chemotherapy, including hypomethylating therapy.42 Thus, the availability of newer agents that are better tolerated might change this approach in clinical practice even in the elderly or in patients with comorbid conditions who are routinely deemed unfit for any treatments. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This was shown in a Phase III trial in 2007 comparing LDAC and hydroxyurea (HU).43 In this trial, LDAC offered 18% CR rate compared to only 1% in the HU arm (P=0.00006). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Structurally, PLKs have two functional domains: the N-terminal serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain(s).56,57 The catalytic domain is where the serine/threonine kinase activity resides and has an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding pocket, to which the small-molecule ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors are directed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The regulatory domain consists of one to two polo-box domains (PBDs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The PBD(s) inhibit the catalytic domain when there is no binding of phosphopeptide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>On binding to the phosphopeptide of a phosphoprotein, the PBD releases the kinase domain, allowing it to bind or dock its substrate, thus setting off the signal transduction cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The PLKs play essential roles in many important cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>These processes include mitosis,58 DNA replication,59 and stress response to DNA damage and recovery,60–62 among other newly discovered ones such as resistance to apoptosis63,64 and regulation of cancer cell invasiveness.65 The role of PLK1 is the best studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Its essential roles in mitosis include mitotic entry, centrosomal maturation, sister chromatid separation, mitotic exit, as well as cytokinesis (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The most prominent phenotype occurring when PLK1 function is depleted is known as the “polo-arrest” (Figure 2).66 When polo-arrest happens, there is perturbation of the spindle assembly and cell cycle arrest at the prometaphase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Mitotic cells accumulate with monopolar spindles that are inappropriately attached to the kinetochores. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Although most clinical trials show that elderly patients benefit from intensive treatment, it is likely that most patients in these trials comprise a very selective group of patients and it is unlikely that these studies are representative of the patients in the general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>This notion is supported by a recent SEER/Medicare analysis, which shows that 60% of patients older than 66 years of age were not offered any treatment.42 Despite intensive search for alternative, low-intensiveness regimens for the elderly and infirm patients unable to tolerate the standard treatment, the ideal regimen that adds benefit to single agent cytarabine proved to be elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In addition, the safety and tolerability of various chemotherapy drugs continues to be the biggest hindrance to the treatment of AML. </plain></SENT>
