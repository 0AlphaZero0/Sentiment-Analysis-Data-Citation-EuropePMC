The nutritional value and healthful properties of tea are closely related to the large amounts of three major characteristic constituents including polyphenols (mainly catechins), theanine and caffeine. Although oil tea (<italic>Camellia oleifera</italic>) belongs to the genus <italic>Camellia</italic>, this plant lacks these three characteristic constituents. Comparative analysis of tea and oil tea via RNA-Seq would help uncover the genetic components underlying the biosynthesis of characteristic metabolites in tea.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that 3,787 and 3,359 bud genes, as well as 4,042 and 3,302 leaf genes, were up-regulated in tea and oil tea, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed high levels of all types of catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea compared to those in oil tea. Activation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of these characteristic compounds was detected by RNA-Seq analysis. In particular, genes encoding enzymes involved in flavonoid, theanine and caffeine pathways exhibited considerably different expression levels in tea compared to oil tea, which were also confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We assembled 81,826 and 78,863 unigenes for tea and oil tea, respectively, based on their differences at the transcriptomic level. A potential connection was observed between gene expression and content variation for catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea and oil tea. The results demonstrated that the metabolism was activated during the accumulation of characteristic metabolites in tea, which were present at low levels in oil tea.

O. Kuntze in the family <italic>Theaceae</italic>. Tea is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and tea leaves represent an important source of many biologically active metabolites such as flavonoids, theanine and caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Flavonoids mainly comprise flavan-3-ols (catechins), epicatechin (EC), gallocatechin (GC), epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C) and their respective gallate esters, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Tea leaves, which contain various secondary metabolites, are usually used as the raw material for tea production. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea remain elusive.</p><p>Great effort has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and secondary metabolite production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in tea. Most of these studies have focused on characterizing genes related to secondary metabolism, most of which were revealed through EST sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and analysis of the transcriptomes from various tissues of tea plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or under different stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. More recently, Shi <italic>et al.</italic> discovered novel candidate genes involved in pathways in tea by analyzing transcriptome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Liu <italic>et al.</italic> reported the discovery of a novel enzyme involved in galloylated catechin biosynthesis in tea plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the lack of genomic information has become an obstacle to exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea. Transcriptome sequencing represents an efficient approach to obtaining functional genomic information.</p><p>RNA-Seq is a rapid technique for genome-wide gene expression analysis that is widely used to determine gene structures and expression profiles in model organisms. <italic>De novo</italic> assembly of RNA-Seq data makes it possible to conduct gene analysis in the absence of reference genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Comparative transcriptomic studies have been performed to identify differential gene expression in several organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Another widely known member of <italic>Theaceae</italic> is oil tea, <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> Abel, a tree serving as an important source of edible oil that is grown specifically in China. Oil tea was genetically closely to tea, and they both belonged to genus <italic>Camellia</italic>. Here, we performed RNA-Seq on buds and second leaves of tea and oil tea to characterize differences in gene expression between these two plants. This comparative transcriptomic analysis provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea, as well as the phytochemical characteristics of its main metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analysis of the contents of catechins, theanine and caffeine</title><p>HPLC analyses were conducted to determine the contents of catechins, theanine and caffeine, and related intermediates in buds and five leaves of tea and oil tea (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Interestingly, PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and CHI (chalcone isomerase) genes, which are employed in the upstream phenylpropanoid pathway, were more highly expressed in oil tea than in tea. However, in the downstream biosynthetic pathway of catechins, the F3H (flavanone 3-hydroxylas), DFR (dihydroflavonol 4-reductase) and ANR (anthocyanidin reductase) genes were more highly expressed in tea. Notably, the ANR gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of anthocyanidins to 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ol, which is an intermediate in the final step of esterified catechin synthesis. Both RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed considerable activation of the ANR gene in tea but not in oil tea, which is consistent with the data from HPLC analyses of EC, EGC, C and GC contents.

We found that tea contains more beneficial nutrients, such as catechins, theanine and caffeine, in its buds and leaves because the pathways related to these metabolites were considerably more active in tea than in oil tea. Theanine is a unique non-protein amino acid that was first discovered in tea. There are trace amounts of this compound in two other <italic>Camellia</italic> species (<italic>C. japonica</italic> and <italic>C. sasanqua</italic>) and in one species of mushroom (<italic>Xerocomus badius)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Of the phenolic compounds, high flavonoid levels are present in oil tea, as revealed by HPLC (140.06&#x000a0;mg/g dry material) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Flavonoids are a class of important secondary metabolites including flavanones, flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols and flavan-3-ols (catechins). These compounds are important for tea quality and are beneficial for human health (especially catechins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Catechins, theanine and caffeine are the main characteristic compounds in tea, and the results of our analysis of these compounds are in accordance with recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Oil tea is genetically closely to tea, but no theanine and caffeine were reported except flavonoids in oil tea leaves in previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We chose tea and oil tea buds and leaves of plants from the same environment for analysis to reveal the mechanism behind the high levels catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea. Our results indicated that the catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea were also present in oil tea, but in much lower amounts. We detected increased expression of some key genes in these three metabolic pathways in tea compared to oil tea, which might lead to the differences in their contents.</p><p>Our results indicated that the genes encoding F3H, DFR and ANR in the flavonoid pathway were more highly expressed in tea than in oil tea. On the contrary, the expression levels of PAL and CHI genes were lower in tea than in oil tea. These observations were consistent with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. High PAL activity was associated with the accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and DFR, ANR and LAR played an important role in the formation of catechins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Xiong <italic>et al.</italic> found that stable expression of F3H insured the formation of dihydrokaempferol, the precursor of individual catechins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In the current study, we did not observe a difference in the expression levels of the C4H gene between tea and oil tea.</p><p>Our analysis of the DEGs related to flavonoid, theanine and caffeine metabolism in tea and oil tea suggests that these two species share common pathways, but the expression levels of some key genes in these pathyways might result in differential biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine.</p><p>Since tea is self-incompatible and recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, little genetic or genomic information is currently available for this species. Therefore, instead of providing a comprehensive in-depth investigation of the tea transcriptome, our experiment was designed to generate a quick view of the landscape. Moreover, since there were significant differences in the contents of the major components from one bud and five leaves of tea versus oil tea, we used the transcriptome data to search for key genes in these metabolic pathways and to uncover the factors underlying this divergence. The quality of tea in large part depends on its metabolic profiles. We therefore performed additional analyses of catechin, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis. We were able to detect almost all genes in these metabolic pathways. Many of these genes appeared to form multigene families, implying that the tea genome, like the genomes of many other higher plants, had undergone one or more rounds of genome duplication during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which might explain why higher levels of gene expression did not always lead to higher enzyme activity in the present study. In our annotated tea and oil tea transcriptome dataset, multiple transcripts encoding all DEGs involved in flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis pathways were identified.</p><p>Using a reciprocal best hit (RBH) method with relatively strict filters, 13,025 putative ortholog pairs were identified between tea and oil tea.

Of these ortholog pairs, 12,400 (95.2&#x000a0;% of 13,025) had a Ka/Ks value of 1 or less than 1, while 625 (4.8&#x000a0;% of 13,025) had a Ka/Ks value of over 1 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>), suggesting that they were under positive selection (PS). Functional GO analysis revealed that most genes under PS were grouped into GO terms cell, cell part, binding and metabolic process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Of the 625 PS genes, 68 exhibited differential expression among tissues (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Notably, some PS orthologs encode CHI and DFR in the flavonoid pathway. CHI is a rate-limiting enzyme, and DFR is key enzyme, in the catechin-producing branch of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Since the Ka/Ks ratio is widely used to detect selective pressure acting on protein-coding sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], rapid evolution of the CHI and DFR genes might be associated with adaptive selection in plants. No PS ortholog was assigned to the theanine or caffeine pathway. Environmental factors might play an important role in the evolution of the flavonoid pathway. Indeed, the highest quality green tea from Japan (a fine powder made from tencha) was grown in the shade and contains high levels of amino acids but low levels of catechins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>GO classification of orthologs between tea and oil tea under positive selection (Ka/Ks&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1).

Comparative transcriptome analyses demonstrated the connection between gene expression and the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine. Comparative transcriptome analyses comparing the levels of metabolites between tea and oil tea not only enabled us to provide a preliminary description of the gene expression profiles, but it also helped elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of characteristic biochemicals in tea.

Unigenes from tea and oil tea were aligned to each other iteratively using BLAST to identify homologous genes in the two species; more than 80&#x000a0;% of the length of each gene in a pair of homologous genes was strictly aligned.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>qRT-PCR analysis of the selected genes</title><p>To validate the accuracy of unigenes obtained from the assembled transcriptome and profiling of gene expression via RNA-Seq, qRT-PCR analysis was performed.
