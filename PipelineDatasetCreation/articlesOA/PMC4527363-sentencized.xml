<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Tea is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and tea leaves represent an important source of many biologically active metabolites such as flavonoids, theanine and caffeine [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Flavonoids mainly comprise flavan-3-ols (catechins), epicatechin (EC), gallocatechin (GC), epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C) and their respective gallate esters, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Tea leaves, which contain various secondary metabolites, are usually used as the raw material for tea production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the biosynthesis of catechins, theanine and caffeine in tea remain elusive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Great effort has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth, development [4, 5] and secondary metabolite production [6] in tea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies have focused on characterizing genes related to secondary metabolism, most of which were revealed through EST sequencing [7] and analysis of the transcriptomes from various tissues of tea plants [8, 9] or under different stress conditions [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>More recently, Shi et al. discovered novel candidate genes involved in pathways in tea by analyzing transcriptome data [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Liu et al. reported the discovery of a novel enzyme involved in galloylated catechin biosynthesis in tea plants [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of genomic information has become an obstacle to exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome sequencing represents an efficient approach to obtaining functional genomic information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>RNA-Seq is a rapid technique for genome-wide gene expression analysis that is widely used to determine gene structures and expression profiles in model organisms. De novo assembly of RNA-Seq data makes it possible to conduct gene analysis in the absence of reference genomes [14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Comparative transcriptomic studies have been performed to identify differential gene expression in several organisms [17–20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Another widely known member of Theaceae is oil tea, Camellia oleifera Abel, a tree serving as an important source of edible oil that is grown specifically in China. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Oil tea was genetically closely to tea, and they both belonged to genus Camellia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here, we performed RNA-Seq on buds and second leaves of tea and oil tea to characterize differences in gene expression between these two plants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Catechins, theanine and caffeine are the main characteristic compounds in tea, and the results of our analysis of these compounds are in accordance with recent reports [30, 31]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Since tea is self-incompatible and recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, little genetic or genomic information is currently available for this species. </plain></SENT>
