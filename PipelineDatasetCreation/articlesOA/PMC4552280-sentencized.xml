</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Seminal plasma contains secretions that are derived from the testis, epididymis and male accessory glands, including the prostate, seminal vesicles and Cowper’s gland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A considerable volume of research has focused on the mechanism(s) involved in production, morphology and function of spermatozoa, however, the critical role that seminal fluid plays in imparting motility and fertilization capacity to sperm is often neglected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Seminal fluid proteins are involved in the nourishment, protection, capacitation, and motility of sperm within the female reproductive tract and therefore, expected to contribute to the success of fertilization [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For example, the fertilization-promoting peptide (FPP) in semen stimulates penetration abilities of spermatozoa promoting fertilization [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Seminal fluid interacts with female reproductive tract, enhances implantation rates and early embryo development [3], increases the levels of uterine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor in mice (GM-CSF) [4] and upregulates the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) in uterine T-cells [5], thereby improving tolerance towards paternal antigens [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, an increasing number of seminal plasma proteins, such as insulin-like growth factor-I, alpha2-macroglobulin and the encephalin degrading enzymes, have been shown to be associated with sperm motility [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A common end to numerous pathways that lead to defective sperm function is attributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of molecules with incompletely reduced oxygen atom [10, 11] that are capable of reacting with almost all biomolecules leading to their altered function such as inhibition/activation of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Nature has bestowed aerobic organisms with an array of antioxidant defence mechanism(s) to fight off the noxious effects of ROS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, when their rate of generation exceeds the cell’s antioxidant defence, it leads to oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>ROS are highly reactive, non-specific and autocatalytic which qualify them to be good signalling molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Physiological levels of ROS is necessarily maintained in all aerobic cells [12] as well as in the semen for optimal sperm function such as capacitation, motility and acrosome reaction [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>While both leukocyte and spermatozoa serve as principal sources of ROS generation in semen, the spermatozoa are more susceptible to ROS—induced damage at stake against ROS due to its rich content of polyunsaturated fatty acids and poor antioxidant capacity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The first report on harmful effects of ROS on spermatozoa was published over 60 years ago [15] and a large body of literature has provided growing support for the concept that abnormal semen parameters and sperm damage are consequences of excessive levels of ROS resulting in impaired sperm function and subfertility [10, 16–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Consensus is growing about the clinical utility of seminal oxidative stress testing in infertility clinics [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A common pathology seen in two-thirds of infertile cases is attributed to oxidative stress in semen, although by different mechanisms [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A previous report from our laboratory suggests that high levels of ROS could be an independent marker of male factor infertility [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Because proteins have many different and unique biological functions, oxidative modifications to proteins can lead to diverse functional consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In fact, previous reports from various laboratories, including ours, suggest global change in proteomic profile of human spermatozoa and seminal plasma under oxidative stress conditions [23–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have reported the differential regulation of protein expression in infertile patients with variations in ROS levels as evidenced by global proteomic profiling [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Extracellular antioxidants are secreted by the male reproductive tract for minimizing oxidative stress suffered by spermatozoa throughout the post-testicular phase of sperm existence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Such protection is apparent in the epididymis [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>However, at the time of ejaculation, spermatozoa move out of a hypoxic epididymal environment into the well-vascularized lower female reproductive tract with higher oxygen tension [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Although spermatozoa spend a very short period of time in seminal plasma, in order to counteract such stress, seminal plasma is well-endowed with high levels of antioxidants, almost 10 times higher than that of blood [30].This is in line with the role of seminal plasma in protecting oxidative DNA damage of spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Here we test the hypothesis that the seminal plasma proteome influences fertilization and implantation in infertile men with various levels of ROS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The present study is the first report on comparative proteomic analysis of seminal plasma as a function of ROS levels in infertile patients with respect to fertile donors. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>However, the sperm concentration in these samples varied significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In proteomic studies protein concentration used has to be normalized i.e. protein contribution from the spermatozoa in each group must be similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In other words, the sperm concentration should also be normalized, i.e. equal amount of protein contributed by similar number of spermatozoa in each patient and the fertile group. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In addition to sperm cells and soluble molecules, mammalian semen contains a variety of membranous vesicles such as prostasomes and epididymosomes, which are derived from prostatic and epididymal epithelial cells, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Other tissues within the male genital tract, such as the vesicular glands, which produce the majority of seminal fluid, and the vasa deferentia, may also contribute membrane vesicles to the seminal plasma [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Epididymosomes are known to transfer proteins from the epididymal epithelium to passing sperm cells [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Many different processes have been attributed to prostasomes, including stimulation of sperm cell motility through delivery of Ca2+ signaling tools [47] and either inhibition [48] or stimulation [49] of the acrosome reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Prostasomes could also help to protect sperm cells from immune responses within the female reproductive tract by inhibiting the complement pathway [50], inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation [51], and inhibiting monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis [52], possibly via contained immunomodulatory proteins such as galectin 3 [53] or CD48 [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>However, with augmented levels of ROS, more organelle fragments, mitochondrial proteins and ER-Golgi intermediates were observed in the seminal plasma in comparison to control suggesting ROS mediated cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In fact, a significant enhancement in the expression of proteins associated with mitochondrial electron transport chain and ATP synthesis was noticed with increasing levels of ROS in seminal plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Since ~2 % of oxygen used by mitochondrial electron transport system is incompletely reduced to ROS particularly at the site of complex-I and -III, an enhanced activity of NDUFS1 (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, complex-I) as reported in the present study would lead to further augmentation of ROS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Since proteins involved in acute inflammatory response are underexpressed and since all samples used in the study were leukocyte negative, it is suggested that the enhanced production of ROS in Medium and High ROS infertile group could be due to defective sperm physiology or as a consequence of systemic disease process or stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the infertile group with Low ROS levels exhibited a under expression in stress response proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Besides HSPs, proteases play an important role in protein turn over. In this study, an augmentation in various proteases was noticed with respect to ROS levels particularly ADAMTS1 and MME. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Most of ADAMs are membrane-anchored glycoproteins that are comprised of a pro-domain, a metalloprotease-like domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich region, an epidermal growth factor repeat, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Fertilin, the first ADAM described, has been implicated in integrin-mediated sperm-egg binding [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Instead of the transmembrane region, ADAMTS-1 (ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 1) has three thrombospondin (TSP) type I motifs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>These TSP type I motifs of ADAMTS-1 are functional for binding to heparin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Kuno and Matsushima [59] have found that ADAMTS-1 is secreted and incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS-1 cleaves the hyalectan (hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan) aggrecan between a glutamate in the P1 pocket and small aliphatic residues in P1′. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>ADAMTS-1-null mice display several developmental abnormalities, primarily within the urogenital systems, affecting normal growth, organ morphology and function, and female fertility [60, 61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>A role for ADAMTS-1 in ovulation has been inferred from studies in rats [62], mice [63] and horses [64], which indicate that upregulation of ADAMTS-1 mRNA correlates temporally with the appearance of ADAMTS cleaved versican within the ECM of the cumulus oocyte complex [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>It has been previously shown that the heparin in seminal fluid stimulates sperm capacitation in bulls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, induction of sperm capacitation in the female reproductive tract is aided by heparin binding proteins secreted by the male accessory sex glands [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Seminal fluid heparin binding proteins are supposed to attach themselves to the sperm surface, especially lipids containing the phosphoryl-choline group, thus allowing heparin-like GAGs in the female reproductive tract to activate sperm capacitation [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, an over expression of ADAMTS1 will lead to excessive cleavage of heparin, rapid liquefaction of semen thereby affecting spermatozoon survival and the overall fertilization process, and this may be directly related to infertility in ROS groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME), also known as Neprilysin, neutral endopeptidase (NEP), cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10), and common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MME gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Neprilysin is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves peptides at the amino side of hydrophobic residues and inactivates several peptide hormones including glucagon, enkephalins, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, and bradykinin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>MMEs are essential for development and reproduction in mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The activities of MME in seminal fractions are very high in comparison to other tissues (10- to 20-fold higher than in the brain) [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the activity of these enzymes is altered in men with asthenozoospermia or necrozoospermia [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Subiran et al. [69] have reported the presence of MME in the prostasomes and in the neck region of few spermatozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>However, they observed that addition of thiorphan (analogue of encephalin that inhibits MME) maintained sperm motility at 2 h, but this effect was not reversed by naloxone which displaces enkephalins from their receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that MME regulates sperm motility by a mechanism that does not implicate the opioid system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>They opined that MME could be involved in the degradation of other peptides, such as bradykinins or tachykinins, which are present in seminal fluid [70, 71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>In this respect, it is interesting to note that in experiments performed with bull spermatozoa, addition of phosphoramidon, another MME inhibitor, produced an increase in sperm motility after 2 h of incubation, presumably by inhibition of bradykinin degradation [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>However, in the present study, we observed a ~2 fold increase in MME in the infertile group suggesting its role in other mechanism rather than sperm motility alone since the concentration, morphology and motility was impaired in the High ROS group in comparison to fertile controls [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an in depth study involving various regulators of MME activity in the seminal plasma from infertile patients with High ROS levels as well as its activity in seminal plasma from fertile men after induction of oxidative stress in vitro may shed more light on the mechanism of MME action in seminal plasma and its impact on sperm function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Since both ADAMST1 and MME inhibit angiogenesis, their enhanced activity which is principally from the prostasomes may adversely affect embryo implantation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, both the enzymes are cited upstream to the proteins involved in post-translational modification, protein folding and developmental disorder as revealed by IPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they may be responsible for altering the conformation and subsequent change in activities of key proteins having reproductive function leading to infertility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a secretory protein that belongs to family with sequence similarity 3, member D (FAM3D) is uniquely expressed in fertile donors and absent in all the three infertile groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Although not much is known about the function of this protein, it is predominantly found in placenta and it belongs to cytokine family of proteins [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its role in modulating post-ejaculatory event in female reproductive tract for tolerance cannot be ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Since MME is uniformly overexpressed in all the three infertile groups and FAM3D is uniquely expressed in fertile groups, it is suggested that measurement of ROS along with MME and FAM3D levels will be better markers for evaluating fertility status since a cohort of infertile patients (Low ROS group) also exhibit ROS levels comparable to fertile donors. </plain></SENT>
