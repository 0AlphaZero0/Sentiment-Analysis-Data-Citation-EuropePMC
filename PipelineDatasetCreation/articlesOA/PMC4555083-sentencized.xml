</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Chikungunya (CHIK), a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), has caused global concern since its re-emergence in several Asian and African countries (Powers and Logue, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>CHIKV belongs to the Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae, and is responsible for severe rheumatic manifestations associated with inflammation and musculoskeletal tissue destruction in humans (Suhrbier and La Linn, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CHIK epidemics have recently been reported in new areas, such as North America and the Caribbean, where the populations are naïve to this viral infection (Cassadou et al., 2013; Leparc-Goffart et al., 2014; Van Bortel et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Over 3 million suspected cases of CHIK have been recorded worldwide till now (Seppa, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a specific treatment, recent epidemics in previously naïve parts of the world have elevated CHIK to a global health problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The symptoms of CHIK appear after an incubation period of 4−7 days following CHIKV infection and mostly resolve within the acute phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although, the acute phase lasts for approximately 2 weeks, joint pain can persist for months or years following the initial infection, which is the hallmark of chronic CHIKV infection (Kelvin et al., 2011; Dupuis-Maguiraga et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently reported CHIK outbreaks have shown severe haemorrhagic and neurologic manifestations, which could be attributed to host immune response (Sissoko et al., 2008; Suhrbier et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The innate immune response plays a key role in virus suppression, propagation, and dissemination before induction of the adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells can kill target cells directly or interact with antigen-presenting cells, T cells to produce cytokines, which have antiviral activities and can trigger an adaptive immune response (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>NKT-like cells are a subset of αβ T cells that express NK activation receptors and also exhibit a highly specialized effector memory phenotype (Peralbo et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The functional activity of NK/NKT-like cells is regulated through their repertoire of activation (NKG2C, NKG2D, NKp30, NKp44, and NKp46) and inhibitory (CD158a, CD158b, KIR3DL1, and NKG2A) receptors, which recognize ligands on the surface of target cells (Peralbo et al., 2007; Watzl and Long, 2010; Das and Tripathy, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Upon activation, both NK and NKT-like cells produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, and lyse target cells by exocytosis of perforin and granzyme, leading to inhibition of viral replication and enhancement of cytotoxicity against target cells (Biron and Brossay, 2001; Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002; Peralbo et al., 2007; Das and Tripathy, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>During the granule dependent mechanism for killing of target cells, the lysosomal membrane associated protein 1 (LAMP1/CD107a) becomes detectable on the surface of NK cells and CTLs, indicating that CD107a expression is a marker of degranulation (Kannan et al., 1996; Bossi and Griffiths, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>NK cells contribution toward arthritis in the Ross River virus infection has been reported by Aaskov et al. (1987). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The higher levels of IFN-α and IL-12 observed in monocyte cultures within 2 h of CHIKV infection suggested their possible involvement in activating NK cells to increase antiviral activities (Gherardi et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009; Her et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Studies on humans and non-human primates have shown increased NK cell numbers in the early stages of CHIKV infection and suggested their participation in the early control of CHIKV (Labadie et al., 2010; Watzl and Long, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Petitdemange et al. (2011) performed phenotypic and functional analyses of NK cells from 25 patients in the early stages of acute CHIKV infection, and showed engagement of a clonal expansion of CD94/NKG2C NK cells that expressed receptors for HLA-C1 alleles, and correlated with the viral load, suggesting that NK cells sense CHIKV from the beginning of infection and may thus contribute to viral clearance (Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a study of CHIKV infection in knockout mice indicated that T cells but not NK cells play a role in viremia suppression (Poo et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>However, the available literature on NK cells in CHIKV infection is limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we performed peripheral phenotypic and functional analyses of T/NK/NKT-like cells from patients in the acute and convalescent stages of CHIKV infection, to assess the role of these lymphocytes in CHIK pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The type I interferon production and NK cell expression in patients in the early phase of CHIKV infection indicated the involvement of innate immune responses to CHIKV infection (Her et al., 2010; Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a detailed investigation of NK and NKT-like cell activities was undertaken in a transverse study from a CHIK outbreak, to explore the interplay between innate and adaptive responses in CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The lower percentages of CD3+CD8+ and CD3+ T cells observed in the acute patient group were concordant with the reported decrease in the percentage of CD3+ T cells in CHIKV-infected patients and supports the hypothesis of infection-associated profound T cell lymphopenia (Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The down regulation of both T cell populations could be a transient phenomenon, as shown by the comparable values observed in controls and convalescent patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>However, there are reports of high levels of CD8+ T cells in acute patients (Hoarau et al., 2010; Wauquier et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The difference in the results may be related to the large differences in sample size/the differences in the cluster of differentiation (CD) markers used/differences in the immune response of the two geographically different populations studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>A study using a mouse model indicated that CD8+ T cells play no role in the antiviral response or pathology of CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The higher levels of CD3+CD4+ T cells observed in the current patient population could account for the joint swelling observed, as reported in a study using a mouse model (Teo et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The positive correlation observed between the percentage of NK cells and the CHIKV load is concordant with the observations of Petitdemange et al. suggesting the involvement of NK cells from the inception of CHIKV infection (Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The function of NK cells is tightly orchestrated by a balance between signals derived from inhibitory and activation receptors (Cooper et al., 2001; De Maria et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Activation receptors, i.e., NKG2C, NKG2D, and DNAM-1, and natural cytotoxicity receptors, i.e., NKp46, NKp44, and NKp30, along with various co-stimulatory receptors are involved in human NK cell activation (Moretta et al., 2001; Lanier, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Reports that higher expression of the activation receptors NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, and CD244 and lower levels of the inhibitory receptors NKG2A and CD94 on NK cells produce an effective cytotoxic response are concordant with the results observed in the acute patient population studied here (Biron et al., 1999; De Maria et al., 2001; Lanier, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Corroborating these data, higher MFI of CD107a+ NK cells in the acute patients than in controls suggests that, the degranulation capacity per NK cell in the acute CHIKV patients is higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In a similar line, Srivastava et al. have demonstrated comparable cytotoxic activity against K562 cells in PBMCs in acute Hepatitis E patients regardless of lower NK cells percentage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon has been attributed to a greater cytotoxic potential per cell of the PBMCs from acute patients (Srivastava et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Higher expression of NKp44 and lower levels of NKG2A, NKp30, and NKp46, associated with cytotoxic NK cells, has been reported in Gabonese CHIK patients (Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Hershkovitz et al. demonstrated a direct protein-protein interaction between Flavivirus E protein and NKp44 that triggers the secretion of granules contained in NK cells, suggesting NKp44-mediated NK cytotoxic activity (Hershkovitz et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the higher percentage of NKp44+ NK/NKT-like cells and the higher cytotoxic potential of NK cells observed in acute CHIK patients suggest that NKp44-CHIKV protein interaction studies would be useful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The higher expression of NKp44+ NK cells observed in CHIK patients could be indicative of the activation of NK cells in CHIKV infection, irrespective of their replicative status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>NKp46+ NK cells in acute patients might modulate cytotoxicity, as reported in other viral infections (Mandelboim et al., 2001; Krämer et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>A lower level of CD244+ (2B4) expression has been correlated with impaired cytotoxic and IFN-γ-producing activities of NK cells (Marcoe et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Reverse observation of the current data indicates CD244+ as a mediator for NK/NKT-like cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>CD244+-mediated signaling can contribute both positively and negatively to viral clearance and immune-mediated disease (Marcoe et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>An understanding of how CD244 regulates both effector cell function and NK/T cell crosstalk may offer opportunities to define the roles of subsets of NK cells in early CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Lower expression of NKG2D+ NK/NKT-like cells observed here and in herpes virus infection suggests that NKG2D+ cells contribute little to activation status (Jonjic et al., 2008; Muntasell et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>However, Petitdemange et al. have shown a functional NK cells in spite of comparable NKG2D expression on NK cells in CHIK patients (Petitdemange et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The higher expression of CD161+ NKT-like cells observed in acute patients suggests the need for further exploration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>The elevation in activation receptors observed in the current patient population could be responsible for NK cell proliferation and might play a role in NK cell maintenance during infection and may deliver direct antiviral effects, as previously reported (Vidal et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The functionality of NK cells requires the differential engagement of cell surface receptors in combination with activities mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The higher IFN-γ expression observed on NKT-like cells of acute CHIK patients leads us to hypothesize that NKT-like cells play an immune regulatory role toward the cytotoxicity of NK cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The IFN-γ release observed in the ELISPOT assay and the IFN-γ expression observed on both NK/NKT-like cells in the convalescent stage are suggestive of the key roles played by these cells in the development of an effective adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the reported role of perforin in an alphavirus-infected mouse model, the higher perforin expression observed on NK cells of acute patients suggested that cytotoxicity could be perforin-mediated phenomena (Kägi and Hengartner, 1996). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>It may be a coincidence that our current study population from the recent CHIK outbreak contained more male than female individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Further, statistical analyses of each assay parameter following separation by gender were comparable to the pooled results, suggesting that the data were not influenced by the gender ratio. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that, during acute CHIKV infection, NK cells are cytotoxic (perforin), and that NKT-like cells elicited an effector response (IFN-γ expression) followed by an adaptive response (IFN-γ release in the ELISPOT assay and IFN-γ expression on NK/NKT-like cells) in the convalescent phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The heightened cytotoxicity and comparable effector functions of NK cells suggested a dichotomy of NK cells in acute CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>The present study elucidates the potential role of activation receptors on cytotoxic NK cells in influencing the pathogenesis of early CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Further, study of the molecular mechanisms that limit viral dissemination/establishment of chronic disease will aid in understanding how NK/NKT-like cells control CHIKV infection. </plain></SENT>
