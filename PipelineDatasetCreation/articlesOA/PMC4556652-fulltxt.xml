A33 is a target for neutralizing antibody responses against EEV. In this study, we produced seven murine anti-A33 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) by immunizing mice with live VACV, followed by boosting with the soluble A33 homodimeric ectodomain. Five A33 specific MAbs were capable of neutralizing EEV in the presence of complement. All MAbs bind to conformational epitopes on A33 but not to linear peptides. To identify the epitopes, we have adetermined the crystal structures of three representative neutralizing MAbs in complex with A33. We have further determined the binding kinetics for each of the three antibodies to wild-type A33, as well as to engineered A33 that contained single alanine substitutions within the epitopes of the three crystallized antibodies. While the Fab of both MAbs A2C7 and A20G2 binds to a single A33 subunit, the Fab from MAb A27D7 binds to both A33 subunits simultaneously. A27D7 binding is resistant to single alanine substitutions within the A33 epitope. A27D7 also demonstrated high-affinity binding with recombinant A33 protein that mimics other orthopoxvirus strains in the A27D7 epitope, such as ectromelia, monkeypox, and cowpox virus, suggesting that A27D7 is a potent cross-neutralizer. Finally, we confirmed that A27D7 protects mice against a lethal challenge with ectromelia virus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Before the eradication of smallpox (variola virus) from nature, hundreds of million of people succumbed to the infection. The discovery of vaccinia virus (VACV), the active ingredient of the smallpox vaccine, ultimately led to the eradiation of smallpox from the human population. Vaccination with VACV leads to a strong antibody response that protects against variola virus. As the protective antibodies recognize viral proteins that are highly similar in sequence between the different orthopox strains, such as A33 used in this study, several antibodies have the capacity to neutralize a larger breath of orthopx viruses. In this study we have identified an anti-A33 antibody from a larger panel that exhibits a unique binding mode to A33. This antibody, A27D7, is also resistant to single amino acid changes throughout the protein and binds to engineered A33 variants that mimic ectromelia and orthopox A33 in the antibody-binding site. As the antibody further protects against ectromelia infection of mice, this antibody appears to be a potent orthopox cross-species protective antibody with therapeutic potential.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The SSRL Structural Molecular Biology Program is supported by the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://science.energy.gov/ber/">http://science.energy.gov/ber/</ext-link>), and by the National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">http://www.nih.gov</ext-link>), National Institute of General Medical Sciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nigms.nih.gov/">http://www.nigms.nih.gov/</ext-link>) (including P41GM103393) and the National Center for Research Resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NCRR.htm">http://www.nih.gov/about/almanac/organization/NCRR.htm</ext-link>)(P41RR001209).

Its success pertains to its high infectivity and thermal stability, and the strong innate and B-cell immune responses that it triggers [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With the eradication of circulating variola virus from the human population, large-scale vaccination efforts against smallpox were ended [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, the general population is no longer protected against orthopoxviruses. This lack of immunity is a concern due to the zoonotic risk of orthologous strains [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] such as monkeypox virus (MPXV) and specific strains of the cowpox species (CPXV) [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as their potential use as biological weapon [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is because of the latter that certain professional groups, including military personnel are still getting vaccinated.</p><p>The vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine used in the eradication campaign was highly effective, but was associated with adverse side effects. The frequency of side effects was acceptable at the time where smallpox was a major health threat but is unacceptable in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. More recently a vaccinia virus clonal isolate, ACAM2000 has been used, produced using modern cell cultures [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Highly attenuated vaccinia strains such as Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) have been available for decades [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Large MVA clinical trials, and clinical use, have found that MVA has an outstanding safety profile, but this is accompanied by a decreased immunogenicity resulting in the need for two immunizations. Moreover, since MVA usage was predominantly after smallpox eradication, the protective efficiency of MVA toward variola virus was not proven. Research on new orthopox vaccines continues, both in response to these concerns and as a means of understanding why the vaccinia virus smallpox vaccine is so effective.</p><p>The strategies leading to today's next generation candidate smallpox vaccines are diverse: they include, but are not limited to, the use of (i) vaccinia immunization in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], (ii) DNA immunization using select immunodominant antigens [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and (iii) soluble poxvirus proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A limited number of immunodominant antigens [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] have been linked to successful protection: intracellular mature virion (IMV) antigens A27 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], D8 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], F9 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], H3 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], L1 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) antigens A33 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and B5 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Maximal protection is obtained with vaccines combining recombinant membrane proteins from both forms of the infectious virus (IMV and the EEV). The virus encodes the seven proteins A33, A34, A36, A56, B5, F12, and F13, that are specific for the EEV membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Among those, A33 is a 23 kDa, homodimeric type II transmembrane that undergoes both O- and N-glycosylation (N125 and N135) [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both N-linked glycosylation sites are used in vaccinia but variola virus and monkeypox virus lack the equivalent N125 site [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A33 controls the incorporation of A36 into the EEV particle and subsequently the production of actin tails. Therefore, A33 plays an important role in effective cell-to-cell spread within the host [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A33 is also required for proper trafficking of B5 to the EEV-specific membrane and proper formation of infectious EEV [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A33 contains a membrane-proximal cysteine on the A33 ectodomain that forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge. However, this cysteine is not required for the production of infectious extracellular virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The crystal structure of the ectodomain of A33 revealed an unusual C-type lectin-fold domain, similar in overall architecture to several NK cell ligands [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Antibodies targeting EEV proteins can protect against viral challenge. For example, anti-B5 mAbs are protective against lethal orthopoxvirus challenges in multiple small animals models [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and anti-A33 antibodies can be protective in vivo [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Protection mediated by anti-B5 antibodies is not mediated by conventional direct virus neutralization, as EEV is highly resistant to direct neutralization by anti-B5 antibodies, anti-A33 antibodies, and other EEV targets [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, protective anti-B5 mAbs are highly efficient at facilitating complement-mediated neutralization of EEV, complement-mediated lysis of infected cells, and Fc-dependent protective mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Mechanisms of protective action of A33 antibodies are similar to those of B5 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Using X-ray crystallography, we mapped the A33 epitopes for three different antibodies and characterized their VACV-neutralization potential <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further identified one antibody (A27D7) that binds to A33 with high affinity, even when epitope residues are individually changed to other amino acids. We further tested the MAb binding to recombinant A33, where epitope residues were replaced with those from other orthopoxviruses and observed high affinity binding for A27D7. In an ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection model, A27D7 MAb was protective. In summary this suggests, that A27D7 is cross-species protective and able to neutralize a range of different orthopoxviruses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Monoclonal anti-A33 antibody characterization</title><p>We generated seven anti-A33 antibodies (A2C7, A26C7, A17D7, A25D11, A27D7, A25F2, and A20G2) by VACV immunization of mice followed by boosting with recombinant A33 protein. DNA sequencing revealed that the seven MAbs are assembled from five distinct heavy chain (HC) and 4 different light chain (LC) sequences (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>): While A2C7, A17D7, and A25F2 have distinct HC sequences, A26C7 shares the HC with A27D7 and A25D11 shares the HC with A20G2, with only one amino acid exchange in CDR L1 (L to F). The LC sequences of A26C7 and A27D7 are nearly identical, while A25D11 is almost identical to A20G2. Both LC pairs only differ by one amino acid substitution in CDR1.

In summary, antibodies A25D11 and A20G2 are identical except for one amino acid difference and the same is true for antibodies A26C7 and A27D7, resulting in a total of five distinct antibodies, of which we have complete sequences for A2C7, and A26C7/A27D7, A25D11/A20G2, and A25F2.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>

We observed two major peaks of different molecular weight (MW), indicating that the Fab&#x02019;s bound to A33 with different stoichiometries. Both Fab&#x02019;s A26C7 and A27D7 eluted with a lower MW when bound to A33, while the Fab&#x02019;s of A2C7, A25D11, and A20G2 formed a higher MW complex with A33. The SEC data indicated that a single Fab of A26C7 and A27D7 bound to one A33 dimer, while A2C7, A25D11, and A20G2 each bound with one Fab to one A33 subunit (2 Fab&#x02019;s per A33 dimer). We next assessed the real-time binding kinetics with the three representative antibodies A2C7, A27D7, and A20G2. Intact antibodies were immobilized on biosensors and binding to A33 in solution was measured by Biolayer interferometry (BLI) (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). A33 bound with very high affinity to the antibodies A2C7 and A20G2 (K<sub>D</sub> ~65 pM), consistent with the SEC data, where the A33 dimer can simultaneously bind to two separate Fab&#x02019;s. This binding mode is characterized by a very slow dissociation rate. A33 also bound with high affinity to the antibody A27D7 (K<sub>D</sub>~14nM), yet roughly 400-fold weaker compared to A2C7 and A20G2. Since the A33 dissociation rates were very slow for both A2C7 and A20G2, which made calculation of the binding kinetics less robust, we repeated the binding assay but immobilized A33 instead of the MAbs (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). Both A2C7 and A20G2 showed similar binding to chip bound A33 in this reversed orientation with a ~2 to 4-fold difference in K<sub>D</sub> each (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). However, MAb A27D7 showed very slow dissociation from A33, consistent with a model in which each Fab can bind to two separate A33 dimers on the sensor tip. As a result, the apparent binding affinity increased from 14 nM (MAb immobilized) to beyond 1pM (A33 immobilized), as no dissociation could be reliably measured. This led to A27D7 being the antibody with the highest affinity in this setting. All subsequent kinetic binding studies using A33 mutants were performed using A33 immobilized on the sensor tip. This binding orientation also mimics the antibody binding during infection, where A33 is embedded in the EEV membrane.</p><fig id="ppat.1005148.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1005148.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Fab/A33 binding interactions.</title><p>(A) Determination of A33/Fab binding stoichiometry by size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

For antigen-antibody interfaces, Sc values of 0.64 to 0.68 [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have been reported, illustrating that the A2C7/A33 interaction is very specific. This interface is held together by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges involving every CDR loop (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Additionally, a number of water molecules mediate H-bonds between A33 and A2C7 (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The presence of water molecules in the heavy chain interface may explain the slightly lower specificity observed for this chain, reflected by its Sc value of 0.67 vs. 0.68 for the light chain, since waters were not included in Sc calculations. Gln173 is a major contact residue of the A2C7 epitope and intersects with of almost every CDR loop. It forms multiple hydrogen bonds via its backbone and side chain (H1, H2, H3, and L3; <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>): The Gln173 backbone carbonyl elicits a favorable hydrogen bond with H2:Tyr50 hydroxyl, while the side chain amide group elicits a hydrogen bond with H1:Tyr35 hydroxyl. Additionally, its side chain amide group elicits favorable hydrogen bonds L3:Ser91 and with L3:Trp96. Because its backbone is involved in the interaction, we mutated this residue to an arginine instead of an alanine, on the basis that the bulky and positively charged side chain may induce steric clashes at the interface in the mutant and will therefore result in a decreased affinity. As expected, we observed complete loss of A2C7 binding to the A33 Gln173Arg mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the Gln173Arg substitution is found in ECTV suggesting that A2C7 would be unable to protect against ectromelia challenge. A33 residue Asp170 is located on a flexible loop and is contacted by both H and L chain. It forms a salt bridge with L2:Lys55 and a hydrogen bond with L1:Tyr32. However, the Asp170Ala mutation did not affect the binding affinity of A2C7-MAb, suggesting it is not a critical binding residue. It should be noted however, that for unknown reasons, the overall binding signal is much lower compared to the wild-type A33 (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>The A33/A20G2 complex</title><p>The ASU of the A33:A20G2 complex contains 2 Fab molecules bound to one A33 dimer (1 Fab per A33 subunit). Although the epitopes on each A33 monomer should be identical, subtle differences have been observed between both binding interfaces and will be reported where necessary. This could be due to a subtle influence of crystal packing. A20G2 binds a similar epitope compared to A2C7. Sixteen residues of each A33 subunit are in contact with sixteen residues of the A20G2 Fab (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Both H and L chain grasp the tip of each A33 subunit similar to a pincer, resulting in the binding of two Fab molecules per A33 dimer (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The binding stoichiometry is consistent with the SEC data (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The Sc value is 0.68 and 0.69 for both antibody/antigen binding interfaces, while the BSA is 802 and 864 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for each of the two Fab/A33 interfaces (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). As such, the A20G2 epitope is slightly larger compared to A2C7. Despite numerous amino acid differences in the CDRs, A20G2 approaches the antigen with an overall similar topology compared to A2C7, with the exception of CDRs L2 and H3. This is reflected in an overall change in binding angle (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). L1 plays a major role in both complexes, as it clamps onto one side of each A33 subunit (A33 residues Phe119, Asp155, Gly156, Asn157, Asp170, and Ser172, while Ser154 and Asn157 are exclusive to A20G2). L3, H1 and H2 target a similar epitope at the top outward edges of A33, centered around residue Gln173 in both A33 molecules. Similar to A2C7, the Gln173Arg mutation also fully abrogates A20G2 binding (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In A2C7, the A33:Asp170-L2:Lys50 salt bridge is replaced against a hydrogen bond in A20G2 involving L3:Tyr96 (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This is the result of L2:Lys50 in A20G2 being replaced with L2:Leu50 in A2C7. However, the Asp170Ala mutation did not have any impact on binding of A20G2 to A33, similarly to the binding of A2C7.</p><p>To compare the overall binding of A2C7 and A20G2 on A33, we superimposed both the variable regions of the L as well as H chains separately. The L chain superimposed well even at the CDRs (RMSD = 1.12 &#x000c5; for C&#x003b1; residues 1&#x02013;119). However, heavy chains did not superimpose well overall (RMSD = 3.73 &#x000c5; for C&#x003b1; residues 1&#x02013;115) but appeared to have a high structural homology when superimposing only residues until H3 (RMSD = 0.77 &#x000c5; for C&#x003b1; 2&#x02013;94). We conclude that sequence divergences of these two antibodies had little effect over most of the antigenic interface, but that it induced major local topological differences in the CDR H3 region. This is not surprising since the H3 loop is much longer in A2C7 due to a four amino acid insertion (H3:AR<underline>QWG</underline>G<underline>A</underline>MDY), compared to A20G2 (H3:ARGMDY).</p><p>Interestingly, the A33 mutation Leu118Arg that is located on both epitopes for A2C7 and A20G2 had no effect on the A20G2 binding kinetics, while they fully impaired A2C7, likely due to a clash with L3, which approached A33 from a different angle. Similarly, the mutation Asp168Ala also did not impair binding of A20G2 significantly (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). In conclusion, A2C7 and A20G2 target similar but not identical epitopes mostly due to sequence differences within H3 and L3.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>The A33/A27D7 complex</title><p>A27D7 MAb engages A33 in a drastically different manner compared to A2C7 and A20G2. A single A27D7-Fab binds at the A33 dimer interface, with the L and H chains contacting both A33 subunits. This correlates well with the SEC data, which suggested that one Fab binds one A33 dimer (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). BSA for both L and H chains bound to A33 are larger compared to A2C7 and A20G2 (L = 525.3 vs. H = 630.2 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) for a total of 1155.5 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (Fab:Ag) (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Sc values of 0.71 and 0.74 are among the highest Sc values reported for any Fab:Ag interface and indicate a highly specific binding interaction.</p><p>Eighteen residues of the H chain contact sixteen A33 residues, while fifteen residues of the L chain contact twelve A33 residues (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). CDR H1 interacts only with A33 subunit A (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). H1:Tyr32 forms hydrogen bonds with three A33 residues (Glu149, Thr160, and Lys161), the most favored of which is with Glu149 (2.53 &#x000c5;). In addition, a salt bridge is formed between Lys161 and H1:Asp31. Surprisingly, the Lys161Ala mutation did not impair A27D7 binding (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). CDR H2 interacts only with A33 subunit B. A33 residue Asp115 is a central residue of the H2 interface, as it forms six potential hydrogen bonds with H2 residues Gly53, Gly54, Gly55, and Thr56. Interestingly, the Asp115Ala mutation only slightly affects A33 binding (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Three other hydrogen bonds link H2 residues Thr56 and Tyr58 to Gln117, Met118, and Asp121. Van der Waals contacts are the most extensive of the interface, with forty-two contacts compared to only eighteen in the H1/A33 interface. Water molecules do not contribute largely to this interface (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p><p>CDR H3 is centrally positioned in the A33 dimer groove, and contacts residues of both A33 subunits. H3 forms three distinct hydrogen bonds with A33 subunit B: Lys177 interacts with H3:Ala97 and H3:Ser98. The third hydrogen bond is formed between Tyr116 and H3:Tyr99. Water molecules are recruited to the interface and allow for water-mediated hydrogen bonds with A33 subunit A residues Glu149 and Asp150. The H3 loop has a number of VdW contacts that is comparable to H1 (20 vs. 18). Overall, H3 appears to make a modest contribution to the interface compared to H1 and H2.</p><p>The A27D7 light chain does not elicit any salt bridge with A33, and its interaction with the antigen is mostly driven by van der Waals contacts. In particular L2 and L3 each interact specifically with either one of the A33 subunits. L1 is relatively short compared to group II MAbs A20G2 and A2C7 (12 vs. 16 residues). A single residue L1:Tyr32, forms one hydrogen bond with Asp150 and also accounts for all VdW contacts with the A33 subunit B. L2 interacts solely with A33 subunit A, with a total of two hydrogen bonds and 30 VdW contacts. Moreover, four residues that elicited VdW interactions are involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond network between L2 residues Asn53, Leu54, Ser56, and Ala60 of A27D7 and A33 residues Gln173<sub>A</sub>, Asp168<sub>A</sub>, Ser172<sub>A</sub>, and Val175<sub>A</sub>. CDR L3 (Ser92 and Leu94) forms an extensive hydrogen bond network with A33 residues Gln173<sub>B</sub>, Glu174<sub>B</sub>, Val175<sub>B</sub> and Arg176<sub>B</sub>. Binding affinity of A27D7-MAb to A33 mutant Gln173Arg, however, remained in the picomolar range (K<sub>D</sub> = 20 pM), suggesting that the many contacts formed between A27D7 and A33 can compensate for the various single amino acid substitutions on A33 (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>As the Fab of A27D7 does not form identical contacts with both subunits of A33, some A33 residues will only be in contact with the Fab once. However, Tyr116, Asp150, and Val175 form contacts with the Fab in both A33 subunits, and among those, Tyr116 was chosen for single alanine scanning mutagenesis, as it might contribute more to the overall binding energy than the previously assessed A33 residues (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). The Tyr116Ala mutation led to a significant decrease in binding affinity (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>; K<sub>D</sub> = 0.54 nM). Next, we asked whether the moderately reduced binding affinity of the mutants Asp115Ala, Lys161Ala, Asp170Ala and Gln173Arg could be the result of a particularly mutation-tolerant A27D7/A33 binding interface, or because these residues are not making important contacts with the antibody. To answer this question, we created the double mutant Asp115Ala/Tyr116Ala and observed a synergistic effect of the mutations, as affinity decreased another ~20-fold compared to Tyr116Ala only (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>; K<sub>D</sub> = 12.47 nM). However, even combining both mutations still resulted in low nM binding affinity suggesting that a large number of energetically favorable interactions still remain intact and enable the specific binding interaction.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Cross-species neutralization abilities of anti-A33 antibodies</title><p>The robustness of A27D7 binding to single alanine A33 mutants made this antibody an attractive candidate for cross-neutralization studies. We therefore explored the potential of our anti-A33 (VACV) MAbs to bind to recombinant A33 that mimics the epitope of the orthopox strains such as cowpox Brighton (CPXV-Br), MPXV, and ECTV. Sequence alignment of A33 from different orthopoxviruses revealed that no more than three residues out of the thirty-eight possible variations differ in the A33 epitopes among the analyzed orthopox strains (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The A2C7 epitope contains only two of those variations, located at positions 118 and 173. A27D7 and A20G2 epitopes contain the same, plus an additional residue at position 117. All residues that may vary within the epitopes are highlighted in red (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), regardless of the viral strain. Using site-directed mutagenesis we made two recombinant forms of A33. The A33 variant Gln117Lys/Leu118Ser both mimics the epitope of CPXV and MPXV, while the A33 variant Gln117Lys/Leu118Ser/Gln173Arg is specific for ECTV. Both antibodies A2C7 and A20G2 failed to bind to the ECTV variant, while A20G2 still bound with a ~9-fold lower affinity to the CPXV/MPXV variant. As expected however, A27D7 was able to bind both A33 variants with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> of 47&#x02013;117 pM) (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005148.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).

Mice were treated with a single 100 &#x003bc;g IP injection of the antibodies at either T = -1 or T = +1 relative to challenge with 1000 PFU of ECTV. An additional group of mice was treated with the potent antiviral cidofivir (CDV), which is known to be protective against this dose of ECTV. Following challenge, we observed that mice treated with antibodies A2C7 and A20G2 were not able to statistically protect mice against challenge when compared to mice treated with vehicle (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>).

The slightly reduced efficacy of the antibodies when administered at T = -1 is likely a reflection of the antibody half-life, which we have not addressed in this assay.

The three neutralizing MAbs, A2C7, A20G2, and A27D7 were further tested in a VACV<sub>WR</sub> challenge model, where they all demonstrated full protection. For each of these antibodies we determined the A33 epitope using X-ray crystallography and assessed the robustness of antibody binding to A33 variants with amino acid exchanges in the various epitopes. We further identified that A27D7 was unique in its binding to A33 and exhibited resistance to single alanine substitutions within the epitope. A27D7 further bound to engineered A33 mimicking other orthopox strains within its epitope and was protective against in vivo challenge with ECTV. In contrast, both A2C7 and A20G2, which failed to bind the ECTV A33 mimic failed to protect against ECTV challenge as expected. The strong protection of A27D7 against ECTV challenge at day 1 post infection is surprising but we believe a reflection of its unique binding to A33, in which the antibody-antigen interface can tolerate several amino acid exchanges and still bind with high affinity. There is slightly reduced protection when the A27D7 is administered 1 day prior to ECTV infection. As A27D7 fully protects against VACV when given at day -1, it could be that the antibody half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> is more important during the ECTV challenge, especially since the A27D7 binds with reduced affinity to the ECTV A33 mimic compared to VACV A33 and a higher dose of antibody could therefore be needed for full protection.</p><p>A former study showed that VACV-A33 vaccination protected mice against ECTV but interestingly not against CPXV-Br [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The reason for the lack of protection remains unclear, because VACV is more closely related to CPXV-Br than to ECTV (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). To address this conundrum, we have developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay to assess the potential cross-neutralization ability of a given antibody in three steps. First, we used single alanine mutagenesis to engineer variants of A33 in which epitope residues that were predicted to be important for antibody binding based on our structural data were targeted. Next, the real-time binding kinetics of the A33 variants to the different antibodies was tested. Antibodies that showed robust binding to different A33 variants (e.g. A27D7) were further assessed in their ability to bind to A33 variants that have been engineered in their epitope to mimic the sequence of other orthopox strains, including ECTV and CPXV/MPXV. If high affinity binding to these A33 cross-species variants is still observed, we predict that the antibodies would be protective. Using such <italic>in vitro</italic> approach, rather than expressing all of the orthologous A33 antigens individually, is highly time and cost efficient and sufficient to predict the outcome of specific MAb-guided protection experiments, and does not require any stringent safety procedure associated to virulent strains.</p><p>In our experiments the antibody A2C7, which failed to bind to the A33 Gln173Arg ECTV mimic, also failed to protect against lethal challenge with ECTV, as expected. Position 173 is occupied by arginine in ECTV, while glutamine is conserved in all other strains (<xref rid="ppat.1005148.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Position 173 is also common to all three epitopes and we expected Gln173Arg mutation to decrease binding of all three MAbs. It indeed resulted in abrogating A33 binding to A2C7 and A20G2. However, its effect was opposite in A27D7, as it reversed the loss of binding conferred by Gln117Lys/Leu118Ser mutations. Beside favoring A27D7 in terms of protectivity for the aforementioned reasons, our study also illustrates how divergent the properties of antibodies targeting a given Ag can be. In this study, we have ranked our representative MAbs using various properties, such as binding affinity the location and composition of the epitope, the binding stoichiometry (1 or 2 Fab per A33 dimer), and the tolerance to alanine scanning mutagenesis within the epitope. The most potent antibody (highest affinity) is not necessarily the top candidate in each category and each MAb may be raised and optimized for a particular property. For example, A27D7 is characterized by a &#x0003e;10-fold higher binding affinity for VACV-A33 compared to A2C7 and A20G2. However, A2C7 and A20G2 present specific binding properties, such as increased MAb clustering resulting from A33 bivalency. This suggests that when considering a particular antigen, the efficiency of an antibody response most likely relies on the combination and the synergetic effect of different antibodies targeting a specific Ag. This added layer of complexity has been so far overlooked, and we hope that its study will be implemented in future protection models. This could be studied in an <italic>in vivo</italic> protectivity assay by comparing the responses obtained while using individual MAbs, to those obtained using cocktails combining MAbs with different features, such as discussed above.</p><p>The data we obtained using single alanine scanning mutagenesis within the A27D7 antibody epitope may explain why a previous study observed that vaccination with recombinant Sindbis virus expressing A33 VACV conferred protection against ECTV but not CPXV [<xref rid="ppat.1005148.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this case, vaccination might not have elicited anti-A33 antibodies that could bind the Gln173Arg variation found in cowpox. Residue 173 is adjacent in the A33 crystal structure to residues 117 and 118 and as such topographically part of the CPII region that the authors identified as containing the protective epitope. We observed a similar effect for A27D7, which bound tighter to our A33 ECTV mimic than to the CPXV counterpart, after mutating this single residue from a Gln to an Arg. However, while we have not tested if A27D7 can protect against cowpox challenge, binding of the MAb to the cowpox A33 epitope variant is still in the nanomolar range, which we predict to be sufficient to confer protection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>A33 protein expression and mutagenesis</title><p>The A33 expression vector (VACV strain Acam2000 GenBank: AY313847) containing the two mutations Leu118Met and Leu140Met was graciously provided by David Garboczi (NIH/NIAID).

Amino acid positions in C can differ with alignment in B by up to 3, due to different lengths of the sequences.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.1005148.s009.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. David Garboczi (NIH-NIAID) for supplying the initial A33 (89&#x02013;185) construct and for helpful discussion.
