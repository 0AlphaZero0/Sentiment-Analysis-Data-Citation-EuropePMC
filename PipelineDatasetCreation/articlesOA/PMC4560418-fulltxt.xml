In the present study, two genes from <italic>Sesuvium portulacastrum</italic>, encoding plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (SpSOS1) and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (SpAHA1), were cloned. Localization of each protein was studied in tobacco cells, and their functions were analyzed in yeast cells. Both SpSOS1 and SpAHA1 are plasma membrane-bound proteins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses showed that <italic>SpSOS1</italic> and <italic>SpAHA1</italic> were induced by salinity, and their expression patterns in roots under salinity were similar. Compared with untransformed yeast cells, SpSOS1 increased the salt tolerance of transgenic yeast by decreasing the Na<sup>+</sup> content. The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity at plasma membrane vesicles was higher in <italic>SpSOS1</italic>-transgenic yeast than in the untransformed strain. No change was observed in the salt tolerance of yeast cells expressing <italic>SpAHA1</italic> alone; however, in yeast transformed with both <italic>SpSOS1</italic> and <italic>SpAHA1</italic>, SpAHA1 generated an increased proton gradient that stimulated the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity of SpSOS1. In this scenario, more Na<sup>+</sup> ions were transported out of cells, and the yeast cells co-expressing <italic>SpSOS1</italic> and <italic>SpAHA1</italic> grew better than the cells transformed with only <italic>SpSOS1</italic> or <italic>SpAHA1</italic>. These findings demonstrate that the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SpSOS1 and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase SpAHA1 can function in coordination. These results provide a reference for developing more salt-tolerant crops via co-transformation with the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31260218, 31160185), the Scientific and Technological Foundation of Hainan Province (No. ZDZX2013023) and the Central Level, Non-profit, Scientific Research Institutes for Basic R&#x00026;D Operations Special Fund Program (No. ITBB130302).

However, excess sodium in the cytoplasm is toxic to some important physiological and biochemical processes, and efflux of Na<sup>+</sup> out of the cytoplasm is an important mechanism of salt tolerance. Excess Na<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm can be transported into the external medium across the plasma membrane or into the vacuole across the tonoplast, such that the Na<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm is maintained at a non-toxic concentration. The tonoplast Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter NHX compartmentalizes Na<sup>+</sup> into vacuoles using the proton gradient generated by vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase (H<sup>+</sup>-PPase), whereas the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SOS1, which is driven by the proton gradient generated by plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases, transports Na<sup>+</sup> out of cells [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>NHX proteins from more than 60 plant species have been reported to date [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtNHX1 was the first NHX protein to be described, and its overexpression can significantly improve the salt tolerance of transgenic yeast or plants [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137447.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Many lines of evidence have indicated that tonoplast-bound NHXs function as Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters and mediate plant salt tolerance by sequestering Na<sup>+</sup> into vacuoles [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As Na<sup>+</sup> influx into vacuoles via NHXs is energized by the H<sup>+</sup> gradient created by vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, these two H<sup>+</sup>-pumps should play important roles in plant salt tolerance. Indeed, the salt tolerance of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> harboring <italic>AVP1</italic> (vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-PPase 1) was stronger than that of wild type [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, the co-expression of NHX and AVP conferred stronger salt tolerance to transgenic plants than NHX or AVP alone, a finding that further demonstrates the relationship between NHX and the H<sup>+</sup>-pump, with plant NHX proteins functioning as Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters using the force from the proton gradient produced by the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-PPase [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SOS1 is the only Na<sup>+</sup> efflux protein at the plant plasma membrane reported to date and functions as a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport system that is driven by the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-pump H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the salt tolerance of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transformed with the <italic>AtSOS1</italic> gene is significantly higher than that of wild type [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity is involved in plant adaptation to salinity [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These findings suggest that the salt tolerance efficiency of the simultaneous expression of SOS1 and plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase genes should be further enhanced, just as the co-expression of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-PPase and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter results in even higher salt tolerance. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to determine whether the combination of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter with H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase effectively increases salt tolerance in transgenic organisms. Herein, a plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter gene, <italic>SpSOS1</italic>, and a plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase gene, <italic>SpAHA1</italic>, were cloned from <italic>Sesuvium portulacastrum</italic>, a halophyte with optimal growth at 200&#x02013;300 mM NaCl [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0137447.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Functional analyses indicated that SpSOS1 could transport Na<sup>+</sup> out of cells using the force of the proton gradient generated by SpAHA1. In particular, the co-expression of <italic>SpSOS1</italic> and <italic>SpAHA1</italic> conferred stronger salt tolerance to transgenic yeast cells than the expression of either gene alone. These results may be helpful in developing more salt-tolerant crops through the co-expression of SOS1 and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant material and cultivation</title><p>
<italic>Sesuvium portulacastrum</italic> (L.) L. plants, dicotyledonous halophytes belonging to the Aizoaceae family, were collected from the seashore of Haikou, China, and propagated through cuttings (<xref rid="pone.0137447.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). The collection site in the seashore is a wasteland, so no one is responsible for this field. Furthermore, <italic>Sesuvium portulacastrum</italic> grows worldwide and is not specifically exploited or an endangered or protected species. Therefore, no specific permission was required for the collection of the plants. Three stem internodes were cut from the mother plants, incubated in Hoagland solution and allowed to grow at room temperature. After 3 weeks, uniform seedlings were treated with 0, 400, 600 or 800 mM NaCl; three replications for each treatment were performed. The roots and leaves were harvested at various times (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 h) after NaCl treatment and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Cloning of <italic>SpSOS1</italic> and <italic>SpAHA1</italic>

SOS1 is the only plant plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup> efflux protein reported to date; thus, the protein is likely a key halotolerance factor in plants. SpSOS1 shows similarities with certain reported plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters, and subcellular localization analysis showed that SpSOS1 is distributed at the plasma membrane in plant cells, suggesting that SpSOS1 can regulate Na<sup>+</sup> efflux and is involved in salt resistance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>portulacastrum</italic>. SpAHA1 is a plasma membrane-bound protein and has high similarity to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AHA family, indicating that SpAHA1 functions as a H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase at the plasma membrane and provides energy for metabolic processes in plants.</p><p>Real-time PCR indicated that the <italic>SpSOS1</italic> expression in roots increased sharply within the first 3&#x02013;6 h and then decreased to basal levels under salt stress. In leaves, no obvious change in <italic>SOS1</italic> transcriptional abundance was found during NaCl treatment (up to 48 h). The salt-induced expression pattern of <italic>SpSOS1</italic> is similar to that of rice <italic>SOS1</italic>, which shows mRNA accumulation in roots but not in shoots under salinity [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In wheat, the <italic>SOS1</italic> expression level in leaves was not up-regulated under salinity treatment, but mRNA abundance in leaves was also substantially lower than that in roots [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These findings suggest that more active SOS1s can transport excess Na<sup>+</sup> out of plants through the roots; correspondingly, Na<sup>+</sup> transport into shoots from roots was decreased, supporting an important salt tolerance mechanism (i.e., retarding Na<sup>+</sup> transport from roots to shoots). Salt stress induced the up-regulation of <italic>SpAHA1</italic> in both roots and leaves, indicating that the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase can provide more energy for the plant to resist salinity. Interestingly, the expression patterns of <italic>SpAHA1</italic> and <italic>SpSOS1</italic> in roots are similar, suggesting that they can work in coordination. Additionally, SpSOS1 functions as a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter using the proton gradient produced by SpAHA1.</p><p>The expression of <italic>SpSOS1</italic> increased the salt tolerance of transgenic AXT3K, a strain that is very sensitive to salt treatment because Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter deficiency at the plasma membrane. Cells expressing <italic>SpSOS1</italic> showed higher Na<sup>+</sup> efflux activity than the untransformed yeast strain, which is congruent with the lower intracellular sodium levels in the NaCl-treated yeast strain expressing <italic>SpSOS1</italic> compared to untransformed cells. Thus, the association between Na<sup>+</sup> transport activity, intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and halotolerance suggests that SpSOS1 may function as a sodium extrusion system. The plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is very important for energizing sodium efflux, and the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in salt tolerance in tomato [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

As a hypothesis, although enhanced plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup> pumping in transgenic yeast cells provides extra energy to support Na<sup>+</sup> export mediated by the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter at the plasma membrane, excess Na<sup>+</sup> in the cytosol cannot be transported out of cells because the Na<sup>+</sup> transporter utilizing the driving force is deficient at the plasma membrane of AXT3K. This hypothesis is supported by the measurement of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity of plasma membrane vesicles, showing that Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport activity did not markedly increase at the plasma membrane of <italic>SpAHA1</italic>-transgenic cells compared with the non-transformed strain.</p><p>Although excess salt is toxic to physiological and biochemical processes in plants, some species can grow in environments containing high levels of salts because they have evolved the unique ability to resist salinity [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One key mechanism in salinity tolerance is the ability to remove excessive Na<sup>+</sup> from the cytosol via tonoplast Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters (NHXs) and the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter (SOS1). The proton motive force utilized by vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters is generated by H<sup>+</sup>-translocating enzymes in the tonoplast, such as V-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-inorganic PPase. Recent studies have demonstrated that the vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter can utilize the electrochemical H<sup>+</sup> gradient generated by tonoplast H<sup>+</sup>-pumps to sequester Na<sup>+</sup> into vacuoles via the simultaneous overexpression of the two tonoplast proteins in plants. The salt tolerance of rice co-expressing <italic>SsNHX1</italic> and <italic>AtAVP1</italic> was higher than that achieved by single-gene transformation [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and rice plants engineered to overexpress native <italic>NHX</italic> and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase genes showed higher salt tolerance than plants expressing <italic>OsNHX1</italic> or <italic>OsVP1</italic> alone [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter can also transport excess Na<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm out of cells using the driving force of the H<sup>+</sup> gradient produced by plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-pumps. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants transformed with the <italic>AtSOS1</italic> gene showed higher salt tolerance than wild-type plants [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity correlates with the adaptation of plants to salt stress [<xref rid="pone.0137447.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the overexpression of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase has not been reported to confer strong salt tolerance to transgenic plants. It is difficult to engineer organisms with vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase because it comprises multiple protein subunits located in the tonoplast, and there is no experimental evidence for enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic organisms with a vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. In the present investigation, SpAHA1 produced an increased electrochemical gradient of protons to promote the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity of SpSOS1, with more Na<sup>+</sup> ion being transported out of cells. Correspondingly, yeast cells co-expressing SpSOS1 and SpAHA1 grew better than cells transformed with SpSOS1 or SpAHA1 alone, demonstrating that the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter SpSOS1 and plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase SpAHA1 could work in coordination in transgenic yeast cells. These results provide a reference for the development of more salt-tolerant crops via co-transformation of the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0137447.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>The collection site of <italic>Sesuvium portulacastrum</italic> plants.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0137447.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank American Journal Experts (AJE) for English language editing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0137447.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
