</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Sodium is a trace element in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, excess sodium in the cytoplasm is toxic to some important physiological and biochemical processes, and efflux of Na+ out of the cytoplasm is an important mechanism of salt tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Excess Na+ in the cytoplasm can be transported into the external medium across the plasma membrane or into the vacuole across the tonoplast, such that the Na+ in the cytoplasm is maintained at a non-toxic concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The tonoplast Na+/H+ antiporter NHX compartmentalizes Na+ into vacuoles using the proton gradient generated by vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase), whereas the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1, which is driven by the proton gradient generated by plasma membrane H+-ATPases, transports Na+ out of cells [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>NHX proteins from more than 60 plant species have been reported to date [1]. Arabidopsis AtNHX1 was the first NHX protein to be described, and its overexpression can significantly improve the salt tolerance of transgenic yeast or plants [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Many lines of evidence have indicated that tonoplast-bound NHXs function as Na+/H+ antiporters and mediate plant salt tolerance by sequestering Na+ into vacuoles [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As Na+ influx into vacuoles via NHXs is energized by the H+ gradient created by vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+-PPase, these two H+-pumps should play important roles in plant salt tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis harboring AVP1 (vacuolar H+-PPase 1) was stronger than that of wild type [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the co-expression of NHX and AVP conferred stronger salt tolerance to transgenic plants than NHX or AVP alone, a finding that further demonstrates the relationship between NHX and the H+-pump, with plant NHX proteins functioning as Na+/H+ antiporters using the force from the proton gradient produced by the vacuolar H+-PPase [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>SOS1 is the only Na+ efflux protein at the plant plasma membrane reported to date and functions as a Na+/H+ antiport system that is driven by the plasma membrane H+-pump H+-ATPase [9–11], and the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis transformed with the AtSOS1 gene is significantly higher than that of wild type [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity is involved in plant adaptation to salinity [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the salt tolerance efficiency of the simultaneous expression of SOS1 and plasma membrane H+-ATPase genes should be further enhanced, just as the co-expression of the vacuolar H+-PPase and Na+/H+ antiporter results in even higher salt tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to determine whether the combination of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter with H+-ATPase effectively increases salt tolerance in transgenic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Herein, a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter gene, SpSOS1, and a plasma membrane H+-ATPase gene, SpAHA1, were cloned from Sesuvium portulacastrum, a halophyte with optimal growth at 200–300 mM NaCl [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Functional analyses indicated that SpSOS1 could transport Na+ out of cells using the force of the proton gradient generated by SpAHA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In particular, the co-expression of SpSOS1 and SpAHA1 conferred stronger salt tolerance to transgenic yeast cells than the expression of either gene alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These results may be helpful in developing more salt-tolerant crops through the co-expression of SOS1 and H+-ATPase. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that more active SOS1s can transport excess Na+ out of plants through the roots; correspondingly, Na+ transport into shoots from roots was decreased, supporting an important salt tolerance mechanism (i.e., retarding Na+ transport from roots to shoots). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Salt stress induced the up-regulation of SpAHA1 in both roots and leaves, indicating that the H+-ATPase can provide more energy for the plant to resist salinity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, SpAHA1 produced an increased electrochemical gradient of protons to promote the Na+/H+ exchange activity of SpSOS1, with more Na+ ion being transported out of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, yeast cells co-expressing SpSOS1 and SpAHA1 grew better than cells transformed with SpSOS1 or SpAHA1 alone, demonstrating that the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter SpSOS1 and plasma membrane H+-ATPase SpAHA1 could work in coordination in transgenic yeast cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>These results provide a reference for the development of more salt-tolerant crops via co-transformation of the plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter and H+-ATPase. </plain></SENT>
