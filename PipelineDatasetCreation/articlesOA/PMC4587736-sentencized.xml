</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In filamentous fungi, the development of multicellular fruiting bodies requires highly conserved differentiation processes and is essential for sexual reproduction [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora is a well-established model organism for studying this process [2, 3]. S. macrospora is a haplont with a homothallic life style and does not require a mating partner for sexual reproduction [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast to many other filamentous ascomycetes, S. macrospora produces no asexual spores [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The life cycle begins with the germination of ascospores that develop into a vegetative, two-dimensional mycelium that forms ascogonia after three days representing the female gametangia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These hyphal coils develop into pre-fruiting bodies named protoperithecia within 5 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>After self-fertilization followed by karyogamy, meiosis and a postmeiotic mitosis by day seven, pre-fruiting bodies become mature fruiting bodies (perithecia) that harbor asci containing eight aligned ascospores per ascus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Ascospores are then released from the pear-shaped fruiting body by increased turgor pressure of the asci [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A genetic screen of S. macrospora identified several “pro” mutants characterized by a developmental arrest between protoperithecia and perithecia formation [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Complementation of these mutants and whole genome sequencing identified several PRO proteins involved in fruiting-body development [5, 8–13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>One of these pro genes, namely pro11, encodes a homolog of the mammalian striatin protein family [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Mammalian striatins are multidomain proteins possessing a caveolin-binding domain, a coiled-coil domain, a calmodulin binding domain at the N-terminus and a C-terminal WD40 repeat region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>They were initially identified as a novel group of phosphatase PP2A regulatory B”‘ subunits with roles in both signaling and trafficking [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, striatins serve as scaffolding units in the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex [15] (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In mammals, this recently identified protein complex consists of striatin as scaffold, the putative kinase activator monopolar spindle-one-binder 3 (MOB3), serine/threonine-phosphatase PP2A subunits A and C, cerebral cavernous malformation 3 (CCM3) protein, the striatin-interacting protein (STRIP)1 and STRIP2 and the germinal center kinases (GCK) MST4, STK24, STK25 and MINK1 [15–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>STRIPAK sub-complexes and STRIPAK-like complexes have since been identified in other organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In mammals, the STRIPAK sub-complex mutually exclusively interacts with the sarcolemmal membrane-associated protein (SLMAP), the related coiled-coil proteins suppressor of IKKepsilon (SIKE) and fibroblast growth factor receptor oncogene partner 2 (FGFR1OP2) or the cortactin-binding protein CTTNBP2 [15] (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila melanogaster and mammals proteomic approaches identified the STRIPAK-like as a negative regulator of the Hippo signaling [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The Hippo pathways consists of a kinase cascade that regulates tissue and organ size in metazoans [22] (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Core components of this pathways are highly conserved in the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as in filamentous fungi [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In S. cerevisiae and fission yeast, one pathway is involved in coupling the cell cycle and cell septation and is termed the MEN (mitotic exit network) and SIN (septation initiation network), respectively [23, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The second kinase pathway, which regulates morphology and polar growth is termed RAM (regulation of Ace2 and morphogenesis) in S. cerevisiae and MOR (morphogenesis of Orb6) in S. pombe [23, 26] (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Based on structural similarity to the S. cerevisiae sterile-20 protein kinase (Ste20), GCKs are members of the Ste20-related group of protein kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These are sub-classified into p21-activated kinases (PAK) and GCK families based on the location of their kinase domain [43], which is C-terminal or N-terminal to the regulatory domain, in PAKs and GCKs, respectively [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>GCKs share a highly conserved catalytic domain and a more divergent regulatory C-terminus [43, 44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The GCK family can be further subdivided into subfamilies GCK I to GCK VIII [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In mammals, GCKs III MST4, STK24, STK25 and the GCK IV MINK1 are identified as components of the STRIPAK complex [15–17, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>CCM3 has recently been shown to act as an adaptor that recruits kinases of the GCK III family to the striatins [15, 17, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The role of CCM3 is to bring GCK III into close proximity to striatin-connected phosphatase PP2A whereas GCK IV MINK1 is directly associated with striatin [16, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the PP2A phosphatase associated with the STRIPAK complex dephosphorylates the GCKs, and thereby reduces their catalytic activity [16, 45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>In order to identify STRIPAK kinases in S. macrospora, we performed a BLASTP search with the mammalian STRIPAK kinases MST4, STK24, STK25 and MINK1 against the S. macrospora genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We identified two GCKs, SmKIN3 and SmKIN24, as possible homologs of the mammalian STRIPAK-associated GCKs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Y2H analyses revealed that both kinases could interact with the S. macrospora striatin homolog PRO11 and the interaction between SmKIN3 and PRO11 was verified in vivo by co-IP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy revealed that both proteins localize to septa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Deletion of Smkin3 led to fewer septa and increased protoplast regeneration and aerial hyphae formation, whereas deletion of Smkin24 caused hyperseptation and sterility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Despite their distinct phenotypes, both kinases appear to act independently because the ΔSmkin3/ΔSmkin24 double-knockout exhibited a phenotype that combined those of the single-deletion strains. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In mammals, three members of the GCK III subfamily of the Ste20 kinases (STK24, STK25, and MST4); and one member of the GCK IV family (Misshappen-like kinase 1, MINK1) are associated with the STRIPAK complex [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>To date, no STRIPAK-associated kinases have been identified in filamentous fungi (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we performed a BLASTP search using mammalian kinases STK24, STK25, MST4 and MINK1 as query against the S. macrospora proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://blast.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link> [67]) to identify putative S. macrospora homologs of the mammalian kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This search revealed the putative germinal center kinases SMAC_01456 (F7VQV9) and SMAC_04490 (F7VYS5) to be orthologous to the mammalian GCKs (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The predicted gene SMAC_04490 comprises 2758 bp and contains three putative introns: 96 bp at position 53–148, 117 bp at position 217–333 and 82 bp at position 502–583 (Fig A in S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The calculated molecular weight (MW) of the encoded 820-aa protein is 91.4 kDa with an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.47. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>It shows a high sequence identity to the serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (stk-3) of Neurospora crassa (locus tag NCU04096, gene symbol prk-9 alias sid-1) (Fig 2) and was therefore named SmKIN3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Two variants have been reported for the N. crassa NCU04096 protein: a long version resulting from a transcript after splicing of three introns, and a short version derived from a transcript retaining intron 3 and following initiation of translation at a downstream ATG codon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The position of all three introns is conserved in Smkin3 and stk-3 (prk-9, sid-1), but we identified splicing of all three introns in Smkin3 using RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing, and splicing of intron 3 did not appear to be optional (Fig A in S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In addition, the position of the downstream start codon is conserved in Smkin3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Initiation of translation from this ATG codon would lead to an N-terminally truncated SmKIN3 version of 663 aa with an MW of 74 kDa (Fig A in S1 File). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>In mammals, GCKs are implicated in fundamental developmental processes, such as proliferation, cell polarity and cell migration [40, 75–77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Previously, it was shown that the GCKs MST4, STK24, STK25 and MINK1 bind to striatin and therefore are part of the mammalian STRIPAK complex [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>The STRIPAK core components striatin and phosphatase PP2A are conserved from yeast to man [37] (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The S. macrospora STRIPAK complex contains the striatin homologs PRO11 and PP2A catalytic and scaffold subunits as well as the STRIP1/2 homolog PRO22, the SLMAP homolog PRO45 and the phocein homolog SmMOB3 [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>However, until now, evidence for the presence of STRIPAK-related kinases in ascomycetes was lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed putative GCKs in S. macrospora and addressed their relevance as putative STRIPAK-associated kinases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec019"><title><text><SENT sid="375" pm="?"><plain>Are SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 STRIPAK-associated kinases? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>A BLASTP search identified SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 as putative homologs of mammalian STRIPAK kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal part of the mammalian STRIPAK kinases, containing the kinase domain, is conserved among ascomycetes (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of MST4, STK24, STK25 and MINK1 and their orthologs in ascomycetes revealed two groups of putative STRIPAK-associated GCKs in filamentous fungi (Fig 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 interacted with PRO11 in Y2H (Fig 4A and 4B) and co-IP experiments (SmKIN3 with PRO11) (Fig 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>However, successful co-IP results required crosslinking, indicating weak interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>In N. crassa, the GCK STK-3 (PRK-9, SID-1; homolog of SmKIN3) is part of SIN/MEN, whereas STK-24 (STK-6, MST-1; homolog of SmKIN24) has a dual role in SIN/MEN and MOR/RAM (Fig 1B) [35, 78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>SIN/MEN is a signal transduction pathway required for proper coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis [23, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Following cytokinesis MOR is essential for cell polarity control and septum formation [23, 79, 80]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Both N. crassa kinases are regulated by the upstream kinase CDC-7, however in an opposite manner (Fig 1B)[35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>N. crassa STK-3 (PRK-9, SID-1) and STK-24 (STK-6, MST-1) both localize to the septa and spindle pole bodies (SPB) [35, 78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>In S. pombe, SIN components bind to the coiled coil scaffold protein SID4 [81]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>However, a clear homolog of the SID4 has not been identified in ascomycetes [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Based on interaction studies, STRIPAK PRO11 may serve as a scaffold for SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 and we therefore predict interplay between STRIPAK and SIN/MEN in S. macrospora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by findings in fission yeast, where the STRIPAK-like complex is called SIP complex (Fig 1A) [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>The fission yeast SLMAP-homolog CSC1 was shown to negatively regulate SIN and promote SIN asymmetry [28] which is crucial for cytokinesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>In D. melanogaster, STRIPAK components negatively regulate Hippo signaling [20], which is homologous to the fungal SIN/MEN and RAM/MOR networks [23, 82] (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The Hippo pathway is a central element of tissue size control in D. melanogaster and higher organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>It consists of an upstream kinase Hpo (MST1/2 in mammals), downstream NDR kinases LATS1/2 and NDR1/2 associated MOB family proteins and various scaffolding subunits [23, 83, 84] (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Based on interaction of Hpo/MST1/2 with homologs of MOB3 and striatin, the D. melanogaster dSTRIPAK complex was identified as the negative regulator of Hippo signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Loss of dSTRIPAK components resulted in elevated phosphorylation of Hpo [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in mammals it was demonstrated that the Hippo kinases MST1 and MST2 bind the SLMAP-STRIPAK complex [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>A BLASTP analysis with Hpo, MST1 and MST2 protein sequences revealed SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 as orthologs of these kinases in S. macrospora. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>However, SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 did not interact with SmMOB3 in Y2H experiments (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>In N. crassa, a direct interaction of STK-24 (SID-1) and the NDR kinase DBF-2 was identified by MS and yeast two-hybrid studies; however an interaction with the kinase activator MOB-1 was not tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>It may be therefore meaningful considering interactions of other MOB-family proteins and STRIPAK associated GCKs to define the regulatory network of the STRIPAK complex and the Hippo (SIN/MEN-MOR/RAM) pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Dettman et al. [85] identified an interaction between STK-24 (STK-6, MST-1), the N. crassa homolog of SmKIN24, and components of the MAK-2 mitogen activated protein kinases module, (MAPKKK) NRC-1 and (MAPKK) MEK-2, involved in fungal communication between germinating spores [86, 87]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>All three kinases of the MAK-2 MAPK module were shown to be weakly associated with STRIPAK components PP2A-A, PP2A-C, striatin and MOB-3 in N. crassa [85]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Thus, STRIPAK components and the SmKIN24 homolog function together in at least one cascade in N. crassa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>In mammals, CCM3 recruits the GCKs MST4, STK24 and STK25 but not MINK1 to striatin [15, 17, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>However, a homolog of CCM3 has so far not been identified in fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assume that STRIPAK-associated kinases in S. macrospora are not recruited by other proteins to PRO11. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Deletion of Smkin3 does not impair fertility, but leads to an increased formation of aerial hyphae and reduced growth rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the deletion strain ΔSmkin24 was sterile, its lifecycle was halted at the later stage of protoperithecia formation and vegetative growth was also impaired (Fig 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>A global phenotypic analysis of serine/threonine-protein kinase deletion mutants in N. crassa revealed that the N. crassa Smkin3-homolog stk-3 (prk-9, sid-1) affects asexual and sexual development as well as vegetative growth and aerial hyphae formation [88]. S. macrospora undergoes only sexual development, so we cannot comment on asexual reproduction in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>The reduced growth rate of deletion strain ΔSmkin3 confirmed previous results of Park et al. [88], however, in contrast to these findings, deletion of Smkin3 did not impair fruiting-body development or fertility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Heilig et al. [78] reported that N. crassa wt x Δstk-3 (prk-9, sid-1) crosses exhibited no abnormalities during sexual development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>Deletion of stk-24 (stk-6, mst-1) in N. crassa resulted in reduced aerial hyphae and slightly reduced macroconidia production [89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Similar to the S. macrospora ΔSmkin24 mutant which is halted at later stages of protoperithecia formation, N. crassa Δstk-24 (stk-6, mst-1) x Δstk-24 (stk-6, mst-1) crosses resulted in empty perithecia that do not contain ascospores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>Unlike S. macrospora mutant ΔSmkin24, the mycelial extension rates were not impaired in the N. crassa Δstk-24 (stk-6, mst-1) mutant [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Both N. crassa Δstk-3 (prk-9, sid-1) and Δstk-24 (stk-6, mst-1) mutants showed hyphal tip swelling and bursting of hyphal tips followed by cytoplasmic leakage [78, 89]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>This phenotype was not observed in the S. macrospora ΔSmkin3 and ΔSmkin24 mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>Deletion of Smkin3 and Smkin24 cause defects in septation, and the SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 proteins are localized to the septa (Fig 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>In N. crassa, the respective homologs are also localized to the septum and deletion of the genes causes defects in septa formation [35, 78, 89]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>Mutant ΔSmkin3 exhibited fewer septa compared with the wt strain, and hyphal compartments were therefore elongated (Fig 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>This phenotype reverted, as growth continued beyond 24 h, presumably due to the accumulation of suppressor mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>This is similar to the N. crassa Δstk-3 (prk-9, sid-1) mutant that produces initially aseptate germlings that form septa during the later stages of colony development [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>In addition, germlings derived from ΔSmkin3 protoplasts grew faster than germlings of wt protoplasts (Fig 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>The septation phenotype of mutants ΔSmkin24 and ΔSmkin3 were distinct, mutant ΔSmkin24 generated more septa that aggregated into bundle-like structures of abnormal shape (Fig 8). Septal actomyosin tangle (SAT) assembly, cortical actomyosin ring (CAR) assembly and CAR constriction are three consecutive stages of septum formation in N. crassa [90]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>The septa observed in mutant ΔSmkin24 resembled unfinished septa from the early stages of septum formation, that were observed during MYO-2 GFP localization studies of SAT and CAR assembly in N. crassa [90]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>SmKIN24 is therefore required for proper CAR assembly, as was recently shown by Heilig et al. [35] in N. crassa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>Despite their contrary phenotypes, SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 appear to function independently in S. macrospora, as shown by the double-deletion mutant ΔSmkin3/ΔSmkin24 that exhibited a phenotype that combined the phenotypes of both single-deletion strains, although septum formation resembles that of the ΔSmkin24 mutant (Fig 8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>The N. crassa homologs of SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 are implicated in SIN and MOR pathways as discussed above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>The results of the present study indicate an additional role of these GCKs in S. macrospora, potentially via interaction with the striatin homolog PRO11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>The interaction between PRO11 and SmKIN3 or SmKIN24 reported here for the first time, should be confirmed by other in vivo methods, such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation coupled with high resolution microscopy, which could also provide more detailed localization information of a possible interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>In addition, interactome studies could identify transient interaction partners and may give insights into crosstalk between signaling pathways and modulation by protein complexes. </plain></SENT>
