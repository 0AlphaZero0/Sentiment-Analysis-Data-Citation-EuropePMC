</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exocarp, or skin, of fleshy fruit is a highly specialized tissue that forms the interface between the fruit flesh and the environment, and supports the mechanical integrity of the fruit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is the outermost part of the fruit wall (pericarp), and typically comprises the epidermis and sub-epidermal cell layers.1 The exocarp protects the developing fruit against uncontrolled water loss or uptake, ultraviolet radiation, mechanical damage, pathogens and herbivores.2,3 Reflecting the diverse functions, cell walls in the exocarp are characterized through thickenings and other modifications, the most prominent one being the cuticle, or the cuticular membrane4 (CM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cuticle is a complex layer of lipophilic materials such as cutin and waxes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is localized in the outer periclinal and anticlinal cell walls of the epidermis, and in some fruit such as apple and tomato, may extend into the hypodermal cell walls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, exocarp cells usually contain high levels of phenolic compounds, pigments, volatile esters and defense-related proteins.5 Several horticulturally relevant traits are also associated with the exocarp, such as color, resistance to pathogen infections and to fruit cracking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>During ripening, the fruit becomes attractive to frugivores through changes in color, smell, flavor and texture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These changes also affect the exocarp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Further developmental changes affect the composition and load of the cuticle6–8 and the mechanical properties of the exocarp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For instance, the peel of tomato and grape berry stiffens towards maturity, which has been proposed to control fruit growth.9,10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The dynamic functions of the exocarp require a developmentally changing repertoire of biosynthetic activities and expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>So far, global transcriptome studies of the whole fruit have uncovered a wealth of developmentally regulated genes in important fleshy fruit crops such as tomato,11 apple,12–14 grape berry,15,16 peach17,18 and date palm.19 Only a few studies on temporal changes of gene expression profiles in the developing exocarp have been published, and these have focused on tomato20–22 or grape berry.23 Other transcriptome analyses of the exocarp have concentrated on a single developmental stage (peach,24 grape berry,25 tomato,26 citrus27) or pooled developmental stages (pomegranate28). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sweet cherry is an important fleshy, non-climacteric tree fruit crop grown in temperate regions worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Like in other stone fruit such as the peach, the edible, fleshy part of the sweet cherry fruit consists of exocarp and mesocarp, while the endocarp develops to a hard shell enclosing the seed, together constituting the ‘stone’ or pit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>So far, relatively little data on gene expression are available for sweet cherry fruit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This limits the ability to identify genes with important roles in developmental processes, which in turn limits breeding and production of superior fruit. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently, developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns were studied for 22 sweet cherry genes, 13 of which are potentially involved in cuticle formation and/or function in fruit.29 The present study is a comprehensive report of transcriptional changes that take place in the sweet cherry fruit exocarp over the developmental course from flowering to maturity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this research were to (i) identify genes expressed in the sweet cherry exocarp; (ii) resolve temporal expression patterns of the exocarp-associated genes; and (iii) identify developmentally regulated processes characteristic to the exocarp on the basis of coregulated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Much of our past research has been on the development and function of fruit cuticles6,30,31 and fruit skin.32,33 In the present work, our particular interest was on genes involved in cuticle deposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Other key processes we focused on included cell wall metabolism during fruit growth, maturation and softening; sugar transport; and transcriptional regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Together, the results reveal a complex chronology of simultaneous, consecutive and overlapping processes taking place in the developing sweet cherry exocarp. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes (except for the homologs of HTH and KCS10) were also among the ones identified previously as putatively involved in CM biogenesis in sweet cherry fruits, and their expression patterns here (Figure 6 and Supplementary Fig. S4B) were very similar to the ones reported.29 A highly abundant contig in this cluster was Pa_02691, an ERF transcription factor homolog. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Contig Pa_04572, with the best B2G hit GDSL esterase/lipase LTL1, was the second best sweet cherry hit (e-value 10−157, 86% similarity) of the tomato CD1 protein, a GDSL lipase and putative cutin polymerase in tomato fruit epidermis.76,77 However, the best hit of tomato CD1 was Pa_16669 (e-value 10−159, 86% similarity), a member of cluster NG1-QT36 (Supplementary Fig. S3a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis and tomato, these HD-ZIP IV factor are essential regulators of cutin, wax and anthocyanin levels.85–87 The expression pattern of Pa_05584 in sweet cherry fruit—exocarp-specific, high expression levels during stages II and III, lower but constant expression levels during Stage I—is consistent with roles in cuticular lipid and anthocyanin biosyntheses also for the sweet cherry fruit ANL2/CD2 homolog. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, GPAT6 functions in cutin biosynthesis in petals and sepals.93 The exocarp specific expression pattern with the peak during the highest rate of cuticle deposition (24 DAFB) in sweet cherry fruit is consistent with a function in the cutin biosynthetic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Along these lines, the second maximum during Stage III is consistent with the low but detectable cuticle deposition rate at this late stage (Figure 1b) and with the increased amounts of the main cutin constituents, 9(10)-hydroxy-hexadecane-1,16-dioic acid and 9(10),16-dihydroxy-hexadecanoic acid, at maturity as compared to 22 DAFB.8 </plain></SENT>
