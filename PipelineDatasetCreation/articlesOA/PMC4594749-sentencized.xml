</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread reproductive and endocrinologic disorder, which accounts for approximately 80 % of women with anovulatory infertility [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>PCOS is characterized by hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries, in addition to anovulation [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This syndrome can also be associated with metabolic issues including obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, besides cardiovascular problems, breast and endometrial cancers, and neurological and psychological effects on quality of life [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In affected women, the normal ovarian function is disturbed mostly by hyperandrogenism and by the elevated serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH, [6, 7]), thus resulting in multiple small cysts [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A nearly universal finding in PCOS is an increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency, which favors LH production over follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The increased LH subsequently promotes theca cell production of androgens, while the relative FSH deficiency reduces the ability of granulosa cells to convert androgen into estrogen and impairs follicle maturation and ovulation [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Ovulation induction protocols can be used to restore fertility in PCOS patients [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>One protocol involves ovarian stimulation by subcutaneous FSH injection [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, because of the large number of small antral follicles that are sensitive to FSH [15], women with PCOS have a higher risk in developing ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) in response to FSH treatment [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To reduce this risk, low-dose administrations of injectable FSH have been used [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the most appropriate regime is the step-up protocol, in which the FSH dose is gradually increased until follicular development is observed, and then maintained until follicular selection is achieved [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Regardless of good pregnancy and live birth rates [17], ovarian stimulation with FSH is actually considered a second-line treatment for the PCOS patients with infertility [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the lack of an oral formulation, the elevated price, and the potentially severe adverse effects, such as multiple pregnancy and OHSS (reviewed in [13]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The basic concern about oral formulation is the low bioavailability of FSH that stem from stomach enzymatic degradation and poor penetration of FSH peptides across the intestinal membrane [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>As a consequence it is clear that the research leading to improved oral FSH therapy could ultimately lead to the development of innovative and more comfortable treatments for PCOS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Androgen-treated rodents have been widely used as models to study both reproductive and metabolic deficits of PCOS (reviewed in [23–25]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is able to induce many of the salient features of the human PCOS condition, such as hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, altered steroidogenesis, acyclicity, abnormal maturation of ovarian follicles, and anovulation in rodents models [26–29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Then the present work aims to assess first of all, the effect of oral administration of low-dose FSH on the morphological and endocrine function of the ovaries of hyperandrogenized mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, since intact FSH is unlikely to be transferred from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation, the effect of a minimal amino acid sequence, derived from the analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites, was analyzed on an in vitro system of bovine oocyte maturation (IVM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human FSH is commonly used in in vitro maturation to stimulate meiotic resumption and cumulus expansion both for research purpose and for application in assisted reproductive technologies in bovine in vitro embryo production [30–34] and its effectiveness is sustained by a growing body of literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the bovine IVM model represents a highly standardized protocol [35, 36], particularly efficient and versatile, which allows at the same time to limit the use and sacrifice of experimental animals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Most of the animal models used to understand the development of PCOS-related dysfunctions are based on induced hyperandrogenism [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>DHEA, an androgen of mainly adrenal origin, is often increased in women with PCOS [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore DHEA is utilized to induce PCOS in different rodent models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The dose commonly used (6 mg/100 g body weight) ensures a hyperandrogenized status equivalent to that found in women with PCOS [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The treatment that we utilized is commonly used in mice to induce the PCOS phenotype, characterized by infertility and ovaries containing more atretic follicles and follicular cysts [56–58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm the previous finding that DHEA treatment increased the number of large follicles (&gt;300 μm of diameter) per ovary, simultaneously reducing the small antral follicles population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In addition to the increase in follicles number, our results demonstrated that DHEA treatment induced an increase of the number of large follicles presenting morphological signs of atresia and/or cysts (from 0.0 % in the Control group to 67.26 % ± 3.5 in the DHEA group). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Motta and colleagues found that mouse cysts had a thin theca layer and a packed stratum of granulosa cells [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>These findings are confirmed by our results, since DHEA treated mice exhibit a reduced thickness of follicular wall (theca interna layer plus granulosa cell layer) in the large follicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We observed also that both serum E2 and P4 levels were increased with induction of cysts formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These findings are in agreement with other authors [26, 28, 59, 60] who observed increase in both cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) activities in theca cells from women with PCOS, suggesting a global enhancement of steroidogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This is also consistent with studies on cultures of human theca cells derived from follicles isolated from the ovaries of PCOS and normal women where it has been demonstrated that PCOS theca cells produce greater amounts of testosterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and P4 than normal theca cells [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism for LH hypersecretion described in human PCOS is not entirely clear, some data suggest that it involves impaired negative feedback on LH secretion mediated by either high E2 or P4 levels in women with PCOS [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly in our study, serum LH was decreased while LH over-production is commonly considered one of the peculiar trait of PCOS [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>While in the rat data on the effect of postnatal treatment with DHEA on LH concentration are reported, although contrasting [28, 29, 64], to the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing the effect on LH concentration after 20 days of DHEA administration in the mouse model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results reveal that DHEA increased animal weight at the end of the treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>These observations are in agreement with both the wide distribution of obesity in PCOS-affected women [65] and with the characterization of the murine model reported in literature [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The therapy of PCOS is focused on ovulation induction in those desiring pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This may be achieved indirectly with clomiphene citrate (CC), which is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator which action results in increases in circulating FSH [13], or directly by FSH administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The first line of treatment, CC, restores ovulation in about 80 %, but will result in pregnancy in only 35 % of patients [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Additionally, about 25 % of PCOS women do not respond to CC and are considered to be “clomiphene resistant” [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Even though FSH treatment is more effective than CC, it is still considered a second line of treatment, mainly because of the lack of oral preparation and the risk of adverse effects [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce the risk of OHSS and multiple pregnancy, low-dose treatment programs have been successfully implemented [17, 18, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The basic thinking behind this regiment is the “threshold theory”, which demands the attainment and maintenance of follicular development with exogenous FSH without exceeding the threshold requirement of the ovary [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>A low starting dose of FSH (usually 50–75 IU) is used for 7–14 days and, if necessary, a weekly 50 % increment of the initial or previous amount is administered until follicular development is initiated [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In our study we investigated the possibility of FSH oral administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Gonadotropins, as most of the drugs constituted by protein formulations, are traditionally delivered via intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous routes because of their reduced oral bioavailability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This is mainly due to the fact that peptides can be readily degraded and pass poorly through the intestinal mucosa [68, 69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study reporting that an oral administration of a low dose of rhFSH is able to ameliorate some peculiar features of PCOS in hyper-androgenized mice with treatment using higher doses potentially being more effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, this remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>During the first week, we orally administered 0.02 IU/die of rhFSH, which was derived from the dose of 50 IU in women and recalculated according to the average body weight in the mouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The orally administered rhFSH was able both to reduce the number of large antral follicles and at the same time to maintain their viability, while reducing the percentage of atretic and cystic signs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The effect of FSH administration on cystic signs in ovarian follicles has not been extensively investigated, apart from a study in a Guinea pig model, which demonstrated that exogenous FSH treatment effectively reduced the ovarian cyst formation [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In our PCOS model, the oral administration of rhFSH normalized estradiol serum concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon appears to reflect the follicular distribution after the oral administration of rhFSH, since rhFSH treated ovaries have a decrease in large antral follicles number (Fig. 4b) in favor of an increase in the new population of small growing healthy follicles (Fig. 7a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Compared to larger follicles, these smaller growing follicles synthetize and secrete less E2 than the larger follicles [71, 72], and this could account for the reduced E2 in the rhFSH treated mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Further support from this concept is provided by the immunohistochemical detection of P450 aromatase in &gt;300 μm large antral follicle and not in the smaller follicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Thus the observed 50 % decrease in serum E2 observed in the rhFSH treated ovaries directly corresponds the 50 % decrease in the number of aromatase expressing follicles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Thus rhFSH, even though orally administered, seemed to be able to partially restore the physiological status of ovarian follicles considering both morphological and functional aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>During estrous cycle, FSH stimulates proliferation of granulosa cells in primary follicles, and once a follicle reaches a diameter of approximately 150 μm, FSH induces antrum formation and aromatase activity within the granulosa cells with a gradual increase in estradiol synthesis [73, 74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility of administering effective gonadotropin treatment orally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>However while oral administration is effective, we hypothesize that intact FSH is unlikely to be transferred from the gastrointestinal tract into the circulation, even though we cannot exclude it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In the present study we tested whether a bioactive peptide derived from FSH is functionally active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>From this premise, we selected an amino acidic sequence derived from the FSH molecule digestion and containing amino acids responsible for specific receptor binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that the selected peptide (from the amino acid 95–121 of β-chain) is not able to exert biological effects (i.e. cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation) in an in vitro model in the bovine species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>On the other hand World Health Organization has calculated that over 10 % of women are inflicted by infertility and subfertility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int">www.who.int</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are well-established treatments, representing substantial economic and healthcare implications for patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Total number of ART cycle per annum will reach 2 million by the end of 2015 with a forecast cost for therapeutics market that is estimated in about 8 billion of euros. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>This valuation derived from the mean of direct cost of one fresh ART treatment cycle in several countries [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Considering that one treatment cycle is often not enough to achieve the childbirth, the amount is surely underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This framework includes also the therapeutic market linked to PCOS considering also that the pharmaceutical market is evolving in a context of increasing economic pressure, it demands alternative approaches [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This situation has contributed to a revival of interest in peptides as potential drug candidates, considering alternative routes of administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The peptide drug market is also growing twice as fast in the worldwide drug market [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Certainly peptides and proteins offer several advantages as compared to conventional drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>These include high activity, high specificity, low toxicity, and minimal non-specific and drug-drug interactions [22], but the physiological, enzymatic and chemical barriers for oral administration route pose a significant challenge to the delivery of peptide and protein drugs [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Then oral delivery of peptides and proteins, and in particular of FSH [78], is currently a topic of intense research, which, together to the economic implication of ovarian stimulation not only in PCOS treatment [22, 78], strongly encourages further investigation in identifying FSH-derived peptides or a combination of peptides that have biologically activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In summary, DHEA treatment induced a global increase of Testosterone, E2 and P4 level confirming data from previous studies on DHEA-induced PCOS model in mouse where postnatal treatment of mice with DHEA for 20 consecutive days resulted in most females exhibiting follicular cysts with a thin granulosa cell layer and anovulation, increased numbers of atretic follicles, hyperandrogenism, and altered ovarian steroidogenesis with elevated serum levels of androgens, estrogens and progesterone [26, 55–57, 66, 79, 80]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Several evidences indicate that androgens modulate follicle development from the present and from other studies [81–83]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In particular, androgen-receptor KO mouse models have been used to establish that androgens actions through androgen-receptors are actually necessary for normal ovarian function and female fertility and recently has been demonstrated that androgens regulate ovarian follicular development by increasing follicle stimulating hormone receptors [83]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In the present study FSH treatment restored E2 to the control level and we hypothesize that this maybe due to FSH ability to suppress growth of large follicles &gt;300, where aromatase is more expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, how FSH affects DHEA-mediated follicle development in mouse model is unknown and to the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing FSH capability to modulate its activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involved in this interaction deserves certainly to be the subject of future research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results suggest that oral administration of FSH is able to attenuate some of the characteristic of PCOS in a hyperandrogenized mouse model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Although further investigation in identifying FSH-derived peptides potentially maintaining its proper biological activity are needed, this research could improve our understanding of the pathogenesis as well as lead to the development of innovative, more comfortable and cost effective treatments for PCOS infertility. </plain></SENT>
