<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In mammals, a hormone called arginine vasopressin regulates water and salt levels in the whole body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This hormone is made by cells in a region of the brain called the hypothalamus, and is then transported to the pituitary gland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When the level of water relative to the level of salts in the blood starts to drop (i.e., during dehydration), arginine vasopressin is released into the blood and travels to the kidneys where it acts as a signal to retain more water in the body. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, if water levels continue to remain low, the stores of arginine vasopressin in the pituitary gland may run out and so more protein needs to be made in the hypothalamus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Like all proteins, arginine vasopressin is made by first copying a template encoded in a particular gene into a molecule called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During dehydration, the cells in the hypothalamus produce more of these corresponding mRNA molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Also, the mRNAs are slightly larger than normal because they have longer ‘polyA tails’ (structures added to the ends of all newly-made mRNAs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, it was not clear how or why this happens. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Here, Konopacka et al. studied the production of arginine vasopressin in rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The experiments show that a protein called Caprin-2 accumulates in hypothalamic neurons when rats are dehydrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Caprin-2 is able to directly bind to the mRNA that encodes arginine vasopressin and is responsible for increasing the length of the polyA tail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To test whether this interaction is important for regulating the balance of water and salts, Konopacka et al. decreased the levels of Caprin-2 protein in the hypothalamus of live rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>When these rats became dehydrated, they had lower levels of the arginine vasopressin mRNA and these mRNAs had shorter polyA tails. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the rats drank less water and urinated less than normal rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Further experiments show that Caprin-2 helps to stabilize the structure of these mRNAs so that they accumulate in cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Together, Konopacka et al.'s findings show that Caprin-2 regulates the production of arginine vasopressin by interacting with and modifying its corresponding mRNA in the rat hypothalamus. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of salt and water homeostasis is a sine qua non condition for the survival of all living organisms (Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In mammals, this process is centrally regulated by the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS), the source of the antidiuretic neuropeptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The HNS consists of the large peptidergic magnocellular neurones (MCNs) of the hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN), the axons of which course though the internal zone of the median eminence and terminate on blood capillaries of the posterior pituitary (PP) gland (Bargmann, 1966; Burbach et al., 2001; Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004), a neuro–vascular interface through which the brain regulates peripheral organs in order to maintain homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of the AVP (Brownstein et al., 1980; Burbach et al., 2001) starts with the translation of AVP-encoding messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) into a large precursor preprohormone that comprises a signal peptide (SP), the nine amino acid AVP moeity itself, the neurophysin II carrier molecule, and a C-terminal glycopeptide (copeptin) of unknown function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Delivery of AVP to the pituitary starts with the insertion of the preprohormone into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum with the removal of the SP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The resulting prohormone is folded then routed unidirectionally to the trans-Golgi network, where it is targeted specifically into the large dense core vesicle of the regulated secretory pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Whilst these granules are anterogradely transported some considerable distance towards the PP, the prohormone is processed to generate the biologically active, mature AVP, which is stored in PP axon terminals until mobilised for secretion into the systemic circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The rise in plasma osmolality that follows dehydration is detected by intrinsic MCN mechanisms (Bourque, 2008) and by specialised osmoreceptive neurons in the circumventricular organs such as the subfornical organ, which provide excitatory inputs to shape the firing activity of MCNs for hormone secretion (McKinley et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Upon release, AVP travels through the blood stream to specific receptor targets located in the kidney where it promotes water reabsorption in the collecting duct (Breyer and Ando, 1994), and sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Ares et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the depletion of pituitary stores that accompanies a chronic osmotic stimulation, there is a need to synthesize more AVP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This starts with an increase in transcription (Murphy and Carter, 1990), which results in an increase in the abundance of both the precursor heteronuclear RNA (Kondo et al., 2004) and the mature mRNA (Sherman et al., 1986). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, following the onset of an osmotic challenge, the AVP mRNA is subject to a curious post-transcriptional modification in the form of an increase in the length of the 3′ poly(A) tail (Carrazana et al., 1988; Zingg et al., 1988; Carter and Murphy, 1989; Murphy and Carter, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Until this report, the regulation and physiologiocal function of this poly(A) tail length increase were not understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In order to better understand the network of plastic events in the osmotically challenged SON and PVN, and in an attempt to identify novel regulatory players, we (Hindmarch et al., 2006) and others (Yue et al., 2006) have used microarrays to ask how chronic osmotic stress evokes changes in the transcriptome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>One of the genes found to be differentially up-regulated in the SON and PVN was cytoplasmic activation/proliferation-associated protein-2 (Caprin2) (Mutsuga et al., 2004; Hindmarch et al., 2006; Yue et al., 2006), otherwise known as C1q domain containing 1 (C1qdc1), EEG1 and RNA granule protein 140 (RNG140). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In these various guises, Caprin2 has been implicated in the inhibition of cell growth (Aerbajinai et al., 2004), differentiation (Aerbajinai et al., 2004; Lorén et al., 2009), the enhancement of canonical Wnt signaling (Ding et al., 2008; Miao et al., 2014; Flores and Zhong, 2015), and, as an RNA-binding protein, the maintenance of the dendritic structure in the adult vertebrate brain (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We sought to understand the physiological role of Caprin2 in the function related plasticity exhibited following an osmotic challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Specifically, given that Caprin2 is an RNA binding protein, we tested the hypothesis that it may associate with AVP transcripts and hence mediate changes in poly(A) tail length and/or mRNA stability. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Caprin-2 has recently been identified in vitro as an RNA binding protein RNG140 (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, up until now, no specific RNA binding partners of Caprin-2 have been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Caprin-2 binds to the AVP mRNA in the SON and PVN of EU and SL rats in vivo, and, in doing so, modulates both its abundance and poly(A) tail length. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>By stimulating water retention at the level of the kidneys (Breyer and Ando, 1994), AVP plays a central role in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis, particularly blood volume and osmolality (Antunes-Rodrigues et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The increase in AVP biosynthesis in MCNs that follows osmotic stimulation is accompanied by a plethora of changes in gene expression (Mutsuga et al., 2004; Hindmarch et al., 2006; Yue et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>One of the novel genes identified as such by transcriptome analysis was Caprin-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Here we confirm the transcriptome data, and that Caprin-2 protein is up-regulated at the mRNA level by chronic hyperosmotic cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Using double immunostaining we also provide evidence that Caprin-2 protein is present in the cytoplasm of VP MCNs, and that its expression increases during osmotic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Caprin-2 has been reported to play a role in several physiological processes, including differentiation, apoptosis in erythroblasts or lens fiber cells, and synaptic plasticity in the mouse cerebellum (Aerbajinai et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2008; Lorén et al., 2009; Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010; Miao et al., 2014; Flores and Zhong, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Although expression of Caprin-2 in the HNS has been reported (Mutsuga et al., 2004), its role in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis had not previously been addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the physiological consequences of Caprin-2 gene knockdown using virally delivered specific shRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The Caprin-2 shRNA had no effect on water homeostasis in euhydrated rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In naïve rats (Greenwood et al., 2015), and in rats transduced with a scrambled control shRNA, as shown here, salt loading results in production of large amounts of dilute urine and excessive fluid intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, compared to the control animals, salt loaded Caprin-2 knockdown rats only minimally increased their urine production and they drank less fluid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Urine osmolality and sodium levels were also higher in Caprin-2 knockdown rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>These observations may be explained by water retention resulting from the elevated plasma AVP levels found in the Caprin-2 shRNA-transduced rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that Caprin-2 knockdown rats increase their ability to concentrate urine and so doing they prevent the decrease in sodium excretion (i.e., elevation of plasma sodium) resulting from lower urine output by producing more concentrated urine. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>We then explored the molecular mechanisms of Caprin-2 action in the hypothalamus, based on our hypothesis that this RNA binding protein (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010) might associate with the AVP mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Caprin-2 does indeed bind to AVP mRNAs in the SON and PVN in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>We then asked if Caprin-2 binding has any role in the alterations in AVP mRNA metabolism that occur as a consequence of the chronic osmotic stimuli of dehydration or salt-loading, namely an increase in abundance (Sherman et al., 1986; Murphy and Carter, 1990), and the unusual post-transcriptional modification of an increase in the length of the 3′ poly(A) tail (Carrazana et al., 1988; Zingg et al., 1988; Carter and Murphy, 1989; Murphy and Carter, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Our in vivo studies show that knockdown of Caprin-2 in the rat SON and PVN prevented the salt-loading-induced increases in the abundance of the AVP mRNA, and the elongation of its poly(A) tail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid containing rat AVP genomic sequences under constitutive CMV promoter, concomitant overexpression of Caprin-2 increased AVP mRNA abundance, whilst addition of the Caprin-2 shRNA significantly reduced AVP mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>At the same time, Caprin-2 overexpression resulted in elongation of the poly(A) tail of the AVP mRNA, whilst Caprin-2 knockdown shortened the poly(A) tails of the AVP mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The direct binding and positive regulation of AVP transcript levels suggest that Caprin-2 may be important for stabilization of AVP mRNAs during osmotic stress, in a similar way to another AVP mRNA binding protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (Mohr et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>It is thus tempting to speculate that the two processes, increased poly(A) tail length and increased mRNA abundance, are consequential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>An important role of poly(A) tail length in regulation of mRNA degradation and stability has been demonstrated for many transcripts (Curinha et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that one of the functions of Caprin-2-mediated poly(A) tail length regulation is protection of AVP transcripts from degradation, which in turn would lead to the observed increase of AVP mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Note that we are unable to distinguish between a process that promotes polyadenylation, or one that prevents deadenylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, whilst Caprin-2 knockdown in the PVN and SON resulted in a decreased AVP mRNA levels in those structures, plasma AVP (peptide) levels increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Although the precise mechanisms underlying this paradoxical effect require separate investigation, examination of the existing literature leads us to propose two possible hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Firstly, Caprin-2 binding to AVP mRNA might inhibit translation, a phenomenon observed as a consequence of other association mRNA-RNA-binding protein interactions, such as the binding of PABP to the AVP mRNA (Mohr et al., 2002; Richter, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This is not necessarily in disagreement with the fact that Caprin-2 stimulates extension of poly(A) tail in AVP mRNAs—recent studies have revealed that a correlation between the length of poly(A) tail and translational activity is not always present (Weill et al., 2012; Subtelny et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>It has been shown previously that recombinant Caprin-2 inhibits the translation of a luciferase mRNA in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with our observation that Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN increases circulating plasma AVP levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that this effect results from the increased translation of AVP mRNA under conditions when Caprin-2 protein level is too low to suppress this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Moreover, knockdown of Caprin-2, whilst increasing the translation of the AVP mRNA, might increase its turnover, and hence decreases steady state transcript levels and poly(A) tail length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>We have previously examined the polysome distribution of the AVP mRNA in euhydrated and salt-loaded SON (Murphy and Carter, 1990), and showed no difference in the pattern association with heavy polysome fractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>However, the AVP mRNA is small, and subject to a high rate of translation, even in euhydrated animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Thus, the rates of translation initiation, elongation and termination, none of which are directly measured by polysome analysis, especially when the size of the RNA limits ribosome number, could be influenced, positively or negatively, by poly(A) tail length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Quantification of Caprin-2 and AVP levels in AVP in the SON neurons (Figure 2) revealed that salt-loading elicits a significant increase in the former protein, but a significant decrease in the latter, consistent with Caprin-2 being an inhibitor of the translation of the AVP mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to point out the steady-state level of AVP in hypothalamic MCNs is not only determined by translation rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>As we describe in some detail in the Introduction, the AVP precursor is subject to axonal transport from cell bodies in the hypothalamus to terminals in the PP, a process that is activated by the need to deliver mature peptide to the circulation following an osmotic stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Thus, further studies are needed to examine the translation of the AVP mRNA under different physiological conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>A second, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis is that the effects that we observe after Caprin-2 knockdown could be modulated by changes in dendritic release of AVP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Dendritic release and autocrine or paracrine action of AVP has been well documented (Ludwig and Stern, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>AVP released from dendrites inhibits the electrical activity of AVP neurons, thus suppressing axonal release to the blood stream (Ludwig and Stern, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Caprin-2 protein is present in the RNA granules localized in the rat neuronal dendrites (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that Caprin-2 knockdown results in a decrease of the synthesis and dendritic release of AVP, which in turn decreases AVP-mediated auto-inhibition of AVP neurons and leads to an increase of AVP release in the neurohypophysis and increased plasma concentration, as we observe after Caprin-2 knockdown in the SON and PVN. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have shown that, during an osmotic stimulus, three things happen to the AVP mRNA in the SON and PVN due to the action of Caprin-2: the abundance of Caprin-2 protein/AVP mRNA complexes increases, the AVP mRNA poly(A) tail elongates, and there is an increase in steady state levels of the AVP mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data, we propose a new mechanism mediating the regulation of AVP gene expression (Figure 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Whilst it has previously been demonstrated that a chronic osmotic stimulus results in an increase in the transcription of the AVP gene (Murphy and Carter, 1990), the data presented here provides new evidence that post-transcriptional process, governed by Caprin-2, are also operative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Both the transcriptional and the post-transcriptional mechanisms would contribute to overall steady-state AVP mRNA abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, it would appear that the increase in AVP mRNA mediated by Caprin-2 does not result in an increase in AVP peptide production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our results are consistent with previous reports that showed that Caprin-2 inhibits translation (Shiina and Tokunaga, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Thus we suggest that association with Caprin-2 may inhibit the production of AVP peptide, perhaps by directly interfering with the translational apparatus, or through sequestration of AVP mRNA in translationally inert mRNP storage or transport granules (Buchan, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, polysome analysis revealed a heavy class of EDTA-resistant AVP mRNA containing fractions that might represent storage granules (Murphy and Carter, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>We also note that AVP transcripts are known to be transported to dendrites (Mohr et al., 2002) and to axons (Murphy et al., 1989), although in the latter case, the AVP RNAs are characterised by a short poly(A) tail that does not change in length following osmotic stimulation (Murphy et al., 1989).10.7554/eLife.09656.013Figure 10.A model for the actions of Caprin-2.Caprin-2 expression increases in the rat SON and PVN following an osmotic stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Caprin-2 binds to the AVP mRNA, and mediates an increase in the length of the poly(A) tail, either by stimulating further synthesis, or by inhibiting deadenylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Caprin-2 also mediates an increase in VP mRNA abundance, possibly by increasing transcript stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, we propose that Caprin-2 inhibits translation of the AVP mRNA, perhaps by displacing ribosomes or by slowing initiation or elongation, or through mediating sequestration into translationally inert storage or transport granules.DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09656.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09656.013</ext-link> </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The osmotic status-dependent modulation of AVP mRNA poly(A) tail length in the SON and PVN was first described over 20 years ago (Carrazana et al., 1988; Zingg et al., 1988; Carter and Murphy, 1989), but only now, with the discovery of Caprin-2, do we have insight into the regulation and physiological function of this post-transcriptional process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>To get a more comprehensive picture of Caprin-2 functioning in the HNS, it will be of interest to identify other mRNAs that bind to Caprin2 in the SON and PVN, in addition to those encoding AVP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Further, identification of the sequences within the AVP mRNA that are recognised by Caprin-2, and the Caprin-2 protein modules that mediate binding to the AVP mRNA and poly(A) tail extension, might reveal interactions with other known Caprin-2 functions, such as the modulation of Wnt signaling (Ding et al., 2008; Miao et al., 2014; Flores and Zhong, 2015) that may have regulatory and physiological relevance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Your submission has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Michael Green, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, Konopacka et al. identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of salt and water homeostasis by post-transcriptional control of the antidiuretic neurohormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous studies by this lab have shown that Caprin-2 mRNA level is induced in response to osmotic challenges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the present manuscript they show that the induction of Caprin-2 protein is important to maintain physiological responses to osmotic stimuli (i.e. fluid intake and urine output, osmolality and sodium concentration). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They associate this response to the regulation of AVP levels by Caprin-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, they show that Caprin-2, which is a known RNA-binding protein, forms a complex with AVP mRNA following osmotic challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Through a set of experiments using shRNA knockdown and/or overexpression of Caprin-2 in vivo and in vitro they show that the binding of Caprin-2 to AVP affects the levels of AVP mRNA via regulation of AVP's poly(A) tail elongation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The reinstatement of AVP levels in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) following chronic osmotic stimulation is critical for the organism's survival as AVP is the major regulator of water balance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Murphy and others previously reported that at the onset of an osmotic challenge AVP mRNA is subjected to an increase in the length of the poly(A) tail, which may affect AVP levels in neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the present manuscript they provide a mechanism for this post-transcriptional modification and associate it to a critical physiological response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although the reviewers appreciate the importance of the work, they have raised a number of specific concerns that need to be addressed for publication in eLife. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These are listed in the “Essential revisions” section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There are also a number of recommendations that the authors feel would strengthen the manuscript but are not essential and these are listed in the “Optional revisions” section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Essential revisions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>1) It is standard in studies using siRNAs or shRNAs to rule out off target effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This is typically done by showing that a second, unrelated siRNA or shRNA against the same target has a similar effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The authors need to show that a second shRNA against Caprin-2, which is unrelated to the first Caprin-2 shRNA, has a similar effect in the key experiments/figures in this study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Thus, under salt-loaded conditions, the poly(A) returns to the length seen in euhydrated rats when Caprin-2 is knocked down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>This has been clarified in the text (subsection “Caprin-2 regulates the length of AVP mRNA poly(A) tails in vivo”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>7) In the Discussion, please clarify the sentence: “These observations may be explained by water retention resulting from the elevated plasma AVP levels found in the Caprin-2 shRNA-transduced rats.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The authors explain that paradoxically increased plasma AVP could be due to increased osmolarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>If so, could authors directly measure the AVP content from posterior pituitary where MCN-synthesized AVP was first delivered to. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="?"><plain>It is still confusing whether Cap2 KD directly alters (increases or decreases) AVP peptide production and whether the aberrant physiological responses in SL-stimulated Cap2 KD rats could be explained by elevated AVP action? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>As we discuss extensively, we suggest that the physiological effects seen in Caprin-2 knockdown rats could be a consequence of elevated AVP action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we see more circulating AVP in these animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The question of the effect on Caprin-2 on AVP mRNA translation, whilst discussed, is beyond the scope of this paper. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>1) Figure 6: Please provide western blot of Cap2 in KD and overexpression conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In addition, can the protein level of AVP be detected by nonapeptide ELISA (used in Figure 3E) or immunofluorescence labeling by the antibody detecting AVP NP-II (used in Figure 2B)? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>A Western blot showing Caprin-2 protein expression in transfected cells is shown in a Figure 7, which also diagrammatically conceptualises the experiment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>2) Figure 7: Does the AVP RNA with shorter or longer poly(A) tail distributed differentially in the polysome profile? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This statement has been added to the text (Discussion, sixth paragraph): </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>“We have previously examined the polysome distribution of the AVP mRNA in euhydrated and salt-loaded SON9, and showed no difference in the pattern association with heavy polysome fractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>However, the AVP mRNA is small, and subject to a high rate of translation, even in euhydrated animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Thus, the rates of translation initiation, elongation and termination, none of which are directly measured by polysome analysis, especially when the size of the RNA limits ribosome number, could be influenced, positively or negatively, by poly(A) tail length.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this figure should be combined with Figure 6 and the protein levels of Cap2 and AVP should be measured by western blotting/ ELISA/ immunostaining (whichever is appropriate to detect Cap2 and AVP) and included in this figure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>See new Figure 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="?"><plain>Can overexpression of an RNA binding-defective Cap2 mutant not affect poly(A) tail of AVP RNA? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This would be a most interesting experiment, but is beyond the scope of this manuscript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Hopefully we will soon secure funding to explore the mechanisms of Caprin-2 action in closer molecular detail. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>3) If HEK 293 cells can recapitulate the relation of AVP RNA and Cap2 observed in SON and PVN, whether expression of Cap2 promotes polyadenylation or inhibits deadenylation of AVP RNA and whether AVP RNAs with long or short poly(A) tail distribute differently in polysomes could be simply tested in this system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>See above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The authors should consider the molecular approaches used to study polyadenylation, deadenylation and translation efficiency in cells to experimentally test these possibilities without extensive speculations in the Discussion section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>This is important since the authors found a paradoxical increase in circulating AVP peptide (Figure 3E) that is not in conceptual accordance with decreased poly(A) tail and stability of AVP RNA found in SON and PVN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Despite Bartel's genome-wide study did not show strong correlation between poly(A) tail (at the steady state) and translation efficiency, their results do not rule out that translation efficiency of any given RNA can be influenced by ongoing polyadenylation or deadenylation events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>For example, the authors (along with many published studies) observed the strong correlation between the change in poly(A) length of AVP RNA in vivo as a function of the degree of physiological responses by altering AVP expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, Cap2 is only able to affect a portion of poly(A) tail (∼20-30 bp out of ∼160 bp under KD condition) in response to osmotic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Thus, the change in AVP expression is likely influenced by polyadenylation or deadenylation event itself instead of poly(A) length. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Please note that we suggest that Caprin-2 is responsible for extending the length of the poly(A) tail, not synthesising the entirety of the poly(A) tail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Thus, under salt-loaded conditions, the poly(A) returns to the length seen in euhydrated rats when Caprin-2 is knocked down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This has been clarified in the text (subsection “Caprin-2 regulates the length of AVP mRNA poly(A) tails in vivo”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>4) The authors claimed that they are unable to distinguish the role of Cap2 between a process that promotes polyadenylation or one that prevents deadenylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Because the authors can recapitulate Cap2 effect in the poly(A) length of AVP RNA in HEK293 cells, it is doable tasks to delineate the role of Cap2 in these two aspects of regulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>These are interesting experiments, but are beyond the scope of this manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>5) Figure 3: The big puzzle here is that the increased plasma AVP (detecting the mature AVP nonapeptide by ELISA) in Cap2 KD SL rats did not evoke stronger physiological responses than control SL rats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="?"><plain>Can this measurement be done using blood withdrawal from rats at SL1 and SL3 besides SL7? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>How about the expression levels of AVP and Cap2 in posterior pituitary since the earlier study showed that poly(A) elongation of AVP RNA is only in hypothalamus but not in posterior pituitary? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>These are interesting experiments, but, again, they are beyond the scope of this manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>6) Related to point 2, it is important to at least roughly map the position of the caprin-2 binding site on the AVP mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Most likely it will be near the 3' end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Mapping can be accomplished by performing RIP or CLIP using region specific primer-pairs and/or by in vitro RNA-protein binding experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Although interesting, these experiments are also beyond the scope of this paper. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>A schematic model has been included (new Figure 10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>8) The section “Cloning and characterization of rat brain Caprin-2 mRNA isoforms” interrupts the flow of the text. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>It is more appropriate for the Methods section. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>10) Figure 2B: The upper and lower panels (Control and shRNA) should be presented at the same magnification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Also, there is no annotation of the colors used to label Caprin and AVP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Better pictures at the same magnification have been provided, and annotations explained in the figure legend (now Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>11) Figure 4: Histograms “a” and “b” are confusing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>It is not clear that “a” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA Vs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Ig control whereas “b” is Caprin-2 binding of AVP mRNA in ehuhydrated vs. salt loaded animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>We would consider omitting “a”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>A schemata depicting the RNA pull-down procedure would be helpful. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>We have omitted (a) at the suggestion of the referee. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>RNA pull-down is a standard procedure that is described in detail in the Materials and methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>A schematic is now included in Figure 5 as suggested. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>12) The reviewers suggest changing the subheading “Caprin-2 regulates AVP… in vitro” to “Caprin-2 directly regulates AVP… in vitro” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Thank you. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This has been done. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>13) In the Discussion the authors write: “Salt loading increases the amount of AVP mRNA bound to Caprin-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This can be attributed both to the increases in Caprin-2 protein levels and the abundance of AVP mRNAs.” One of the reviewers found this confusing because the increased Caprin-2 protein levels are responsible for the AVP mRNA abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Thus, this is one not two phenomena, and the word “both” is confusing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The referee makes a good point. </plain></SENT>
