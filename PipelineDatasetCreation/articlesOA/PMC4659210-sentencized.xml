</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Fish represent the oldest and most diverse vertebrate group, inhabiting every available aquatic environment [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>They display remarkable heterogeneity of life trait characteristics and occupy a historically important place in human culture as a source of nutritionally valuable food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Marked by genome duplication events, the diversification and adaptive radiation of fish represent an attractive evolutionary model to study ecological, behavioural and physiological aspects of biodiversity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Migratory tunas (family Scombridae, order Perciformes: suborder Scombroidei), are pelagic oceanodromous top predators, which display a set of extreme adaptations to life in a prey depauperate pelagic environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>They are obligate ram ventilators with streamlined bodies for rapid locomotion, have increased aerobic scope and metabolic rates that allow them to satisfy the energy needs of multiple high performance functions without compromise, including high digestive rates, increased somatic and gonadal growth and incredibly fast recovery from oxygen debt after exhaustive exercise compared to other teleosts [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A key characteristic of tunas is their ability to retain metabolic heat in the brain, red muscle and viscera via vascular specialisations called rete mirabile, which comprise numerous juxtaposed arterial and venous vessels acting as a counter-current heat exchange system [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This heterothermic physiology shares characteristics of both poikilothermic and homeothermic organisms and is considered to have developed in order to permit thermal niche expansion, especially in correlation with maintenance of central nervous system function [5] or to sustain a rise in aerobic capacity and muscular performance [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The largest of the tuna species, Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus (Linnaeus, 1758), inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Based on the observed homing behaviour to two major spawning grounds, the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea [7], the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recognises a smaller Western and larger Eastern population as separate management units divided by the 45°W meridian. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although the differentiation between these populations has been corroborated by genetic data [8, 9], results of electronic tagging reveal a complex ecology, with extensive trans-Atlantic migrations and mixing of individuals at the foraging and spawning grounds [10, 11], complicating T. thynnus stock management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In high demand for sushi and sashimi preparation in the Japanese market, both populations of T. thynnus are considered to be depleted and overfished [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>While latest assessments report a reduction in fishing mortality and increase in spawning stock biomass, allowing for moderate catch quotas increase after a long time in 2015 [15], these populations remain under threat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Capture-based tuna aquaculture, developed in the Mediterranean Sea over the past two decades, relies on yearly population renewal from the wild, fattening fish to market size in 3 months to 2 years, but is not thought to be sustainable in the long run [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is considered that only domestication of T. thynnus and development of high welfare aquaculture practices independent of wild resources can preserve the species for future generations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Extensive research efforts have been made regarding the control of T. thynnus reproduction in captivity [16, 17], a prerequisite for the development of a sustainable aquaculture industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>As evidenced from the Pacific bluefin tuna (T. orientalis) aquaculture development in Japan [18], the first bluefin tuna species successfully grown in captivity, a comprehensive approach will be required to solve many technical problems in order to meet this species’ physiological needs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Large scale transcriptomic studies of important life trait characteristics, such as growth, maturation, environmental tolerance and disease resistance, can provide important knowledge concerning underlying molecular mechanisms and control elements, assisting in the development of welfare-centred and sustainable management strategies for aquaculture species, e.g. [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>With the increasing availability of high throughput sequencing technologies, development of the necessary tools and resources for broad-scale transcriptomics studies can be achieved in a relatively short period of time, even for species with a low level of background information [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Until recently, publicly available genomic resources for T. thynnus have been relatively scarce, most being derived from a single EST (expressed sequence tag) sequencing project comprising adult liver, ovary and testis mRNA transcripts contributed by Chini et al. [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This resource served as the basis for the construction of the first T. thynnus-specific oligonucleotide DNA microarray, which was employed for the description of the Gulf of Mexico T. thynnus gonad transcriptome [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It was also utilised to profile the cardiac transcriptome response to temperature acclimation in congeneric T. orientalis [24], highlighting the applicability of such a tool for gene expression analyses in phylogenetically related species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The release of a genome for T. orientalis [25] opens new opportunities for tuna comparative genome studies and ongoing transcriptome characterisation projects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the current study were: 1) to contribute to and expand existing transcriptomics resources for studying T. thynnus, 2) to use the newly developed resource to design and validate a custom oligo-microarray, and 3) to employ the newly developed microarray to investigate functional differences in transcript expression among tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To this end, pyrosequencing technology was used to sequence adult mixed-tissue normalised cDNA library providing the template for the development of a custom 8 × 15 K Agilent oligo-microarray. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The microarray was used to compare: gill, heart, liver, ovaries and testes of adult fish and to infer their respective transcriptional specificities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The derived transcriptome was also compared to T. orientalis genome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>These included a subunit of mediator complex (med6), which is a transcriptional co-activator of RNA polymerase II that is particularly important for expression of developmentally regulated genes [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Fanconi anaemia complementation group 1 (fanci) was also present, part of the DNA repair mechanism employed during homologous recombination in meiosis [74], as well as Piwi-like 2 (piwil2) homologue, essential for the germline integrity via transposable element repression and gonad development [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Analysis of ovary- and testis-associated transcripts as a single amalgamated group (ovary + testis) did not reveal any new additional pathways relative to separate analysis of the two tissues (see Additional file 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>A further Biolayout cluster comprised largely testis-specific transcripts (Cluster 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Testis-associated pathways (Fig. 7) were more similar to those of other inspected tissues than to ovaries, however there was an overlap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Shared pathways were associated with nucleotide metabolism, replication, repair and translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Some of the transcriptional differences between ovaries and testes have been identified for T. thynnus [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A similar transcript to one found differentially expressed in this previous study, was present here in the testis-specific Cluster 6; a component of t-complex tcte1, important for molecular interaction between sperm and egg zona pellucida [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This was also identified as testis-specific in rainbow trout by Rolland et al., when compared to ovary, liver, muscle, gill and brain transcripts [77]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 (fabp2), suggested to play a role in sex dependent energy balance in T. thynnus [23], was found in heart-specific Cluster 2 (see Additional file 3) with its expression markedly elevated in testes compared to ovaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The presence of several typically pituitary hormone transcripts, growth hormone (gh) and somatolactin (sl), were also apparent in the testis-specific cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The expression profile for somatolactin was re-investigated with qPCR and joint analysis of both datasets statistically confirmed (p &lt; 0.05) this observation (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Both hormones are members of the growth hormone/prolactin family and are implicated in pleiotropic functions such as somatic growth, osmoregulation, lipid metabolism and reproduction [78, 79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Extra-pituitary expression of growth hormone has been demonstrated in mammals and chicken testes [80], as well as fish [81] being localised to spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in chicken and Sertoli cells surrounding the germ cells in Japanese eel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>It has a paracrine role during spermatogenesis, stimulating proliferation of spermatogonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This mitotic phase of spermatogenesis occurs in Mediterranean T. thynnus between October and January [82], corresponding to the collection period for our samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, a germ cell line marker vasa homologue (vasa), a putative RNA helicase found to be expressed in Pacific bluefin tuna spermatogonia [83], was also found to be up-regulated in testes of T. thynnus examined here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Primarily expressed in the pituitary gland, somatolactin mRNA has been detected across various tissues, including gonads in fish [84, 85]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest T. thynnus testes actively transcribe gh and sl, warranting further investigation, especially in the context of reproductive cycle in both gonads. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>During their spawning migrations, tuna utilise perigonadal mesenteric fat deposits as a source of metabolic energy for reproductive maturation and active swimming, which are primarily processed by the liver [82, 86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In this study the T. thynnus liver was functionally characterised by lipid, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, bile secretion, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, xenobiotic biodegradation and immune system (Fig. 7), consistent with the basic metabolic role of this organ [87] and agreeing with previous findings for the liver of T. thynnus [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Among the transcripts showing predominant expression in the liver, members of a haem-containing superfamily of cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenases, involved in metabolic biotransformation of xenobiotics and lipids often associated with liver [88], were found (see Additional file 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The liver is also a key production site for coagulation and complement proteolytic cascade components, mediators of blood clotting and elements of the innate immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Two representative transcripts, homologues of blood coagulation factor V (f5), pivotal proteins in maintaining haemostasis with dual pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant activities in humans [89], and complement component C4 (c4), which plays a crucial role in the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation as a subunit of the C3 convertase [90], were found to be significantly up-regulated in the liver compared to other tissues (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Tuna cardiac function has been the subject of extensive investigation, as the heart operates at ambient temperature while supporting high metabolic rates and endothermic physiology [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Tuna have large hearts that function at close to maximum stroke volumes and depend, more than other teleosts, on oxygen consuming fatty acid oxidation as a fuel source, similar to mammals [62, 91]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria isolated from skipjack tuna ventricles have a higher capacity to oxidise lactate than other metabolites, suggesting that lactate is also an alternative fuel source, especially during high intensity swimming when blood lactate is elevated [92]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>These processes were well represented in the pathways and functional categories assigned to T. thynnus heart (apex ventriculi) compared to gill, liver and gonads in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Lipid (fatty acid degradation), energy (oxidative phosphorylation), carbohydrate metabolism (pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis) and circulatory system (cardiac muscle contraction) were most prominent categories in functional contrasts displayed for the heart in Fig. 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The ability to maintain cardiac performance during temperature acclimation, especially to cold, has been linked at the transcriptomic and functional level to Ca2+-dependent excitation-contraction coupling (EC) in T. orientalis [24, 93]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (atp2a2a or serca2) homologue, vital for Ca2+ removal from cytosol into sarcoplasmic reticulum in vertebrates [94], has been identified in T. thynnus heart-specific Cluster 2 (Fig. 6 and see Additional file 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Amalgamating transcripts by pairs of tissues (e.g. gill + liver, gill + heart, gill + testis etc.), in order to resolve shared and unique pathways, showed pairings which included gill, heart and liver to be most informative and revealed functional signatures shared between these tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>For instance, the most pronounced feature in Fig. 7 is the up-regulation of metabolism of other amino acids, β-alanine metabolism specifically (see Additional file 6), found exclusively for the heart + liver combination. β-Alanine is produced in vertebrate liver and is used as a rate-limiting precursor for synthesis of histidine-containing dipeptides such as carnosine and anserine in skeletal muscle, heart and brain [95, 96]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>These compounds are involved in intracellular pH buffering by tissues exhibiting high dependence on anaerobic glycolytic metabolism in which lactic acid is generated, such as fast-twich white skeletal muscle in fish [95]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>High levels of histidine-containing dipeptides have been recorded for skipjack tuna white muscle, with anserine largely exceeding carnosine [97]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Aside from strong buffering capacity, carnosine has also been found to exhibit antioxidant, pro-contractile, chelating and anti-glycating properties and it is considered that β-alanine diet supplementation can have protective cardiac effects due to increased levels of carnosine [96]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Other important pathways mediating environmental and physiological adaptation were also identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor) signalling pathway was found to be up-regulated in gill + heart and heart + liver combinations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Hif is a transcriptional factor governing the physiological response to hypoxia that induces a wide range of changes in energy metabolism, red blood cell formation, vascularisation, oxygen transport and apoptosis [98]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Regulation of hif-1α has been reported in haemaotopoietic and gas-exchange organs in T. orientalis as a result of cold temperature acclimation [99]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>ABC transporter systems were found to be up-regulated in gill + heart and gill + liver combinations (see Additional file 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The ATP-binding cassette (ABC-transporters) are trans-membrane spanning proteins involved in substrate translocation across membranes and form the basis of multi-xenobiotic resistance mechanism in aquatic animals, with high detoxification relevance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>They also participate in transport of lipids, ions and other metabolites and have been attributed various tissue-specific roles [100]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Finally, insulin signalling pathway was found common to all pairwise combinations of gill, heart and liver (see Additional file 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Exerting its effect through insulin receptors and associated effector signalling cascade actively transcribed in various peripheral organs, insulin has been implicated in wide range of processes in fish, including vital carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, appetite regulation, growth and development [101]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>We have developed and validated a new and flexible gene expression profiling tool, in the form of a 15 K oligonucleotide DNA microarray, which produced biologically relevant information agreeing with prior observations made in the literature, providing external validation for our new resource. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The resolved expression profiles of gill, heart, liver and gonads provide a useful starting point for exploring gene expression patterns in T. thynnus and for planning new transcriptomic studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The oligo-microarray can also be further expanded to include un-annotated transcripts from the generated library with the aim of extending their functional characterisation through correlation with annotated entities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>It is important to keep in mind that even tissue specific profiles can be population dependent [102], warranting further research on captive and wild tuna populations. </plain></SENT>
