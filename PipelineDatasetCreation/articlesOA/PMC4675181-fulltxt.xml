A significant challenge was the collection of high-quality biospecimens for extensive genomic analyses. Here we describe how a successful infrastructure for biospecimen procurement was developed and implemented by multiple research partners to support the prospective collection, annotation, and distribution of blood, tissues, and cell lines for the GTEx project. Other research projects can follow this model and form beneficial partnerships with rapid autopsy and organ procurement organizations to collect high quality biospecimens and associated clinical data for genomic studies. Biospecimens, clinical and genomic data, and Standard Operating Procedures guiding biospecimen collection for the GTEx project are available to the research community.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>Introduction</title><p>T<sc>he aim of the Genotype-Tissue Expression</sc> (GTEx) Project of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx">https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx</uri>) is to determine how genetic variation affects normal gene expression in human tissues, and ultimately to assess how this relationship correlates with the development of disease. To achieve this goal, the project planned to collect multiple different human tissues from each of hundreds of donors, isolate nucleic acids from the tissues and perform genotyping, gene expression profiling, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing, and analyze the data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> The scientific goals of the project required that the donors and their biospecimens present with no evidence of disease (henceforth termed &#x0201c;normal tissues&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;normal biospecimens&#x0201d;).</p><p>The project began as a 2.5-year pilot study to assess the feasibility of collecting tissue from up to 40 different tissue types from women and 34 different tissue types from men, from hundreds of individual donors.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The resulting biospecimens needed to yield RNA with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN)<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> of at least 6 for optimal RNA sequencing results. The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (BBRB) worked with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and other GTEx project partners to develop a plan for collecting the normal human biospecimens for GTEx.</p><p>A group of experts working in the ethical, scientific, and operational aspects of biobanking was assembled to identify key challenges of collecting normal biospecimens and to help develop a framework for the project. This planning group recognized that donations of normal biospecimens from living donors were rare, typically only occurring as a secondary research donation when surgery is performed for cancer treatment, limb amputation, or other surgical disease treatments. Thus it was envisioned that the GTEx biospecimens would be collected from deceased donors, due to the project's need for multiple tissues per individual donor.</p><p>The GTEx project set out to partner with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and institutions with rapid autopsy programs to obtain the high number of normal biospecimens needed for this study.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The expert planning group established a comprehensive set of recommendations for acquiring high-quality, normal biospecimens.

The GTEx pilot study required explicit next-of-kin or legally authorized representative authorization for participation in the project.</p><p>Under the law, deceased individuals are not considered to be human subjects and do not require consent for research; however, GTEx management decided to require authorization due to the large amount of sequencing data to be produced and made publically available.

An electronic data capture system, the Comprehensive Data Resource described later in this article, controlled the display and access to data based on user roles and entitlements. BSSs could only view data from their own sites, and only a limited number of approved staff members within the GTEx project could view protected health information. In addition, the project established a combined material transfer agreement/data use agreement that covered all parties receiving either biospecimens or data.</p><p>The template agreement is posted publicly at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/global/pdfs/caHUB_Material_Transfer_and_Data_Use_Agreement_072512-508.pdf">http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/global/pdfs/caHUB_Material_Transfer_and_Data_Use_Agreement_072512-508.pdf</uri>. While the development and negotiation of such an agreement required an initial time investment, the agreement clearly laid out responsibilities and requirements for privacy protection for all parties and was written broadly enough to cover the collection process throughout the course of the project.</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>Developing an infrastructure to support the collection of human biospecimens</title><p>To meet the challenging biospecimen requirements of the GTEx pilot study, NCI's BBRB and its partners developed a novel infrastructure for collecting normal human biospecimens for research purposes. BBRB, together with the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, developed an operational plan to contract medical centers and OPOs to screen potential donors, consent next-of-kin, and collect and ship biospecimens. Each BSS complied with their respective institution's biospecimen handling policies to procure GTEx biospecimens that were sent to a central, separately contracted Comprehensive Biospecimen Resource (CBR).</p><p>The CBR inventoried and divided biospecimens for three purposes: (1) shipment to the separately contracted GTEx Laboratory, Data Analysis, and Coordinating Center (LDACC) for molecular analysis, (2) histology for pathology review, and (3) local storage for future analysis. Whole brains were sent directly from the BSSs to a separate Brain Bank for proper sectioning and were then subsequently sent to the LDACC for analysis. Also, blood and skin samples were sent directly to the LDACC to generate EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and fibroblasts, respectively.</p><p>The entire biospecimen collection, processing, storage, and transfer operation was coordinated through a central quality control program and uses a custom web portal for data entry. A Pathology Resource Center (PRC), comprised of board-certified pathologists, evaluated the quality of the biospecimens. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> outlines the biospecimen platform and the flow of biospecimens and data to and from each site within the infrastructure.

Hallmarks of established quality management methodology including data management, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) development, and auditing have been adopted by the project.</p><p>A major challenge for GTEx was in the management of data associated with the biospecimens; each case could include more than 500 data elements. To help manage the data, a system for data queries was implemented and this process proved to be an effective method for producing well-organized, easily accessible, and reliable data. Implementation of data management techniques can be time consuming and burdensome. However, such techniques provided real time feedback to the BSSs on their protocol conduct, which resulted in site improvements and improved adherence to protocol.</p><p>Queries were also used to guide data collection best practices, resulting in an increase in data fidelity and a decrease in the issuance of certain query types. The development of these standards allowed for harmonization across all BSSs and was an important contributor to the project's successful acquisition of high quality biospecimens.</p><p>One lesson learned from the GTEx pilot study is that there is not a &#x0201c;one size fits all approach&#x0201d; to SOP development for biospecimen procurement; this lesson was largely based on institutional differences, many of which were unavoidable. The BSSs were consulted when new SOPs were developed to ensure that the SOPs were operationally feasible. Document control software was also utilized to ensure that current versions of SOPs were being used and training was conducted to ensure comprehension of new procedures. Approximately 100 supporting quality documents were developed to provide consistency and clarity to this complex project. Many of these documents are available to the public, including SOPs, workflows and project-related tools (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/resources/sops/library.asp">http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/resources/sops/library.asp</uri>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s007"><title>Results</title><sec id="s008"><title>Biospecimen annotation</title><p>The utility of a biospecimen for research purposes depends a great deal on the degree of annotation associated with the biospecimen. The GTEx pilot study used the Comprehensive Data Resource (CDR) to facilitate the input and analysis of multiple data types related to informed consent, the donor's medical history, biospecimen collection and handling, and pathology annotations. The CDR is a distributed, multi-tenant informatics platform that controls display and access to data based on user roles and entitlements. Personally identifiable information and protected health information were restricted to a limited data set and to individuals with authorized access through dynamic content redaction.</p><p>Web service application program interfaces (APIs) connected remote Laboratory Information Management Systems, whole-slide imaging systems and molecular analysis APIs for real-time, two-way data transfers. The CDR proved to be user-friendly, durable, and scalable. Its common data model was easy to query and easy to integrate with outside information technology systems for the benefit of sharing and exchanging data. The CDR was accessed by multiple users around the clock for entering and accessing data necessary for the collection, shipment, processing, and analysis of biospecimens.</p><p>The challenging biospecimen collection setting and differences among partner organizations complicated the process of uniform data collection for donor characteristics. For example, data related to the health of the donor could have been derived from multiple sources, including the donor's medical record (if available) and information from the donor's next-of-kin. Accordingly, additional CDR data fields were included to annotate the source of various information reported. Terminology related to data elements, such as medication name and medical condition or cause of death, varied across the BSSs, most often due to the use of similar but different terms or synonyms.</p><p>The CDR interfaced with a common vocabulary system, derived in part from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM), Current Procedural Terminology (CPT4) and the National Drug Code, to standardize the data collected about GTEx donors and to improve comparability across information sets from different BSSs. These vocabulary elements were presented dynamically and in context to data entry personnel during data entry.</p><p>Data from the CDR was exported to the LDACC-developed GTEx web portal (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/home">http://www.gtexportal.org/home</uri>), where members of the public can request access to GTEx samples, and to dbGAP (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1</uri>), where the research community can request access to genomic data and corresponding biospecimen data, such as clinical, demographic, and biospecimen handling data.</p></sec><sec id="s009"><title>Number of biospecimens collected</title><p>The GTEx pilot biospecimen collection included up to 41 different PAXgene preserved postmortem target tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). The PAXgene Tissue preservation system<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> developed by Qiagen was selected for GTEx because it facilitates good histological analysis as well as extraction of high-quality RNA and DNA. Hair, whole brain (frozen), and sections from 11 brain sub-regions (frozen) were also collected. The tissue types collected for GTEx were chosen based on their relevance to the scientific goals of the project, their clinical significance, logistical feasibility, and their relevance to the research community. Recovering target tissues from donors in rapid autopsy programs, where the donors were not donating tissue for transplant purposes, was frequently achievable. The OPO setting proved to be more challenging due to several factors, including the need to prioritize tissue and organ donations to living recipients and delays due to cause-of-death investigations; however this obstacle did not hinder GTEx from reaching its collection goal, ultimately procuring 10,152 PAXgene preserved tissue aliquots from190 donors.</p><fig id="f4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><bold>FIG. 4.</bold></label><caption><p>The number and type of GTEx tissues collected. 41 different PAXgene preserved tissues types were collected for the GTEx project.

Eleven tissue types had at least 70% of the samples with RIN greater than 6, and more than 60% of all RNA from GTEx tissues had RIN values greater than 6, making them suitable for high dimensional genomic analyses. A RIN value of 6 was set as a goal because, in general, tissues with a RIN of 6 and above yield high quality RNA sequencing data, whereas tissues with a RIN value below 6 are more likely to have samples with failed sequencing reactions.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> At the outset of the project, we also tested RNAs of different quality (RIN 2.0&#x02013;9.0) across multiple different library construction protocols for RNA sequencing. The most scalable and robust library construction protocol was the Illumina TruSeq protocol with Poly-A selection, which performed best with more intact RNA with RIN values of 6.0 or higher.</p><fig id="f5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><bold>FIG. 5.</bold></label><caption><p>GTEx RIN values.

PMI is defined as the interval between the time of death or the cessation of blood flow and the time that the tissue is placed in preservative. The average RIN value was 8.6 for tissues with a PMI less than 4 hours, and 6.7 for tissues with a PMI between 4 and 8 hours, while tissues with a PMI of &#x0003e;8 hours resulted in average RIN values below 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>). An hourly correlation between PMI and RIN is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Text S2</xref>.

Most established tissue networks do not contain a large number of normal, non-disease biospecimens, but instead have a collection of retrospective disease or condition-specific biospecimens, frequently with limited annotation available. BBRB met the GTEx pilot requirements by creating the infrastructure described here for the acquisition of normal biospecimens through contractual relationships with OPOs and rapid autopsy programs.</p><p>The biospecimen collection project of the GTEx pilot faced many challenges. Collecting biospecimens for research purposes using a novel preservation method (PAXgene Tissue) presented a new challenge for OPOs due to the fact that the staff needed to be trained in proper use of the preservative including the required step of switching from fix to stabilizer solutions. Ongoing feedback from project partners was essential to synergize project needs and local operations. Throughout the initiation, start-up and steady state phases of the pilot GTEx project, collaboration with all partners was paramount to the success of GTEx analysis, and continues to be an essential factor in the project.</p><p>The pilot phase GTEx biospecimens and data are already valuable resources for the scientific community. RNA sequencing data and expression array data generated by the LDACC, as well as clinical annotation for the GTEx biospecimen collection, are publicly available on dbGAP<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1</uri>) and are being analyzed by an international team of bioinformatics experts.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Multiple aliquots of GTEx tissues have been made available to the scientific community through a Request for Application funding mechanism (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-12-009.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-12-009.html</uri>) and a biospecimen access policy has been developed for already-funded investigators (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.gtexportal.org/static/form/GTEx_sample_access_policy_to_the_public_v20131024.doc">http://www.gtexportal.org/static/form/GTEx_sample_access_policy_to_the_public_v20131024.doc</uri>). In addition, 40 SOPs from the GTEx project are available for public use and are a major contribution to the research biobanking community (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/resources/sops/default.asp">http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/resources/sops/default.asp</uri>).</p><p>A meeting entitled &#x0201c;The GTEx Symposium: All Things Considered- Biospecimens, Omics and Data&#x0201d; was held on the NIH campus on May 20 and 21, 2015, that included presentations on each of the topics discussed in this report and some molecular analysis presentations. The meeting videocast was archived and can be accessed at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=19024&#x00026;bhcp=1">http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=19024&#x00026;bhcp=1</uri> (May 20) and <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=19026&#x00026;bhcp=1">http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=19026&#x00026;bhcp=1</uri> (May 21). Project policy mandates that all data generated by researchers from the GTEx biospecimens must be made publicly available. Such availability will greatly enhance the value of GTEx resources by complementing other initiatives aimed at identifying functional elements in the human genome, such as the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107">http://www.genome.gov/10005107</uri>) and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://commonfund.nih.gov/lincs">http://commonfund.nih.gov/lincs</uri>), in translating genome-wide association study findings to help prioritize the advancement of therapeutic targets.</p><p>One goal of the GTEx pilot study was to assess the feasibility of collecting a large number of normal, high-quality biospecimens. This goal was met in 2.5 years with the collection of samples from 190 donors. The first set of molecular analysis data from the GTEx pilot, including RNA sequencing data was published in May 2015.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;17</xref></sup> Due to the overwhelming proof of feasibility during the pilot, the NIH Common Fund committed support to continue the GTEx project. Therefore the GTEx study is ongoing and will continue through the end of 2015 and aims to collect a total of 900 cases.</p><p>To meet the demands of such a large biospecimen collection beyond the pilot phase, the GTEx project developed relationships with several additional BSSs and worked with all other partners to ensure that proper staffing and resources are in place to accommodate the influx of biospecimens collected.</p><p>The project has added the collection of frozen tissue samples for a limited number of tissue types based on feedback from a request for information (RFI) regarding the potential uses of stored GTEx biospecimens (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-12-028.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-12-028.html</uri>). Adding frozen biospecimens will increase the utility of the biospecimen set for the research community in terms of being able to compare the GTEx tissue directly to past and future studies with frozen tissue since PAXgene preserved tissue is not yet widely utilized. The novel infrastructure put in place by BBRB and its partners is an essential part of the groundbreaking GTEx scientific project, which has the potential to change our understanding of gene regulation and how gene interactions contribute to disease development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e911" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supp_Table2.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e916" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s012" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Members of the GTEx consortium include Laura Barker, Margaret Basile, Alexis Battle, Joy Boyer, Debra Bradbury, Jason P.
