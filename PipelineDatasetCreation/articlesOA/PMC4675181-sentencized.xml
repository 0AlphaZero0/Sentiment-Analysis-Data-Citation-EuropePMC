<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund (https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx) is to determine how genetic variation affects normal gene expression in human tissues, and ultimately to assess how this relationship correlates with the development of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To achieve this goal, the project planned to collect multiple different human tissues from each of hundreds of donors, isolate nucleic acids from the tissues and perform genotyping, gene expression profiling, whole genome sequencing, and RNA sequencing, and analyze the data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).1–3 The scientific goals of the project required that the donors and their biospecimens present with no evidence of disease (henceforth termed “normal tissues” or “normal biospecimens”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The project began as a 2.5-year pilot study to assess the feasibility of collecting tissue from up to 40 different tissue types from women and 34 different tissue types from men, from hundreds of individual donors.1,4 The resulting biospecimens needed to yield RNA with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN)5 of at least 6 for optimal RNA sequencing results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (BBRB) worked with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), and other GTEx project partners to develop a plan for collecting the normal human biospecimens for GTEx. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A group of experts working in the ethical, scientific, and operational aspects of biobanking was assembled to identify key challenges of collecting normal biospecimens and to help develop a framework for the project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This planning group recognized that donations of normal biospecimens from living donors were rare, typically only occurring as a secondary research donation when surgery is performed for cancer treatment, limb amputation, or other surgical disease treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Thus it was envisioned that the GTEx biospecimens would be collected from deceased donors, due to the project's need for multiple tissues per individual donor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The GTEx project set out to partner with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and institutions with rapid autopsy programs to obtain the high number of normal biospecimens needed for this study.4 The expert planning group established a comprehensive set of recommendations for acquiring high-quality, normal biospecimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A summary of the recommendations has been published4 and the full recommendations are posted for public use (http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/global/pdfs/caHUB_ANTWG_Postmortem_BPs.pdf). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The eligibility criteria were developed within a framework that considered the limited data immediately available in the timeframe surrounding a potential donor's death and the feasibility of the Biospecimen Source Sites to obtain the tissues and associated data in a timely manner. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Terminology related to data elements, such as medication name and medical condition or cause of death, varied across the BSSs, most often due to the use of similar but different terms or synonyms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Most established tissue networks do not contain a large number of normal, non-disease biospecimens, but instead have a collection of retrospective disease or condition-specific biospecimens, frequently with limited annotation available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>BBRB met the GTEx pilot requirements by creating the infrastructure described here for the acquisition of normal biospecimens through contractual relationships with OPOs and rapid autopsy programs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The biospecimen collection project of the GTEx pilot faced many challenges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Collecting biospecimens for research purposes using a novel preservation method (PAXgene Tissue) presented a new challenge for OPOs due to the fact that the staff needed to be trained in proper use of the preservative including the required step of switching from fix to stabilizer solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Ongoing feedback from project partners was essential to synergize project needs and local operations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Throughout the initiation, start-up and steady state phases of the pilot GTEx project, collaboration with all partners was paramount to the success of GTEx analysis, and continues to be an essential factor in the project. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The pilot phase GTEx biospecimens and data are already valuable resources for the scientific community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>RNA sequencing data and expression array data generated by the LDACC, as well as clinical annotation for the GTEx biospecimen collection, are publicly available on dbGAP10 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000424.v1.p1) and are being analyzed by an international team of bioinformatics experts.1 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Multiple aliquots of GTEx tissues have been made available to the scientific community through a Request for Application funding mechanism (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-12-009.html) and a biospecimen access policy has been developed for already-funded investigators (http://www.gtexportal.org/static/form/GTEx_sample_access_policy_to_the_public_v20131024.doc). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Project policy mandates that all data generated by researchers from the GTEx biospecimens must be made publicly available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Such availability will greatly enhance the value of GTEx resources by complementing other initiatives aimed at identifying functional elements in the human genome, such as the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project (http://www.genome.gov/10005107) and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program (http://commonfund.nih.gov/lincs), in translating genome-wide association study findings to help prioritize the advancement of therapeutic targets. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This goal was met in 2.5 years with the collection of samples from 190 donors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The first set of molecular analysis data from the GTEx pilot, including RNA sequencing data was published in May 2015.11–17 Due to the overwhelming proof of feasibility during the pilot, the NIH Common Fund committed support to continue the GTEx project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Therefore the GTEx study is ongoing and will continue through the end of 2015 and aims to collect a total of 900 cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>To meet the demands of such a large biospecimen collection beyond the pilot phase, the GTEx project developed relationships with several additional BSSs and worked with all other partners to ensure that proper staffing and resources are in place to accommodate the influx of biospecimens collected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The project has added the collection of frozen tissue samples for a limited number of tissue types based on feedback from a request for information (RFI) regarding the potential uses of stored GTEx biospecimens (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-RM-12-028.html). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Adding frozen biospecimens will increase the utility of the biospecimen set for the research community in terms of being able to compare the GTEx tissue directly to past and future studies with frozen tissue since PAXgene preserved tissue is not yet widely utilized. </plain></SENT>
