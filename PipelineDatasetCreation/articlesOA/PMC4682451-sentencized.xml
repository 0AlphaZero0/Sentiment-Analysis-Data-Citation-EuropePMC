</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Lynch syndrome (MIM #120435) predisposes to the development of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers [Lynch and de la Chapelle, 2003]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually MLH1 (MIM #120436) or MSH2 (MIM #609309) [Lynch et al., 2009]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In many cases, the functional and hence clinical significance of the sequence alterations, in particular single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) outside coding regions, is uncertain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For these families, predictive testing and targeted preventative surveillance of family members cannot be offered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A recent study reported the classification of 2,360 constitutional MMR gene variants into class 1 (not pathogenic), class 2 (likely not pathogenic), class 3 (uncertain), class 4 (likely pathogenic), or class 5 (pathogenic) [Thompson et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The finding that a large proportion (32%) of variants belonged to class 3 demonstrates the importance of collecting further evidence about these variants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Several class 3 variants within the MLH1 promoter have been found in cases of suspected Lynch syndrome, namely, c.-411_-413del, c.-432_-435del, c.-64G&gt;T, c.-53G&gt;T, c.-42C&gt;T, c.-28A&gt;G, c.-28A&gt;T, c.-27C&gt;A, c.-11C&gt;T, and c.-7C&gt;T [Green et al., 2003; Hitchins et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2013; Kwok et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, for most of these variants, it is unclear whether they abrogate MLH1 function directly or whether they are linked to another genetic defect within MLH1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Studies of the c.-27C&gt;A variant provide the most compelling evidence that MLH1 promoter variants can directly affect the regulation of MLH1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This variant segregates with colorectal cancer in multiple cancer-affected families [Raevaara et al., 2005; Hitchins et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2013; Kwok et al., 2014] and has been associated with reduced transcriptional activity and the dominant inheritance of a mosaic constitutional MLH1 epimutation [Hitchins et al., 2011]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that MLH1 promoter variants may cause unbalanced constitutional expression of MLH1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In support of this, the c.-411_-413del, c.-42C&gt;T, c.-27C&gt;A, and c.-11C&gt;T variants also significantly reduce the activity of the MLH1 promoter in driving the expression of a reporter gene [Green et al., 2003; Hitchins et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2013]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no analysis of the potential pathogenicity of the c.-28A&gt;G or c.-7C&gt;T variants has been undertaken, despite the fact that these variants have been described in at least two unrelated individuals with suspected Lynch syndrome [Lee et al., 2005; Muller-Koch et al., 2001]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to determine the pathogenicity of the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants within the MLH1 5′ untranslated region (UTR) in two individuals from suspected Lynch syndrome families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these variants were linked to other constitutional pathogenic alterations within or around the MLH1 gene and whether they were associated with epigenetic alterations at the gene promoter or changes in gene expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>We combined targeted high-throughput sequencing of the wider MLH1 locus with microsatellite marker analysis to provide high-resolution sequence and zygosity information across the 3p14.3-p22.3 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Collectively, this data confirmed the lack of potentially pathogenic sequence alterations within or flanking the MLH1 gene, other than the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>This approach identified a frameshift variant within the neighboring VILL gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The cosegregation of the c.1164del1, c.-28A&gt;G, and c.-7C&gt;T variants in a first-degree relative of Proband 32 showed that they were located on the same chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, their precise frequencies in control exomes provided clues to the genetic history of this haplotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>For example, the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants have an identical MAF of 0.0003, showing that they represent part of an ancestral haplotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the absence of any identifiable sequence differences on the variant MLH1 haplotype between the two probands investigated in our study supports the conclusion that this MLH1 haplotype originates from a common ancestor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants cosegregated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants are the most likely cause of predisposition to CRC with MMR deficiency and loss of MLH1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The InSiGHT database [Thompson et al., 2014] describes two suspected individuals with this haplotype in addition to two cases described previously [Muller-Koch et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2005]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>One was diagnosed with CRC aged 46 years and had a sibling who was diagnosed with CRC aged 28 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The proband’s tumor was MLH1 and PMS2 negative and BRAF wild-type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Separate from the c.-7C&gt;T and c.-28A&gt;G variants, no constitutional mutations in MLH1, EPCAM, or MSH2 were found by MLPA and no expression analyses were undertaken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The other individual with this haplotype was also diagnosed with MLH1 negative CRC; however, no further information is provided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the rarity of the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T haplotype at the population level, but its presence in several suspected Lynch syndrome individuals to date suggests it is associated with a Lynch syndrome phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The cosegregation of these two variants makes it difficult to ascertain whether both or only one are pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The c.-7C&gt;T variant was found in a member of a hereditary prostate cancer family who met revised Bethesda guidelines [Fredriksson et al., 2006]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>However, the description of a case of CRC that was associated with a c.-28A&gt;T variant in a 29-year-old individual from a family with multiple cancer-affected members [Isidro et al., 2003] suggests that loss of the c.-28A nucleotide may be pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Whether the c.-28A&gt;T variant in this family was associated with reduced MLH1 expression or cosegregation with disease was not determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a variant of the adjacent nucleotide (c.-27C&gt;A) also segregates with Lynch syndrome in several unrelated families [Hitchins et al., 2011; Kwok et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Collectively, this suggests that c.-27 and c.-28 sites are located within an important regulatory motif within the MLH1 5′UTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Further work to identify the DNA-binding protein that binds to this site will help to elucidate the mechanistic basis of how variants within the MLH1 5′UTR affect expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The presence of the c.-93G&gt;A, c.-28A&gt;G, c.-7C&gt;T, and c.655A&gt;G variants in both probands allowed us to distinguish between wild-type and variant alleles and transcripts and to investigate the mechanisms of reduced MLH1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>We conclusively demonstrate that the variant MLH1 promoter remains unmethylated despite partial loss of expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This contradicted the pathology report from Proband 32, which reported methylation in tumor DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Using several approaches, we demonstrate that the apparent hypermethylation was an artifact caused by the c.-7C&gt;T variant, which lies within a recognition site of the HhaI restriction enzyme utilized as part of the MS-MLPA assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, reductions in gene expression can correlate with other chromatin changes at transcription initiation sites, such as increased nucleosome occupancy, which can physically occlude an initiation site from the transcriptional machinery [Jiang and Pugh, 2009]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the variant allele was associated with increased nucleosome occupancy, we precisely defined sites of MLH1 transcription initiation and compared nucleosome occupancy between the variant and wild-type alleles using an allele-specific NOMe-Seq assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Our finding that the variant allele showed no increase in nucleosome occupancy when compared with the wild-type allele, or the MLH1 promoter in other cells expressing high levels of MLH1, confirmed that it remained epigenetically unaltered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The continued recruitment of DNA-binding factors is thought to protect CpG island promoters from nucleosome occupancy [Struhl and Segal, 2013] and de novo methylation [Lienert et al., 2011; Krebs et al., 2014]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the variant allele may be protected from epigenetic silencing because it retains the ability to recruit DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Due to the proximity of the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants to transcription initiation sites, we hypothesize that diminished expression may be a result of impaired ability to initiate transcription. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study describes further cases of suspected Lynch syndrome associated with the c.-28A&gt;G and c.-7C&gt;T variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Our analysis shows that these variants may be pathogenic due to partial loss of MLH1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>These findings reinforce the potential importance of sequence variants in the MLH1 promoter in Lynch syndrome and the need for future studies to sequence the entire 5′UTR when searching for pathogenic sequence alterations. </plain></SENT>
