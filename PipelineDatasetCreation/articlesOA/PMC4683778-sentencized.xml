</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The climate is becoming increasingly warmer, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the global average temperature will continue to increase by 0.2 °C per decade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Heat stress in poultry impacts animal production and welfare and, in the poultry industry, it causes an estimated economic loss of $125 to 165 million in the US, with the broiler industry alone accounting for $58.1 million [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In 2007, an extreme heat wave in California resulted in more than 700,000 deaths in poultry [2] and in 2009, over 1.5 million layer hens died during a summer heat wave (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Production losses due to heat stress may result from mortality, reduced body weight, reduced egg production, reduced feed intake, and higher feed to gain ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A recent study on broilers that were exposed to chronic heat stress from 1 to 42 days of age showed a reduced body weight (32.6 %), increased feed conversion ratio (25.6 %), and reduced feed intake (16.4 %) [3], and another study using shorter periods of heat stress on younger birds, from 2 to 4 weeks of age showed a reduced feed intake by 14 % [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In a paired feed study, genetically lean broilers that were exposed to chronic heat stress, from hatch to 9 weeks of age showed increased weight gain and feed efficiency compared to less lean counterparts, which supports the hypothesis that increased fat accretion is inversely related to thermo-regulation [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in poultry have elucidated a genetic influence on response to heat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Layers that were divergently selected for heat tolerance displayed differences in survivability during increased heat conditions [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in production traits have been found between a commercially fast growing chicken line and a local chicken breed from China during heat stress [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Microsatellites were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for several traits measured during heat stress in a Japanese quail F2 intercross including body weight (BW), feed intake, and body temperature (BT) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Because in poultry, response to heat stress involves a genetic component, it is possible to use genomic selection for heat tolerance, which will increase accuracies and response to selection [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To increase our understanding of the genetic influence on response to heat stress in chickens, we used the F18 and F19 generations of a broiler (heat-susceptible) × Fayoumi (heat-resistant) advanced intercross line (AIL) and an environmentally-controlled experiment to identify genomic markers related to response to high ambient temperatures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Chickens of this AIL were exposed to high ambient temperatures for 7 days during which BW, BT, breast yield, and digestibility were measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These traits, as well as the changes in BT and BW due to heat treatment, were used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The genes and markers associated with thermal tolerance can help elucidate the genetic architecture of traits involved in heat stress and, subsequently, be used to breed more heat-resilient chickens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Although this population has limited variability due to the initial mating, the broiler sire was characterized by the offsprings’ phenotypic means and variances of body composition phenotypes, which showed that it was representative of the entire broiler population [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the highly inbred Fayoumi breed became fixed for alleles that had the highest frequency in the founder line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Thus, this population is a powerful resource to identify QTL. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>More precise methods of BT measurement (e.g., infrared thermography) should be explored. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Heritabilities for BW were low to moderate (0.15–0.35), which agree with the heritabilities of 0.4 to 0.6 previously reported for BW in broiler lines [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Heritability for breast yield was moderate i.e. 0.15 and agreed with previously reported estimates [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In this study, dry matter digestibility was measured using a titanium oxide marker to calculate dry matter in the feed and ileal contents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>We estimated a heritability of 0.33 for digestibility, which is similar to that (0.33 to 0.47) reported for broilers that were fed a wheat-based diet [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Many previous studies on feed conversion ratio in chickens reported moderate heritabilities [36–38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Feed intake and conversion ratios, which are associated with digestibility, are arguably the most costly impacts of heat stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Because the heritability estimated for digestibility during heat stress is moderate, there may be potential for improvement of this trait via selection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Generally, heritabilities estimated for most traits in our study are lower than those previously reported, which is likely due to lower genetic variation within the population studied. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>To date, seven QTL for BT have been reported on GGA2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 [39–41], but none overlapped with those detected here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This absence of QTL overlap may be due to differences in experimental protocols since, in these previous studies [39–41], the traits that were measured were response to disease challenge and resting BT between lines selected for growth or fat accretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In addition, these QTL may be population-specific. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The two QTL which co-localized for BT20 and BT28-20 and for BT20 and BT28 were near QTL for hematocrit on GGA14 [42] and GGA15 [39], respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>One mechanism to regulate BT during periods of heat is to increase blood flow towards the body surface [43], and it has also been well documented that panting behaviour occurs under high temperatures [44]; both mechanisms result in changes in the blood system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the co-localized QTL for BT on GGA15 was located near a QTL for corticosterone that was measured in response to manual restraint [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This co-localization suggests that it may be a good candidate for further investigation of the pleiotropic response to stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Heat stress specific QTL were identified for BT28 and BT28-20 on GGA26 and 27, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Both regions present considerable overlap with previously reported QTL for growth [23, 24, 40, 46–49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The large overlap between BT and QTL for growth is not surprising given the highly negative correlation between BT and growth during heat stress in chickens [50], although we attempted to account for this relationship by fitting BW as a co-variate in the GWAS analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The co-localized QTL for all BW measurements on GGA6 was near a previously reported QTL for growth in many different chicken populations, including a broiler × layer cross [48, 49, 51, 52], White Plymouth Rock, New Hampshire and White Leghorn chickens [53], a commercial broiler line [54], high and low growth broiler lines [40], white leghorn x red jungle fowl [55], and the F2 broiler × Fayoumi generation used in the current study [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The QTL that we detected on GGA6 is confirmed by previously reported QTL in this region in a wide range of chicken populations, which suggests a conserved QTL, and supports our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This region explained a relatively large percentage of the genetic variation for BW21 (3.0 %), BW28 (8.1 %), and BW28-21 (4.6 %), which confirms the importance of this QTL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The co-localized QTL for BW21 and BW28 on GGA1 were also localized near QTL for growth that were previously reported in a large range of chicken populations including crosses between Silkie fowl and Cornish broiler [46], White Recessive Rock and Xinghua chicken [56], broiler and layer [49], and Shamo and White Plymouth Rock [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>As observed for the co-localized QTL on GGA6, this region on GGA1 is probably highly conserved given the variety of populations for which QTL have been reported near this region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Several QTL for average daily gain are located near the region where QTL for BW28 and BW28-21 co-localize on GGA4, in two chicken populations including a Silky fowl × White Plymouth rock cross [58], and a broiler × layer cross [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Again, this overlap between the QTL detected in our study and previously reported QTL supports our results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Although it is interesting to discuss overlapping QTL for measurements performed at different phases, it is also relevant to examine the QTL that were identified specifically for traits measured during heat stress i.e. BW28 on GGA26 and BW28-21 on GGA10 and 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the QTL for BW28 on GGA26 was located within the 2-Mb QTL region for BT28 and as discussed above, many QTL for growth have been identified in this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Similarly, QTL for growth have also been reported in the QTL regions on GGA10 and GGA21 that we detected here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Although feed represents a large proportion of poultry production costs (51.8 % in 2001 and 68.7 % in 2008) and these costs continue to increase due to the increased demands for grain in other industries such as ethanol for fuel [59], very few QTL related to feed use have been identified (37 of the 4795 QTL listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.animalgenome.org">http://www.animalgenome.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In a recent study that evaluated layer hens for feed intake and feed use and performed a GWAS using the 600 K array, eight QTL were identified [60], but none co-localized with the QTL reported here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The three QTL identified for digestibility were all located near previously reported QTL for growth-related traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Very recently, Mignon-Grasteau et al. [61] identified a QTL for dry excreta weight on GGA19 within the same interval as that reported here for digestibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The fact that the QTL regions for these two feed-use traits overlap provides evidence that this region on GGA19 is indeed a true QTL and should be further investigated given the economic importance of these traits to the poultry industry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>A strong QTL for breast yield was identified on GGA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>This region contains a large number of QTL related to abdominal fat and growth traits that were detected across diverse chicken populations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.animalgenome.org">http://www.animalgenome.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, no QTL for breast muscle has been reported in this region even in studies on previous generations of the same AIL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that this QTL may be specific to breast muscle growth during heat stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the QTL for breast yield that we detected on GGA15 and 22 overlap with previously reported QTL for breast muscle on GGA15 [40] and GGA22 [46]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Cellular response to heat stress has been extensively reviewed and involves a range of biological mechanisms, i.e. inhibition of DNA synthesis, transcription, translation, cell cycle arrest, denaturation of proteins, enhanced degradation of proteins by ubiquitin and lysosomal pathways, disruption of the integrity of the cytoskeleton [62] and increased apoptosis [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In addition, heat stress induces metabolic changes and increased intracellular ion concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Previously, Coble et al. [64] observed that, in broiler chickens, heat stress induced transcriptional changes and Morimoto [65] reported an increased expression of heat shock protein genes in response to heat stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Heat shock proteins form an evolutionarily conserved family across all multicellular organisms [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in the disruption of DNA synthesis, transcription, RNA processing, and translation were identified near the QTL for all traits analyzed in this study except for BW28 and BW28-21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>We identified three genes that code for separate subunits of the mediator complex (MED 9, 15, and 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The mediator complex is required for the regulation of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcripts [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In yeast, the mediator complex interacts directly with heat shock proteins and serves as a bridge between heat stress and transcriptional regulation of heat shock related genes [68]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Disruption of progression through the cell cycle and resulting apoptosis occur during cellular stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>We identified five genes that are involved in cell cycle progression that were located near some of the QTL detected in our study for all BT measurements and digestibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Among the cell cycle checkpoints, two crucial checkpoints, between G1/S and G2/M transitions, are arrested in response to heat stress [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Apoptosis is induced during extreme stress conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Other categories of functions that were associated with the candidate genes detected in our study include glucose regulation, disruption of the cytoskeleton, free radical damage, and blood vessel development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The ACE gene, involved in blood vessel development, was located near the QTL for BT28-20, thus we hypothesize that it may play a role in reducing BT during periods of heat stress by enhancing blood flow to the body surface [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in membrane permeability and changes in cellular ion concentrations were located near the QTL for BT, BW, and digestibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In chickens, Ait-Boulahsen et al. [70] showed that Na+, K+, and Cl− plasma levels increase in response to heat stress, which can have an effect on the endocrine system, for example as a secondary messenger, and subsequently on stress response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Two genes of this functional category were identified near the QTL for digestibility i.e. SLC13A5 that encodes a citrate transporter and PITPNM3 that encodes a calcium ion binding protein; both these genes are involved in ion movement, which is impacted by heat stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Genes related to the immune system were identified near the QTL for BT20 and BT28, and breast yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that, compared to animals not exposed to high ambient temperatures, laying hens that are exposed to cyclic heat stress have decreased T-cell and B-cell proliferations and antibody titre to sheep red blood cells and an increased total white blood cell count [71], which supports the hypothesis that the immune function is disrupted during heat stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We identified the MIF and DDT genes near the QTL for BT22 and BT28, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These genes function as proinflammatory cytokines involved in the immune response [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>One of the hallmarks of inflammation is to increase BT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>If inflammation can be suppressed in birds subjected to heat stress, this might decrease the negative impact of high ambient temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The SOCS2 gene that encodes a suppressor of cytokine signalling was identified near the QTL for breast yield and may be a good candidate gene for future studies on the mechanisms that influence breast muscle yield in chickens. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The 1-Mb window with the largest effect that we identified here was for breast yield and explained 15.4 % of the total genetic variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The favourable allele of the SNP with the largest effect within the window that explained the largest proportion of genetic variation was fixed in the Fayoumi line but was also segregating in the broiler line; thus, it was not possible to determine which line contributed the favourable allele. </plain></SENT>
