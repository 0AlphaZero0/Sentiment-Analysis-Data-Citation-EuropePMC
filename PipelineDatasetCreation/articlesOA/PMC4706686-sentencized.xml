<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to complement the in vitro data with an in vivo analysis using ChIP-seq to explore the genome-wide binding profile of TrmBL1 under glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Basal transcription in archaea relies on a eukaryotes-like transcription machinery and promoter elements, whereas, transcriptional regulation is based on mainly bacteria-like transcriptional regulators [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These regulators can act as repressors [4,5], activators [6–8] or both [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the genome of the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon Pyrococcus furiosus a total number of 85 putative transcription factors (TFs) can be found, which represent about 4 % of all open reading frames (ORFs) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>13 of these regulators belong to the TF family of TrmB (transcriptional regulator of mal operon) proteins, which is mainly distributed within the euryarchaeota, but can be found across all archaeal divisions [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Two of them, TrmB and TrmBL1 (TrmB-like protein 1), play a crucial role in transcriptional control of genes involved in sugar transport and metabolism in P. furiosus [10,14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>TrmB mainly serves as transcriptional repressor of the operon encoding an ABC transporter specific for trehalose and maltose (TM-system) [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The TrmB binding site in the TM system overlaps TFB-recognition element (BRE) as well as TATA-box and repression is mediated by impairing TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor B (TFB) binding through steric hindrance [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TrmBL1 functions as a global regulator, which can act both as repressor and activator [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The Thermococcales_Glycolytic_Motif (TGM) with the consensus sequence TATCAC-N5-GTGATA serves as palindromic DNA recognition element for TrmBL1 binding in vitro and in vivo [10,11,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Targets of TrmBL1 mediated regulation are genes encoding enzymes mainly involved in sugar uptake, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The dual functionality of TrmBL1 relies on binding upstream or downstream of the promoter elements [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TrmBL1 binding downstream of the TATA-box inhibits RNA polymerase (RNAP) recruitment, whereas upstream binding activates transcription. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A detailed in vitro analysis of TrmB and TrmBL1 revealed crossregulation of both factors on some promoters, e.g. the TM and maltodextrin-specific-ABC-transporter (MD) system [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Thus, we chose the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) approach to decipher the specific genomic binding sites of TrmB and TrmBL1 in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Currently, only a few ChIP studies exploring archaeal species are available, mainly for the halophilic strain Halobacterium salinarum-NRC1 and the hyperthermophilic crenarchaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius [21–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Most of these groups combined ChIP with whole genome microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) for the analysis of genome-wide protein occupancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Instead of using ChIP-chip, coupling of ChIP with high-througput sequencing (ChIP-seq) became a widely used approach for quantitative mapping of protein-DNA binding events in a genome-wide manner in eukaryotic and bacterial systems [27,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recently, a workflow for genome-wide mapping of archaeal transcription factors ChIP-seq was reported [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to dissect the specific role of TrmB and TrmBL1 as transcriptional regulators of genes encoding enzymes involved in sugar uptake, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in a genome-wide manner in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For this purpose a previously described ChIP protocol of our group for the hyperthermophilic archaeon P. furiosus was successfully improved for a ChIP-seq approach [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The identified binding sites in the P. furiosus genome under steady state glycolytic or gluconeogenic growth conditions exposed the function of TrmBL1 as global regulator for sugar transport and metabolism and revealed novel and unexpected genes which are in addition under the transcriptional control of TrmBL1. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Focusing on ChIP-seq analysis of TrmBL1 revealed 37 putative binding sites in the P. furiosus genome and the presence of the TGM could be shown for 34 identified regions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition, the identified binding sites upstream of PF0967 and PF1476 pointed to a higher-ranking influence of TrmBL1 on transcriptional regulation: The first one is located within an operon transcribed from PF0971 to PF0965 [48], but an additional separate transcript of PF0967 to PF0965 has been also suggested for this region [57,61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>PF0967 to PF0965 encode three subunits of the POR and PF0970 to PF0968 encode three subunits of the ketoisovalerate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (VOR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Both enzymes were heterotetramers and the missing γ-subunit is encoded by the first gene PF0971 of the operon and is shared by both enzymes [57,61].

<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This is also encouraged by the finding that TrmBL1 activates expression of a second gene (PF0505) containing a HTH motif, which suggests a presumable function as transcriptional regulator. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In contrast to T. kodakarensis the trmBL1 promoter has no TGM and we assume that binding of TrmBL1 to the TGM and its function as transcriptional regulator in P. furiosus is mainly controlled by the presence of inducers and possible co-repressors. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>However, there are several additional putative TrmBL1 binding sites, which also appear to be unbound by TrmBL1 in vivo using ChIP-seq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>The binding of TrmBL1 not only relies on the presence of the TGM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Previous reports indicate that the function of TrmBL1 is also impaired by the presence of certain sugars, which act as inducers or possible co-repressors (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Gene expression microarray analyses of P. furiosus cells, which were grown on a variety of glucans, revealed differential transcriptional responses to this different carbon sources [55,64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>This includes several genes (e.g. PF2047), whose expression is regulated by TrmBL1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that equivalent varying transcriptional responses can also be observed using pyruvate or peptides as carbon source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>This may also explain the deviations between the ChIP-seq results and the microarray analysis of P. furiosus grown on carbohydrates or peptides [54]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the ChIP-seq technique complements the microarray data and it increases the number of available global in vivo methods for the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon P. furiosus to study gene regulatory networks in more detail. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the identification of novel binding sites and the experimental verification clearly indicate that TrmBL1 is also involved in regulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in additional cellular processes e.g. proteolysis, amino acid metabolism, transcriptional control or metabolic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The TrmBL1-regulated targets obtained from ChIP-seq are summarized in Fig. 8. </plain></SENT>
