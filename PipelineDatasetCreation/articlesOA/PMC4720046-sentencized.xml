</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the USA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases and adverse health conditions (Adhikari et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the risk for cigarette smoking attributable diseases and adverse health conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For adult cigarette smokers who are unwilling or unable to quit, health risks might be lowered by reducing exposure to potentially harmful cigarette smoke constituents via switching to alternate, potentially-reduced exposure tobacco products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This concept is the basis for the principle of harm reduction and the existence of a risk continuum across a range of tobacco products (Nutt et al., 2014; Zeller et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>With the reduction of exposure to tobacco toxicants, reduction in the risk of disease associated with tobacco-consumption is achievable (Stratton et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This is supported by epidemiology data that have indicated that reducing exposure reduces the subsequent risk of smoking-related diseases (Lee, 2013; USDHHS, 1989, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Understanding the differences in toxicant exposure between cigarettes and other tobacco products, including following a switch from cigarettes to alternate tobacco products, is relevant to the discussion of modified risk tobacco products under the United States Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (US Congress, 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Measuring the levels of tobacco-related biomarkers of exposure is an appropriate metric for exposure assessment, as biomarkers indicate that both contact and uptake into the body have occurred (Sexton, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Additionally, these biomarkers account for variations in smoking behaviors among consumers (e.g. puff number, puff volume, puff frequency), unlike the easily quantified and standardized machine-generated mainstream smoke constituent yields (Borgerding &amp; Klus, 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A randomized, multi-center study of adult cigarette smokers switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus or ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917) (Ogden et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Subjects’ experience with the randomized product was followed for 24 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A group of never smokers was included for baseline comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This paper documents the differences in biomarkers of tobacco exposure among cigarette smokers and never smokers at baseline, and the changes in biomarkers in the three groups switched to alternate tobacco products relative to each other and over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mouth level exposure (MLE) analyses [e.g. yield-in-use (YIU)] were used to evaluate the potential for clinical confinement effects, compensatory smoking and nicotine yield versus nicotine uptake in subjects switched to the ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It is not clear that any single compound, or any subset of compounds, in tobacco or tobacco smoke contributes directly to the risk of developing diseases associated with cigarette smoking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, with substantial reductions in exposure to multiple classes of harmful and potentially harmful compounds, reductions in risk may be possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers are useful for determining actual exposure to tobacco constituents among consumers of various tobacco products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In this article, changes in biomarkers of exposure among cigarette smokers switched to alternate tobacco products (i.e. tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus and ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes) for 24 weeks have been presented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>At baseline (week 0), measured biomarkers in both urine and blood were statistically significantly greater in smokers than in a comparison group of never smokers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This indicated that further evaluation of these biomarkers after randomization to the three product groups was reasonable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>After switching to the alternate tobacco products for 24 weeks, week 12 and 24 reductions in many of the measured biomarkers of exposure were observed in the three product groups, with a few exceptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>A greater number of reductions and a greater magnitude in reductions were observed in the groups switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes and snus, although reductions in some constituents were also observed in subjects switched to ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes (with reductions attributed to product switching, not decreased daily cigarette consumption) (Ogden et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that compliance with assigned study product was less than 100% in all three groups, with highest compliance in the tobacco-burning cigarette group, and lowest compliance in the snus group (Ogden et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Thus, biomarker values after 12 and 24 weeks should be interpreted as estimates of the effects due to dual or poly-tobacco product use, rather than as estimates of effects due to complete switching to the assigned alternate tobacco product; further improvements are likely to have occurred with complete product switching. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In the tobacco-heating cigarette group, statistically significant reductions were observed for most measured biomarkers of exposure at both weeks 12 and 24, with the exception of 1-naphthol, 1-OHP, DHBMA, and HPMA in urine, and serum cotinine and percent COHb. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>As described above, COHb was significantly reduced at week 12 and not different at week 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Notably, several prior, short-term studies have found significantly increased carbon monoxide exposure among subjects using Eclipse relative to usual brand cigarettes (see, e.g. Lee et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The different finding for COHb presented herein might be partly due to the longer-term product use in this study compared with previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, it is primarily attributed to a redesign of the fuel source (i.e. geometry and composition) for Eclipse in mid-2006, which was specifically targeted to reduce CO yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This redesigned fuel source was incorporated in the tobacco-heating cigarettes for this study and remains unchanged in current market Eclipse cigarettes to date. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Similarly in the snus group, statistically significant reductions were observed for the majority of the biomarkers of exposure with the exception of NICEq, 1-naphthol, 1-OHP, and DHBMA in urine, and serum cotinine and 4-ABP-Hb in blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In the group switched to ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes, reductions were observed in approximately one-half of the measured biomarkers, while no significant changes were observed for 1-naphthol, 2-OHF, 1-/9-OHPh, 2-/3-OHPh, 1-OHP, MHBMA, DHBMA, HMPMA, HPMA, and SPMA in urine, and percent COHb and 4-ABP-Hb adducts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Not surprisingly, the biomarkers for tobacco combustion-related, harmful and potentially harmful constituents (e.g. PAHs) were more likely to have been reduced in the tobacco-heating and snus groups than in the ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Additionally, changes in exposure were consistent with differences in chemistry among the three products (Bodnar et al., 2012; Borgerding et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In general, both 1-naphthol and 1-OHP may be less tobacco-specific than the four other PAH biomarkers evaluated (Hatsukami et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In the current study, both 1-naphthol and 1-OHP were statistically significantly elevated in smokers compared with never smokers at baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>However, the magnitude of differences in both 1-naphthol and 1-OHP between smokers and never smokers was less than those of the other PAH biomarkers, consistent with previous studies (Hecht et al., 2004; IARC, 2004; Yang et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Additionally, no differences or inconsistent patterns for 1-naphthol and 1-OHP were observed after 12 and 24 weeks in all three groups switched to alternate tobacco products, supporting the notion of decreased specificity for tobacco-related exposures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Similarly, although the major urine metabolites of 1,3-butadiene have been reported to be MHBMA and DHBMA (Urban et al., 2003), previous publications have suggested that MHBMA is a more specific marker for 1,3-butadiene exposure from cigarette smoking than DHBMA (Carmella et al., 2009; van Sittert et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In this study, statistically significant and greater reductions in MHBMA were observed in the tobacco-heating cigarette and snus groups at weeks 12 and 24, in contrast to DHBMA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>DHBMA did not differ statistically significantly in any of the three product groups, and while it was different between smokers and never smokers at baseline, the difference was less than twofold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Coupled with a higher differential for MHBMA levels between smokers and never smokers (i.e. &gt;15-fold), this suggests a strong selectivity for MHBMA in representing 1,3-butadiene exposure changes among consumers of various tobacco products. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the current study results, urine concentrations of the aromatic amines 4-ABP, 2-AN, and o-T have been reported to be higher in smokers compared with non-smokers in some studies (Riedel et al., 2006; Seyler &amp; Bernert, 2011), but not all (Hecht, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>For 4-ABP-Hb, levels in blood have been consistently higher in smokers compared with non-smokers, and levels are associated with quantity and duration of cigarette smoking, as well as smoking cessation (Hatsukami et al., 2006; Talaska &amp; Al-Zoughool, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The differences in reduction between the two markers for 4-aminobiphenyl (i.e. 4-ABP in urine and 4-ABP-Hb in blood) are likely due to the longer half-life of 4-ABP-Hb adducts compared with the half-life of 4-ABP in urine (Seyler &amp; Bernert, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, hemoglobin adducts may be more reliable markers of chronic aromatic amine exposure from tobacco smoking than urine markers (Hecht, 2002), and the determination of the free aromatic amine in the urine is likely a better short-term measure of exposure reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>In the current study, for both urine 4-ABP and 4-ABP-Hb adducts in blood, the largest reductions from baseline (i.e. at either week 12 or week 24) were observed in the tobacco-heating cigarette group, followed by the snus group, and finally in the ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The reductions in urine 4-ABP in all three product groups at both time points were statistically significant; however, for 4-ABP-Hb adducts, only the reductions in the tobacco-heating group were statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This is possibly because subjects in the snus group tended to be less compliant with use of the assigned product (Ogden et al., 2015b), and continued to smoke some tobacco-burning cigarettes per day. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In this study, urinary HPMA, a marker for acrolein exposure, was higher in the tobacco-heating cigarette group at 12 and 24 weeks compared with baseline, as well as relative to the other two product groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This was the only biomarker of exposure that presented this pattern, and was specific to the tobacco-heating cigarette group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This increase in urinary HPMA was consistent with differences in the measured machine-yields of acrolein from various cigarette products (i.e. increase in Eclipse compared with tobacco-burning cigarettes) (Bodnar et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>It is notable that preclinical and observational studies of acrolein-only exposure have documented an association with inflammation, oxidative stress and irritation (ATSDR, 2007; Uchida et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress evaluated in the current study were not observed to be increased in the tobacco-heating cigarette group subjects relative to baseline or relative to the other two product groups (Ogden et al., 2015a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Similarly, previous evaluations have indicated reduced biological activity and toxicological risk of the Eclipse cigarette compared with traditional combustible cigarettes (Marano et al., 2012; Wagner &amp; Eclipse Expert Panel, 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>MLE analyses were used in this study to evaluate whether subjects altered their smoking topography and behaviour, during confinement and/or in response to switching from usual brand to an ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette, as well as to compare nicotine MLE with relative nicotine uptake (i.e. NICEq). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The data showed minimal to no confinement effects and/or compensatory smoking in the subjects switched to ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Additionally, study findings indicated that YIU is a reliable estimate of relative nicotine yield and smoker uptake when switching cigarettes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Results from this randomized, multi-center study indicated that adult cigarette smokers switched from their usual brand of cigarettes to alternate tobacco products, including tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus and ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes, had significantly reduced exposure to many potentially harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Notably, the average “tar” yields of usual brand cigarettes in all three groups were approximately the same at baseline (Ogden et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In comparison with subjects switched to ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes, subjects switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes or snus had greater reductions in these biomarkers of tobacco exposure, both in number of constituents and magnitude of reductions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>These reductions were likely associated with the elimination and near elimination of tobacco combustion in use of snus and tobacco-heating cigarettes, respectively, although reductions in biomarkers of exposure were also observed in the ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In general, the results from the current study are consistent with previous studies of smokers switched to alternate tobacco products, including an electrically heated cigarette, snus and lower machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes (Benowitz et al., 2009; Kotlyar et al., 2011; Leroy et al., 2012; Mendes et al., 2008; Roethig et al., 2008; Sarkar et al., 2010; Smith et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study included the predominantly White subject sample in general and the predominantly male sample in the per-protocol sample of smokers switched to snus, limiting generalizability of the findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Advantages of the current study included the relatively long duration, the extensive number of biomarkers evaluated, and the inclusion of the ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarette group as a control and for comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>These results further the understanding of tobacco and tobacco smoke constituent exposure among combustible and non-combustible tobacco products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Results similarly provide a relevant foundation for initial placement of alternate tobacco products along a continuum of risk. </plain></SENT>
