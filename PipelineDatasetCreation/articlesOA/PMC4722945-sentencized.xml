</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemia is a major barrier to the attainment of glycemic control targets in patients with diabetes (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 1 diabetes bear the greatest burden of problematic hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In such patients, mild-to-moderate hypoglycemia (blood glucose 50–70 mg/dL) occurs frequently and responds in most cases to oral carbohydrate administration (2,3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, further reductions in blood glucose can lead to hypoglycemia-induced cognitive dysfunction, which may make it impossible for an individual to take appropriate corrective measures to restore normal blood glucose (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the most severe hypoglycemic events, administration of oral carbohydrate by a second party is precluded because the patient is combative, unconscious, or having a seizure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Such severe hypoglycemia, which is not uncommon, can be associated with significant morbidity (5) and mortality (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the T1D Exchange registry, about 1 in 10 participants reported hypoglycemia-related seizure or loss of consciousness in the prior year, with an even higher annual frequency (1 in 5) for those with &gt;40 years’ diabetes duration (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Other studies have reported similar frequencies (8,9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Treatment of severe hypoglycemia should be administered when possible by bystanders while awaiting emergency medical services and currently involves parenteral administration of glucagon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Glucagon, the principal counterregulatory hormone to insulin, is inhibited by insulin and fails to activate in response to hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Current commercially available glucagon preparations are unstable in solution and available only as a lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted in diluent immediately prior to injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, glucagon is often not available when needed and, even when available, may be improperly administered owing to the complexity of the preparation and administration processes (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus, alternative delivery systems for the administration of glucagon for severe hypoglycemia are needed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>More than 20 years ago, several small studies demonstrated the ability of intranasally administered glucagon solution or powder to increase plasma glucose levels in healthy volunteers (13) in a dose-dependent fashion (14) and to correct insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (14–17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>None of these studies led to commercialization of a nonparenteral glucagon preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of a novel intranasal glucagon delivery system in comparison with standard intramuscular glucagon for the treatment of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Enrolled participants underwent two glucagon dosing visits, scheduled 1–4 weeks apart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 3 mg intranasal glucagon (Locemia Solutions) or 1 mg intramuscular glucagon (GlucaGen HypoKit [Novo Nordisk]) (19) during the first dosing visit, with the other glucagon preparation administered during the second dosing visit in a crossover fashion using a block design stratified by clinic; the randomization sequence was generated by the coordinating center and revealed to clinic center staff using a central study Web site upon enrollment of each participant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The intranasal glucagon formulation consisted of 3 mg glucagon, the phospholipid dodecylphosphocholine as an absorption enhancer, and β-cyclodextrin as a bulking agent in a total dose mass of 30 mg powder, contained within a single-use one-step dispensing device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The tip of the device was inserted in one nostril, and the dose was delivered by simply depressing a plunger connected to a piston that gently discharges the powder into the nostril (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc15-1498/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A phase II study established a dose response for intranasal glucagon that attained a maximal increase in blood glucose with the 3-mg dose, presumably due to saturable absorption across the nasal mucosa (20). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Average glucose concentrations and time to meet the primary end point after intranasal glucagon lagged ∼3 min behind glucose concentrations after intramuscular glucagon, consistent with the glucagon concentrations showing a relative delay in achievement of peak glucagon levels with intranasal glucagon of ∼5 min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, pharmacologic levels of glucagon were present by 5 min after administration by either approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>The slight delay in glycemic response would likely be clinically inconsequential and in many circumstances might be offset by the time required, errors, and failures to deliver among nonmedical caregivers in preparing and administering the injectable intramuscular formulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a recent human factors study simulating treatment of severe hypoglycemia shows nasal delivery of glucagon is much faster with a higher success rate than injection for trained caregivers of insulin-using persons (16 s vs. 1.9 min for time to administer, 94% vs. 50% for delivery) and for untrained acquaintances (26 s vs. 2.4 min, 93% vs. 20% for delivery) for intranasal and intramuscular dosings, respectively (22). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Several small studies have documented the ability of intranasally sprayed glucagon to increase plasma glucose levels in healthy volunteers (13) in a dose-dependent fashion (14) and to correct insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (14–16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In the case of glucagon administration for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia, impaired or absent consciousness would prevent patient inhalation of sprayed solution to assist with absorption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Another small study tested the response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes using a dry powder formulation containing either 1 or 2 mg glucagon and found similar pharmacodynamics with the 2-mg dose of glucagon compared with 1 mg glucagon administered intramuscularly (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>In these prior reports, the glucose-raising effect of intranasal glucagon was similar in onset but of shorter duration compared with intramuscular administration (13,15,17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In our study, 3 mg intranasal glucagon exhibited equivalent durability of the glucose-raising effect as with intramuscular glucagon for the 90-min postdosing observation period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In the current study, there was a delay in resolution of hypoglycemia symptoms at the intranasal compared with intramuscular dosing visit; however, the magnitude of hypoglycemia symptoms was not different between visits, likely because of the similar nadir glucose levels achieved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>While we did not measure plasma epinephrine, given the comparable degree of autonomic symptom generation and the pharmacologic levels of glucagon present by 5 min under both dosing conditions, we do not believe other counterregulatory hormones played a significant role in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>As expected, transient nasal symptoms and head or facial discomfort occurred more frequently with the intranasal preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>However, in the setting in which intranasal glucagon is given to an individual with severe cognitive impairment and often loss of consciousness, this will not be relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Nausea and vomiting, well-known consequences of glucagon administration owing to relaxation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle (23), occurred at similar frequencies with both glucagon preparations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>This study had certain limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>The glucagon dosing administration was not blinded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Although this could have influenced investigator handling of the insulin infusion protocol to induce hypoglycemia, there was no evidence of bias, since the actual amounts of insulin administered, as well as the preglucagon dosing insulin and glucose levels, were nearly identical between the study visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>The study lacked a sham treatment condition that would have controlled for possible spontaneous recovery from hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>However, hospital policies preclude not treating hypoglycemia &lt;40 mg/dL, and with this degree of hypoglycemia experienced during 27% and 18% of the intranasal and intramuscular glucagon dosing visits, respectively, a very high rate of rescue treatment would have been required without an intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>It was also not ethical to reduce glucose levels to the point of seizure or loss of consciousness or continue insulin administration once reaching moderate hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the degree of glucose elevation with intranasal was similar to that of the intramuscular and should be more than sufficient for the individual to achieve a glucose level where consciousness is restored and further oral treatment of hypoglycemia can be administered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>In the study, glucagon was administered by trained health care professionals under nonemergency conditions; whether similar results can be obtained with either glucagon preparation in an outpatient setting remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that intranasal glucagon is effective for the correction of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Although hypoglycemia was induced in a controlled setting by administering insulin, this should approximate the real-world setting of severe hypoglycemia that occurs owing to excessive therapeutic insulin availability relative to the impaired or absent endogenous glucagon response (10) that normally works to limit hypoglycemia (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>A needle-free intranasal preparation is likely to be preferred due to its relative simplicity compared with injectable formulations, particularly since individuals who must administer rescue glucagon are usually not trained medical professionals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>In the current injectable form, administration of glucagon is a relatively complex process and, outside the home, is often unavailable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>This leads to suboptimal use of an otherwise effective medication, unnecessary delays in treatment, and costly use of emergency medical systems including ambulance services, emergency room visits, and hospital admissions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Given the results of this study, intranasal glucagon delivery appears promising, and when commercially available, it can be expected to have a substantial beneficial impact on the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. </plain></SENT>
