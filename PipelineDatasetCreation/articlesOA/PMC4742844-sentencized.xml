</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lactobacillus casei is often present in the non-starter microbiota of cheese at the end of ripening (Beresford and Williams 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This implies that this species plays a significant role in proteolysis and flavor development during cheese ripening and that it could be used as adjunct culture with starter bacteria to improve ripening control and enhance flavor intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of metabolic activities and pathways is advantageous in the selection of proper strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The increasing number of newly sequenced genomes allows for the prediction of phylogenetic relatedness and metabolic pathways (Siezen et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, annotation of these genomes relies mostly on sequence and structural comparisons, which may lead to incorrect functional gene assignments and consequently to incorrect metabolic pathway predictions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis of cysteine in cheese-inhabiting bacteria is of particular interest since cysteine is, unlike methionine, present in lower amounts in caseins (Farrell et al. 2004) and could therefore be a growth-limiting source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cysteine and methionine are precursors for the formation of odor-active volatile sulfur compounds during cheese ripening (Landaud, Helinck and Bonnarme 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cysteine can be synthesized from serine or homocysteine (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The biosynthesis from serine is well characterized in Enterobacteriaceae (Kredich 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>First, serine is acetylated to O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) by a serine acetyltransferase (SAT, EC 2.3.1.30), which is encoded by cysE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Second, cysteine synthase (EC 2.5.1.47) encoded by cysK replaces the acetyl group by sulfide to form cysteine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that the orthologous cysK gene from L. casei FAM18110 actually synthesized cysteine from OAS and sulfide (Bogicevic et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the annotated genome of L. casei ATCC 334 apparently does not carry a gene encoding SAT, which is necessary for the formation of OAS (Makarova et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In connection with the characterization of cysK from L. casei, we observed that the gene was co-transcribed with the coding sequence that lies upstream of cysK (Bogicevic et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This gene is annotated as homoserine O-succinyltransferase (MetA, EC 2.3.1.46) in various L. casei genomes that are deposited in the GenBank database (Table S1, Supporting Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>MetA is an enzyme that catalyzes the acylation of homoserine (Fig. 1) and should therefore be involved in methionine biosynthesis (Born and Blanchard 1999). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The genome of L. casei ATCC 334 was the first strain of this species to be sequenced (Makarova et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>With regard to the two-step synthesis of cysteine from serine, the gene encoding cysteine synthase is found in the annotated genome, but a gene encoding the enzyme that provides the substrate OAS for the cysteine synthase is missing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This implies that L. casei cannot synthesize cysteine from serine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, when we inoculated a CDM containing only sulfide as the sole sulfur source with various L. casei strains, we observed growth in seven out of nine strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This indicated that L. casei, in general, possesses the genes necessary for the synthesis of cysteine from serine and sulfide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The two strains that did not grow with sulfide—ATCC 334 and FAM18172—also did not grow when we used cysteine as the sole sulfur source, but they did grow very well when cysteine and methionine were present (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the pathway for the conversion of cysteine to methionine is inactive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that two genes from L. casei FAM18168, named metB and malY, encode cystathionine synthase and cystathionine lyase, respectively (Irmler et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We assume that both genes constitute the transsulfuration pathway which converts cysteine to homocysteine, the precursor of methionine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>We sequenced both genes from L. casei FAM18172 and FAM18110 and compared the deduced amino acid sequences with the one of FAM18168 and ATCC 334 (Figs S1 and S2, Supporting Information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We found that ATCC 334 possesses a strain-specific glutamine to proline amino acid substitution (Q169P) in MalY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>A slight truncation of the MetB protein as a result from a nonsense mutation in the corresponding gene is specific for FAM18172. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Whether these genetic changes render the strains auxotrophic for methionine needs further investigations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>With regard to the synthesis of cysteine from serine, we assumed that the metA gene that forms an operon with cysK in fact encodes a SAT protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>To study our hypothesis, we cloned the putative metA from L. casei FAM18110 and expressed it heterologously in E. coli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>We found that the purified recombinant protein clearly acetylated L-serine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Slight acylation activity was also observed when propionyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA were used as substrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The enzyme did not show acylation activity when D-serine or L-homoserine was used as acyl donors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Taken together with the complementation of an E. coli cysE mutant strain, this study clearly showed that the L. casei gene encodes SAT and therefore should be named cysE and not metA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Liu et al. (2012) made a comprehensive in silico comparison of genes involved in sulfur metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The authors describe that the genomes of other LAB species such as L. acidophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. rhamnosus, L. helveticus, L. fermentum, L. kefiranofaciens, L. reuteri and L. salivarius possess a cysK gene but not a cysE gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cysK is co-localized with a metA gene in the genomes of this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Consequently, these species should not be able to synthesize cysteine from serine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The situation resembles the one of L. casei and considering the genetic organization we assume that metA in these LAB species could also encode a SAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Our assumption could be clarified by studying growth of these bacteria in the presence and absence of various sulfur compounds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that SAT activity in various organisms is inhibited by cysteine (Johnson, Roderick and Cook 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>We did not observe this kind of feedback inhibition with the L. casei SAT in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The SATs from other bacteria, such as E. coli, Salmonella enterica, Thermus thermophilus, Paracoccus denitrificans and Haemophilus influenza, have a KM for serine of 0.11, 0.77, 0.013, 0.4 and 4.7 mM and for acetyl-CoA of 0.56, 0.1, 0.011, 0.1 and 0.7 mM, respectively (Kredich and Tomkins 1966; Burnell and Whatley 1977; Baecker and Wedding 1980; Kobayashi et al. 2004; Guan et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The L. casei SAT showed affinity for both substrates within the same order of magnitude (KM of 1.1 mM for serine and 0.02 mM for acetyl-CoA). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>According to Johnson, Roderick and Cook (2005), acyltransferases can be divided into hexapeptide and non-hexapeptide proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This classification is based on the presence or absence of imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>While MetA from E. coli and a homoserine acetyltransferase from H. influenzae belong to the non-hexapeptide acyltransferases, SATs generally possess this structural motif that can be found using InterProScan (IPR001451). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>We searched for these hexapeptide sequences in the L. casei SAT protein but did not detect this structural motif (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the L. casei SAT is, to our knowledge, the first SAT to be described as a non-hexapeptide acyltransferase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the amount of assembled and annotated genome data of microbes is rapidly accumulating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Currently, the annotation of genomes is mainly based on sequence and structural comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This study shows that functional confirmations are very valuable, especially when metabolic pathways that are predicted from genome data seem to be incomplete. </plain></SENT>
