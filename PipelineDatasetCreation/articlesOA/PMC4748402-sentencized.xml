<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For millennia, medicinal plants have been a valuable source of therapeutic agents, and still many of today's drugs are plant-derived natural products or their derivatives (Kinghorn et al., 2011; Newman and Cragg, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, since natural product-based drug discovery is associated with some intrinsic difficulties (discussed in more details in Section 2.1), pharmaceutical industry has shifted its main focus toward synthetic compound libraries and HTS for discovery of new drug leads (Beutler, 2009; David et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The obtained results, however, did not meet the expectations as evident in a declining number of new drugs reaching the market (David et al., 2015; Kingston, 2011; Scannell et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This circumstance revitalized the interest in natural product-based drug discovery, despite its high complexity, which in turn necessitates broad interdisciplinary research approaches (Heinrich, 2010a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In line with this, the Austrian “Drugs from Nature Targeting Inflammation (DNTI)” consortium was formed in 2008 uniting scientists with expertise in multiple disciplines relevant for natural product-based drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The DNTI program aimed at identifying and characterizing natural products with anti-inflammatory activity by the combined and synergistic use of computational techniques, ethnopharmacological knowledge, phytochemical analysis and isolation, organic synthesis, plant biotechnology, and a broad range of in vitro, cell-based, and in vivo bioactivity models [e.g., (Atanasov et al., 2013b; Fakhrudin et al., 2014; Schwaiberger et al., 2010); further details for the DNTI consortium are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uibk.ac.at/pharmazie/pharmakognosie/dnti/">http://www.uibk.ac.at/pharmazie/pharmakognosie/dnti/</ext-link>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Using their multidisciplinary expertise and the gathered experience from the DNTI participation, the authors of this review want to summarize here the currently established strategies and recent developments in the discovery and resupply of plant-derived bioactive natural products. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The first written records on medicinal applications of plants date back to 2600 BC and report the existence of a sophisticated medicinal system in Mesopotamia, comprising about 1000 plant-derived medicines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Egyptian medicine dates back to about 2900 BC, but its most useful preserved record is the “Ebers Papyrus” from about 1550 BC, containing more than 700 drugs, mainly of plant origin (Borchardt, 2002; Cragg and Newman, 2013; Sneader, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been extensively documented over thousands of years (Unschuld, 1986), and the documentation of the Indian Ayurveda system dates back to the 1st millennium BC (Patwardhan, 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The knowledge on the medicinal application of plants in the Western world is mainly based on the Greek and Roman culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Of particular importance are the compendia written by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD), and by the Romans Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) and Galen (2nd century AD) (Sneader, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The Arabs preserved a large amount of the Greco-Roman knowledge during the Dark and Middle ages (i.e., 5th to 12th centuries), and complemented it with their own medicinal expertise, and with herbs from Chinese and Indian traditional medicines (Cragg and Newman, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The invention of letterpress by Johannes Gutenberg led to a resurrection of the Greco-Roman knowledge in the 15th and 16th century, and to the compilation of several very influential herbal books that were widely distributed in Europe, like The Mainz Herbal (Herbarius Moguntinus, 1484) and The German Herbal (1485), both edited by Gutenberg's partner Peter Schöffer, the Herbarium Vivae Eicones (Otto Brunfels; 1530), the Kreütter Buch by Hieronymus Bock (1546) that was written in German, and De Historia Stirpium by Leonhart Fuchs that was published in Latin in 1542 and also in German in the following year (Sneader, 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>During all that time, medicinal plants were only applied on an empirical basis, without mechanistic knowledge on their pharmacological activities or active constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It was only in the 18th century that Anton von Störck, who investigated poisonous herbs such as aconite and colchicum, and William Withering, who studied foxglove for the treatment of edema, laid the basis for the rational clinical investigation of medicinal herbs (Sneader, 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Rational drug discovery from plants started at the beginning of the 19th century, when the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner succeeded in isolating the analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium which he named morphium (morphine) after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>He published a comprehensive paper on its isolation, crystallization, crystal structure, and pharmacological properties, which he studied first in stray dogs and then in self-experiments (Sertürner, 1817). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This triggered the examination of other medicinal herbs, and during the following decades of the 19th century, many bioactive natural products, primarily alkaloids (e.g., quinine, caffeine, nicotine, codeine, atropine, colchicine, cocaine, capsaicin) could be isolated from their natural sources (Corson and Crews, 2007; Felter and Lloyd, 1898; Hosztafi, 1997; Kaiser, 2008; Kruse, 2007; Sneader, 2005; Zenk and Juenger, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Apothecaries who specialized in the purification of these compounds were the progenitors of pharmaceutical companies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The first one was H.E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Merck in Darmstadt (Germany) who started extracting morphine and other alkaloids in 1826 (Kaiser, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, efforts were undertaken to produce natural products by chemical synthesis in order to facilitate production at higher quality and lower costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Salicylic acid was the first natural compound produced by chemical synthesis in 1853 (Kaiser, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>After the discovery of penicillin (1928), an era of drug discovery from microbial sources was initiated in the 1930s, that laid the scientific and financial foundation of the modern pharmaceutical industry after World War II. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>At that time, the therapeutic use of extracts and partly purified natural products was increasingly replaced by the use of pure compounds (Beutler, 2009; David et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Despite the advent of combinatorial chemistry and HTS campaigns during the last decades, the impact of natural products for drug discovery is still very high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Of the 1073 new chemical entities belonging to the group of small molecules that had been approved between 1981 and 2010, only 36% were purely synthetic, while more than the half were derived or inspired from nature (Newman and Cragg, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of these compounds have been discovered in higher plants (Kinghorn et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Particularly prominent examples of plant-derived natural compounds that have become indispensable for modern pharmacotherapy can be found in the field of anti-cancer agents, e.g., paclitaxel and its derivatives from yew (Taxus) species, vincristine and vinblastine from Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Don), and camptothecin and its analogs initially discovered in the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminata Decne. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>(Cragg and Newman, 2013; Kinghorn et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Further notable examples include the cholinesterase inhibitor galanthamine that has been approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and was initially discovered in Galanthus nivalis L. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Challenges contributing to the decline of plant-derived natural products as drug discovery source </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Since very often plants are collected directly from their natural habitat, the correct identification and nomenclature are essential and the basis for all following steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>For an unambiguous identification, a combination of methods might be necessary, such as genetic and chemical analysis in addition to morphological and anatomical characterization (Bucar et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Continuously ongoing modifications in plant taxonomy as well as synonymy issues add to the difficulty of this challenging task (David et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Moreover, collection of the plant material and accurate documentation, botanical identification, as well as preparation of the herbarium vouchers are tasks that cannot be automated (David et al., 2015) and need specialists who become increasingly rare (Bucar et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Important challenges related with the use of plants as a source for identification of bioactive compounds are related with the accessibility of the starting material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Often the available amount of natural products is low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Although many plant-derived natural products have already been isolated and characterized, available compound quantities are often insufficient for testing for a wide range of biological activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>While small amounts of plant material are usually required for an initial pharmacological evaluation, much larger quantities are needed for through characterization of the pharmacological activity of its constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, limited availability becomes even more problematic when a bioactive plant-derived natural product is identified to have a very promising bioactivity and becomes a pharmaceutical lead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Recollections of wild species may turn difficult, since plant habitats can rapidly disappear under anthropic pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the habitat of plants, particularly of protected species, needs to be respected when collecting from the wild (David et al., 2015), and season-dependent chemical composition of plant material may limit the time window for recollection (e.g., blossom collection necessitates collection during the flowering season). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In cases of imported plant material, also an entire array of additional factors might affect its accessibility, for example local wars, natural catastrophes, or changing legal regulations for cross-border traveling and export of plant material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The importance of plant material accessibility is illustrated by a recent study (Amirkia and Heinrich, 2014) investigating the correlation between species abundance of alkaloids occurrence and their use as pharmaceutical drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Species distribution was assessed on the basis of Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The authors found that 93% of all alkaloids in medical use have more than 50 occurrences in the GBIF database, and only two have less than 10 occurrences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the authors conclude that natural products occurring in many different species are more favorable for medicinal use, and that supply constraints are a major obstacle to the successful research, development and commercialization of natural products. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In many cases, when a plant becomes commercialized as a herbal medicine or when one of its constituents starts getting used as a pharmaceutical drug, its populations become threatened due to extensive wildcrafting and unsustainable harvesting techniques (Cordell, 2011; Vines, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The classical example for this compound supply problem was the so-called “taxol supply crisis” (Cragg et al., 1993; Kingston, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>When the compound turned out to possess remarkable clinical efficacy in ovarian cancer, suddenly the demand for taxol increased tremendously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>However, at that time, the compound was only accessible from the bark of the western yew (Taxus brevifolia L.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This was on one hand problematic because the whole production process including tedious bark collection and drying, extraction, and purification was very time-consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, concerns on the ecological impact of intensive bark collection were raised (Cragg et al., 1993; Kingston, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Although taxol is meanwhile accessible via alternative routes (see Section 4.2), the problem of sustainable supply of herbal material still frequently occurs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Cultivation would be a more sustainable alternative to wildcrafting, nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the 50,000 medicinal plant species used world-wide are still wildcrafted (Canter et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Therefore, institutions like WHO (WHO, 2003) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) (EMA, 2006) developed guidelines on good agricultural and collection practices (GACP) for medicinal plants in order to promote sustainable plant collection techniques and to reduce the ecological problems produced by wildcrafting of medicinal plants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Apart from that, ecological and legal considerations also have an important influence on accessibility of plants as a source of drug discovery, especially laws dealing with plant access and sharing of benefits, as well as patentability issues with local governments in the countries of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cbd-en.pdf">http://www.cbd.int/doc/legal/cbd-en.pdf</ext-link>), signed in 1992 by the international community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, aims at: (1) conserving the biodiversity; (2) sustainably using its genetic resources; and (3) sharing the benefits from their use in a fair and equitable manner (Cragg et al., 2012; Kingston, 2011; Soejarto et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Resulting from CBD, the provider countries, their people and representatives also become important stakeholders that need to be considered in plant-based drug discovery programs (Heinrich, 2010a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Although the CBD provided a framework for countries to regulate and define bioprospecting, the treaty left many open questions, particularly in the issue of access and benefit sharing (Cragg et al., 2012; Kingston, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>On one hand, CBD could not always rebut the skepticism toward bioprospecting in many developing countries due to previous exploitation of their biodiversity; some countries issued very stringent protective regulations, and some were very slow in establishing the necessary legal framework, leading to confusion where to go for permissions and who had authority to grant them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the expectations of biodiversity-rich countries on the potential monetary benefits to achieve from drugs developed from their genetic resources were highly exaggerated, if one considers that from the 114,000 extracts derived from 12,000 species that the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) investigated over decades, only taxol and camptothecin are currently used as pharmaceutical drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>These issues frequently hampered the access to samples from biodiversity-rich countries in the last two decades and thereby discouraged pharmaceutical companies from natural product-based drug discovery (Cragg et al., 2012; David et al., 2015; Kingston, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In order to improve this unfavorable situation, the Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/doc/protocol/nagoya-protocol-en.pdf">http://www.cbd.int/abs/doc/protocol/nagoya-protocol-en.pdf</ext-link>), has been published in 2011 and has come into force in October 2014, after reaching ratification by 50 countries. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Although some researchers are worried that the protocol might lead to stricter regulations that could hamper drug discovery and even be counterproductive for biodiversity conservation (Gilbert, 2010), others expect that – provided that the protocol is implemented into national laws in a sensitive way – the higher legal certainty will revitalize the interest to investigate plants from biodiversity-rich countries, and thereby provide incentives to conserve biodiversity (Burton and Evans-Illidge, 2014; Cragg et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Besides the accessibility of the plant material, also its quality is of great importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Available plant material often varies on quality and composition and this can hamper the assessment of its therapeutic claims. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The chemical composition is not only dependent on species identity and harvest time, but also on soil composition, altitude, actual climate, processing, and storage conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Moreover, during extraction, as well as during the isolation processes, transformation and degradation of compounds can occur (Bucar et al., 2013; Jones and Kinghorn, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Another aspect determining the chemical composition of the starting plant material is that endophytic organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, might inhabit plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>As a result, natural products present in the collected plant material might be in some occasions metabolites of the endophytic organism, or plant products induced as a result of the interaction with this organism (David et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Further complications related to the resupply of bioactive natural products arise from the fact that natural products are more likely to have complex chemical structures with numerous oxygen-containing substituents and chiral centers, which hampers the development of methods for total synthesis or derivatization that might be needed for property optimization of drug candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In contrast, pharmaceutical leads originating from synthetic libraries are usually comparably easy to generate and modify using simple chemical approaches (Butler, 2004; Henrich and Beutler, 2013; Li and Vederas, 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Another major challenge for natural product drug discovery programs is common incompatibility of natural products with HTS (Koehn and Carter, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Investigation of a large number of plant extracts by HTS, followed by the identification and characterization of bioactive constituents is highly challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Adaption and changes of sample preparation and assay designs are necessary in order to apply HTS for bioactivity detection of plant extracts and to identify potent pure compounds thereof. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In general, HTS can be conducted using cell-free or cell-based assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>It requires high reproducibility, accuracy, robustness, and reliable liquid handling systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Test compounds should not decompose or precipitate, should not interfere with assay reagents nor show non-specific effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Especially natural products often fail in fulfilling these requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of plant extracts integrity might be very problematic due to their complexity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Extracts often show high viscosity, tend to aggregate or precipitate, or contain components that non-specifically bind proteins, which can result in misleading assay outcomes, therefore necessitating sophisticated sample preparation or fractionation of the crude extracts prior to testing (Coan et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2011; Maes et al., 2012; Schmid et al., 1999; Tu et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Natural product extracts are also likely to contain fluorescent or fluorescence quenching compounds, which interfere with the fluorescent HTS endpoint measurements, whereby the presence of colored compounds might also interfere with colorimetric HTS endpoints (Gul and Gribbon, 2010; Henrich and Beutler, 2013; Zou et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plant extracts may contain compound classes that are obstructive for certain assay types and might lead to false positive or false negative results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Particularly common highly apolar compounds, such as fatty acids (Balunas et al., 2006), common polar compounds, such as polyphenols and flavonoids (Zhu et al., 1997, 2013; Zou et al., 2002), as well as chlorophyll (Henrich et al., 2006) might be especially problematic since they can interfere with a range of different assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Much effort is necessary to remove such constituents from samples prior to testing (Cardellina et al., 1993; Collins et al., 1998; Picker et al., 2014) or to modify the assay system in order to avoid their detection (Sasiela et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Next to organic molecules, also some inorganic constituents, such as metals, can lead to false positive results in HTS (Hermann et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>This might be especially problematic for HTS of plant extracts, since many plants concentrate metals from their environment (Fernando et al., 2013), and metal impurities could be present in commercially available plant samples (Eisenberg et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytotoxic constituents might cause problems in cell-based assays, since they can mask the detection of other bioactivities or the presence of other compounds with the desired efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Saponins, for example, which possess detergent effects, can lead to the lysis of cells and therefore interfere with the results of cell-based assays (Henrich and Beutler, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>For further details on the application of HTS to natural product samples and its challenges, the reader is referred to the excellent and comprehensive recent review by Henrich and Beutler (Henrich and Beutler, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Further difficulty is set by the fact that determination of the precise molecular mechanism of action of natural products is a challenging task [e.g., curcumin, triptolide; (Corson and Crews, 2007)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>However, a detailed knowledge of the interaction of a drug candidate compound with its molecular target is very advantageous for the drug development process, because it allows property optimization by medicinal chemistry approaches, and on some occasions a more appropriate clinical trial design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The conduction of rigorous clinical trials needed for approval of natural products as drugs represents another major difficulty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>While such clinical trials are often feasible just with industrial support due to the high costs, at the same time the interest of pharmaceutical companies in natural products that are not synthetically modified is limited due to controversies with their patentability [e.g., curcumin; (Corson and Crews, 2007)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In this line, the recent situation concerning patentability of natural products got even more difficult after new guidelines were issued on 4th of March 2014 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“Guidance for Determining Subject Matter Eligibility of Claims Reciting or Involving Laws of Nature, Natural Phenomena, &amp; Natural Products”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The new guidelines state that a patent claim must demonstrate a “marked difference” from a known natural law, material, or phenomenon, and their issuing came after two relevant high-profile Supreme Court decisions: The Association for Molecular Pathology versus Myriad, which ruled that isolated and purified DNA is not patentable, and Mayo versus Prometheus, which ruled that methods for determination of optimal drug doses based on levels of a naturally occurring metabolite is not eligible for patenting (Harrison, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Aside of issues related to patentability of natural products, it should be also noted that there has been some general shift in the pharmaceutical industry from small molecule-based drug discovery toward biological big molecules (biologicals; e.g., therapeutic proteins or nucleic acids) (Appendino et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>However, the patient costs for biologicals are much higher than the costs for small molecule drugs, and their increasing use is putting a rising pressure on national health insurances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the high prices of this type of pharmaceuticals is not expected to quickly drop in the near future after patents expiration, because biological generics (biosimilars) require additional clinical bioequivalence studies to be approved for use and overall have significantly higher development and manufacturing costs in comparison to small molecule generics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to relive the increasing financial burden, turning back to some “old” small molecule-based approaches is conceivable (Appendino et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Due to the challenges described above, the interest in natural product-based drug discovery has been gradually declining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Even in the last decade, many big and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies, which were still active in the area in the 1990s, terminated their natural product programs, leaving natural product research to a major extent to academic universities and start-up companies (Beutler, 2009; David et al., 2015; Ortholand and Ganesan, 2004). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by HTS of large synthetic compound libraries, which were introduced in the 1990s (Scannell et al., 2012), did not meet the expectations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Instead of introducing more drugs to the market, the approval rates of new drugs declined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Whereas 45 new drugs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1990, only 21 were approved in 2010 (David et al., 2015; Kingston, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>While the reasons for this declining trend are complex (Kola and Landis, 2004), one important aspect is that synthetic compound libraries usually cover only a small range of the chemical diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Moreover, due to similar generation strategies, the HTS-compound libraries of different companies often overlap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Due to high sample numbers in such libraries, compounds to be investigated further are often selected quickly, mainly based on potency values (Scannell et al., 2012), although a negative correlation of cell-free in vitro potency and favorable ADME/T (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion/toxicity) is likely (Gleeson et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The plant kingdom includes a high number of species, producing a diversity of bioactive compounds with different chemical scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>According to previous estimations only 6% of existing plant species have been systematically investigated pharmacologically, and only around 15% phytochemically (Cragg and Newman, 2013; Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001; Verpoorte, 1998, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Although today the percentage of better characterized species is likely higher due to ongoing research efforts, it is still conceivable that there is a huge number of plant compounds that are not well investigated pharmacologically in the approximately 310,000 plant species described so far (IUCN, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, as a result of ongoing climate changes and anthropogenic factors, a significant decrease in global vegetative species in the next years is predicted (Maclean and Wilson, 2011; Thomas et al., 2004), endangering the sources of potential new drugs from nature and prompting urgent actions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Since natural products are made from living organisms, they possess properties that are evolutionary optimized for serving different biological functions (e.g., binding to specific target proteins or other biomolecules) (Appendino et al., 2010; Hunter, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Detailed analyses of structural differences between natural products and molecules generated by combinatorial synthesis found that major differences originate from the introduction of properties making combinatorial synthesis more efficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For example, chiral separation is challenging and expensive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Therefore, creating molecules with a low number of chiral centers is favorable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Besides a much lower number of chiral centers, synthetic compounds tend to have a lower molecular weight, a higher number of freely rotatable bonds, higher chain lengths, a lower number of rings, less oxygen but more nitrogen, sulfur, and halogen atoms, a lower number of Lipinski-type H-bond acceptors and donors, and higher calculated octanol-water partition coefficients (cLogP values). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Other differences are the complexity of ring systems and the degree of saturation (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; Koehn and Carter, 2005; Lee and Schneider, 2001; Stahura et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These structural differences, especially the significantly lower number of chiral centers, the lower size, and the higher flexibility result in weaker and less specific activity of synthetic compounds (Feher and Schmidt, 2003; Klebe, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, natural products often have selective biological actions due to binding affinities for specific proteins relevant for their biological functions, possess superior chemical diversity and complexity developed during biosynthesis (Clardy and Walsh, 2004; Koehn and Carter, 2005), and often have more advantageous ADME/T properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Particularly in the context of drug discovery from medicinal plants, a big advantage is that sometimes well documented ethnopharmacological information about the traditional use is available, which can provide hints for compounds therapeutically effective in humans (Corson and Crews, 2007; Heinrich, 2010a; Heinrich and Gibbons, 2001; Kinghorn et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In line with this notion, analysis of 122 plant-derived compounds identified to be globally used as drugs revealed that 80% of them originate from plants that have ethnomedical use identical or related to the indications for which the respective pure compounds are prescribed (Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001; Farnsworth et al., 1985). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was even demonstrated that natural products used for the development of medicines are highly likely to be used traditionally, even if this was not known at the stage of drug development (e.g., the discovery of the anti-cancer agent taxol from T. brevifolia was done with a random screening approach, but later on it came to light that the plant has been used by western Indian cultures as a medicine) (Heinrich, 2010a; Moerman, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Importantly, knowledge about traditionally used medicines is disappearing even faster than the biodiversity of plant species and with the current tempo of globalization, much valuable information is on the risk of getting lost forever (Appendino et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Resulting from the above discussed advantages of natural products, in spite of the predominant industrial focus on HTS approaches with synthetic compound libraries, natural products still represent a valuable source for drug discovery (Newman and Cragg, 2012). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Reflecting better appreciation of the advantages of natural products and the growing interest in plant-derived natural product-based drug discovery, a rapid increase in the number of scientific studies targeting this research area is observed upon analysis of the recent PubMed publication trends (Fig. 1; data retrieved with MEDSUM, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webtools.mf.uni-lj.si/public/medsum.html">http://webtools.mf.uni-lj.si/public/medsum.html</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The revived scientific interest in plant-derived natural product-based drug discovery is paralleled with major scientific and technological advances in the relevant research fields, including better understanding of diseases and their underlying mechanisms, advances in screening methods and analytical equipment, increasing number of targets available for testing, and improved possibilities for optimization of natural leads using synthetic modification strategies [reviewed in (Henrich and Beutler, 2013; Koehn and Carter, 2005; Li and Vederas, 2009; Paterson and Anderson, 2005)]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In the random screening approach (Table 3), plant extracts, enriched fractions, or isolated compounds are randomly selected on the basis of their availability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In the context of plant-based drug discovery, this approach might be highly advantageous when applied with samples originating from regions of high biodiversity and endemism, as the chemical diversity of natural products can reflect the biodiversity of their source organisms (Barbosa et al., 2012; Henrich and Beutler, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The random selection of test material has the potential to result in the identification of unexpected bioactivities that could not have been predicted based on the existing knowledge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, the used pharmacological assays often have a small- or medium-throughput, and the starting test samples (extracts, fractions, or pure compounds) are often available only in small amounts, limiting the number of bioassays in which they can be tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, as alternative to random testing intrinsically suffering from a low hit-rate, a variety of knowledge-based strategies can be applied to increase the probability for the identification of relevant bioactive compounds out of a smaller number of test samples with the use of a limited number of carefully selected pharmacological assays. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P26"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The classical knowledge-based approach is the ethnopharmacological approach (Table 3), where the traditional medicinal use of plants constitutes the basis for the selection of the test material and the pharmacological assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Ethnopharmacology involves the observation, description, and experimental investigation of traditionally used drugs and their bioactivities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>It represents a transdisciplinary concept based on botany, chemistry, biochemistry, and pharmacology, that involves many disciplines beyond natural science, such as anthropology, archeology, history, and linguistics (Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001; Heinrich, 2010a; Leonti, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Some prominent examples of approved drugs that were initially discovered by the use of ethnopharmacological data are: khellin from Ammi visnaga (L.) Lam. that served as lead compound for the development of chromoglicic acid, the sodium salt of which is used as mast cell stabilizer in allergy and asthma; galegine from Galega officinalis L. that was the template for the synthesis of metformin and triggered the subsequent development of biguanidine-type antidiabetic drugs; papaverine from Papaver somniferum L. which was the basis for the development of the antihypertensive drug verapamil; quinine from the bark of Peruvian Cinchona species that was used to treat malaria and inspired the synthesis of chloroquine and mefloquine which largely replaced quinine in the mid of the 20th century (Cragg and Newman, 2013; Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001); the antimalarial drug artemisinin that has been isolated from the TCM herb A. annua L. in 1971 and led to the development of derivatives, such as sodium artensunate or artemether, that are nowadays widely used to treat malaria (Klayman, 1985; White, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P27"><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In the well-established traditional medical systems, such as TCM or Ayurveda, ethnopharmacological knowledge is comparably easily accessible, as these systems possess an established body of written knowledge and theory that has often been revised throughout the centuries and is still in use today. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In medical systems based on herbalism, folklore, or shamanism, however, no written documents exist, and the herbal formulations used are often kept secret by the practitioners, making the information more difficult to access (Brusotti et al., 2014; Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Depending on the herbs to be studied, information can be acquired from different sources, including books on medical botany (e.g., Lewis, 2003), herbals (e.g., Adams et al., 2012), review articles on medicinal plants used in a certain geographic region or by an ethnic culture (e.g., Gairola et al., 2014), field work (e.g., Kunwar et al., 2009), and computer databases (Leonti, 2011; Ningthoujam et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P28"><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>A system particularly amenable to ethnopharmacological studies is TCM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other traditional medical systems, TCM has always been regarded as a science, and it has been taught at medical schools for more than 2000 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The first textbook fully devoted to the description of herbal drugs is the Shen-nung-pen-ts'ao ching (Shen Nung's Classic of Pharmaceutics). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Beginning with this compendium, the first version of which was probably written down during the later Han period (25–220 AD), the literature of Chinese Materia Medica developed by continuous addition of new drugs as well as re-evaluation and addition of new indications for existing herbs during the centuries (Bauer, 1994; Unschuld, 1986; Zhu, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The fact that TCM always possessed a scientific status makes it an extremely valuable source for acquisition of ethnopharmacological data, as the development in the use of medicinal plants can be readily traced back in history by studying the ancient textbooks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P29"><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The use of the ethnopharmacology-based approach, however, is associated with multiple challenges: (1)Herbs that have been selected as study candidates based on ethnopharmacological data require not just detailed knowledge about their habitat, abundance, correct botanical authentication, whether they are threatened or endangered, and which permits are necessary in order to collect and investigate them (David et al., 2015; Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001), but might also provoke occasions of legal right-claims from the country of origin or from ethnical groups in which the traditional knowledge was originally generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In this context, also access and benefit sharing issues determined in the United Nation's Convention on Biological Diversity, and in the Nagoya Protocol need to be respected (see Section 2.2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>These restrictions make collection of plants on an ethnopharmacological basis more tedious and time-consuming than a mere random collection, which is regarded more feasible for the common practices of pharmaceutical industry (Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001).(2)Some traditional systems, such as TCM and Ayurveda, involve the application of sophisticated multicomponent mixtures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The complexity of these formulations and possible synergistic effects heavily complicate the identification of active principles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, this combinatorial approach might provide new perspectives in the treatment of multifactorial diseases, such as dementia, that might be better addressed by a multitarget-oriented, combinatorial approach (Kong et al., 2009).(3)The definitions of health and disease in traditional medicine often widely deviate from the Western reductionist approach that is mainly based on anatomy, physiology, and cell and molecular biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>For example, the theory of TCM has been strongly influenced by Chinese philosophy, like the theory of Yin and Yang, emphasizing the balance of functional systems, and the theory of the Five Phases (Wu Shing) (fire, water, metal, wood, and earth), that are connected to five functional areas in the body (liver, heart, lung, kidney, and spleen and stomach) (Cheng, 2000; Uzuner et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Such discrepancies to Western terminology often complicate the correct interpretation of ethnopharmacological data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the holistic, personalized approach of these medical systems is difficult to assess by many of the bioassay systems currently used to prove pharmacological activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, the emerging omics- and systems biology-based technologies might be better suited to address these issues, due to their more holistic orientation (Guo et al., 2014; Ngo et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P33"><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Next to the ethnopharmacological approach, another possibility for selection of plant material for the pharmacological testing is the chemosystematic or phylogenetic approach, making use of chemotaxonomic knowledge and molecular phylogenetic data in order to select plant species from genera or families known to produce compounds or compound classes associated with a certain bioactivity or therapeutic potential in a more targeted manner (Barbosa et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Combined phylogenetic and phytochemical studies have shown that there is a strong phylogenetic signal in the distribution of secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom that can be exploited in the search for novel natural products (Saslis-Lagoudakis et al., 2011, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>As an example, Rønsted et al. and Larsen et al. used a phylogenetic approach to select the most promising target plants from the genus Narcissus and from the Amaryllidaceae tribe Galantheae for discovery of further acetylcholinesterase inhibitory alkaloids (Larsen et al., 2010; Rønsted et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The combination of phylogenetic information with traditional ethnobotanical knowledge constitutes the emerging field of “phylogenetic ethnobotany” (Saslis-Lagoudakis et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The basic assumption of this approach is that medicinal properties are not randomly distributed throughout the plant kingdom, but that some plant taxa are represented by more medicinal plants than others, and that selection of species from these “hot” taxa will lead to higher success rates in drug discovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Particularly the exploration of cross-cultural ethnomedical patterns within a phylogenetic framework is regarded as a very powerful tool for identification of highly promising plant groups, when phylogenetically related plant species from very distant regions are found to be used for medical conditions in the same therapeutic areas (Saslis-Lagoudakis et al., 2011, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P34"><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The ecological approach to select plant material is based on the observation of interactions between organisms and their environment that might lead to the production of bioactive natural compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis underlying this approach is that secondary metabolites, e.g., in plant species, possess ecological functions that may have also therapeutic potential for humans. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis might be justified due to the fact that a high proportion of biochemical architecture is common to all living organisms; considering this, it seems reasonable that secondary metabolites from organisms as distant as plants, fungi and bacteria are all able to interact with the macromolecules of the human body (Caporale, 1995). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The required availability of structurally and stereochemically well-defined compounds and the approach-inherent incapability to find novel compounds, constitute the limitations of virtual screening studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Molecular descriptors for a compound can be calculated from its 2D or 3D structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Simple examples for such descriptors are the number of rotatable bonds or hydrogen bond acceptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>These descriptors can then be compared to datasets of active compounds to recognize correlations and establish quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models to preselect compounds with a higher likelihood of activity on a specific target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In a study by Gavernet et al., for example, QSAR models were used to screen for new potential anticonvulsants in a natural products database containing 10,900 molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Using a series of computational filters, they proposed four hit compounds, one of which was experimentally evaluated and confirmed as active (Gavernet et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>When applying this method to plant constituents, however, it is important to stress that natural products often differ from typical synthetic pharmacologically active molecules (e.g., size, number of aromatic rings, flexibility), that are mainly found in bioactivity databases, such as CHEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012) or PubChem (Li et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The aim of docking is to accurately predict the positioning of a ligand within a protein binding pocket and to estimate the strength of the binding with a docking score (Waszkowycz et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>As an example, Fig. 2B visualizes the empty binding pocket of PPARγ, which can be used in docking simulations to place new molecules into the binding site and to calculate the binding free energy of the ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>If the 3D structure of a protein is available, either from X-ray crystallography, NMR data, or through homology modeling, then ligand molecules can be computationally positioned directly in the binding pocket to analyze their putative target-ligand interactions and thus identify the crucial binding features of the molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Docking can also be employed in large scale virtual screenings, where a molecule is docked into a series of targets and a suitable docking score is used to compare the results to identify the best ranked matches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Docking has been widely employed to rationalize the structure–activity relationship of natural products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated for example recently with constituents of Carthamus tinctorius L., which showed different activities on indoxyl indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Temml et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P41"><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Drug discovery from plants requires a multidisciplinary approach in which the success is largely dependent on a well-chosen set of in vitro and in vivo assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The choice of the bioassays, first and foremost determined by the study objectives, should optimally combine simplicity with good sensitivity and reproducibility. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P42"><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Historically, the investigation of plant-derived substances was based on a forward pharmacology approach using in vivo animal tests, organ or tissue models, or bacterial preparations, followed by in vitro investigation of mechanistic underpinnings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In the more recent past, the approach of investigating plant-derived substances changed and is now usually starting with screening of large collections of plant-derived compounds (“libraries”) against pre-characterized disease-relevant protein targets, with the aim to identify “hits”, compounds with the desired activity that are then further studied in relevant in vivo models with the aim to validate them (a reverse pharmacology approach). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Both the forward and the reverse pharmacology approaches use an overlapping selection of bioassays but differ in the stage when the assays are applied (Fig. 3; (Lee et al., 2012; Schenone et al., 2013; Takenaka, 2001; Zheng et al., 2013)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P43"><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The forward pharmacology, also known as phenotypic drug discovery, first determines functional activity by detecting phenotypic changes in complex biological systems and then characterizes the molecular target of the active compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>This traditional way of drug discovery was carried out mainly in the era before the Human Genome Project, and especially before the development of many of the modern molecular biology techniques. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P44"><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The reverse pharmacology, also known as target-directed drug discovery, starts by identifying a promising pharmacological target against which compounds are screened and then obtained promising hit compounds are validated in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Both unbiased (random) compound libraries as well as knowledge-based libraries (see Section 3.1) can be used with this approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>While the reverse pharmacology approach has the advantage of reduced animal testing, its disadvantage is that it often requires a huge amount of time and effort for the initial stages, without a guarantee for in vivo efficacy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P45"><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>It must be noted that in the medicinal plant research community in the last decade the term “reverse pharmacology”, is also used sometimes to designate “bedside-to-bench” or “field to pharmacy” strategies starting with clinical efficacy data followed by in vivo and in vitro mechanistic studies (Aggarwal et al., 2011; Graz, 2013; Patwardhan and Vaidya, 2010; Vaidya, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, this terminology use is conflicting with the mainstream understanding existing in the broad drug discovery scientific community, which would see the “bedside-to-bench” strategy as a classical forward pharmacology (phenotypic drug discovery) example starting with observation of phenotypic changes at organismal level [e.g., reversal of disease symptoms in patients; (Lee et al., 2012; Schenone et al., 2013; Takenaka, 2001; Zheng et al., 2013)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>In this sense, terminology standardization is needed in order to avoid miscommunication between researchers from different scientific disciplines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P46"><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The importance of a proper selection of the initially used pharmacological assay is underlined by the fact that lack of clinical efficacy (indicative for inappropriate pre-clinical models) is among the most important reasons for failure of novel drugs during development (Kola and Landis, 2004; Schuster et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>In this section we present a brief overview of assays used to determine bioactivities of phytochemicals on the protein-, cell-, or organism level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>For further information on the topic, we refer the reader to the following excellent reviews: (Agarwal et al., 2014; Butterweck and Nahrstedt, 2012; Fallarero et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Methods for activity assaying that are based on simple chemical reactions, such as some widely used methods to determine in vitro antioxidant properties (e.g., the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay), have been reviewed elsewhere (Gulcin, 2012; Moon and Shibamoto, 2009) and will not be discussed in detail here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P47"><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Assays to detect bioactivities of natural products comprise in vitro models with purified proteins, cell-based target-oriented or phenotypic assays, models with isolated tissues or organs, and in vivo preclinical animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These methods mainly differ in their complexity and throughput capacity and exhibit some advantages and disadvantages, as covered in Table 4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P48"><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Classical protein-based in vitro assays rely on the measurement of the functional activity of the investigated target protein in the presence of a test compound, or of the physical interaction of the test compound with the target protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This class of assays can be usually performed in any general-purpose laboratory without the need for cell culture or animal facilities and are well suited for HTS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>A recent evaluation of the drugs that were approved by the FDA during the past three decades (Rask-Andersen et al., 2011) revealed that the biggest group of protein targets of approved drugs so far are receptors (193 proteins targeted by 563 approved drugs), followed by enzymes (124 proteins targeted by 234 drugs), transporter proteins (67 proteins targeted by 181 drugs), and other types of targets (51 types, targeted by 84 drugs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The best represented target classes were the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the receptor group, the hydrolases in the enzyme group, and the voltage-gated ion channels in the transporter protein group (Imming et al., 2006; Rask-Andersen et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P49"><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Observed inhibition in in vitro protein assays often reflects binding of the test compound to the active center of the target protein, thereby blocking it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In other cases, the assay might be designed to reflect the inhibition of a protein–protein interaction required for the functional activity, or protein activation induced upon compound binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>While these assays inherently provide a “mechanism of activity” of the identi-fied inhibitor or agonist, they cannot guarantee its functionality in more complex biological systems such as cells and multicellular organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>As a result, many promising “hits” fail when further tested in cell-based in vitro assays or in vivo animal experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Peculiarly, in spite of the current focus of the pharmaceutical industry on target-oriented in vitro screening, analysis of the first-in-class new molecular entities (NMEs) approved by the FDA between 1999 and 2008 revealed that the majority of them was first discovered using phenotypic assays (28 compounds compared to 17 identified by target-based approaches). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The surprising result of this analysis led the authors to postulate that a target-centric approach for first-in-class drugs may significantly contribute to the current high attrition rates and low productivity in pharmaceutical research and development (Swinney and Anthony, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, it should be noted that assays with purified proteins have been extensively and on many occasions very successfully employed in many different drug discovery programs e.g., in the identification of selective inhibitors of various GPCRs and kinases (Alkhalfioui et al., 2009; Cohen and Alessi, 2013; Zaman et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P50"><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Assays with cultured mammalian cells are a relatively simple and inexpensive alternative to in vivo assays for the initial assessment of pharmacological activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>They are also applicable for bioactivity-guided isolation of natural products from plant extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Compared to protein-based in vitro assays, they provide bioactivity information at the cellular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Assays with cultured mammalian cells are mostly used in academic institutions for low to medium throughput screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>However, this type of assays is also amendable for up-scaling to screen very large compound libraries, and in this form is still widely used primarily, but not exclusively (Larsen et al., 2014), by the pharmaceutical industry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P51"><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The broad spectrum of available cell-based assays requires a careful and meaningful selection of the assay design, depending on the aim of the investigation and the intended throughput. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The type of process that is studied often dictates the selection of the cell type that needs to be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>For example, endothelial cells are selected to study angiogenesis; epithelial cells might be used for dermatological research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cell-based assays might be target-oriented or phenotypic (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Target-oriented assays are providing information on the interference of investigated compounds with the function of a specific protein or pathway [e.g., (Atanasov et al., 2013b; Orlikova et al., 2013; Reuter et al., 2009)], whereby phenotypic models are providing information on a changed cellular phenotype with a complex regulation [e.g., cell proliferation (Kurin et al., 2012; Schwaiberger et al., 2010)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Cell-based assays might be performed using primary mammalian cells or cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Although immortalized cell lines are easier to maintain in culture, often results obtained with them are less relevant, because immortalization and prolonged in vitro maintenance allows accumulation of mutations and phenotypic changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Used cells or cell lines can also be derived from genetically modified transgenic animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Other approaches resort to engineering of cells in vitro to stably overexpress, stably down-regulate, or knockout a gene product of interest (Ketting, 2011; Wang et al., 2014c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The spectrum of cell-based assays has been widened by engineering of cells enabled to act as reporters (e.g., luciferase- or fluorescence-based) of a specific intracellular response influenced by the tested substance (Baird et al., 2014; Fakhrudin et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Aside of the use of reporter systems, a variety of phenotypic parameters have been successfully selected as readout, e.g., changes in cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell proliferation, migration, differentiation status, metabolic status, redox status, cell apoptosis or senescence (Atanasov et al., 2013b; Blazevic et al., 2014; Gaascht et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic cell-based assays can be used to verify the activity of compounds identified by protein-based in vitro assays at the cellular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cell-based phenotypic models might also be used to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of certain biological effects, possibly leading to the discovery of new target molecules or pathways affecting the respective phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, changes in intracellular signaling or gene expression are often characterized by techniques such as immuno-cytochemistry, FACS-analysis, real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, or “omics”-techniques (e.g., genomics-, transcriptomics-, proteomics- and metabolomics-techniques) for characterization of global changes in gene expression or metabolite quantities (Ladurner et al., 2012; Lee and Bogyo, 2013; Schenone et al., 2013; Schreiner et al., 2011; Ziegler et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P52"><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Besides mammalian cells, also yeasts have been employed for the establishment of whole-cell phenotypic assays with applications in drug discovery, e.g., for high throughput functional screening based on the activation of caspases and other proteases involved in cell death and inflammation (Hayashi et al., 2009), as a screening tool for pharmacological modulation of GPCRs (Minic et al., 2005), but also to understand the mechanism of action of drugs or to identify novel drug targets and target pathways (Hoon et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P53"><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>A special set of assays that stay on the interface of in vitro and in vivo models encompasses in situ and ex vivo methods with isolated tissues or organs (Luo et al., 2013; Teicher, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>They show the advantage of usually resembling the in vivo situation more closely than the in vitro tests, but also the disadvantages of lower throughput, more difficult resupply, ethical concerns related to the use of animals, and the short half-life of the isolated tissues and organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Into this group of methods also falls the recently described technology Ex Vivo Metrics™ that uses intact human organs ethically donated for research (Curtis et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>While most of the mentioned limitations of ex vivo models are applicable also to the Ex Vivo Metrics™ technology, its strong advantage is that it eliminates potential species differences and offers the closest applicable biological system in terms of emulating human exposure to drugs prior to clinical trials (Curtis et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P54"><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In summary, even though the relevance of in vitro assays is limited due to the inability to provide information on factors influencing the activity of compounds in vivo (such as ADME/T), in vitro assays still represent very important tools to identify and characterize bioactive compounds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P55"><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Following the reverse pharmacology approach (Fig. 3), compounds identified with a good activity in vitro need to be tested in vivo in suitable animal models that can provide basic pharmacological and toxicological data prior to subsequent human clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P56"><text><SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, in part due to the reasonably high homology and similarity between mammalian genomes and physiology, and to the relatively short reproductive cycle, mouse and rat models were used for the assessment of the activity of plant extracts or isolated natural products (Butterweck and Nahrstedt, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Such animal models are still crucial for drug evaluation and validation, as they provide the investigator with an integrated response encompassing efficacy, bioavailability, side effects, and toxicity (ADME/T parameters) of the drug in a whole organism, and are standardly used for pharmacokinetic and safety studies that are a pre-requisite for human clinical trials (Alqahtani et al., 2013; Eddershaw et al., 2000; Parasuraman, 2011; Zhang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Non-rodent mammalian species such as rabbits, dogs, swine, and monkeys are also widely used in pharmacological safety and pharmacokinetic studies (Parasuraman, 2011; Pellegatti, 2013; Swindle et al., 2012; van der Laan et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Although such large animal models are associated with limitations, such as higher price and more pronounced ethical considerations, their use is still widely practiced, especially by the pharmaceutical industry, since the regulatory guidelines of FDA, European EMA, and other similar international and regional authorities usually require safety testing in at least two mammalian species, including one non-rodent species, prior to human trials authorization (Parasuraman, 2011; van der Laan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Indeed, rodent and human proteins are sometimes not similarly sensitive toward bioactive compounds (Huang et al., 2004; Kervinen et al., 2010), and therefore a higher confidence for safety and efficacy can be obtained by using several mammalian species, or genetically engineered “humanized” animal models if available (Foster et al., 2014; Scheer and Roland Wolf, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In this context, an additional factor contributing to the broad use of rodents as first-line in vivo models for pharmacological testing is the availability and the established methods for de novo generation of genetically modified mice (with a gene-knockout, downregulation (knockdown), or overexpression of a protein of interest), as well as genetically modified rats, which are providing a set of additional approaches to study pharmacological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Such genetically modified rodent models are successfully applied for the verification of in vivo efficacy prior to human trials, for the discovery of new pharmacological targets, as well as to assist the elucidation of pharmacological mechanisms of action (Foster et al., 2014; Zambrowicz and Sands, 2003; Zhang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The generation of genetically modified animal models has dramatically evolved recently by the development of new TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated techniques for genome editing (Harrison et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P57"><text><SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>General limitations associated with the use of rodents or other mammals for scientific purposes are higher costs, incompatibility with modern HTS, and growing ethical concerns [which led for example to the recent introduction of the Directive No. 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament promoting the “3R principle” (Replace, Reduce and Refine) for the use of animal experiments]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In spite of these limitations, mouse and rat remain the most widely used and still indispensable species in the drug discovery process. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P59"><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>A very common approach is to start pharmacological testing with crude plant extracts and subsequently to isolate and characterize the constituents responsible for the activity of the extract (Koehn and Carter, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Preparation of plant extracts is relatively simple and low in cost and time investment, but to assure good data reproducibility, it is crucial to carefully document identity, history, and processing of the plant material (see Section 2.2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>The extraction method can strongly influence the chemical composition, and thus the biological activity of the extract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the selection of the extraction method, including the solvent, needs to be carefully considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>If the starting material originates from plants used in traditional medicine, it is often recommended to perform the extraction in a way that mimics the preparation of the traditional herbal drug, although this is often difficult, e.g. when fresh plant material is used for the traditional application (Heinrich, 2010a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>If the structural classes of the target compounds are known, the extraction and fractionation procedures can be optimized to maximize the yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, often the chemistry of the bioactive compounds in the investigated plant is not known, and in such cases it is advantageous to extract a broad spectrum of compound classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Often, the initial crude extracts are prepared with 70% aqueous methanol or ethanol, since these solvents have proven in practice to be suitable to extract a broad range of bioactive molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>An often used alternative to the extraction with one solvent is the preparation of multiple crude extracts by subsequent extraction of the plant material with solvents of increasing polarity (e.g., n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>The major advantage of this approach is that the generated multiple crude extracts contain a smaller variety of compounds, and the major disadvantage is that more crude extracts need to be biologically assayed (Liu, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P60"><text><SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Crude plant extracts exhibiting biological activity are subjected to iterative bioactivity-guided fractionation cycles until the respective pure bioactive compounds are identified [Table 5; (Liu, 2008)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Since the fractionation and bioactivity evaluation of the generated fractions are very laborious steps, it is critical to obtain reliable bioactivity data with the crude plant extracts, optimally in independent complementary bioassays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Typically, liquid–liquid extraction (Huang et al., 2007; Pantev et al., 2006) using organic solvents of different polarity (e.g., ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and chloroform) in water is conducted as a first fractionation step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>In order to guide the isolation process, fractions obtained from bioactive crude extracts are subjected to biological investigation (best in direct comparison with the crude extract). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Following each fractionation step, inactive fractions are dropped, and active fractions are subjected to further separation, most often by column chromatography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>If the testing is done at the same (w/v) concentration, the bioactivity of fractions containing the active constituents is expected to increase in each following fractionation cycle, compared to the crude extract, because the relative abundance of the active constituents in these fractions is increasing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Most often, several chromatographic steps are necessary to obtain the pure active compounds, which are then identified using different spectroscopic techniques (Liu, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P61"><text><SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>The above described workflow of traditional bioactivity-guided isolation is time-consuming, labor- and cost-intensive, but nonetheless can result in the successful identification of relevant constituents with novel bioactivities (Baumgartner et al., 2010; Heiss et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>However, it also might lead to known compounds with already known bioactivities (Vogl et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since plant extracts represent complex mixtures comprising a multitude of different components (active, partially active, as well as many inactive compounds) (Heinrich, 2010b), there are often interactions between constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a high activity of a crude extract may result from the presence of many weakly active compounds which act additively or synergistically (Junio et al., 2011; Kurin et al., 2012; Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2009; Zimmermann et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In such a scenario, fractionation will disrupt these interactions and thus result in a decrease of the activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>It is also possible to miss a promising bioactivity if the concentration of the bioactive compound in the crude extract is too low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a promising bioactivity can also be masked or diluted by highly abundant constituents in the extract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitous bulk substances, such as chlorophyll and polyphenols (e.g., tannins) may interfere with biological assays and generate false positive or false negative results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Whereas chlorophyll was shown to interact with fatty acids and to possess anti-oxidative activity (Cho et al., 2000; Park et al., 2007; Potterat and Hamburger, 2006), tannins are known to form complexes with polysaccharides, proteins, and metal ions, to interfere with cell-based activity assays, and also to display anti-oxidative effects (Cos et al., 2006; Tan et al., 1991; Wei et al., 2011b; Zhang et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P62"><text><SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>An emerging alternative to bioactivity-guided fractionation is the metabolic profiling approach (Table 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>It correlates the chemical profile and the bioactivity pattern of plant extracts, to guide the isolation of compounds, and to identify new or already known bioactive constituents at an early stage (dereplication) (Tawfike et al., 2013; Wolfender et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>The goal of metabolomics in general is to analyze all secondary metabolites in a sample qualitatively and quantitatively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Compared with other “omics” techniques such as genomics or proteomics, plant metabolomics is considered to be the most function-oriented approach to identify the biochemical status of the plant, since metabolites are the end products of cellular regulatory processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Therefore, their levels can be viewed as the ultimate response of biological systems to genetic or environmental changes (Yuliana et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>The identification and quantification of secondary metabolites in plant extracts in general is highly challenging (Ebada et al., 2008; Kjer et al., 2010) due to the diversity of the chemical and physical properties and the wide range of concentrations of the analytes (Dunn et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Therefore, highly sensitive and reproducible analytical methods are required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Usually (ultra) high performance liquid chromatography [(U)HPLC] or gas chromatography (GC) coupled to (high resolution) mass spectrometry [(HR)-MS], and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, are applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>The analytical data need to be pre-processed prior to statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Different open-source and commercial software packages are available for this task (Creek et al., 2011; Hartler et al., 2011; Jankevics et al., 2012; Kamleh et al., 2008; Kawaguchi et al., 2010; Pluskal et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Preprocessed analytical data from a high number of samples showing distinct pharmacological activities can then be subjected to multivariate data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>As a first step, usually unsupervised methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) are used in order to examine the distribution of the samples (e.g. active vs. inactive ones) and to identify outliers (Wolfender et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>In a second step, correlation of analytical and pharmacological data by supervised methods like partial least square regression modeling discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) or orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) enables the identification of features that are highly correlated with the biological activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>This allows the targeted isolation of novel putatively bioactive compounds, as well as the dereplication of already known ones (Cardoso-Taketa et al., 2008; Maree et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this approach can shorten the bioactivity-guided isolation process by enabling the detection of the bioactive compounds at an early stage and therefore preventing unnecessary efforts, costs, and time of working steps (Tawfike et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Wolfender et al. have recently extensively reviewed the still existing challenges underlying this approach (Wolfender et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>The main obstacle is the comprehensive detection of the metabolites occurring in complex natural extracts by highly reproducible methods, that often requires the application of several extraction methods (Choi and Verpoorte, 2014) and of several complementary sophisticated analytical platforms, involving expensive high-end analytical instruments (Wolfender et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Also pre-processing and data mining are critical steps due to the high complexity of the analyzed samples and the wide variety of existing software packages that are based on different algorithms and therefore can extract different features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Dereplication and unambiguous identification of metabolites is particularly problematic in case of LC–MS data, since different instrument types generate different ion species and fragmentation patterns, thus complicating the setup of generic databases (Wolfender et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P63"><text><SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>The bioactivity-guided isolation and the metabolic profiling approaches focus on the isolation and identification of active principles from identified active extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the direct phytochemical isolation approach focuses on the full chemical characterization of a plant extract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>By using dereplication tools (e.g., LC–MS), special emphasis is put on the isolation of novel compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>The isolated compounds are subjected directly to biological testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Compounds isolated with this approach might also be assembled in natural product libraries, for example the National Cancer Institute's natural product library (Liu et al., 2013), that can be used for different bioactivity tests, including HTS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Starting the bioactivity screening with pure compounds has many advantages including better compatibility with HTS and prevention of many difficulties, which come along with extract testing as mentioned above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>However, using this approach, time and effort need to be invested in advance for the isolation of the natural compounds without any guarantee that the respective compounds will finally have a relevant bioactivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Next to the possibility for HTS with libraries composed of randomly selected natural products, a variety of knowledge-based strategies can be applied for the assembly of focused natural product libraries including just natural products with certain characteristics (see Section 3.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>In this respect, a good prioritization approach might be to use chemography to navigate in chemical space (Oprea and Gottfries, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Chemical space is the entity of all possible molecules, comprising an estimated number of more than 1060 compounds only when small carbon-based molecules are considered and a significantly higher number when adding more complex bioactive molecules (Bohlin et al., 2010; Larsson et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>The region of chemical space relevant for natural product-based drug discovery is termed “biologically relevant chemical space”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The limits of this multidimensional sub-volume are defined by properties and boundaries that allow binding interactions between biological molecules [primary and secondary metabolites, polypeptides, enzymes, RNA, DNA; (Bohlin et al., 2010; Lipinski and Hopkins, 2004; Oprea and Gottfries, 2001)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>In order to enable the exploration of biologically relevant space, ChemGPS-NP, a prediction model tuned for the exploration of the regions of chemical space most likely to enclose compounds with biologically relevant functions and activities, has been developed [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se">http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se</ext-link>; (Larsson et al., 2007; Rosen et al., 2009)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>This online tool can be applied for compound selection and prioritization, property description and interpretation, cluster analyses and neighborhood mapping as well as comparison and characterization of large compound datasets (Rosen et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P64"><text><SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Starting the screening with enriched fractions, containing a smaller number of compounds in comparison with crude extracts, is an approach that is in-between the other two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>There is less preliminary work required in comparison with the approach directly starting with pure compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>In addition, less subsequent work is required to isolate and identify the bioactive compounds compared to the approach starting with crude extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>However, starting the screening with enriched fractions is based on a higher number of starting test samples since multiple fractions are generated from a single plant extract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>In cases when the pharmacological assays allow HTS, this approach is advantageous, since many HTS approaches that do not work well with plant extracts due to interferences with ubiquitous perturbing compounds, could be successfully applied to enriched fractions (Eldridge et al., 2002; Hassig et al., 2014; Henrich and Beutler, 2013; Johnson et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>In addition to HTS with libraries of randomly obtained plant-derived fractions, also in this occasion different knowledge-based strategies can be applied for the assembly of focused libraries containing just fractions with certain characteristics (see Section 3.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>For example, an approach for selection of extracts and fractions based on their drug-like physicochemical properties was recently developed (Camp et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P65"><text><SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Since the bioactivity of a plant extract may be the result of synergistic interactions of several components, and in this case bioactivity-guided fractionation might fail, a synergy-directed fractionation strategy was recently developed (Junio et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>This approach combines bioactivity testing of the generated fractions for synergistic interactions, with MS-profiling and natural products isolation, aiming to identify synergistic interactions of extract constituents which could be missed using the traditional bioactivity-guided fractionation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P66"><text><SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, in addition to the identification of single bioactive plant constituents, there is also an increasing interest in the use of standardized plant extracts as herbal medicinal products or dietary supplements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Especially if there are synergistic or additive effects, if bioactive compounds are more stable in the extract, or if the bioavailability is better, an extract might possibly have higher therapeutic efficacy compared to the isolated pure compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>However, more research is needed in this direction (Gertsch, 2011; Liu and Wang, 2008; Liu, 2008; Schmidt et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P67"><text><SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Another important aspect related to the identification of plant-based bioactive molecules, is that it is now increasingly recognized that some natural products are prodrugs that need to be metabolized in vivo by the intestinal microorganisms or by the mammalian organism in order to yield pharmacologically active molecules (Akao et al., 2002; Atkinson et al., 2004; Butterweck and Nahrstedt, 2012; Hostanska et al., 2014; Tomas-Barberan et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>This is posing serious challenges to some of the established approaches related to bioactivity investigations of traditionally used medicinal plants, since in such occasions the effector compounds are not present in the starting plant material and bioactivity cannot be detected with many conventionally used assays and approaches [e.g., in vitro assays (Table 4) and direct phytochemical isolation approach (Table 5) are not applicable]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>An emerging concept, termed here “metabolism-directed approach” (Table 5), is addressing these challenges by the use of in vivo models or in vitro assays specifically designed for a targeted search of bioactive plant metabolites (Actis-Goretta et al., 2012; Bowey et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2008; Qiao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014b; Xiao and Hogger, 2013; Yu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P68"><text><SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>Many potent plant-derived natural products such as paclitaxel, podophyllotoxin, or vinblastine share severe difficulties to meet the market demands, as their natural sources are often slow-growing or even endangered species that tend to accumulate these compounds at very low quantities over long growth periods (Miralpeix et al., 2013; Staniek et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Natural populations of many medicinal plants have been increasingly facing pressure from mostly anthropogenic factors like environmental damage, deforestation and industrialization due to extensive population growth, fires and other natural disasters, development of land for agriculture, climate change, and last but not least, extensive collection of plant material from the wild (Arora et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>In fact, more than 20% of the world's medicinal and aromatic plant species are threatened to varying degrees (Schippmann et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of the estimated 50,000 medicinal plant species currently used are collected from the wild, raising concerns about issues such as diminishing populations, loss of genetic diversity, local extinctions, and habitat degradation (Canter et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>While isolation of natural products directly from the plant species in which they occur is often acceptable if small to moderate amounts of the respective compounds are needed (for example for the supply of sufficient quantities for small-scale experimental laboratory work), additional routes for resupply need to be considered once there are increased market demands for the respective natural product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>In these cases natural products can be resupplied by the application of plant cell and tissue culture, heterologous production, total chemical synthesis, or semi-synthesis from isolated precursors occurring more abundantly in nature, as discussed in greater detail in the following subsections. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>For some of the stages which make up the process of domestication of wild-growing plant species, in vitro techniques can be applied, for example in selection breeding for genetic improvement or storage of plant materials (Bohr, 1997; Franz, 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Since the fundamental report by Haberlandt on the in vitro cultivation of isolated plant cells (Haberlandt, 1902), plant cell and tissue culture has developed into an important and well established discipline, with impact on both basic research and applied technologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Out of these, the in vitro propagation (micropropagation) of plants and the in vitro culture of plant organs (typically roots) can provide means for the supply of plant material as source of natural products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Plant cell culture (i.e. the in vitro culture of isolated cells) has long been regarded as a convenient tool for the biotechnological production of plant compounds, but as outlined later, the practical applicability of this approach should be critically questioned. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P70"><text><SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Micropropagation is defined as the in vitro plant regeneration from excised plant parts through either shoot organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis (Siahsar et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>On a commercial scale it has developed into a multi-billion-dollar industry and offers important advantages over the conventional propagation of plants, like production of large numbers of genetically homogenous plants year-round in a comparatively short time, disease-free propagules, and greatly enhanced multiplication rates (Debnath et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Micropropagation has become a standard method of plant production for many species of economic value, such as plants of agricultural, ornamental, vegetable, and forestry importance (Debnath et al., 2006; Read, 2007; Tasheva and Kosturkova, 2013). In vitro propagation certainly also holds significant potential for the mass production of medicinal plants and numerous protocols for micropropagation of a huge number of medicinally used species have been developed up to date (Afolayan and Adebola, 2004; Chaturvedi et al., 2007; Debnath et al., 2006; Rout et al., 2000; Sarasan et al., 2011; Tripathi and Tripathi, 2003; Wawrosch, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>However, the higher costs of in vitro techniques as compared to conventional propagation are a major disadvantage and have limited its use at a commercial level (Mehrotra et al., 2007; Pence, 2011; Sahu and Sahu, 2013; Wawrosch, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Although medicinal plants are increasingly introduced into field culture (Wiesrum et al., 2006), general obstacles to the commercial cultivation of many medicinal plants include a difficulty to predict which herbal products will remain marketable (Debnath et al., 2006), economic impediments in case of small market sizes, and last but not least the fact that wildly collected material is less expensive (Lubbe and Verpoorte, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P71"><text><SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Plant cell cultures (dedifferentiated cells suspended in liquid nutrient medium) have been aptly denominated as chemical factories of secondary metabolites (Rao and Ravishankar, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>They offer a number of advantages over the conventional use of plants as sources of phytochemicals, like for example independence of geographical, seasonal, and environmental variations; continuous reliable production in uniform quality and yield; avoidance of pesticide and herbicide application; and comparatively short growth cycles (Bonfill et al., 2013; Debnath et al., 2006; Rao and Ravishankar, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Technologies which have been developed for other cell culture systems like mammalian cells or yeast can be adapted for large scale industrial applications with plant cells (Kolewe et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>But, despite of many decades of research in the field, at present only fourteen substances or products are produced commercially from plant cell cultures (Frense, 2007; Kolewe et al., 2008), with the most prominent being paclitaxel from Taxus spp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>This is due to several limitations of plant cell cultures in comparison to microbial production sources, including slow growth rates and low and variable yields of metabolites — in fact, many metabolites do not accumulate in plant cell cultures because of lacking differentiation and compartmentalization (Kirakosyan et al., 2009; Kolewe et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>While still very little is known about the plant secondary metabolites biosynthesis and its regulation, it remains questionable whether in a foreseeable time plant cell cultures will play a significant role in the industrial production of natural products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in order to get a broad overview of the existing resupply approaches, some aspects of the methodology will be briefly addressed here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P72"><text><SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, in many cases the formation of desired compounds in plant cell cultures can be distinctly enhanced by different measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>In this regard, one important approach is the modification of the nutrient medium with the aim of increasing biomass and, often in a subsequent step, optimizing metabolite production (Bonfill et al., 2013; Murthy et al., 2014; Weathers et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>Herein, key factors include the ionic strength of the basal medium, phosphate and nitrate level, the level and type of sugars, growth regulators, and the feeding with precursors (Murthy et al., 2014; Rao and Ravishankar, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a number of physical factors can influence the properties of plant cell cultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>These are the inoculum density, temperature, light quality and intensity, pH of the nutrient medium, and agitation and aeration of the culture batch (Kanokwaree and Doran, 1997; Murthy et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P73"><text><SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>Dedifferentiated cells, typically constituting plant cell cultures are usually prone to high variability in product biosynthesis, formation of large cell aggregates, and they are sensitive to shear stress — with the latter two features being particularly important obstacles in industrial-scale cultivation (Yun et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>The key aspect therein is about how to “design (…) chemical products and processes to reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances” (Anastas and Warner, 1998; Horvath and Anastas, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>It attempts to achieve sustainability at the molecular level and applies to all stages of the chemical life cycle (Anastas and Eghbali, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>Key to this are the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry, meant to be a cohesive set of guidelines for the design of products and processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>Outlined very briefly, they are: Prevention (of waste, rather than treating it), Atom Economy (vide infra), Less Hazardous Chemical Synthesis (applies to methodology), Designing Safer Chemicals (while preserving their intended function), Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries (if they cannot be avoided altogether), Design for Energy Efficiency (methodologies should allow ambient temperature and pressure), Use of Renewable Feedstock (rather than depleting limited raw materials), Reduce Derivatives (in concession steps such as non-strategic redox reactions and functional group interconversions, protective group manipulations), Catalysis (as selective as possible), Design for Degradation (applies to products which should break down to nonhazardous materials at the end of their function), Real-Time Analysis for Pollution Prevention (before hazardous substances are formed), and Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention (minimizing the hazard factor in the risk function). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>These principles are discussed in more detail with examples elsewhere (Anastas and Eghbali, 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P93"><text><SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>Meaningful statements about the impact on health and environment also require a quantitative assessment to describe the various shades of green of a product or process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>For this reason, different metrics have been proposed, gradually marking a paradigm shift from the overall yield as the most important criterion toward a more integrated view (Dicks and Hent, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="544" pm="."><plain>With regard to a synthetic plan (chemical reactions on paper), the concept of atom economy AE was proposed early on (Trost, 1991) as a measure of how much of the reactants, in terms of their molecular weight M, remains in the desired final product (Eq. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P94"><text><SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>When molecules are transformed, waste material is produced in most cases, depending on the type of reaction mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>For example, addition and rearrangement reactions tend to be more atom economic while substitution and elimination reactions do not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>When extending the concept to a reaction sequence composed of a number of individual steps, the intermediate compounds do not appear in Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>(1) because they cancel from the overall net reaction equation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>A reactant is defined as any component which contributes atoms to intermediate or final products, even if none of the reactant eventually remains in the final product as it is the case in protection–reaction–deprotection sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>Catalytically active species, solvents and other auxiliary components are neglected unless they are (partially) incorporated into intermediate or final products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>The equivalents of reaction components used to calculate AE are taken as demanded by the stoichiometry of the transformation, i.e. disregarding the excess of some components one may choose to use in a real chemical reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>The advantage of this approach is that chemists can evaluate different synthetic strategies before real experiments are attempted (Dicks and Hent, 2015), where subsequent reaction optimization then very likely calls for reactant equivalents, catalysts, solvents, auxiliaries, and other conditions to be varied considerably. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P95"><text><SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>For the same reasons, however, atom economy is also quite remote from real-world chemistry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>A metric which actually accounts for experimental details, called the reaction mass efficiency (Curzons et al., 2001), also known as Curzons RME (Eq. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>Moreover, calculating various metric parameters for multistep (especially convergent) synthetic plans by hand is rather impractical, since it is easy to lose track and make mistakes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>To address this, a spreadsheet based, step-by-step algorithm was created for practical application to any complex synthesis, and the method was applied to exhaustively compare the greenness of 18 synthetic plans (both industrial and academic) of oseltamivir (Andraos, 2009), the initial preparations of which were based on the elaboration of quinic acid (obtained from e.g. the bark of Cinchona species) or shikimic acid (from Illicium species, such as the Chinese or Japanese star anise). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="573" pm="."><plain>This revealed that the industrial semi-synthetic shikimic acid route (Harrington et al., 2004) and a streamlined modification thereof (Carr et al., 2008) had the highest overall yield ε (39.0% and 43.8%) and the highest kernel RME (0.115 and 0.113), while they had the lowest value for the E-factor (230.9 and 203.5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="574" pm="."><plain>The industrial route produced the least amount of total waste (94.7 kg for 1 mol, or 230.8 kg for 1 kg of oseltamivir phosphate). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="582" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, a chemoenzymatic process was developed in which the chiral intermediate necessary to elaborate 10-deacetybaccatin III to paclitaxel was produced via kinetic resolution employing reusable, immobilized lipases, and the process was scaled to up to 150 l, resulting in excellent yield, enantiomeric excess and purity (Patel et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P105"><text><SENT sid="583" pm="."><plain>Strategies for natural product synthesis are not readily delineated by type of chemical reaction, although a methodology-oriented central step may sometimes be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="584" pm="."><plain>Bond metathesis affording a macrocyclic structure is a characteristic example (Fürstner, 2011; Nicolaou et al., 1998), in which case the key transformation occurs toward the end of the synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="585" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a synthetic strategy may be built upon procuring important intermediates or starting materials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="586" pm="."><plain>An example for this (from chemoenzymatic methodology) is the enantioselective dihydroxylation of variously substituted benzenes by toluene dioxygenase (Hudlicky and Reed, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="587" pm="."><plain>This transformation is remarkable since it accomplishes dearomatization of benzene derivatives to give arene dihydrodiols, allowing for synthetic routes, which would otherwise not be feasible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="588" pm="."><plain>It is also a whole-cell fermentation (in E. coli) which appears well-scalable (up to 15 l of broth in a laboratory setting), furnishing the dihydrodiols on 10 to 100 g scale within three days, including the time needed for preculture preparation and inoculation (Endoma et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="589" pm="."><plain>Compounds of this sort, the production of which by chemical means would be a lengthy procedure, are highly useful building blocks because chemical synthesis might be next used to elaborate them further to plant compounds such as pancratistatin and morphine (Hudlicky, 2006; Reed and Hudlicky, 2015), or analogs and derivatives thereof, and also oseltamivir (Werner et al., 2010), in the order of ten steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="590" pm="."><plain>This hand-in-hand of biotransformation and synthesis improves the metrics discussed above in two ways: the enzymatic process itself fulfills most of the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry very well, except for the Renewables principle because the substituted benzene, although readily prepared chemically, may still originate from a hydrocarbon source, and the Safer Chemicals principle because such dihydrodiols unfortunately can violently rearomatize upon exposure to trace acid, while the Degradation principle would not apply to these intermediates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="591" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a short overall synthesis is possible because the dihydrodiol already contains important strategic bonds of the target molecule. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P106"><text><SENT sid="592" pm="."><plain>Identification of such strategic bonds, however, is a general approach in synthetic planning and applies to all types of strategies and methodologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="593" pm="."><plain>Therein, the target molecule is conceptually disconnected (retrosynthesis) into simpler fragments (synthons). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="594" pm="."><plain>This process is iterated until the synthons translate into readily available and inexpensive starting materials for the forward synthesis (Corey and Cheng, 1989). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="595" pm="."><plain>A specific instance of such a disconnection approach in terms of natural products is biomimetic synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="596" pm="."><plain>The idea is to have at least one key step which retrosynthetically emulates the same bond disconnections as the (proposed) biosynthesis, in an effort to render the route to the final product more efficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="597" pm="."><plain>The concept may be traced back to the synthesis of tropinone by Robinson (Robinson, 1917), but the field really gained momentum in the early 1970s (Breslow, 1972). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="598" pm="."><plain>Successful laboratory preparations involving intermediate structures that also occur in natural systems (e.g., plants) have also been used to support biosynthetic rationales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="599" pm="."><plain>Thus, biomimetic synthesis (also called bioinspired synthesis) has given rise to numerous natural products, as reviewed by Bulger et al. (Bulger et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P107"><text><SENT sid="600" pm="."><plain>Collective total synthesis represents a more recent concept related to biomimicry and the idea of modularity in synthesis that focuses on generating structurally diverse natural products (Jones et al., 2011b), as demonstrated with different alkaloids belonging to the Strychnos, Aspidosperma and Kopsia families by pointing out their presumably common biosynthetic precursor preakuammicine (Hudlický and Reed, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="601" pm="."><plain>This led to the preparation of a variety of such alkaloids via a key intermediate structure, obtained in an organocatalytic and enantioselective cascade in high yields. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="602" pm="."><plain>Notably, this approach also constitutes the most concise synthesis of (−)-strychnine as the subject of many total syntheses (Bonjoch and Sole, 2000; Cannon and Overman, 2012) to date, with an overall yield of 6.4% in 12 steps starting from a commercially available compound. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="603" pm="."><plain>This compares to 2 × 10−4% overall and 29 steps in the landmark Woodward synthesis of the compound (Woodward et al., 1954). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="604" pm="."><plain>This collective synthesis approach for plant compounds has subsequently been taken up by others (Ghavimi and Magnus, 2014; Han et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P108"><text><SENT sid="605" pm="."><plain>Scalability of chemical reactions is a concern in its own right. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="606" pm="."><plain>The mass and heat transfer rates change dramatically when scaling to a large reactor, affecting reaction rate and selectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="607" pm="."><plain>For example, reactions such as lithiations are typically carried out at −78 °C (the sublimation point of dry ice), but on industrial scale, the increased viscosity and low solubility of such a solution can lead to inhomogeneity and possibly impurity formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="608" pm="."><plain>In the downstream process, problems include large-scale liquid–liquid extraction (formation of emulsions) and the need to tightly control the crystallization process (polymorphism and solvate formation) of every batch (Laird, 2010; Stitt and Simmons, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="609" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the very nature of the step-by-step process requires many manual operations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="610" pm="."><plain>Most work-up und purification procedures generate waste and consume energy, making alternatives where production processes are telescoped highly desirable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="611" pm="."><plain>Continuous flow chemistry holds the potential of bypassing scaling problems and improving the environmental footprint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="612" pm="."><plain>Considerable efforts have been invested into managing multi-step processes, downstream processing and handling low temperatures, gases and slurries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="613" pm="."><plain>This is combined with increased process safety, real-time reaction monitoring and control, and the potential to reduce solvent amounts and waste production, as well as truly continuous (i.e., 24/7) operation (Pastre et al., 2013), well in agreement with the Twelve Principles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="614" pm="."><plain>For example, a flow reactor system has been used to react singlet oxygen with the endocyclic double bond of dihydroartemisinic acid, eventually furnishing artemisinin via a hydroperoxy intermediate with the capability of producing the antimalarial drug at a rate of 200 g per day (Levesque and Seeberger, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="615" pm="."><plain>Although this method has been criticized in favor of a batch process (Paddon et al., 2013), it has been pointed out that accumulation of this hydroperoxy intermediate in batch might be hazardous (Booker-Milburn, 2012), whereas it is continuously converted further in the flow process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="616" pm="."><plain>Moreover, flow chemistry is not restricted to semi-synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="617" pm="."><plain>Preparation of the neolignan grossamide represents a pioneering case as a proof of concept (Baxendale et al., 2006b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="618" pm="."><plain>There are several other instances of plant-derived compounds being synthesized by the use of flow methods, including (rac)-oxomaritidine (Baxendale et al., 2006a), (−)-dumetorine [alongside with the synthesis of the structurally similarly (−)-sedamine and (+)-sedridine (Riva et al., 2011)], and (+)-pauciflorol F (Kim et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="619" pm="."><plain>The rapidly emerging area of flow chemistry-mediated preparation of natural products has been recently discussed in substantial detail (Pastre et al., 2013), and its connections to Green Chemistry (choice of solvents and solvent reduction by an order of magnitude, process safety, recovery and reuse of immobilized reagents, more efficient energy transfer and shortened process time) have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Ley, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P109"><text><SENT sid="620" pm="."><plain>It has been argued that, once a (single-digit) gram-scale synthesis of a complex natural product has been achieved, it is more likely to be amendable to larger scale without complete revision of the synthetic plan (Kuttruff et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="621" pm="."><plain>The preparation of such quantities, including many plant-derived compounds, mostly represents the state of the art within the constraints of an academic setting (Hong, 2014; Kuttruff et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="622" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, chemical synthesis of plant compounds has been regarded very difficult and expensive due to their structural complexity (De Luca et al., 2012), and there is no consensus on whether synthetic chemistry or synthetic biology will be the major supply route of the future for the production of chemical entities in general, especially in light of recent advances in chemical biology (Keasling et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="623" pm="."><plain>In addition, progress in both areas could very well be used synergistically, as was pointed out above for chemoenzymatic production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="624" pm="."><plain>Chemical synthesis has reached a level of complexity to achieve a large diversity of bond-formation processes, which can certainly be implemented on industrial scale employing favorable economics for the production of compounds that are available from natural sources in minute quantities only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="625" pm="."><plain>To this end, a brief case study shall be presented which compares the chemical routes of (−)-galanthamine and (+)-ingenol, two plant-derived and therapeutically used compounds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P110"><text><SENT sid="626" pm="."><plain>Galanthamine (Reminyl® and other trade names, Sanochemia Pharmazeutika) is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid, and its main use is to alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase to counteract decreased levels of the neurotransmitter in the brain (Jones et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="627" pm="."><plain>It can be produced by isolation from various Galanthus (snowdrop) species, but these sources do not meet the demand, in particular due to highly specific conditions for culturing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="628" pm="."><plain>Various syntheses had been reported [first by Barton and Kirby (Barton and Kirby, 1962)] before a kilogram scale route was developed to allow the industrial production of galanthamine hydrobromide by chemical means [Fig. 5; (Czollner et al., 2000; Küenburg et al., 1999)]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P111"><text><SENT sid="629" pm="."><plain>Ingenol is a diterpenoid found in Euphorbia (spurge) species, and most important with regard to its bioactivity is that the naturally occurring derivative ingenol mebutate has recently been approved by FDA and EMA as the first-in-class drug to treat actinic keratosis (Gras, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="630" pm="."><plain>As ingenol mebutate is isolated from E. peplus L. in yields of only 1.1 mg/kg (Hohmann et al., 2000), it is currently prepared semi-synthetically from the more abundant parent ingenol [Picato®, LEO Pharma; (Liang et al., 2012)], obtained from dried seeds of E. lathyris L. in 275 mg/kg (Appendino et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="631" pm="."><plain>This process is still not optimal, and because knowledge on the biosynthesis is scarce, advances on the part of synthetic chemistry were prompted to render ingenol more readily accessible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="632" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these efforts were also driven by the possibility to explore and produce analogs of this compound with enhanced pharmacological properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="633" pm="."><plain>Three total syntheses had been reported previously [as reviewed by (Kuwajima and Tanino, 2005)], but an approach offering a perspective for large scale synthesis was reported only recently [Fig. 6; (Jørgensen et al., 2013; McKerrall et al., 2014)], having elicited considerable interest (Appendino, 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P112"><text><SENT sid="634" pm="."><plain>Among other structural features regarding the two compounds discussed in detail here, ingenol has more stereocenters than galanthamine (8 vs. 3), and more non-aromatic quaternary carbons (3 vs. 1), two of which are contiguous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="635" pm="."><plain>In the case of ingenol, asymmetry is introduced by using the naturally occurring and readily available (+)-3-carene as a starting material, with the remainder of the synthesis relying on substrate-controlled diastereoselective reactions with non-chiral reagents only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="636" pm="."><plain>By contrast, access to optically active galanthamine is achieved because the intermediate narwedine can racemize in solution and be selectively induced to precipitate to enantiomerically pure crystals by seeding with (−)-narwedine, enabling an asymmetric route without any chirality-conferring starting materials or reagents at all. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="637" pm="."><plain>As for the overall synthesis, the most apparent differences are the number of steps (14 + 4 vs. 9), and the use of relatively simple and inexpensive reactants and bulk chemicals for galanthamine compared to the ingenol route. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="638" pm="."><plain>The chemistry is more complex in the latter case, in part because ingenol is entirely carbocyclic, requiring more elaborate methods for bond formation, while the galanthamine synthesis relies mostly on the natural polarities of carbon-heteroatom bonds to furnish new ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="639" pm="."><plain>While there are 3 skeleton-forming bond connections (of which one is carbon-carbon during the central oxidative phenol coupling) for galanthamine (Fig. 5), there are 7 such connections for ingenol (all of which are carbon–carbon) during what is called the cyclase phase of the synthesis, in addition to a carbon–carbon bond formation to furnish the allene aldehyde (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="640" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a key vinylogous pinacol rearrangement to the ingenane-type intermediate and the installment of 4 hydroxyl groups during the oxidase phase take place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="641" pm="."><plain>In connection with this, and more on the technical side, the use of cryogenic and inert reaction conditions, as well as the air-sensitivity of the reagents, are more pronounced in the ingenol synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="642" pm="."><plain>Stoichiometric use of osmium tetroxide is also prohibitively expensive and, along with selenium dioxide, a very toxic reagent of the synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="643" pm="."><plain>More protective group manipulation is also involved, although this is still moderate given the complexity of the molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="644" pm="."><plain>Conducted on kilogram-scale, chromatography is completely absent from the galanthamine synthesis, whereas it is the major purification method in the ingenol synthesis, for which the delivery of the final product on milligram-scale was published. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P114"><text><SENT sid="651" pm="."><plain>Medicinal plants have historically been a rich source for successful drugs, and still represent an important pool for the identification of new pharmacological leads today. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="652" pm="."><plain>Renewed scientific interest in plant-derived natural product-based drug discovery is evident from the analysis of PubMed publications trends (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="653" pm="."><plain>Plants are producing numerous chemically highly diverse secondary metabolites which are optimized for exerting biological functions and are still far from being exhaustively investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="654" pm="."><plain>Resulting from the revived scientific interest in natural product-based drug discovery, new approaches for the identification, characterization, and resupply of natural products are being developed, that may address some of the challenges related with the development of plant-based therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="655" pm="."><plain>One major asset of medicinal plant-based drug discovery is the existence of ethnopharmacological information providing hints for compounds therapeutically effective in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="656" pm="."><plain>In order to harvest its full potential, of particular importance is the adoption of a broad interdisciplinary approach involving ethnopharmacological knowledge, botany, phytochemistry, and more relevant pharmacological testing strategies (e.g., early in vivo efficacy studies and compound identification strategies including metabolism and synergistic action of the plant constituents). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="657" pm="."><plain>Resupply from the original plant species is very often unfeasible to meet market demands upon commercialization of a natural product, and alternative resupply approaches are being developed that rely on biotechnological production or chemical synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="658" pm="."><plain>Total chemical synthesis is an effective resupply strategy in case of natural products or natural product derivatives with simple structures such as acetylsalicylic acid and ephedrine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="659" pm="."><plain>For complex structures with multiple chiral centers, however, total synthesis is, at present, both difficult and economically unfeasible in most cases, requiring significant technological advances to be successfully applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="660" pm="."><plain>For the resupply of complex natural products usually harvesting from plant sources and semi-synthesis from naturally occurring precursors still remain the most economically-viable approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="661" pm="."><plain>Although biotechnological production is currently not broadly applied for industry-scale production of plant-derived natural products, it bears potential that can be harvested in the future align with the progress of the knowledge of plant biosynthetic pathways and the development of more efficient genetic engineering strategies and tools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P115"><text><SENT sid="662" pm="."><plain>While natural product-based drug discovery and development represents a complex endeavor demanding a highly integrated interdisciplinary approach, the presented recent scientific developments, technologic advances, and research trends clearly indicate that natural products will be among the most important sources of new drugs also in the future. </plain></SENT>
