</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasma spp. are bacteria that evolved by a process of degenerative evolution from the low G + C Firmicutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasmas have lost genes for cell wall biosynthesis, and many anabolic processes (including a TCA cycle) are reliant on glycolysis for the production of cellular ATP [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasmas typically have small genomes of less than 1000 kbp and are dependent on the host for the supply of cholesterol for membrane biosynthesis, amino acids, nucleotides and other macromolecular building blocks for cell growth [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As such, mycoplasmas are excellent model organisms to examine the complexity of post-translational modifications in prokaryotes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is an agriculturally significant swine respiratory pathogen that causes substantial economic losses, estimated in the billions of dollars per annum [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete genome sequences of four geographically distinct strains of M. hyopneumoniae are available [3,5,6], shedding light on the metabolic capacity, host specialization and evolutionary background of this minimal organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genomes range in size from 850 to 920 kb and encode approximately 700 open reading frames (ORFs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The M. hyopneumoniae strain 232 genome contains 691 known proteins and 728 annotated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A recent proteome analysis of strain 232 identified 8607 unique peptide sequences (false discovery rate of 0.53%) confirming the expression of 70% (483) of the 691 predicted ORFs during culture in Friis broth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This included 171 of the 328 predicted hypothetical proteins (52%), 80% of the lipoprotein genes, and all the P97/P102 adhesin gene families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the same study, proteogenomic analysis of strain 232 uncovered previously unidentified genes and 5′ extensions to several genes [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome studies indicate that 92% of predicted ORFs are transcribed in M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight non-coding RNAs were also identified in the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Genes with the highest expression levels primarily encoded proteins involved in basal metabolism, as well as chaperones, adhesins, surface proteins, transporters and RNase P. A number of uncharacterized proteins were also identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The M. hyopneumoniae gene encoding the P216 adhesin protein was also presented with a significant number of transcripts (RPKM, reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads: 10 796.4) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>While these approaches have shed light on the protein coding capacity of M. hyopneumoniae, they do little to understand the extent by which it modifies its proteome post-translationally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>During the early, critical stages of infection, M. hyopneumoniae adheres specifically along the entire length of cilia of ciliated epithelial cells that line the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles in the upper respiratory tract of pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This association causes ciliostasis, loss of cilia and eventual epithelial cell death, which effectively perturbs mucociliary function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The P97 and P102 adhesin families are central to mediating attachment of M. hyopneumoniae to epithelial cilia [9–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Notably, all members of the P97 and P102 adhesin families are processed post-translationally to the extent that it is difficult to find evidence of adhesin pre-proteins [9–12,15,17,18,20–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Most members of the P97 and P102 families are processed via highly efficient cleavage events typically at S/T–X–F↓–X–D/E sites, but also within stretches of hydrophobic amino acids and by numerous, less efficient cleavage events often in a manner consistent with trypsin-like activity [20–22,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the surface protein architecture of M. hyopneumoniae displays cleavage fragments derived via processing of the P97 and P102 adhesin families by several endopeptidases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>What is unclear is how endoproteolysis alters the presentation of surface proteins not related to the P97 and P102 adhesin families, including members of the lipoprotein family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The current trend in global proteomic analysis has been to use high-speed, ultra-sensitive mass spectrometers combined with orthogonal upfront chromatographic fractionation (i.e. two-dimensional LC–MS/MS) in a peptide-centric manner to characterize proteomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These high-throughput protocols rely on all proteins in a sample being digested with an efficient protease (e.g. trypsin) into peptides for downstream analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Peptide-centric or ‘bottom-up’ approaches are used widely, because peptides are more readily solubilized for fractionation and are amenable to chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometry is more sensitive when analysing peptides, rather than intact proteins [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Conversely, protein-centric approaches aim to preserve intact proteins throughout fractionation steps, so that proteoform information may be retained [26], and then discrete proteins or fractions are digested to peptides and analysed individually by mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Protein-centric methods are thus not necessarily ‘top-down’ approaches that aim to analyse individual intact proteins by mass spectrometry [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Without selective enrichment, high-throughput peptide-centric approaches can fail to capture post-translational proteolytic modifications and can lead to an oversimplification of the complexity of the proteome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we applied protein-centric approaches that retain mass context with the aim of identifying proteins that are targets of processing events in M. hyopneumoniae-type strain J. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>While the precise functions of bacterial lipoproteins remain poorly understood, there is mounting evidence to suggest they are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>PAMPs are recognized by Toll-like receptors that trigger innate immune responses [49–52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Most mycoplasma lipoproteins are surface-exposed with acyl groups anchoring these proteins in the cell membrane, where they are thought to function as cytadhesins, transport proteins or virulence factors with immunomodulatory capabilities [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>P65 is an abundantly expressed, immunoreactive and lipolytic lipoprotein that selectively partitions to the detergent phase during extraction with TX-114 [38,54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Schmidt et al. showed that anti-P65 antibodies inhibit the lipolytic activity of P65 and growth of M. hyopneumoniae, indicating that P65 performs a primary function on the external membrane surface by providing a source of essential lipids for growth [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>It has also been suggested that P65 may alter surfactant properties in the lungs of pigs in vivo [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In our studies, P65 was recovered during affinity capture protocols using different host molecules as bait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Although these are preliminary data that require quantitative studies to confirm a direct role for P65 in these interactions, this suggests that P65 displays motifs that facilitate binding to a diverse range of host molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these preliminary observations, we show here for the first time that P65 is a target of several processing events that generate cleavage fragments which are selectively retained during affinity chromatography using porcine epithelial cell surface proteins, fibronectin or porcine heparin as bait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The ability of the cleavage fragments of P65 to bind the same bait proteins as P65 lends weight to the hypothesis that the interactions with host molecules are direct and biologically relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Cleavage occurred at a number of sites in the P65 protein sequence, including at a phenylalanine residue within a S/T–X–F↓X–D/E motif; a known processing site in the P97 and P102 adhesin families [9–12,15,18,20–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>An immunoblot of biotinylated cell surface M. hyopneumoniae strain J proteins fractionated using TX-114 that was probed with anti-P65 polyclonal antibodies identified a 65 kDa protein and numerous smaller mass fragments of P65 consistent with cleavage at several sites within the molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>These data show that P65 and cleavage fragments of P65 reside on the surface of M. hyopneumoniae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Notably, there is clear evidence of a doublet at approximately 65 kDa (boxed in figure 2b) in the lane containing M. hyopneumoniae aqueous phase proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that P65 may undergo clipping at the N-terminus and be a target of further post-translational processing events [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the doublet may represent forms of P65 that have lost the lipid anchor because they partitioned to the aqueous phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>If correct, these data suggest that a small lipopeptide similar to the macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2 (MALP-2) of Mycoplasma fermentans may be produced from P65. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Unlike RF, both MALP-2 and MALP-404 are lipid-modified and remain associated with the membrane of M. fermentans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>MALP-2 is a potent immunomodulatory molecule that engages Toll-like receptor 2 [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Like the MALP-2 lipopeptide, the N-terminus of P65 may play a similar immunomodulatory role in M. hyopneumoniae; however, further studies are required to confirm this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Similarly, MGA0674 is an 82 kDa lipoprotein in Mycoplasma gallisepticum whose expression is elevated in virulent strain Rlow compared with the attenuated vaccine strain F, suggesting that it may play a role in pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>A significant number of the 35 proteins identified to be targets of post-translational processing were glycolytic enzymes and other metabolic proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Glycolytic enzymes are increasingly being identified as multitasking or moonlighting proteins in a wide range of organisms, including parasites [58], yeasts and fungi [59], mammalian cells [60], plants [61] and bacteria [62], and this is reflected in the range of entries seen in MultitaskProtDB [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In other members of the Mollicutes, proteins with canonical functions in the cytosol have also been found to be surface-exposed and interact with host components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>For example, in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, elongation factor Tu (EfTu) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PdhB) were identified as surface-exposed moonlighting proteins, through screening for fibronectin binding proteins by ligand blotting of whole cell lysates and fibronectin-coupled affinity chromatography, and their surface localization was confirmed by immunogold labelling and electron microscopy [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of EfTu revealed specifically that the carboxyl-terminus was surface-exposed by immunogold labelling and responsible for fibronectin binding [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>In Mycoplasma genitalium, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was identified to be surface-exposed and bind mucin, probably functioning as an adhesin [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>These proteins were identified here to be cleaved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Many processing events are likely to alter canonical (enzymatic) function and profoundly influence how cleavage fragments interact with the mycoplasma membrane and host molecules [67]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>LDH is a highly immunogenic cytoplasmic protein involved in the glycolytic process of M. hyopneumoniae [68,69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Here, we have identified LDH to be present at the cell surface both as a full-length molecule and as cleavage fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>We identified a single putative cleavage site between amino acids 188–199 and the cleaved form of LDH is unlikely to carry out its primary function owing to significant structural alteration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotic organisms, LDH has been recognized as a moonlighting protein, along with other glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and enolase, playing a role in transcriptional regulation [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>LDH has also been identified as a single-stranded DNA-binding protein in eukaryotic cells [71,72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotic cells, this switch in function is likely to be due to translocation to the nucleus where these functions take place, possibly through post-translational modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation [70,73,74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>It is possible that, as in eukaryotic cells, post-translational modifications may also affect localization and function of LDH in M. hyopneumoniae, or direct a subset towards processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Intact LDH was identified from spots on two-dimensional gels between pI of 5.7 and 7.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>With a theoretical pI of 7.63, this indicates an acidic shift is likely to be caused by a variable degree of post-translational modification such as deamidation affecting a proportion of LDH [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>LDH has also been identified from extracellular supernatants of various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species from the honeybee Apis mellifera [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>These lactic acid bacteria belong to the Firmicutes, and are genetically similar to the low G + C content mycoplasma species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that LDH, once localized to the surface, could evolve alternative functions as a moonlighting protein, functioning as an auxiliary adhesin [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we have also previously identified a glutamyl aminopeptidase from M. hyopneumoniae, MHJ_0125, which moonlights as a multifunctional adhesin at the cell surface [77], and a leucyl aminopeptidase, MHJ_0461, which functions as a multi-substrate peptidase and binds heparin, plasminogen and foreign DNA [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>The cleavage fragments of LDH identified here bound to heparin, used as a structural mimic for glycosaminoglycans in the respiratory tract, and the N-terminal fragment also bound to fibronectin, an extracellular matrix component, indicating fragments may also have adhesin functions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>We identified 347 (52%) of the 672 putative ORFs predicted from the genome sequence of M. hyopneumoniae strain J. The proteome coverage from well-resolved two-dimensional gels, while low, is unsurprising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The limitations of two-dimensional gels are well documented, particularly considering the nature of sample preparation required, which limits the ability to retain and resolve very basic, acidic, small, large or hydrophobic proteins [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>However, protein-centric, gel-based separations provide a technique complimentary to high-throughput two-dimensional LC–MS/MS protocols by maintaining mass and pI context, allowing the identification of cleavage products and the extent of proteolytic processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>We show for the first time that proteins with canonical functions in the cytosol that moonlight on the cell surface are also targets of endoproteolytic events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>This describes a new dimension to protein moonlighting and suggests that much more biological information is inherent in proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>While we cannot yet determine the exact nature of cleavage events as they occur in vivo, the analysis presented here is an important first step in determining physiologically relevant cleavage events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Cleavage events will undoubtedly complicate efforts to correlate the transcriptome with the proteome in future studies [78,79], and the protein-centric approaches presented here will provide a solid foundation for further investigation of post-translational processing in proteins involved in pathogenesis of M. hyopneumoniae, and will assist with delineating functionally important binding motifs. </plain></SENT>
