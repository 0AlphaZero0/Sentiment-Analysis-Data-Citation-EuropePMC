</text></SecTag></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hereditary ataxias and hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders.1–3 The predominant feature of HSPs is progressive lower limb spasticity and weakness caused by the degeneration of corticospinal tracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSPs are often associated with additional neurological and systemic features such as cognitive impairment, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and hematologic and skin abnormalities; these HSP syndromes are referred to as complicated HSP.2,3 Because of more than 70 genetic loci, it is quite problematic to make a correct diagnosis of a particular genetic form of HSP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In particular, the combined presence of pyramidal features and ataxia, so-called spastic-ataxic syndromes, is troublesome for the differential diagnosis.4 Many clinicians often struggle to decide whether the patient has a hereditary ataxia with pyramidal tract signs or HSP with cerebellar ataxia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a family with spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) showing the phenotype of a nearly pure cerebellar ataxia with less predominant spasticity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This family had been followed as a certain subtype of hereditary ataxias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a homozygous p.R398X mutation in SPG7 in this family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of the p.R398X mutation in SPG7 in the Japanese population and this family is the second published one with SPG7 in Japan.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proband (case 1) was a 74-year-old man with hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>His parents were reported not to be consanguineous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>His mother and father died at age 42 and 80, respectively, and they were free of neurological symptoms in their lifetime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At age 32, the proband began to note staggering upon walking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>He developed a hand tremor during writing and dysarthria at age 41 and then pollakiuria at age 45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When he first visited a neurology clinic at age 47, he presented with dysarthria, limb ataxia, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes without extensor planter responses and ataxic gait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Head computed tomography revealed a mild cerebellar hemispheric atrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>His condition was diagnosed as spinocerebellar degeneration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, his ataxic gait progressed slowly, and he became wheelchair bound at age 52. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>At his latest visit at age 74, his mini-mental state examination score was 30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>He had no optic nerve atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus or blepharoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The deep tendon reflexes were increased in all four limbs, but Babinski sign was not elicited bilaterally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Neither ankle nor knee clonus was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>He had no involuntary movements, rigidity or bradykinesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Truncal and limb ataxia appeared exacerbated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>He showed a marked staggering and could not walk without holding on to something. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>His scores on Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia and International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale were 23 and 58, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>He complained of pollakiuria and urinary incontinence but not of constipation or orthostatic hypotension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of sensory disturbance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>His condition was still consistent with cerebellar ataxia associated with urinary disturbance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A nerve conduction study revealed no signs of neuropathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed an atrophy in the cerebellar hemisphere but not in the brainstem, corpus callosum or cerebrum (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The younger brother of the proband (case 2) first noticed gait disturbance with a feeling of shaking knees at age 50. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>At age 51, he developed dysarthria and urinary dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination at age 52 showed ataxic dysarthria, exaggerated patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes without Babinski signs and lower limb ataxia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>His gait was wide-based and staggering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>He started to complain of a sense of stiffness in the lower limbs at age 55. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>His gait disturbance gradually worsened, and he became dependent on a cane at age 66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>At his latest visit at age 71, his mini-mental state examination score was 29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>There was no optic nerve atrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>He showed a limitation in horizontal eye movement, but no blepharoptosis or nystagmus was noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Ataxic dysarthria was evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>His deep tendon reflexes were normal in the upper limbs but enhanced in the lower limbs, and Babinski sign was positive bilaterally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Extrapyramidal signs were not noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>His gait was wide-based, staggering and spastic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>His scores of Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia and International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale were 20 and 41, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>He experienced pollakiuria but neither constipation nor orthostatic hypotension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>He showed no signs of sensory disturbance, and a nerve conduction study was not particular. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>He had a slight talipes equinovarus deformity bilaterally. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>His brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were essentially the same as his elder brother (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The elder sister of the proband (case 3) was reported to develop gait disturbance at age 50. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed with spinocerebellar degeneration, but the clinical details were not available because she died prior to this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Based on the positive family history and the clinical and neuroradiological findings, these patients were suspected as having a certain subtype of hereditary ataxias, although the family history was not fully informative on whether the mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant or recessive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>After obtaining informed consents from cases 1 and 2, we performed genetic testing; autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias including SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA12, SCA17, DRPLA and SCA31 were ruled out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Then, WES was performed for case 1 as previously described.6 Briefly, genomic DNA was captured by using a SureSelect Human All Exon v5 kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and sequenced on a HiSeq2000 with 101 bp paired-end reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Image analysis and base calling were performed by sequence control software real-time analysis and CASAVA software v1.8 (Illumina). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The reads were aligned to GRCh37 with Novoalign (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.novocraft.com/">http://www.novocraft.com/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>PCR duplicates were removed using Picard (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">http://picard.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Variants were called by the Genome Analysis Toolkit (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/">http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/</ext-link>) and annotated by using ANNOVAR (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/">http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/</ext-link>) after excluding the common variants registered in the common dbSNP135 database (minor allele frequency ⩾0.01). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The WES mean depth of coverage against the RefSeq coding sequence was 71.8x, and 86.7% of the total coding sequence bases were covered by 20 reads or more. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We obtained a rare protein-altering and splice-site variant calls after filtering against 575 in-house control exomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>WES revealed a homozygous c.1,192C&gt;T/p.R398X mutation in SPG7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This mutation was not detected in 575 control exomes, supporting that the carrier frequency of this mutation is quite rare in the Japanese population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Sanger sequencing strongly supported that both patients were homozygotes for this mutation (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>More precisely, however, the possibility could not be completely ruled out that the patients were compound heterozygotes of the p.R398X mutation and an unidentified large deletion involving SPG7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>SPG7 encodes paraplegin, a 795-amino acid protein that is a subunit of the m-AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protease.7,8 The m-AAA protease, which is composed of paraplegin and AFG3L2, is involved in protein quality control in the mitochondrial inner membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>It is very likely that the p.R398X mutation causes nonsense-mediated RNA decay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The truncated protein, even if it is present, might result in drastic structural and functional defects of the complex because the truncation occurs in the AAA domain of paraplegin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>SPG7 usually manifests as complicated HSP syndrome and is frequently associated with cerebellar ataxia.2,3,9 Both affected individuals (cases 1 and 2) presented with a marked cerebellar ataxia with less prominent spasticity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>They did not show any cognitive impairment, optic atrophy or peripheral neuropathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>It is quite difficult to make a correct diagnosis for a particular subtype of ARCAs or autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in the case of a predominant cerebellar phenotype of adult onset without extracerebellar or non-central nervous system symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Our cases were roughly included in this category, and therefore, we conducted WES analysis and reached a final diagnosis of SPG7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Our cases indicate that SPG7 can manifest as a nearly pure cerebellar ataxia phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Both patients complained of urinary frequency, but detailed urodynamic studies were not performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively, bladder dysfunction might be suggestive of SPG7 because approximately half of the patients (22/42) exhibited bladder dysfunction in a large Dutch cohort including 60 SPG7 patients.10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>One report described a sporadic SPG7 patient who was a compound heterozygote of the p.R398X/p.A510V mutation in SPG7, which is the most common SPG7 mutation in Caucasian countries.11 He demonstrated cerebellar ataxia, but the brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>In a large Dutch cohort described above, cerebellar ataxia was observed in 57% (27/47) of the patients.10 The authors suggested that the cerebellar phenotype of SPG7 might be correlated with SPG7 null alleles.10 Our observation is consistent with this speculation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we report here that SPG7 can present with the predominant cerebellar phenotype masquerading as SCA6 or cortical cerebellar atrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In Japan, the prevalence of SPG7 is considered very rare,12 but it needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of hereditary spastic-ataxic syndromes, even if the cerebellar signs are much more predominant than the pyramidal tract signs. </plain></SENT>
