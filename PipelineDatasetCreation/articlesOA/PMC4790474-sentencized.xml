</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Plant biomass is routinely utilized in diverse agro-industrial sectors such as pulp and paper, forage, bio-manufacturing and bioenergy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among several sustainable energy strategies, the conversion of plant cell walls into fermentable sugars offers the possibility for microbial production of bio-based products including materials (e.g. biopolymers), commodity chemicals, fine and specialty chemicals, and liquid fuels (Vickers et al. 2012, George et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Lignin is a hydrophobic polymer that permeates plant cell walls and impedes the biochemical processes used for plant biomass conversion into fermentable sugars (Zeng et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Lignin from ferns and gymnosperms contains p-hydroxyphenyl (H) and guaiacyl (G) units derived from p-coumaroyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol, respectively; and lignin from certain lycophytes and angiosperms additionally contains syringyl (S) units (Boerjan et al. 2003, Weng et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These lignin monomers (or monolignols) are synthesized from phenylalanine in the cytosol and exported to the cell wall for oxidative polymerization (Boerjan et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In the lignin pathway, the metabolic entry point responsible for the production of both coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols involves hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), which catalyzes the coupling of p-coumaroyl-CoA with shikimate to produce p-coumaroyl shikimate (Fig. 1) (Hoffman et al. 2003, Hoffman et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Following this step, the hydroxycinnamoyl moiety of p-coumaroyl shikimate is hydroxylated by p-coumaroyl shikimate 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H) to produce caffeoyl shikimate which is then transesterified by HCT to release caffeoyl-CoA, or, as recently described in Arabidopsis, cleaved by caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE) to release caffeate (Fig. 1) (Franke et al. 2002, Vanholme et al. 2013a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Reduction of HCT activity limits the synthesis of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols and causes a backlog of upstream metabolites, which leads to a redirection of part of the metabolic flux of p-coumaroyl-CoA into p-coumaryl alcohol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the lignin from plants exhibiting strong HCT down-regulation is enriched in H units and its content is heavily reduced due to the poor capacity of p-coumaroyl alcohol to incorporate the polymer (Hoffman et al. 2004, Vanholme et al. 2013b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Considering its central role in lignin biosynthesis, HCT has been a target in genetic engineering strategies for improving the commercial utility of plant biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, down-regulation of HCT expression reduces lignin content and improves forage digestibility and saccharification efficiency in alfalfa (Chen and Dixon 2007, Shadle et al. 2007).

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Dashed arrows represent the CSE-mediated esterification of caffeoyl shikimate as described in Arabidopsis (Vanholme et al. 2013a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>HCT belongs to the BAHD family of acyl-CoA-dependent transferases, which includes several enzymes that use hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs as a donor for the transfer reaction (D’Auria 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These transferases are capable of acylating a wide variety of acceptors, and some of them exhibit broad substrate flexibility (Landmann et al. 2011, Molina and Kosma 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For example, it is well known that some HCTs can use quinate as a substrate in addition to shikimate (Hoffman et al. 2003, Lallemand et al. 2012, Walker et al. 2013, Escamilla-Treviño et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Moreover, HCT from globe artichoke (CcHCT) was shown to accept 3-hydroxyanthranilate as a substrate (Moglia et al. 2010), and similar substrate promiscuity was described for HCT from Coleus blumei, which can also use 3-amino- and 3-hydroxybenzoates as acceptor substrates, forming both p-coumarate ester and amide conjugates (Sander and Petersen 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Although HCT is a well-conserved enzyme among land plants (Xu et al. 2009, Tohge et al. 2013), characterization of its substrate flexibility remains poorly described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, until now, it had yet to be tested whether the substrate promiscuity of HCT could be exploited for lignin engineering and improving plant biomass. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In this study, using a yeast expression system, we investigated the substrate promiscuity of HCT from a bryophyte (Physcomitrella patens), a lycophyte (Selaginella moellendorffii), a coniferous gymnosperm (Pinus radiata), a monocot angiosperm (Panicum virgatum) and two dicot angiosperms (Populus trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana) toward a series of benzene and benzoate derivatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Recombinant yeast strains that individually co-express these phylogenetically related HCTs with 4-coumarate-CoA ligase were capable of producing p-coumaroyl conjugates when fed with p-coumarate and shikimate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate (gentisate), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate), 3-aminobenzoate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, 5-hydroxyanthranilate, ortho-hydroxyphenol (catechol) and para-hydroxyphenol (hydroquinone). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Purified recombinant HCT from switchgrass showed activity towards these new ‘non-canonical’ substrates, which confirmed their capacity to bind the active site of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that in vitro formation of p-coumaroyl shikimate by either a switchgrass recombinant HCT (PvHCT2a) or an Arabidopsis stem protein extract is partially inhibited in the presence of the non-canonical acceptors, presumably via a mechanism of competitive inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Finally, we extended this characterization to in vivo inhibition assays by engineering Arabidopsis lines to overproduce one of these HCT-competitive inhibitors (protocatechuate) in lignifying tissues, and showed an approximately 30% reduction of lignin content, providing a significant improvement of biomass saccharification efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the potential of inhibiting HCT in various bioenergy crops by overproducing unusual HCT acceptors in planta. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The substrate promiscuity of HCT was observed in all the plant taxa we tested, and it appears to have been conserved since plants first appeared on land about 450 Ma ago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This novel approach could be particularly valuable to reduce lignin in crops for which genomic information is still unavailable. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>A HCT from the woody dicot poplar was also selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In particular, out of seven HCT genes found in the poplar genome, PtHCT1 and PtHCT6 have been associated with lignin biosynthesis because of their xylem-specific expression profile (Shi et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>PtHCT6 was selected for this study since it has higher catalytic efficiency towards coumaroyl-CoA (Wang et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For gymnosperms, we selected a HCT from pine (PrHCT) for which the silencing in cell cultures results in reduction of lignin content (Wagner et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using biochemically characterized hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA-dependent BAHD transferases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) and confirmed that AtHCT, PtHCT6, PvHCT2a and PrHCT belong to the same clade along with other characterized HCTs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In these in vivo assays, the different recombinant yeast strains were fed individually with p-coumarate in combination with shikimate (as a positive control) or one of the potential phenolic acceptors listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although P. patens contains orthologs of all the genes required for the synthesis of p-coumaryl and coniferyl alcohols (Xu et al. 2009), the presence of lignified tissues has never been demonstrated in this plant. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Although PpHCT1 falls into the clade of known HCTs in the phylogenetic tree of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA-dependent BAHD transferases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1)</ext-link>, it may instead be involved in the synthesis of alternative phenylpropanoid conjugates such as chlorogenic acid (3-O-caffeoylquinic acid) which has been identified in P. patens (Erxleben et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of HCT activity for an enzyme from Selaginella. However, its involvement in lignification remains questionable due to the presence in this plant of a dual meta-hydroxylase (SmF5H), which can by-pass the enzymatic steps catalyzed by C3′H and HCT (Weng et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>More generally, BAHD acyltransferases from Selaginella could have a role in the synthesis of phenolic esters other than p-coumaroyl shikimate (Weng and Noel 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Although the formation of p-coumaroyl shikimate occurs via an ester linkage between p-coumaroyl-CoA and shikimate, these HCTs can also catalyze the formation of p-coumaroyl conjugates via an amide bond, as exemplified with the use of 3-aminobenzoate as acceptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Both ester and amide linkages are possible for the formation of p-coumaroyl 3-hydroxyanthranilate and p-coumaroyl 5-hydroxyanthranilate, but only one product was observed in our assays when these acceptors were tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>For these two cases, an amide bond can be anticipated, as previously determined for the p-coumarate conjugate formed by CcHCT using 3-hydroxyanthranilate (Moglia et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In this work, the apparent Km value observed for PvHCT2a towards shikimate (∼700 µM) is comparable with the values observed for tobacco HCT (750 µM), which has been genetically implicated in lignin biosynthesis (Hoffmann et al. 2003), and for poplar HCT (895 µM; Kim et al. 2011), but higher than the values reported for HCT from coffee (75 µM; Lallemand et al. 2012), sorghum (153 µM; Walker et al. 2013) and Coleus blumei (332 µM; Sander and Petersen 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The slightly different structure of the new HCT acceptors described in this study could influence their binding to the active site of the enzyme and explain the higher apparent Km values of HCT for these substrates compared with shikimate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The catalytic mechanism of HCT has been elegantly described previously by Walker et al. (2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In their mutagenesis experiments using shikimate as a substrate, the mutant T384A-SbHCT (equivalent to Thr382 in PvHCT2a) showed only 9% of the enzyme activity compared with wild-type SbHCT (Walker et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that the loss of the C5 hydroxyl interaction with Thr382 in the PvHCT2a–p-coumaroyl-CoA–protocatechuate complex affected the effective binding of protocatechuate, thus engendering a similar effect to the T384A mutation in SbHCT on the turnover rate of the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This is most probably the reason why it was possible to capture crystallographically the substrate PvHCT2a–p-coumaryl-CoA–protocatechuate ternary complex, compared with the product state when shikimate was used in soaking experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to use the substrate promiscuity of HCT to reduce lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In this attempt, we generated Arabidopsis lines that overproduce protocatechuate, a non-canonical acceptor and competitive inhibitor of HCT in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The engineered plants accumulate approximatey 25-fold more protocatechuate than wild-type plants, and showed significant lignin reductions (31–37%) in biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transgenic lines expressing the pobA gene alone accumulated approximately 1.8-fold more protocatechuate than wild-type plants presumably from the conversion of the endogenous pool of p-hydroxybenzoate but showed no reduction of lignin content, suggesting that a threshold amount of protocatechuate is necessary to inhibit significantly HCT activity in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Since lignin is reduced in the protocatechuate-overproducing plants, either the amount of p-coumaroyl protocatechuate produced by HCT is too low to sustain lignin biosynthesis, or p-coumaroyl protocatechuate is not metabolized further in the lignin biosynthetic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is not known whether C3′H can hydroxylate p-coumaroyl protocatechuate, and whether CSE would cleave the putative resulting p-caffeoyl protocatechuate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Neither p-coumaroyl protocatechuate nor putative p-caffeoyl protocatechuate were detected in the metabolite extracts from ubiC-pobA transgenic plants, possibly because of their conjugation to other metabolites such as sugars, as was recently shown for other lignin oligomers (Dima et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Our dual transgene strategy consists of a two-step conversion of chorismate into protocatechuate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Steady-state levels of phenylalanine and salicylate, two metabolites derived from chorismate, are not significantly changed in the ubiC, pobA and ubiC-pobA transgenics compared with the wild type, suggesting that chorismate is not limiting in these lines, as previously hypothesized in the case of tobacco plants that express ubiC and show normal growth characteristics (Siebert et al. 1996, Viitanen et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the reduction of lignin observed only in the ubiC-pobA lines (and not in the ubiC single lines) is unlikely to be the consequence of phenylalanine depletion, although our data cannot rule out a possible slowing down of the metabolic flux. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>In addition, the height reduction observed in the ubiC-pobA lines at the mature stage is probably a consequence of lignin reduction rather than drastic changes in levels of salicylic acid, a metabolite whose overaccumulation in some transgenic plants often results in dwarf phenotypes (Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous studies of plants in which HCT activity was down-regulated, the lignin composition of our transgenic lines does not show any enrichment in H units, possibly due to a lower degree of inhibition of activity and the consumption of p-coumaroyl-CoA by HCT for the formation of both p-coumaroyl protocatechuate and p-coumaroyl shikimate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the increase of the S:G ratio in our transgenics, which results from the decrease of G units in favor of an increase in S units, is a lignin feature predicted by metabolic flux analysis in the case of HCT down-regulation, and was previously observed in plants affected in HCT activity (Chen and Dixon 2007, Ziebell et al. 2010, Vanholme et al, 2013b, Wang et al. 2014, Eudes et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of HCT transcript levels in the ubiC-pobA transgenic lines showed no major difference compared with the wild type (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S10</ext-link>), which is consistent with the hypothesis that protocatechuate affects the activity of HCT rather than its expression in the ubiC-pobA lines. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that very low amounts of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoates could be detected in our metabolite extracts from wild-type plants (∼10 nmol g–1 FW), whereas hydroxyanthranilates, 3-hydroxybenzoate and 3-aminobenzoate were below the detection limit, and, to our knowledge, have never been measured in plant extracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>With the exception of the occurrence of the phytoalexin p-coumaroyl 5-hydroxyanthranilate in oats (Collins 1989), p-coumaroyl conjugates of such phenolics have never been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Lastly, although catechol and hydroquinone are found in plants (Mageroy et al. 2012, Rychlińska and Nowak 2012), no corresponding p-coumaroyl esters have been described, maybe as a consequence of poor HCT activity towards these diphenols (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S6</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>HCT seems to have appeared at the same time that plants began colonizing land. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>It is unclear why such promiscuity has been retained, and this question will require further study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>However, a strategy of exploiting this substrate promiscuity of HCT offers a novel way to reduce lignin in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Because this enzymatic activity appears to be conserved among land plants, this strategy can be valuable to affect HCT activity in bioenergy crops for which no HCT gene has been cloned or for which multiple, functionally redundant copies are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In this respect, particular attention should be paid to the spatio-temporal activity of the transgene promoters employed for the overproduction of HCT alternative substrates to limit possible growth defects associated with lignin reduction as observed in this study using Arabidopsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Lastly, as we show here in the case of protocatechuate overproduction, such an approach has the potential to add value to plant biomass by increasing the amount of valuable metabolites utilized in the bio-based chemical industry (Linger et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
