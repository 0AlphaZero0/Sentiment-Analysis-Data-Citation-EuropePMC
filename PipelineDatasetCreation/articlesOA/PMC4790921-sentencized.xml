</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The development of molecular biology based detection methods led to the discovery of several new viruses among them a new parvovirus of pigs, namely porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Parvoviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, linear DNA genomes of approximately 5–6 kilobases (kb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>According to the current taxonomic classification (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp">http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp</ext-link>) Parvoviridae family is divided into two subfamilies: Densovirinae and Parvovirinae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Members of Densovirinae infect various arthropods, while viruses belonging to the Parvovirinae subfamily are detected in vertebrates and form eight distinct genera, including Tetraparvovirus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>PPV2 (proposed name Ungulate tetraparvovirus 3), a member of the Tetraparvovirus genus, was discovered in 2001 during a survey for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in swine sera collected in Myanmar [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The HEV-specific primers non-specifically amplified a DNA fragment, which later proved to be of parvovirus origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The amplification of nearly complete genetic material of the virus resulted a 5 kb long genome (H-1 virus, Myanmar-type PPV2), showing the highest similarity to Muscovy duck parvovirus and Bovine parvovirus 3 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of PPV2 appeared to be unique until many years later a genetically highly similar virus (Cnvirus) was detected in China [2] in blood samples collected between 2006–2007 from pigs affected by porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) associated disease (PCVAD) and "high fever" disease (caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PRRSV). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Genetic comparison of H-1 (Myanmar) and Cnvirus revealed approximately 95% identity [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Further studies indicated that PPV2 was presumably present worldwide as it was detected not only in Asia but also in Europe [4,5] and North America [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The report by Opriessnig et al. [7] showed that PCVAD affected pigs were infected with PPV2 with high prevalence and suggested a role of the virus as co-factor also in the porcine respiratory disease complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Attempts to propagate the virus in vitro failed so far therefore animal experiments to fulfill Koch's postulates and to study the pathogenicity of PPV2 are not yet possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In order to assess the possible pathogenic role of PPV2 without the use of animal experiments it is necessary to develop diagnostic methods for the in situ detection of the virus in tissue environment and also to detect and monitor the antibody response to PPV2 in context with the appearance of clinical signs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA method suitable for the detection of PPV2 specific antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Using this method we measured the specific humoral immune response against PPV2 in an infected swine herd and compared the antibody levels with the presence of the virus in serum samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Several new, emerging parvoviruses were discovered in pigs during the recent years [1,15–17] and according to the limited number of the reports these viruses are widespread in pig populations around the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Clarification of the pathogenic role of the new parvoviruses including PPV2 is still pending mainly due to the lack of reliable in vitro virus propagation techniques for experimental infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Swine herds are frequently infected not only with PPV2 but simultaneously also with one or more other pathogens like PCV2, PRRSV, SIV, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida and other microorganisms that hinder or make very difficult to clarify the pathogenicity of PPV2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Fortunately in situ detection methods and serological techniques at least in part may be of help to determine the importance of a PPV2 infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a serological method to examine the specific humoral immune response against PPV2 and determined the PPV2 specific antibody profile of on affected swine herd. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The potential GH loop of capsid proteins of both Myanmar-type and Cnvirus-type viruses were chosen because the GH loop forms a large part of the parvoviral capsid surface around the threefold axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Several important functions are localized in this region in different parvoviruses including tissue tropism, pathogenicity determining amino acids and most importantly antibody binding sites [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>According to our best knowledge, this is the first description of serological examination of this virus infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, the piglets suckling colostrum from their PPV2 positive sows and absorbing high amounts of specific antibodies have very good passive, maternal protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>On the second day of life PPV2 specific maternal antibody level is higher in piglets than in their corresponding mothers, but this protection decreases rapidly (Fig 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The increase of PPV2 specific antibody level starts after 28–36 days of age and calculating with the usual 7 to 10 days required for the primary immune response of B lymphocytes the estimated time of infection is suggested to be earlier than or between 21–36 days of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In the examined swine herd, respiratory signs were observed 2 to 3 weeks after weaning (around 42–49 days of age) and the animals recovered, by 57 days of age these clinical signs disappeared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Along with this, after 43 days of age a rapid rise of PPV2 specific antibody levels could be observed, resulting high amounts of antibodies in the 57 days old group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The serum samples were also tested for PCV2 and SIV specific antibodies (data not shown), but the rise of PCV2 specific antibodies was observed only after 120 days of age and increase of SIV specific antibodies was not detected in pigs before, at and over 57 days of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The examined swine herd was free of PRRSV, and the bacteriological examinations for common respiratory pathogens were also negative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that PPV2 may have played a role in the development of the respiratory signs around 40–50 days of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>This assumption is supported by the frequent detection of PPV2 in pigs exhibiting respiratory diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In a previous study in Hungary 10.5% of the examined lung samples were positive for PPV2 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In a Japanese swine herd, all of the 69 examined tonsil samples, collected from unhealthy 8 to 900 days old pigs were PPV2 positive [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In the USA the highest levels of PPV2 nucleic acid were present in lung samples originating from nursery and grow-finish pigs with a history of respiratory disease [8], covering the age of pigs where the respiratory clinical signs and PPV2 specific antibody rise were detected in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Based on a retrospective study PPV2 was present with high prevalence in archived North American lung samples from 1998 not only in PCVAD affected (33.3–55.6%) but also in PCV2 negative pigs (20%) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of viraemia in samples collected between 2006 and 2013 in North America was 27.3–41.4% in PCV2 positive and 33.3% in PCV2 negative sera [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Previously in China, PPV2 was identified in 9.66% of serum samples of PCV2 and PRRSV caused disease affected pigs 3 weeks prior the disease onset [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Similarly in the USA the peak of PPV2 viraemia was detected at 15 weeks of age, 2 weeks before the development of PCVAD [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In our study, low level of viraemia was detectable in every age group, but the peak was measured in 57 days old pigs (Table 2), earlier than in previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the antibodies produced by this age in increasing quantity and quality started to eliminate PPV2 from the blood stream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>After the initial IgM antibody production the immune response normally produces IgG antibodies of increasing affinity and larger quantity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The more specific antibodies produced in later phase of the immune response showed stronger reaction with the homologous Myanmar-type antigen then the heterologous Cnvirus-type antigen as confirmed by the statistical analysis (Table 3) and shown by the ELISA results obtained for different age groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>This relatively small difference however did not influence the usability of the heterologous antigen in the serological diagnostic test. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Taking into account the few studies about PPV2 the results of this study suggest a pathological role of PPV2 in respiratory disease of pigs, but to clarify the importance of this virus further, well designed studies including experimental infections are needed. </plain></SENT>
