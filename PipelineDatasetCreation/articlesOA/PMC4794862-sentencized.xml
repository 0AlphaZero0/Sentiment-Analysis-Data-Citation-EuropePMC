</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As feed can account for up to 75 % of the variable costs in beef cattle production systems [1, 2], any means by which these costs may be reduced without compromising overall feed efficiency or animal performance would be of benefit to the beef industry worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Compensatory growth (CG) is defined as a physiological process whereby an animal has the potential, following a period of restricted feed intake, to undergo accelerated growth upon re-alimentation [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The CG phenomenon is commonly utilised by cattle producers to reduce the overwintering costs of beef cattle [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, despite extensive utilisation by producers, there is little understanding of the biological and molecular mechanisms regulating the exaggerated growth phenotype typically observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although typically attributing to between 1 and 1.3 % of body-weight, the liver is a major metabolic organ, accounting for on average, 24 % of whole body energy use [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The energy requirement arises from activities associated with absorption and transportation of nutrients for subsequent use by other tissues and also a large portion of this energy is used for the maintenance of tissue integrity and mass [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the size of the liver have been shown to be directly proportional to dietary intake [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Indeed previous work, including our own data, has shown a reduction in the weight and metabolic activity of this organ during dietary restriction, which facilitates efficient coping with restricted nutrient availability, primarily through a reduction in its basal metabolic rate [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is thought that this reduced metabolic rate may continue into the initial stages of re-alimentation and thus facilitate the CG process [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>During subsequent re-alimentation induced CG, the liver has been shown to be one of the most responsive tissues to re-alimentation, compensating ahead of other organs and tissues in the body [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Indeed liver tissue of the compensating animals in the current study were found to have achieved 100 % recovery following 55 days of re-alimentation, whereas overall body-weight CG index for animals undergoing CG during the same time was only 48 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A previous microarray based examination of hepatic gene expression during feed restriction, followed by early phase re-alimentation of cattle, has been reported by Connor et al. [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The authors noted alterations in the expression of genes associated with cellular division and mitochondrial function during early CG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Next generation RNAseq technology has distinct advantages over microarray technology, including sensitive unbiased detection of all expressed genes without the requirement to generate an array of probes based on known sequence as well as having a much greater dynamic range [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous work from our own group using hepatic tissue comparing both microarray and RNAseq datasets pertaining to the same biological samples identified a greater number of DEGs through utilisation of next generation sequencing technology [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the study of Connor et al. [14] differential expression of genes was evaluated within the first 2 weeks of re-alimentation, which potentially may have been too early to identify genes associated with more sustained and lasting CG as genes identified as differentially expressed by Connor et al. [14] may have reflected latent effects of the previous dietary restriction phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore the objective of the current study was to examine the differential expression of hepatic genes in cattle following an industry typical period of restricted feeding (125 days) and subsequent CG using RNAseq technology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The liver was chosen as a target tissue of interest, as it is a highly metabolic organ and is clearly physically affected by restricted feeding and subsequent re-alimentation induced CG [9, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Our efforts during re-alimentation were focussed within the first 60 days as this is the period where the greatest increment of overall body CG is typically observed [3]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The phenomenon of CG following a period of restricted feeding has been associated with an improved efficiency and utilisation of feed, most notably through greater overall gain in body-weight for a given level of feed intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Indeed this was observed in the animals used in the current study, whereby animals undergoing CG were more feed efficient [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Several studies have investigated the physiological control of restricted feeding and CG [9–13, 24–28] however, understanding of the molecular control of CG still remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This is important as genes contributing to the phenomenon may represent putative biological markers for improved growth and feed efficiency potential in cattle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The liver was chosen as a target tissue of interest, as it is a highly metabolic organ and is clearly physically affected by restricted feeding and subsequent re-alimentation [9, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Indeed liver tissue of the compensating animals in the current study were found to have achieved 100 % recovery following 55 days of re-alimentation, whereas overall body-weight and carcass CG indexs [3] for RES animals were 48 and 32 % respectively, during the same time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec16"><title><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Metabolism and nutrient transporters </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>As the liver is the central organ responsible for intermediary metabolism within the body [29], it is not surprising that a reduction in dietary intake would incur a reduction in its size and metabolic activity [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Following digestion of food, the chemical constituents of the feed are transferred to the liver from the small intestine where they are further metabolised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The liver can subsequently orchestrate flux and inter-conversion of nutrients and metabolites to support the changes in demand and supply of nutrients during periods of restrictive feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This may be controlled through alterations in gene expression, enzyme activities and the resultant nutrient fluxes which are essential for optimal liver function and nutrient inter-conversion [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as a highly metabolic organ, the liver has a substantial basal energy demand, responsible for between 18 and 25 % of the total oxygen consumption in cattle [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In order to utilise energy more effectively and efficiently during restricted feeding, the liver has the capacity to regulate its size and metabolic activity so as to reduce energy requirements during times of limited nutrient availability [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Indeed we and others have shown that liver size is reduced during periods of restricted feeding [9, 11, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the current study we observed genes associated with amino acid, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism to be differentially expressed, with a large number of these genes down-regulated following a period of dietary restriction at the end of Period 1 (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Following 55 days of re-alimentation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolic processes were significantly affected by re-alimentation, with the majority of DEGs involved in both lipid and carbohydrate metabolism up-regulated in RES compared with ADLIB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>These results indicate an acquired greater capacity for hepatic metabolic processes during CG, which is not surprising given the documented greater feed intake per unit of bodyweight during re-alimentation which was evident in the animals used in the current study as outlined by Keogh et al. [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Burrin et al. [33] observed that metabolic processes associated with dietary energy intake were enhanced during CG in sheep. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This was particularly evident in that study through a comparison of liver energy consumption in rams undergoing either maintenance (22 % energy consumption of whole body energy use) or CG (41 % energy consumption of whole body energy use). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>This lower nutrient requirement of the liver to process nutrients was evidenced in the current study through down-regulation in the expression of a number of nutrient transporter genes in animals following feed restriction compared with their ad libitum fed contemporaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Nutrient flux through the plasma membrane is facilitated by nutrient transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>These trans-membrane proteins are substrate specific and are differentially expressed between different tissues to aid in the partitioning of nutrients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Following a period of feed restriction, genes associated with the transport of nutrients such as lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates as well as mineral transporters were differentially expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>All DEGs related to nutrient transport displayed reduced expression at the end of Period 1 in RES animals compared with ADLIB animals, with the exception of SLC38A2 and SLC6A14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Expression of SLC6A14 has previously been shown to be up-regulated in the duodenal epithelia of cows which displayed greater feed and production efficiencies [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>A reduction in hepatic expression of nutrient transporters following restricted feed intake has also been observed in chickens [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Additionally, alterations in solute carrier transporters was observed in dairy cows during negative energy balance, a period of time after calving when energy consumption is typically less than requirements [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Amino acid, sugar and mineral transporters were down regulated due to alterations in energy partitioning during the early post-partum period in that study, reinforcing the role of transporters in energy partitioning in highly metabolic organs such as in the liver. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We observed a number of growth and proliferative genes to be differentially expressed between feed restricted and non-restricted animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Of note, all of these genes had lower transcript abundance in the feed restricted animals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Signalling processes involved in cellular proliferation and growth such as the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinases DYRK1A and DYRK1B [39] and PI3-kinase signalling including PIK3C2G [40] all had reduced expression at the end of a period of restricted feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The TGF-beta superfamily is involved in many cellular processes including cell growth and differentiation [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>A gene which codes for the beta C chain of inhibin (INHBC), which is a member of this superfamily, displayed reduced expression in the feed restricted animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Additionally, there was up-regulation of genes associated with the inhibition of cellular proliferation, including: MANF and ID2. A previous examination of liver gene expression using microarray technology also showed alterations in genes associated with cellular growth and proliferation in hepatic tissue of steers following restricted feeding [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, there was no consistency in the specific genes identified between the two studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This may be due to differences in experimental design between the two studies in addition to utilising varying technologies, or alternatively, it may be due to sampling tissue at different time points, or stringency in data analysis, ultimately confounding comparison of the outcomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>One gene in particular SPARC, which codes for a cysteine-rich acidic matrix-associated protein, was up-regulated in both hepatic tissue studies, during the initial stages of accelerated growth [14] and also following 55 days of re-alimentation in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This gene appears to regulate cell growth through interactions with the extracellular matrix and cytokines [42]. SPARC may be a potential genomic target for enhanced CG or improved feed efficiency potential in cattle particularly as it was differentially expressed during both the initiation of re-alimentation [14] and also during more sustained CG in the current study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Continued increased expression of cellular proliferation genes by 55 days into the re-alimentation period was somewhat unexpected as by then, at least on a weight recovery basis, the liver appeared to have compensated fully (displayed a 100 % weight recovery index). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, as only 2 genes associated with proliferation and growth were up-regulated by day 55 of re-alimentation compared with a larger number observed earlier into re-alimentation in other studies [14], this suggests that the accelerated growth of this organ had declined by day 55 of re-alimentation which is consistent with overall recovery of this tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>However, it must be noted that although no difference was apparent in the weight of the liver between treatment groups at the end of Period 2, a return to equal mass of the liver may not reflect a return to equal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Thus, further evaluations on the functional control of hepatic tissue during CG is warranted. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Genes coding for proteins important to the G1/S transition of the cell cycle were also down regulated in RES animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>For example, NEK9, which is a regulator of mitotic progression, participating in the control of spindle dynamics and chromosome separation [43] was down regulated in RES animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CDC7 which encodes a cell division cycle protein with kinase activity that phosphorylates critical substrates regulating the G1/S phase transition [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Down regulation of genes involved in the G1/S transition occurred in parallel with up regulation of GADD45GIP1- a nuclear-localised protein that may be induced by p53 and regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting G1 to S phase progression [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The encoded protein acts as a negative regulator of G1 to S phase progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Genes coding for structural components of the cell cycle were also affected by the feed restriction regimen employed here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>For example, NUF2 which codes for a component of the essential kinetochore-associated NDC80 complex, which is required for chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint activity was down regulated in the restricted animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The protein encoded by this gene is required for kinetochore integrity and the organisation of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The effect of restricted feeding on hepatic cell cycle progression was further established through up-regulation of genes associated with cell cycle inhibition including, DDIT3 and LZTS2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>DDIT3, a transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [47], was up regulated in feed restricted animals at the end of Period 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Differences in cell cycle genes followed a similar pattern to those involved in cellular proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In particular, with respect to the up regulation of proliferative genes 55 days into re-alimentation, where DDIT3, was subsequently down regulated in animals undergoing CG. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Cyclins are a family of proteins that control the progression of the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase enzymes [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G2 (CCNG2), cyclin-dependent kinase 11a (CDK11A), cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CKS2) and a cyclin regulatory subunit (CDK12) were all down regulated in restricted animals following 125 days of feed restriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Additionally, CABLES1, which encodes a protein involved in regulating the cell cycle through interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases was also down-regulated in RES animals at the end of Period 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Down regulation of these cell cycle progression genes further implies less cell cycle division and replication taking place in hepatic tissue of the restricted animals compared with the ad libitum fed control animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>However, CCDN3 which forms a complex with, and functions as a regulatory subunit of cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6, whose activity is required for the G1/S cell cycle transition, was in fact up-regulated in animals following a period of restricted feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that the GADD45GIP1 gene was in fact expressed in order to cause a disruption to the G1/S phase transition in the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Indeed inhibitors of cyclin activity were identified as differentially expressed following a period of restricted feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Proteins encoded by CDK2AP1 and CDK2AP2 are both thought to function as negative regulators of cyclin dependent kinase 2, during S phase of the cell cycle [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Similarly, CDKN1B which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was also up regulated in animals fed a restricted diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The encoded protein binds to and prevents the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 or cyclin D-CDK4 complexes and thus controls the cell cycle progression at G1 and is ultimately involved in G1 arrest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Overall, it is apparent that the documented difference in liver weight and volume at the end of a restricted feeding regimen may have been due to a reduction in the occurrence of hepatic cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>As only one gene associated with cell division was differentially expressed 55 days into re-alimentation, together with the observed full recovery of liver weight, suggests that most, if not all, of hepatic tissue compensation had occurred at this time. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This was also evident through KEGG pathway analysis, where at the end of Period 1, the ribosome was identified as the second most significantly over-represented pathway (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The ribosome is a large and complex molecular machine that serves as the primary site of biological protein synthesis [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This organelle works to link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA molecules and consists of two components, the small ribosomal subunit (40S) which reads the RNA, and the large subunit (60S) which joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chain [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>During differential feeding in Period 1, 28 genes coding for components of the ribosomal 40S subunit and 35 genes of the 60S ribosome were all up-regulated (Additional file 1: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Greater expression of these genes in Period 1 coincided with greater expression of a number of genes involved in amino acid synthesis and protein processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a number of tRNA (transfer RNA) genes were also up regulated following a period of restricted feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Amino acids are selected, collected and carried to the ribosome by tRNA, which enter the ribosome and bind to the mRNA chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Increased protein synthesis has been documented previously in rodents when examining the effect of feed restriction on ageing properties [51–53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Greater expression of genes related to protein synthesis in RES animals suggests a greater efficiency and utilisation of diet derived nutrients in hepatic tissue in these animals during dietary restriction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>A greater degree of protein deposition occurs within the body during the initial stages of CG [54–56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This is thought to act through a necessity to increase the metabolic capacity of organs such as the liver and gastrointestinal tract in order to be able to process the greater quantities of nutrients available during re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>There is potential, given the up-regulation of hepatic genes associated with protein synthesis during restricted feeding, that this may continue on into the re-alimentation period and ultimately contribute to the occurrence of CG through repletion of metabolically important tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In their examination of hepatic DEGs, Connor et al. [14] observed up-regulation of ribosomal genes on the first day of re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Of the ribosomal genes identified in that study, 19 genes coding for subunits of the large ribosome, whilst 15 encoded subunits of the small 40S subunit were up-regulated in animals undergoing CG on the first day of re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In our own study we identified 14 60S ribosomal genes which were in agreement with the findings of Connor et al. [14], whilst 14 40S ribosomal genes were also common between the two studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>By day 55 of re-alimentation, only one ribosomal gene, RPS27, was differentially expressed between RES and ADLIB animals and this was down-regulated in RES. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Taken together with evidence presented earlier, it is appropriate to suggest that hepatic compensation was complete at this stage of re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>When metabolically important tissues have been restored fully, there is an apparent increase in adipose deposition as opposed to protein tissue deposition [55, 57–59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>An indication towards an increase in adipose deposition occurring during CG was obtained through up-regulation of genes involved in adipose deposition including FADS1 and SREBF1on day 55 of re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>These results potentially indicate an increase in adipose deposition together with a decrease in protein deposition in hepatic tissue coinciding with a decrease in overall body growth rate at the end of Period 2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as CG is associated with an improvement in feed efficiency, differentially expressed genes identified in this study may contribute to breeding protocols for the selection of animals with improved feed efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>An examination of the findings of both the current study and those of Connor et al.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>During dietary restriction evidence of reduced metabolic activity of the liver was apparent through less mRNA abundance of nutrient transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Additionally, through an examination of differential transcript abundance we observed evidence for a reduction in cell cycle processes as well as a reduction in cellular proliferation and growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>For both processes this was manifested as a down-regulation in the expression of promoter genes coincident with an increase in transcripts coding for inhibitor proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Our data also suggests that an increased capacity for protein synthesis following feed restriction may sustain into CG in re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>This may then allow for the preferential deposition of protein ahead of adipose deposition in order to aid in the recovery of metabolically active organs such as the liver and gastrointestinal tract, which are required to facilitate the increased feed intake and nutrient availability associated with re-alimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Our results further suggest that hepatic protein synthesis may have subsided by 55 days into re-alimentation, in favour of adipose deposition and may signal full hepatic tissue recovery at that stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In the context of the current study, 55 days into re-alimentation may have been too late to identify large differences in pathways and genes regulating CG, as although an overall body compensatory index of only 48 % was achieved in this time, the liver had fully recovered by day 55. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Potentially sampling hepatic tissue earlier into re-alimentation for example following 1 month of re-alimentation may yield further information on the underlying biological control regulating the expression of CG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>However, genes differentially expressed by day 55 in the current study may represent a more sustained or prolonged CG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>It must be noted, however, that a return to equal mass of the liver following 55 days of re-alimentation and CG may not reflect a return to equal function, thus, further evaluations on the functional control of hepatic tissue during CG is warranted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The new knowledge generated in this study offer further insights into some of the molecular processes underlying restricted and CG in cattle. </plain></SENT>
