</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In humans, primordial germ cells (PGCs) originate outside the gonadal primordia, in the posterior part of the yolk sac, close to the allantois and hindgut wall and undergo a phase of proliferation and migration towards the gonadal ridge (Byskov, 1986; Mollgard et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Normally, these PGCs reach gonadal primordia around week 7 of gestation (W7, or week 5 post conception) to become enclosed in either seminiferous tubules or ovarian cords, respectively in male and female embryos (Heeren et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, some PGCs in humans may stop migrating along the way to the gonads (Mamsen et al., 2012) or become lodged in extragonadal organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most obvious ectopic organ to lodge PGCs would be the adrenal glands (or adrenals). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This is because the somatic gonad and adrenal cortex, both steroid-producing organs, have a common somatic origin and both organs are colonized by migratory neural crest cells (Keegan and Hammer, 2002; Mollgard et al., 2010; Morohashi, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In mice and bovine, ectopic germ cells have been described in the adrenal glands (Upadhyay and Zamboni, 1982; Wrobel and Suss, 1999; Zamboni and Upadhyay, 1983). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Ectopic germ cells present along the migratory pathway are most of the times eliminated by apoptosis (Runyan et al., 2008; Stallock et al., 2003), however, when lodged in the adrenal glands some of these ectopic germ cells survive and are able to undergo meiosis to become oocytes in both females and males (Upadhyay and Zamboni, 1982; Zamboni and Upadhyay, 1983). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the adrenal glands may provide a microenvironment that induces (or allows) germ cells to undergo a female sex differentiation pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these adrenal ‘oocytes’ seem to develop synchronous with gonadal ‘oocytes’ regarding growth, meiotic entry and they even develop a zona pellucida (Zamboni and Upadhyay, 1983), in agreement with the current view of a default female pathway in the urogenital region, initiated by exposure to retinoic acid (RA) and blocked in the male gonad by local degradation of RA or related metabolites (Bowles et al., 2006; Koubova et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In different animal models, PGCs follow different ‘routes’ to reach the gonads, including the gut and abdominal mesentery in mice (Starz-Gaiano and Lehmann, 2001) or the vasculature in chicken (De Melo Bernardo et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has been suggested that in humans, PGCs may migrate along the peripheral nervous system (Mamsen et al., 2012; Mollgard et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic nerve fibers were also found in the adrenal glands and indeed human ectopic PGCs could enter the adrenal glands via these fibers (Mamsen et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here, we have investigated the presence of ectopic human germ cells in the adrenals during human development (from W8.4 until W22) and investigated how these ectopic germ cells developed by comparing the dynamics of expression of early, late and meiotic germ cell markers between the adrenal and the gonadal germ cells. ‘Adrenal’ germ cells seem to upregulate the late marker DDX4, but we were unable to observe ‘adrenal’ germ cells entering meiosis until W22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, we show that meiotic entry in human female gonads is an asynchronous process that is still taking place after W22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We discuss possible ways of how the human germ cells reach the adrenals and on the fate of those ‘adrenal’ germ cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To understand whether these ‘adrenal’ germ cells were entering meiosis, we used immunofluorescence for DDX4 and either (phosphorylated) H2AFX, a marker associated with DNA double-strand breaks both during meiosis entry, but also apoptosis (Hunter et al., 2001; Ismail and Hendzel, 2008; Rogakou et al., 1999) or SYCP3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Both in female and male first trimester adrenals, DDX4+ germ cells were never positive for H2AFX (Fig. 2C,D; Fig. S1) or SYCP3 (Fig. S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, many H2AFX+ cells were observed in the adrenals and could correspond to adrenal cells undergoing apoptosis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Neural crest derivatives, marked by class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3), have been described to guide human PGCs towards the gonadal primordia (Mamsen et al., 2012; Mollgard et al., 2010) and perhaps inadvertently to other organs, including the adrenals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s3a"><title><text><SENT sid="123" pm="?"><plain>How do the human germ cells end up in the adrenals? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>We observed that ‘ovarian’ and ‘adrenal’ POU5F1+ germ cells expressed TUBB3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>As these germ cells are still phenotypically immature, expression of TUBB3 is a reminiscence of the migratory phase of germ cells and a common characteristic with neural crest derivatives (Mamsen et al., 2012; Mollgard et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Whether germ cells only share this characteristic with neural crest cell derivatives or effectively depend on structural support provided by neural crest derivatives to colonize the gonadal ridge (or the adrenals) remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>We could envisage that neural crest cells and PGCs could use (partly) common migratory routes, share common markers, or respond to similar chemo-attractant cues to colonize both the adrenal and genital primordia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation to the presence of germ cells in the adrenals is the common origin of the human gonadal primordia and adrenal primordia, both initially expressing high levels of DAX1 (also known as NR0B1) and SF1 (also known as NR5A1) (Hanley et al., 1999, 2001; Morohashi, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The colonization by the PGCs, at least in rats, is shown to occur before the physical separation of gonadal and adrenal primordia (Hatano et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>It is feasible that in humans this also occurs and that some germ cells reach the adrenal primordia and remain there after the two organs separate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><text><SENT sid="131" pm="?"><plain>Do human ‘adrenal’ germ cells enter meiosis synchronously with ‘ovarian’ germ cells? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In mice, the meiotic wave (described from anterior to posterior) in females is of relatively short duration (from E11.5 to E12.5) and gametogenesis during mice embryonic development is further a rather synchronous process (Bowles and Koopman, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the process of gametogenesis from PGCs to primordial follicle in female human germ cells is strongly asynchronous and clearly spatially regulated (Anderson et al., 2007; Heeren et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that in humans the time window for the start of meiosis in females is less defined than in mouse and we did not observe robust meiotic entry (by SYCP3) at least until W17 in ovaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, even at W21.5 in the female gonads there was still a large population of germ cells that had not entered meiosis, particularly in the periphery of the ovary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to investigate the fate of these peripheral POU5F1+ germ cells at later developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>They may perhaps still enter meiosis or alternatively they may have missed the time window to do so and enter apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In any case, due to the asynchrony of meiotic entry it is difficult to predict when the expression of the meiotic markers should be expected to occur in the ‘adrenal’ germ cells in humans and we cannot exclude the possibility that ‘adrenal’ germ cells enter meiosis after W22. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><text><SENT sid="139" pm="?"><plain>What happens to human ‘adrenal’ germ cells? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Ectopic human KIT+ and POU5F1+ germ cells have been described in the abdomen from W4 to W16 in the developing peripheral nervous system (Mamsen et al., 2012; Mollgard et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that ectopic germ cells at E15.5 in mice seem to be present in the adrenals, but also at other locations on their migratory path. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In humans, although the number of adrenals analyzed was limited, ‘adrenal’ germ cells seemed to be able to downregulate POU5F1 and upregulate DDX4, as in the ovary, but were unable to enter meiosis at least until W21.5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The ‘adrenal’ POU5F1 and/or DDX4 germ cells were not apoptotic (TUNEL-positive). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether during further development, those germ cells remain in the adrenal or lose their germ cell identity by downregulating POU5F1 and DDX4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Ectopic germ cells are thought to give rise to extragonadal germ cells tumors that occur in particular in midline structures (Looijenga et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2001), if they fail to be eliminated by apoptosis, but develop instead malignant characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DDX4 as highly associated with neuroblastoma tumors (Nguyen et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the origin of adrenal neuroblastoma tumors that occur mainly in children remains elusive, but has been associated with TUBB3-positive neural crest derivatives (De Preter et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Because POU5F1+ germ cells both in ovaries and adrenals seem to express TUBB3 as well, it may be important to investigate the expression of additional markers to exclude a potential link between neuroblastoma and ‘adrenal’ germ cells. </plain></SENT>
