</text></SecTag></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With over 30,000 extant species, ray-finned fishes (Class: Actinopterygii) are the largest group of extant vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The species-richness of this group is in fact largely due to a single monophyletic group of fishes, the teleosts, which account for more than 99% of present day ray-finned fishes1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Teleosts are also the most diverse group of vertebrates that exhibit a wide diversity in their morphology, colouration, behaviour and adaptations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The evolution of this group of ray-finned fishes was accompanied by emergence of several novel characters which were crucial to their success2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These include replacement of bony plates and denticles with overlapping disc-like scales which reduced the weight and increased flexibility, the use of a swim bladder to maintain buoyancy, replacement of heavy toothed jaws with more flexible and protractile ones for efficient prey capture, shift from a heterocercal to homocercal tail for faster speed and change in the position of the paired fins for better maneuverability2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Sequencing and analysis of whole-genomes from fugu and other teleosts have revealed that the common ancestor of teleosts experienced a whole-genome duplication event, known as the teleost-specific genome duplication (TGD), about 350 million years ago34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The TGD has been proposed to have provided the additional raw genetic material that was used for evolving genes with novel functions resulting in novel phenotypes thereby spurring the diversity of teleosts56. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, genome sequences of ancient groups of teleosts that emerged soon after the TGD are crucial for understanding the genetic basis of the origin and diversity of teleosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Teleosts are classified into three broad groups: the Osteoglossomorpha (bonytongues and mooneyes), Elopomorpha (eels and relatives) and Clupeocephala (the remaining teleosts). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Among them, Osteoglossomorpha is considered as one of the ancient groups, with fossil records dating back to the late Jurassic7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, the phylogenetic relationships of the three groups are controversial8910111213. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Earlier mitogenome-based phylogenetic analysis had placed Osteoglossomorpha as the ancestral teleost group, with Elopomorpha and Clupeocephala forming a monophyletic group11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, recent studies based on nuclear genes813 and ultraconserved elements10 have suggested Elopomorpha as the most ancestral teleost group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study based on phylogenetic analysis of ‘question-specific’ genes showed a sister relationship of Osteoglossomorpha with Elopomorpha9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The Asian arowana or dragonfish (Scleropages formosus; Order Osteoglossiformes; hereafter referred to as arowana) is a member of the superorder Osteoglossomorpha and also one of the most expensive cultured ornamental fishes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Currently it is listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, the only commercially cultured species included in the list14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Three major colour varieties of arowana occur naturally: the green, golden and red varieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these colour variations remain largely elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In order to reduce the pressure on natural populations, farms have started culturing different varieties of arowana. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>One of the bottlenecks in the cultivation of arowana is the lack of a reliable and easy sex-determining method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Since the sex of even mature brooders is not obvious, broodstock selection and management often become skewed towards selection by desired phenotype, like colour and body shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a need to understand the sex determination mechanism in arowana and develop a viable sexing method that can be used at an early developmental stage of the fish. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have generated a high quality, chromosome-level reference genome of a golden female arowana (Fig. 1A), in addition to draft genome sequences of red and green arowana varieties (Fig. 1B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on a stringent, genome-scale set of one-to-one orthologues from various teleosts, we report a robust phylogenomic analysis which resolves the branching order of the three major lineages of teleosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our study also identifies differentially expressed genes potentially involved in the colour variations, and provides the first indication for the likely presence of a ZW/ZZ sex chromosomal system in the species. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Recently, a draft assembly of an Asian arowana (colour variety unknown) with an N50 scaffold length of 59 kb has been generated15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We sequenced the genomes of golden, red and green varieties of arowana to &gt;100-fold coverage (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Sequence reads from the three varieties were assembled separately (Supplementary Table 3) using SOAPdenovo216 resulting in N50 scaffold sizes of 5.96, 1.63 and 1.85 million bases (Mb), and genome assemblies spanning approximately 779, 753 and 759 Mb for the golden, red and green varieties, respectively, in agreement with their estimated genome sizes based on k-mer analyses (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Evaluation using CEGMA17 and de novo-assembled transcripts showed that the three assemblies covered over 98% of core eukaryotic genes and 95% of gene regions (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5), confirming their high level of completeness and accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We then indentified 829,293, 1,168,314 and 1,684,422 heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and detected the following heterozygosity levels: 1.01%, 1.23% and 1.88% in the golden, red and green arowana genomes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>To further improve the quality of the golden variety genome assembly, we developed a high-density genetic map by restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) using 94 F2 individuals that originated from red grade 1 and Malaysian golden arowana grandparents18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we identified 22,881 SNPs using the golden assembly as the reference, of which 5,617 refined SNPs and their corresponding scaffolds were clustered and embedded into 25 linkage groups (Fig. 2) spanning approximately 3,240 cM and 683 Mb (87.7% of the golden variety assembly; Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The high-quality linkage group-anchored assembly of the golden variety of Asian arowana can be used as a reference genome, whereas the draft genomes of green and red varieties are suitable for comparative studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Transposable elements (TEs) account for 27–28% of the three genomes (Supplementary Table 7), with the TcMar DNA transposon being the most predominant type (approximately 8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We predicted 22,016, 21,256 and 21,524 genes in the genome assemblies of golden, red and green varieties, respectively (Table 1), using a combination of de novo, homology- and transcriptome- (comprising 4 Gb transcriptome reads from the skin of each colour variety) based annotation methods (Supplementary Table 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Approximately 95% of genes from each variety had both transcriptome and homology support (Supplementary Fig. 3), and about 87% of the genes showed evidence for expression (FPKM &gt;0) (Supplementary Table 9). </plain></SENT>
