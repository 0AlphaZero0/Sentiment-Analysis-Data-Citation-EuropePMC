</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for the development of many neurological disorders including degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and early onset dementia [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Age significantly increases both the risk and incidence of acquired brain injury [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to TBI and have clinically worse outcomes after TBI with increased morbidity and mortality, and reduced functional recovery [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>While age as a prognostic factor after TBI has long been recognized [6], limited attention has been devoted to understanding and modulating the pathologic processes that contribute to poor outcomes seen in aged individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Brain injury initiates an immediate response involving multiple cellular effectors of the innate immune response, notably the brain’s resident tissue macrophage and microglia, as well as the recruitment of peripherally derived monocytes/macrophages presumably through the disruption of the blood-brain barrier [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Aging in humans and rodents has been shown to alter this response [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we used unsupervised gene clustering and pathway analysis to define the effect of age on injury-induced inflammatory sequelae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Our data show that age predisposes the injured brain to an exaggerated inflammatory response involving the enrichment of chemotactic mediators associated with the recruitment and activation of the peripheral monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Specifically, our data show that aged TBI animals have an exacerbated response in the production of ligands that bind to both CCR2 and CCR5 at a critical time point associated with migration of peripheral monocytes/macrophages to the injured brain parenchyma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This molecular response was paralleled by an increased recruitment of CCR2+ macrophages to the injured brain of aged mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Given the exacerbated CCR2/5 cellular and molecular signatures, we used a novel small molecule antagonist for CCR2/5 to abrogate this phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Using a clinically relevant pharmacological approach, our data show that the age-related phenotype in response to injury is significantly mitigated in treated animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These data implicate a new important role for the accumulation of monocyte/macrophages in the maintenance of neuroinflammatory sequelae following neurotrauma in the aged brain. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The brain’s response to neurotrauma initiates a wide range of molecular signaling mechanisms involving a variety of cell types [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Of principle concern is the activation of the myeloid constituents, microglia, and monocytes, due to their involvement and propagation of a variety of acute and chronic disorders [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The approaches taken in this study define the brain’s inflammatory milieu in response to TBI and how these molecular patterns are altered as a function of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The altered shift in expression patterns of chemotactic mediators in aged TBI brain created a permissive environment for the exaggerated influx of peripheral monocytes/macrophages to the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>This, in part, may be due to redundant increases in chemokines associated with CCR2/5 signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>While the role of these monocyte populations is diverse across various neurological diseases, we have shown that these cells augment a pro-inflammatory and potentially neurotoxic bias in the aged brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We also used an available CCR2/5 inhibitor to reduce the accumulation of pro-inflammatory myeloid cells in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Cumulatively, our findings demonstrate that the CCR2-mediated recruitment of monocytes into the injured brain is a rational therapeutic target that may abrogate TBI-induced neuroinflammatory-mediated sequelae. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We recently described the leukocyte-mediated neuroinflammatory sequelae associated with this TBI model in young animals over a detailed time course spanning acute through chronic time points [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Our previous findings suggest that resident microglia are responsible for the initiation of specific inflammatory mediators and infiltrated CCR2+ macrophages significantly augment this response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, in the context of aging, recent work has shown that the aged brain has an altered inflammatory profile relative to basal levels of adult mice [32], potentially priming these systems for maladaptive responses to insult or injury [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In the context of neurotrauma, our current data suggest that age dysregulates multiple signaling networks associated with the activation, chemotaxis, and inflammatory response of innate immune effectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that these responses do not fall within the dichotomous constraints of “M1/M2” polarization [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In agreement with or previous work, our current data indicate that as a result of age, there is dysregulation across both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>While we highlighted several instances of exaggerated pro-inflammatory and chemotactic gene profiles using unsupervised hierarchical clustering, we also observed pro-inflammatory mediators such as CD40, CXCL11, CCL17, CCL19, and IL16 that were downregulated in the aged TBI group, relative to young TBI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Given these opposing inflammatory responses, it is difficult to conclude that TBI in the aged predisposes a purely pro-inflammatory bias, as there are both inductions of anti-inflammatory response with concomitant downregulation of pro-inflammatory responses, relative to young injured animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, our current data attribute, in part, that cumulatively, these maladaptive responses create an overly permissive environment for the exaggerated recruitment and accumulation of CCR2+ macrophages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Although CCR2 is expressed on a variety of immune cells, circulating “inflammatory” monocytes are the main population that expresses this cytokine receptor [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>CCR2 is currently known to have five cognate ligands; CCL2, CCL8, CCL7, CCL13 (human only), and CCL12 [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>However, there is a degree of promiscuity of the CCR2 receptor and its ligands as they are known to bind other C-C receptors; notably CCR5 [36, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Expression of CCR5, like CCR2, is found on a variety of circulating immune effectors, but most relevant to our study, is co-expressed on CCR2+ monocytes [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Overall, in the context of our current findings, the cross-talk and co-expression of CCR2/5 on monocytes, and enhanced expression of their cognate ligands may potentiate the increased recruitment we observed in aged TBI animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our current data are consistent with the formation of a pro-chemotactic milieu created, in part, by increased signaling through CCR2/5 expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>NOX2 activation possesses a neurotoxic nature from the production of ROS intermediates [39, 40] as well as maintaining redox pro-inflammatory signaling cascades of macrophages [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Recent work has detailed an increase in some subunits of the ROS-producing NOX2 complex of aged TBI animals [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Our treatment paradigm with CVC significantly downregulated the expression of the multiple subunits that comprise the NOX2 complex, suggesting a decreased propensity for ROS intermediate formation relative to the vehicle-treated animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>These data align with our previous work implicating CCR2+ macrophages as the predominant source for NOX2 gene expression following TBI [13]. </plain></SENT>
