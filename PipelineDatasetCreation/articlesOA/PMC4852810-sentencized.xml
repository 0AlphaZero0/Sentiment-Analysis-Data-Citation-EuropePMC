</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Total hip arthroplasty (THA) with metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings was reintroduced in the late 1980s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>At that time, MoM THA was hypothesised to minimise wear and convey longer survivorship than standard metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Although small diameter femoral head MoM THAs and certain designs of hip resurfacing have indeed done well in large clinical series and registries, large diameter femoral head (&gt; 36 mm) MoM THAs have had high rates of adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR) and revisions.1-4 Unfortunately, it is not clear which of these hundreds of thousands of patients’ THAs are at risk to fail. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Ideally, these ALTRs should be diagnosed prior to significant soft-tissue damage developing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Recent pathological analyses of these ALTRs, as well as associated pseudotumours, reveal that the underlying physiology is of a hypersensitivity reaction associated with regional hypervascularity.5 At this time there are no validated, definitive prognostic tests that can predict ALTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Most commonly, the investigation includes radiological imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US) and metal ion level testing at the time of clinical presentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>However, the radiological findings may be non-specific and the findings may not correlate with clinical severity or significance.3,6 Because of the associated hypervascular response with ALTR, a potential prognostic test is dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This technique involves rapid, repeated imaging before, during and after intravenous injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent7 providing a quantitative index Ktrans, a parameter that reflects blood flow and perfusion in tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>More importantly, Ktrans has proven useful for assessing vasculature and inflammation, as well as predicting the future course of some microvessel-dependent diseases.8-11 To our knowledge, Ktrans measurements have never been performed near human THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was, 1) to evaluate the feasibility of Ktrans measurements of the peri-articular tissue bed in patients with a THA and 2) to compare Ktrans in patients with a MoM bearing versus MoP, hypothesising that Ktrans in hips with MoM THA is higher than in hips with MoP. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The recruitment for this study took place between July 2007 and May 2010 at the Ottawa Hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval was obtained from the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board, and the trial was registered on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> with registration number NCT00911599. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The study was designed as level three evidence as subjects were originally recruited as part of a prospective randomised study quantifying acetabular bone mineral density comparing a monoblock cobalt-chrome large head MoM bearing with a standard MoP bearing in primary THA.12 This study protocol included the evaluation of serum metal ion levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were any patient between 45 and 75 years of age who had undergone primary THA for non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease, including osteoarthritis (degenerative or post-traumatic), congenital hip dysplasia and avascular necrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Exclusion criteria included previous arthrodesis of the hip, Girdlestone procedure, acute fracture of the femoral neck, above-knee amputations, significant knee arthritis (including previous total knee arthroplasty), evidence of active infection, neurological or muscular disease that may adversely affect gait or weight-bearing, previous ipsilateral hemi-/total resurfacing, uni/bipolar arthroplasty or THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Patients with neuropathic joints, a requirement for structural bone grafts, documented severe psychiatric disease or a documented allergy to cobalt chromium molybdenum were also excluded from participation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>At the time of this study, 36 of the 50 randomised patients had minimum two-year follow-up and of this group, two were deceased, one had renal failure, one had a fracture and two had undergone a revision, leaving 30 patients eligible for the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>All of these patients were contacted by mail and 24 patients agreed to participate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients were unreachable to book the MRI and three patients changed their minds citing claustrophobia, leaving 18 patients that had imaging completed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Due to poor image quality, two of the patients who had the MRI were excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The poor images were likely to be due to excessive movement during the image acquisition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>From this cohort, 16 asymptomatic patients were recruited with a mean age at MRI of 65 years (standard deviation (sd) 6) (55 to 74). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Seven (44%) of the patients were males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Of the seven male patients, five had a MoM THA and two a MoP THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Of the nine females, three had a MoM THA and six a MoP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 28.4 kg/m2 (sd 4.7) (23 to 38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The MRIs were performed between October 2011 and August 2012, on average 3.6 years (sd 0.7) (2.4 to 4.7) after arthroplasty implantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>There were eight patients in each group of large head MoM THA (BFH, MicroPort, Memphis, Tennessee) and MoP THA (Lineage shell, MicroPort). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The median femoral head sizes were 48 mm (40 to 50) and 28 mm (28 to 36) for MoM and MoP, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Prior to surgery, all patients had filled out a questionnaire with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis index (WOMAC) and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>All patients repeated the questionnaires two years after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In addition, serum cobalt and chromium levels had been taken at the two-year mark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood was collected, by venipuncture of the median cubital vein, into 6 mLtrace-element evacuated plastic tubes with clot activator (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The blood was mixed immediately with the additive by gently inverting the tubes five times, allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature, and centrifuged for ten minutes at 1600 × g at 4°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The serum was transferred into 8 mL polypropylene screw-cap tubes (Sarstedt Inc., Saint-Léonard, Quebec) using a polyethylene plastic transfer pipette (VWR, Mississauga, Ontario), and frozen/stored at -20°C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of Co and Cr were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (London Laboratory Services Group, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Corrections for Co and Cr contamination originating from the containers were not required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla (T) scanner (Magnetom Symphony; Siemens AG, Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Before DCE-MRI, standard anatomic imaging was performed with T1-weighted fast spin echo (FSE), and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in the axial, coronal and sagittal planes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Metal artefact reduction strategies were incorporated into the protocol, including increased bandwidth, use of fast spin echo as opposed to spin echo or gradient recalled echo sequences, minimisation of the echo time, and minimising voxel size by increasing the frequency encode direction steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of averages and phase oversampling was increased in order to recover some of the signal that may be lost by the artefact minimisation protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The parameters for T1-weighted FSE were bandwidth = 385 Hz/pixel, TR = 649 ms, TE = 9.1 ms, acquisition matrix = 448 x 224, number of averages = 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The parameters for STIR were bandwidth = 395 Hz/pixel, TR = 4500 ms, TE = 34 ms, acquisition matrix = 384 x 211, number of averages = 2, and inversion time = 155 ms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>DCE-MRI was performed using the “Bookend” method developed in 1999 by Cron, Santyr and Kelcz.13 Rapid, repeated, T1-weighted imaging with injection of contrast agent was flanked in time by two “Bookend” spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) inversion recovery measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In other words, a T1 measurement was performed, followed by dynamic imaging with contrast, followed by a second T1 measurement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The two T1 measurements served to convert the dynamic signal-versus-time to gadolinium concentration- versus -time.13 FSE was used for all pulse sequences of the Bookend method, in order to minimise metal artefacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>FSE parameters were: echo train length = 7, bandwidth = 349 Hz/pixel, echo time = 6.8 ms, number of slices = 16, slice thickness = 6 mm, gap between slices = 1.5 mm, field of view = 22 cm, and matrix size = 128 x 128. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The images were acquired in the axial plane with slices prescribed between the level of the lesser trochanter and the acetabular roof. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Each T1 measurement was performed with repetition time = 8000 ms and an inversion pulse with inversion times = 500, 1000, and 3000 ms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>T1 was computed for each voxel by fitting an exponential recovery curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The dynamic imaging with contrast was performed with repetition time = 865 ms, no inversion pulse, temporal resolution = 7.8 s, gadolinium contrast agent dose = 0.1 mmol/kg (Magnevist; Bayer, Berlin, Germany), injection rate = 2.5 cc/sec, and duration of DCE-MRI = 4 min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The total scan time of the Bookend method was 11 minutes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>For each voxel, a gadolinium concentration-versus-time curve was estimated from the two T1 measurements and the dynamic signal-versus-time curve was estimated using the Bookend method.13 Contrast agent accumulation (in millimolar) was calculated for each voxel using the end of the concentration-versus-time curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The concentration-versus-time data were then analysed voxel-by-voxel with nordicICE software (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) using the Extended Tofts Model to generate three-dimensional maps of Ktrans.14 For this modeling, a population-based arterial input function was used.15 Example DCE-MRI data are shown in Figures 1 and 2. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Understanding the pathological mechanism of implant failure remains a challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Several factors may influence this failure, including implant positioning, implant material, patient activity and the biology of the host.18 More importantly, the fact that some patients have failure of their joint arthroplasties with no measurable, or minimal, wear while others with significant wear have minimal to no host response would indicate that the host response to implant wear debris is key variable.19 Consequently, gaining a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms that may influence the development of an inflammatory reaction in the presence of a THA is critical in the development of screening and diagnostic tools for ALTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>When looking at failed MoM THA, Willert et al20 described an aseptic, lymphocyte-dominated, vasculitis-associated lesion (ALVAL), indicating a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown that THA has a shorter lifespan in patients whose skin tests positive for sensitisation to implant components.21 To our knowledge, this is the first report of DCE-MRI data in patients with a THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Our pilot study has shown that MRI is achievable using a fast spin echo sequence for the DCE-MRI instead of the conventional gradient echo sequence, which would be prone to significant metal artefact.22-24 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Different imaging techniques have been applied to evaluate for ALTR, but none of these techniques can differentiate between incidental, asymptomatic changes and symptomatic, more clinically significant changes that may be precursors to joint failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Conventional radiographs are insensitive for diagnosing ALTR.25 By applying a metal artefact reduction sequence (MARS), MRI of diagnostic quality is feasible in hips with THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The typical finding in hips with ALTR is a complex peri-prosthetic mass or collection, often with heterogeneous fluid signal.26 This collection often communicates with the hip joint but can extend into the surrounding muscles, intermuscular planes, tendon sheaths and subcutaneous fat.25,26 A grading system for MRI findings has been introduced, but fails to differentiate between benign and aggressive lesions or to determine risk of progression.27 On ultrasound, ALTR has been described as a solid or cystic mass or a complex fluid collection.28 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that female patients with a MoM bearing have a significantly higher level of perfusion, as measured with DCE-MRI, compared with the MoP group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>When looking at the clinical outcome of female patients with MoM THA, pseudotumours, metal-bearing complications, aseptic loosening, and prosthesis revision are significantly higher compared with male patients.29,30 It has been postulated that these increased problems in women are due to wider range of hip joint motion and subsequently more frequent impingement, or higher incidence of metal allergy caused by wearing jewellery.30 Although there is most likely a multifactorial aetiology to these poor outcomes (i.e. fibrous fixation of the implant, soft-tissue irritation, reaction to wear debris), female gender certainly stands out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Looking at patients with MoM THA in this study, women had Ktrans values which were nearly double those of men, possibly indicating a different host response to a MoM bearing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>All THAs, regardless of type, may have some level of inflammatory response or perhaps mild alteration in perfusion kinetics of soft tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>There are two variables that determine the degree of response: gender and THA type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that the inflammatory profile, from lowest to greatest, is ranked 1) Male MoM 2) MoP (equal for both genders) 3) Female MoM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The pathway for developing soft-tissue reactions is not fully elucidated, and is likely a function of variable implant inflammatory profiles as well as gender-specific physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Indeed, gender differences have been reported for cerebral and cardiac perfusion measured with MRI, with 13% to 20% higher values in women, similar to what we found in MoP THA patients (11% higher Ktrans values in women).31,32 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>With the numbers available, we were unable to identify a correlation between Ktrans and WOMAC scores, UCLA scores, cobalt ion levels, or chromium ion levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This may not be surprising given that ALTR has not been found to correlate with pain or metal ion serum levels.3,26,33-35 Although Ktrans did not correlate with cobalt and chromium levels, it did correlate with titanium levels (R = 0.760, p = 0.011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This suggests that titanium may have a greater inflammatory profile, or may be of greater relevance than the other ions in the study of ion-related soft-tissue reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>An important limitation of this study was the small number of patients in each group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomised, in an effort to minimise selection bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>This work was constructed as a pilot study, however, and the fact that significant differences were found despite the small number demonstrates the exciting potential of this imaging technique in diagnosing ALTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if any of these patients will eventually go on to have failure of their joint arthroplasty and more long-term follow-up of this patient cohort is needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The absent difference of Ktrans values between hips with MoM and hips with MoP bearing cannot be proved with this sample size, as a type II error cannot be excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>DCE-MRI images suffered from metal artefacts immediately adjacent to the implant, although this did not significantly affect image quality in the surrounding tissues (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Another limitation was that we were unable to obtain individual arterial input functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This is because spin echo sequences are particularly sensitive to inflow effects, making it difficult to obtain reliable DCE-MRI curves in blood.36 Only one hip was scanned per patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>It was not feasible to scan both simultaneously as this would have increased the field of view and required a significant increase in scan time or a reduction in resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, doing a separate scan of the contralateral side, or native hip without THA, would have provided an internal reference for each subject, and will be considered for future projects beyond this pilot study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This study has shown the feasibility of a novel DCE-MRI technique for evaluation of tissue surrounding THA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Higher Ktrans values measured with DCE-MRI were found in female patients with MoM THA, indicating high tissue perfusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>This may reflect gender differences or underlying adverse tissue inflammatory reaction, which may be a precursor to tissue damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Our findings have potential future clinical and research applications for identifying and stratifying patients of particular gender and/or with various THA types who may be at increased risk for joint failure due to tissue hypersensitivity reactions. </plain></SENT>
