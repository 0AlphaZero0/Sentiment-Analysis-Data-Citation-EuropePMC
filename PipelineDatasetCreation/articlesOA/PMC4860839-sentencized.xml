</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is an important human tumor suppressor protein which plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling [1], cell adhesion [2, 3], cell migration [4, 5], mitosis and chromosomal instability [6], and so on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mutations of the human APC gene are found in most of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, as well as in a majority of sporadic colorectal cancer cases [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal armadillo repeat (ARM) domain of APC is the most conserved region among its vertebrate and invertebrate homologs [9, 10], and mediates its association with a variety of binding partners including APC membrane recruitment 1 (Amer1, also named as WTX for ‘Wilms tumor gene on the X chromosome’) [11, 12], Asef [13], Sam68 [14], and IQGAP1 [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Amer1/WTX is another important human tumor suppressor whose gene is somatically inactivated in one-third of Wilms' tumors, the most common pediatric kidney cancers [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In contrast, germline mutations of the Amer1/WTX gene predispose to osteopathia striata congenita with cranial sclerosis, a bone overgrowth syndrome [16]. Amer1/WTX-knockout mice exhibited both kidney and bone defects due to aberrant specification of mesenchymal progenitor cell fate [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The Amer1 protein possesses two membrane targeting regions at its N-terminus, three APC-interacting sites named as A1 (residues 280–368), A2 (residues 380–531), and A3 (residues 717–834) [11], as well as a β-catenin-binding arginine-glutamate-alanine (REA) repeats [18] (Supplementary Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>By recruiting APC to the plasma membrane, Amer1 regulates the APC-dependent maintenance of intercellular junctions [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In addition, together with APC and Axin, Amer1 promotes ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin, thus negatively regulates the Wnt signal transduction pathway [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Amer1 also has a variety of other functions including participating in the upstream activation of Wnt signaling by promoting the phosphorylation of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 [20], shuttling to the nucleus and enhancing the transcriptional activity of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) [21], and positively regulating the CBP/p300-mediated p53 acetylation [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The three APC-binding regions A1, A2, and A3 of Amer1 display no obvious sequence similarities among themselves nor exhibit any resemblance with other APC-ARM-binding motifs such as the APC-binding region (ABR) of Asef [10] and the YY motif of Sam68 [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These three sites have only been roughly mapped to regions spanning 50–120 residues, and it is completely unknown which residues at these three sites mediate specific recognitions with APC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the case of the ARM domain of β-catenin, its interaction partners such as phospho-APC 20-amino-acid repeat [23, 24], phospho-E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain [25], and TCF’s β-catenin-binding domain [26] all reside in the same surface groove of β-catenin-ARM with a similar binding pattern despite their diverse sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It will be interesting to examine whether different APC–ARM-binding fragments including those from Amer1, Asef, and Sam68 also exhibit a common mode to associate with APC-ARM, although they have no apparent recognizable homology with each other. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the molecular basis underlying the complex formation between Amer1 and APC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We identified core sequences of the Amer1-A1 and -A2 sites for APC binding, discovered a fourth APC-binding site on Amer1 (which we named as A4), and determined the crystal structures of APC–ARM in complexes with the A1, A2, and A4 peptides of Amer1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In addition, point mutations of key interface residues on Amer1-A1/A2/A4 or APC–ARM abrogated their interactions by glutathione sulfur transferase (GST) pull-down, yeast two-hybrid, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Amer1-A1/A2/A4, Amer1-A3 was found to use a bipartite interaction mode to bind to the C-terminal side of APC–ARM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Composite mutations on APC or Amer1 disrupting all four interaction interfaces abolished their association in cultured cells and abrogated the membrane recruitment of APC by Amer1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Finally, structural superimposition reveals a common mode used by APC–ARM to recognize Amer1-A1/A2/A4, Asef-ABR, and Sam68-YY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>By summarizing their sequences and interaction patterns, a consensus APC–ARM recognition motif employed by its binding partners is proposed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec><title><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Identification of the core Amer1-A1 and -A2 sequences for APC–ARM binding </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have roughly mapped the Amer1-A1 and -A2 sites to residues 280–368 and 380–531, respectively [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, examination of the structure of APC–ARM shows that the ligand-binding groove on its surface is ~50 Å long and~20 Å wide [9, 10], which can only accommodate a peptide of 12–15 residues in a fully extended conformation or a longer peptide containing bends or secondary structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Alignment of the human Amer1 protein sequence with those of its chicken, frog, and zebrafish orthologs as well as its paralogs Amer2/FAM123A and Amer3/FAM123C revealed conserved sequence blocks (Amer1 residues 315–335 and 496–508 for the A1 and A2 sites, respectively) flanked by non-conserved residues (Figure 1a) [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, ITC experiments demonstrated that peptides of Amer1-A1 (residues 325–335) and -A2 (residues 496–508) sequences exhibited approximately equal binding affinities for APC–ARM (Figures 1b and c, Table 1) as full Amer1-A1 (residues 280–368) and -A2 (residues 380–531), respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Figures S2A and S2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, the N507K point mutation of APC has been shown to abrogate its association with Amer1 [11] and Asef [10, 28], and its corresponding mutation of N175K in Drosophila APC2 (also known as E-APC) resulted in developmental defects [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In accordance with these findings, both Amer1 (325–335) and Amer1 (496–508) displayed non-detectable interaction with the N507K point mutant protein of APC–ARM, as shown by the GST pull-down assay (Supplementary Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Amer1 residues 325–335 and 496–508 are regarded to represent the core A1 and A2 fragments for APC binding, respectively, although other conserved Amer1 residues nearby such as residues 315–324 may also contribute to the interaction with APC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Identification of A4, a fourth APC-binding site on Amer1 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Amino-acid sequences of the three APC-binding sites of Amer1/WTX, especially A1 and A2, show little variance among different Amer1 orthologs and paralogs (Figures 1a and 1d), suggesting that the recognition of APC is a conserved function of Amer1 throughout evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>When the percentage of conservation for each Amer1 residue was carefully examined, another highly invariant sequence block between the A1 and A2 sites, residues 365–375, was found (Figures 1d and e) [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Similar to the core A1 and A2 sequences, it also contains an acidic residue in the middle and several hydrophobic residues at its C-terminal part (Figure 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>When the ITC assay was performed to examine the binding affinity between Amer1 (365–375) and APC–ARM, their dissociation constant (K d) was measured to be 1.96 μM (Figure 1f), stronger than that of Amer1-A1 and similar to that of Amer1-A2 (Figures 1b and c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Hence, this sequence block represents a fourth motif on Amer1 for APC recognition, which is named as A4 after the three previously described APC-binding sites. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>To further understand the molecular basis of how APC recognizes Amer1, we determined the crystal structures of the APC–ARM/Amer1-A1, APC–ARM/Amer1-A2, and APC–ARM/Amer1-A4 complexes to 1.90 Å, 2.00 Å, and 1.70 Å resolutions, respectively (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Despite possessing apparently different sequences, Amer1-A1, -A2, and -A4 adopt remarkably similar conformations when bound to APC–ARM, both in anti-parallel manners with respect to the armadillo repeats of APC (Figure 1g). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>At all three interfaces between APC–ARM and Amer1-A1/A2/A4, four highly conserved asparagine residues, N507/N550/N594/N641 from the H3 helices of armadillo repeats 2/3/4/5 of APC–ARM function as rivets fastening Amer1-A1/A2/A4 onto its surface groove. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>With the exception of N507 that forms only one hydrogen bond with A1-A333/A2-A504/A4-A373, these asparagines each employs its side chain amide group to make a couple of hydrogen bonds with the main chain NH and CO groups of Amer1-A1, -A2, and -A4 peptides (Figures 2a, c and e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In addition, two basic residues, APC-K516 and -R549, straddle the middle portion of Amer1-A1/A2/A4 peptides on both sides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>They form salt bridges with a conserved acidic residue A1-D330/A2-D503/A4-E370 and make hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl groups of A1-C328/A1-G329/A2-S501/A2-G502/A4-G368 (Figures 2a, c and e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two tryptophan residues, APC-W593 and -W553, provide more binding affinity by hydrogen bonding with A1-T326/A2-S499 and making van der Waals interactions with A1-G327/A1-G329/A2-Y500/A2-G502/A4-G367/A4-G369, respectively (Figures 2b, d and f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a number of hydrophobic residues F458, M503, and F510 from APC cluster together and form hydrophobic contacts with non-polar residues such as I332/A333 from Amer1-A1, L505/T506 from Amer1-A2, and M372/A373 from Amer1-A4 (Figures 2b, d and f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Amer1-A1, -A2, and -A4 all orchestrate a remarkably similar assembly of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to associate with an almost identical set of APC–ARM surface groove residues, despite their apparently divergent sequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Mutations of key residues of APC–ARM and Amer1-A1/A2/A4 disrupt their associations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>To corroborate our structural observations, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on critical interface residues of APC–ARM and Amer1-A1/A2/A4, and examined the effects of these point mutations by yeast two-hybrid, GST pull-down, and ITC assays. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Consistent with their crucial roles observed in the co-crystal structures, replacing the three key asparagines of APC, N507/N550/N594, by lysines disrupted or diminished the association between APC–ARM and Amer1-A1/A2/A4 (Figures 3a–d, Supplementary Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In addition, point mutations of K516E and R549E (and to a less extent, R549A) abolished the recognition of APC–ARM for Amer1-A1/A2/A4 (Figures 3a–d, Supplementary Figures S4 and S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, substitution of the crucial hydrophobic residue APC-F510 by a lysine reduced the complex formation between APC–ARM and Amer1-A1 (Figure 3c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In Amer1-A1, -A2, and -A4, a serine/threonine residue (A1-T326/A2-S499), an acidic residue (A1-D330/A2-D503/A4-E370), and a non-polar residue (A1-I332/A2-L505/A4-M372) are key contributors mediating interactions with APC–ARM (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, point mutations of T326R/T326A, D330K/D330A, and I332D in Amer1-A1 eliminated its binding with APC–ARM (Figures 3e and f, Supplementary Figure S6); the S499A, D503K/D503A, and L505D mutations in Amer1-A2 undermined its complex formation with APC–ARM (Figures 3e and g, Supplementary Figures S6 and S7); and the E370K point mutation or deletion of residues 370–373 in Amer1-A4 eliminated its interaction with APC–ARM (Figure 3h, Supplementary Figure S8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the G329A mutation in Amer1-A1 (Figure 3f) and the D498K mutation in Amer1-A2 (Figure 3e) also attenuated their associations with APC–ARM as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Different from Amer1-A1/A2/A4, Amer1-A3 employs a bipartite binding mode to interact with the C-terminal side of APC–ARM </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The APC–ARM-binding site A3 of Amer1 was only roughly mapped to a region of about 120-amino acids from 717 to 834 [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Sequence comparison of the human Amer1-A3 with its orthologs shows that residues 767–819 are highly conserved, whereas residues outside this region possess little homology (Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when we compared the binding of APC–ARM with Amer1 (716–834) or Amer1 (766–823) by the ITC and GST pull-down assays, these two constructs of Amer1 exhibited comparable interaction affinities (Figures 4b and c, Table 1, Supplementary Figure S9A), suggesting that Amer1 (residues 766–823) might represent the core A3 fragment for associating with APC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Within Amer1 (766–823), residues 767–777 and 796–819 are more conserved, while the amino acids 778–795 between them display much more diversity (Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>When residues 778–794 were deleted from Amer1 (766–823), the resulting construct Amer1 (766–823, Δ778–794) still retained the majority of binding affinity for APC–ARM (Figures 4c and d, Table 1, Supplementary Figure S9A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To exclude the possibility that either the N-terminal (residues 766–777) or C-terminal fragment (residues 795–823) of Amer1 (766–823, Δ778–794) was sufficient for binding to APC–ARM, we examined the association of Amer1 (766–777) or Amer1 (786–823) with APC–ARM by the GST pull-down (Supplementary Figure S9B) and ITC assays (Figures 4e and f, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that Amer1 (766–777) or Amer1 (786–823) displayed no detectable interactions with APC–ARM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Residues 778–794 probably form a bulging loop when Amer1-A3 is bound to APC–ARM, and thus do not provide much contribution to the recognition between APC and Amer1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Amer1-A3 employs residues 766–777 and 795–823 to associate with APC–ARM by a bipartite binding mechanism, and neither of these two fragments is able to interact with APC–ARM separately on its own. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>When we tested the set of APC–ARM point mutants defective in binding Amer1-A1/A2/A4 such as N507K/K516E/R549E/N550K for association with Amer1-A3, we surprisingly found that these mutations did not affect their interaction (Figure 4g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a point mutation at the C-terminal side of APC–ARM, M717K, destroyed the APC–ARM/Amer1-A3 complex formation (Figure 4g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>M717 was mutated because it was shown to be a key residue in mediating the interaction of APC–ARM with Sam68 [14] and lies outside of the residues mediating interaction of APC–ARM with Amer1-A1/A2/A4, which were not relevant for binding to Amer1-A3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Hence, Amer1-A3 interacts with the C-terminal portion of APC–ARM using a bipartite binding mode, which is different from the way that Amer1-A1/A2/A4 bind. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Composite mutations on Amer1 (2–700) disrupting the A1/A2/A4 sites abrogated its association with FL APC and compromised the recruitment of APC to the plasma membrane </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To this end, we first prepared a triple mutant construct of Amer1 (2–700) in which the A1/A2/A4 sites were destroyed by the D330K/D503K/E370K triple mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Amer1 (2–700) does not contain the A3 site, thus this triple mutant construct effectively has all of the APC-binding sites removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation assays verified that Amer1 (2-700, D330K/D503K/E370K) was not able to assemble with either APC–ARM (Figures 5a and b) or FL APC (Figure 5c) anymore, although the Amer1 (2–700) double mutant D330K/D503K with only the A1/A2 sites disrupted still associated with APC (Figures 5a and c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>One important function of Amer1 is to recruit APC to the plasma membrane, thus regulating the formation of intercellular junctions and Wnt signaling (Figures 6a and aʹ) [11, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Amer1 (2–700) could also bring APC to the plasma membrane (Figures 6b and bʹ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>When the double mutation of D330K/D503K with only the A1/A2 sites destroyed was introduced to Amer1 (2-700), APC was still recruited to the plasma membrane by Amer1 (Figures 6c and cʹ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the D330K/D503K/E370K triple mutation on Amer1 (2–700), which eliminated all four APC-binding sites, abrogated the membrane co-localization of APC with Amer1 (Figures 6d and dʹ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our co-immunoprecipitation and subcellular co-localization experiments demonstrate that each of the four APC-binding motifs of Amer1 is functional in recruiting APC in cultured cells and translocating APC to the plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Yet, by superimposing the crystal structures of APC–ARM in complexes with Amer1-A1/A2/A4 as well as Asef-ABR and Sam68-YY [10, 14], these APC-interacting ligands are all found to reside in the same surface groove of APC–ARM, all in anti-parallel manners with respect to the armadillo repeats of APC (Figure 7a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>As these APC-binding partners occupy roughly the same position, we wonder whether they would compete with each other in a mutually exclusive manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Indeed, addition of the Asef-ABR-SH3 protein to the pre-assembled APC–ARM/Amer1-A2 complex progressively dissociated APC–ARM from Amer1-A2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7b), which is consistent with our surmise. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the fact that the fourth glycine is the most conserved one among the three glycine residues of the consensus motif (Figure 7c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The fifth amino acid of the APC–ARM-binding consensus is an acidic one (D330 in Amer1-A1, D503 in Amer1-A2, E370 in Amer1-A4, E183 in Asef-ABR, and E384 in Sam68-YY), whose side chain carboxylate group is recognized by G511 and K516 of APC by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the seventh and eighth sites of the consensus motif are hydrophobic residues (I332/A333 in Amer1-A1, L505/Y506 in Amer1-A2, M372/A373 in Amer1-A4, L185/A186 in Asef-ABR, and T386/T387 in Sam68-YY), which are surrounded by non-polar APC residues such as F458, M503, and F510 (Supplementary Figure S10). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>It also has a crucial role in regulating the cytoskeleton formation and cell migration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The ARM domain of APC is critical for these diverse activities by mediating interactions with Amer1, Asef, IQGAP1, and so on to regulate these diverse functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>It is therefore of high appealing interest to determine the molecular basis of how APC–ARM accommodates these various binding partners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, although there is no apparent sequence similarity among the APC-binding regions A1, A2, and A4 of Amer1 and those of Asef and Sam68, our structural and mutational analysis revealed a common interaction mode shared by them and allowed us to deduce a consensus sequence for APC–ARM recognition (Figure 7c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>We propose, and showed for the Asef and Amer1-A2 pair (Figure 7b), that these APC–ARM-binding partners are competitive with each other for APC-binding, similar to the case for β-catenin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>There are four APC-binding sites in Amer1, the previously described A1, A2, A3 [11] and the newly identified A4 in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>These four sites are the most highly conserved regions of Amer1 (Figure 4d), implicating that the interaction between APC and Amer1 at these four sites is specially retained by the selection pressure throughout evolution [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Single-point mutations of key interface residues on APC or Amer1 attenuated their associations mediated through the four individual motifs (Figure 3), while composite mutations disrupting all four binding sites abrogated interactions of full-length proteins (Figure 5) and abolished the recruitment of APC to the plasma membrane by Amer1 (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>By comparing the interaction modes of Amer1-A1, -A2, -A4, Asef-ABR, and Sam68-YY, a consensus APC–ARM-binding motif is proposed (Figure 7c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Side chain amide groups of four asparagine residues, N507/N550/N594/N641 from the H3 helices of APC armadillo repeats 2 through 4, hydrogen bond with the main-chain NH and CO groups of the APC–ARM-binding motif in a zipper-like manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In addition, three glycines, one acidic residue, and two hydrophobic residues of the consensus APC–ARM-interacting motif are recognized by W553/W593, G511/K516, and F458/M503/F510 of APC, respectively (Supplementary Figure S10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>It would be intriguing to investigate whether other APC–ARM-associating proteins such as IQGAP1 [15], PP2A-B56α [29], KAP3 [30], and Striatin [31] also use similar mechanisms to recognize APC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>However, it would not be surprising if any of them employs a different recognition mode, as Amer1-A3 has already provided such a scenario. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Amer1 is a multifunctional protein whose gene knockout in mice resulted in defective specification of mesenchymal progenitor cell fate, mainly through aberrant β-catenin activation [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>As the Amer1–APC complex is also involved in regulating β-catenin protein stability [19, 20], it would be worthwhile to investigate what effect specific disruption of the Amer1–APC complex would have on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
