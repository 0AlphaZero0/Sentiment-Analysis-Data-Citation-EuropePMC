</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The naturally occurring catecholamine dopamine (DA) acts as a neurotransmitter and neurohormone in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates and invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>DA is a precursor in the biochemical pathway for the production of melanin, and is required for invertebrate cuticle sclerotization [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence suggests that in insects, DA and DA receptors (DARs) are involved in the regulation of larval and pupal ecdysis, as well as in metamorphosis [5–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>DA metabolism has been studied extensively within many phylogenetic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The essential steps required for dopaminergic neurotransmission (i.e., DA synthesis, release, receptor activation, and reuptake) are conserved between flies and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DA synthesis is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is encoded in Drosophila by the pale locus [1–4, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>TH converts tyrosine to the precursor molecule L-DOPA, which is in turn converted to DA by the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), encoded by the Ddc gene [5–9, 11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>TH and DDC are required for normal development in Drosophila. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Null mutations targeting either biosynthetic enzyme result in late embryonic lethality [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>More recently, elegant studies have shown that selective depletion of TH in the nervous system is well tolerated by the developing fly, and that corresponding adults have normal lifespan, albeit display behavioral deficits (e.g., motor activity, phototaxis, aversive learning) [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DA exerts its function by activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The fruit fly expresses both D1-like and D2-like DA receptors, which are distinguished based on the ability of the receptor to couple to either stimulatory Gαs (D1-like) or inhibitory Gαi/o (D2-like) G proteins, which in turn activate downstream signaling mechanisms [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The fly D1-like receptors include Dop1R1 (synonyms: DopR1, dDA1, dumb, Dmdop1, DA1) [17, 18] and Dop1R2 (synonyms: DopR2, DAMB, DOPR99B) [19, 20], as well as the non-canonical DopEcR (synonym: dmDopEcR) [21–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>DopEcR has a unique in vitro pharmacological profile and can be activated either by dopamine or by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There is only one known Drosophila D2-like receptor, Dop2R (synonym: DD2R, D2R), which has also been cloned and characterized [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition to modulating a range of receptor-mediated physiologies in insects [25–33], DA acts as a precursor of metabolites involved in cuticle melanization (pigmentation) [4], and is essential for the crosslinking of proteins and chitin during sclerotization (hardening) of the cuticle after eclosion [2, 34–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Although the importance of DA GPCRs as modifiers of adult fly behavior (including locomotor activity, memory, arousal, temperature preference, courtship, gustation, olfaction and response to drugs of abuse) is well-documented [21, 23, 25–31, 38, 39], the contribution of DA receptors in the modulation of developmental processes has remained poorly defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>DopEcR, which responds to both DA and ecdysone, has been shown to regulate sugar sensing, male courtship, and pheromone perception in adult insects [22, 23, 40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Overexpression or a significant reduction in the expression of this receptor, however, does not compromise normal development [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The focus of our study is to define the role of the D1-like Drosophila DA receptor, Dop1R2, during development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This GPCR is well-conserved in arthropods, but exhibits limited homology with mammalian dopamine receptors [41, 42], suggesting a unique function for Dop1R2 that is specific to invertebrate physiology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We have used transgenic Dop1R2 RNA interference (RNAi) Drosophila, and characterized the effects of Dop1R2 knockdown (KD) using the GAL4/UAS-mediated system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that Dop1R2 activity is critical during the third larval instar and pupal stages to ensure completion of development through adult emergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Our investigations of the tissue/cell types that underlie the observed Dop1R2-mediated phenotypes suggest the involvement of Dop1R2 receptors expressed in the salivary glands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The Dop1R2 RNAi-induced phenotypes observed in escaper adults are recapitulated in progeny exposed to a Dop1R2 small molecule antagonist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We have identified a subset of genes that respond to Dop1R2 KD, and are essential in development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This finding correlates with previous studies in other insect species (i.e., cockroach, locust, tick), which have demonstrated dopaminergic innervation of peripheral secretory cells in the acini, and along the ducts, of the salivary glands [60–62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>More recently, D1-like dopamine receptors were found in the salivary glands of adult ticks and cockroaches, where they may play a role during the feeding phase, as well as modulate salivary secretion, myoepithelial cell contraction and effects of neuropeptides [59, 62, 63]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>A function for Dop1R2 in salivary glands is consistent with: (i) the observed (Dop1R2 RNAi-induced) deregulation of genes that are selectively expressed in this organ (e.g., Eig71E genes), and (ii) the DAVID GO clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (Figs. 5 and 6, Additional files 3 and 4), which reveals enrichment in salivary gland biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>A compelling example comes from the family of Eig71E (aka L71) puff genes that are (concomitantly) induced exclusively in salivary glands, and specifically during puparium formation (they are then repressed ~12 h later) [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>It is known that the corresponding L71 small defensin-like polypeptides are secreted from the salivary glands between the prepupal cuticle and imaginal epidermis, to help protect the metamorphosing organism against infection [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The Eig71E genes participate in the secondary response to 20E (i.e., as “late” genes), which itself depends on the expression of the early-late genes BR-C and E74 [74]. BR-C expression is also up-regulated in Dop1R2 RNAi flies, and derepression of this gene could lead to subsequent induction of the Eig71E genes in Dop1R2 RNAi flies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Our studies support the premise that Dop1R2 acts upstream of selected late genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Of note, although three out of four salivary gland drivers resulted in corresponding dsDop1R2 progeny displaying comparable phenotypes (Table 1), no phenotype was observed when using the sgs3-GAL4 driver.

<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Further supporting the role of Dop1R2 in development, pharmacological treatment of larvae with the established D1-like receptor antagonist flupenthixol dihydrochloride [9, 41, 76–78] results in pre-adult developmental delay/arrest (Additional file 12: Figure S10A), as well as abnormal melanization and cuticle defects in escapers (Additional file 12: Figure S10C), that recapitulate those observed by genetic manipulation of Dop1R2 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Importantly, flupenthixol and other selected compounds that also inhibit the mosquito AaDOP2 receptor, which is the Aedes aegypti ortholog of the fly Dop1R2 receptor, have emerged as promising candidate insecticides to control vector arthropods [9, 66, 79]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>It is well-established that in Drosophila the balance between repression and induction of the immune defense is tightly regulated, and ensures optimal growth and size at metamorphosis [80–82]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Control of the innate immunity enables larval growth amidst the plethora of bacteria and fungi found in the natural larval feeding environment and ensures high tolerance for the larval gut commensal microbiota, which has been shown to promote development [83–85]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Conversely, deregulated immune responses can alter normal fly growth and development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Rynes et al. (2012) have shown that chronic inflammation of the larval gut epithelium results in developmental delay, growth retardation and lethality [86]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the field have unraveled an exquisite interplay of negative regulators of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway that together adapt the immune response to the microbiome encountered by the developing fly (dietary/beneficial or pathogenic). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>These factors are essential to larval growth and immune homeostasis [55, 81, 86–92], and loss-of-function mutations in these negative regulators can result in larval death [86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that down-regulation of Dop1R2 leads to up-regulation of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including the cecropins CecA1 and CecA2 (Figs. 5 and 6), which are gut peptides strongly induced upon infection in an IMD/relish-dependent manner [52, 93]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>These short peptides, which are normally released into the hemolymph following septic injury, are postulated to act as chemokines [96, 97]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Importantly, IM1, IM2, IM3, IM4, IM10, IM23, along with Dro2 and AttB (Fig. 5 and Additional file 3: Dataset 1), were recently identified within a group of 14 AMPs and IMs that are markedly up-regulated in mutant Drosophila deficient in activating transcription factor 3, atf3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Atf3 plays an essential role in larval growth, and is highly expressed in the larval gut, salivary glands and Malpighian tubules [86]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The overlap between the dysregulated gene set (and associated adverse effects on development) induced by Dop1R2 deficiency, and that induced by atf3 deficiency, suggests an important role for Dop1R2 in the control of the immune response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In addition to antimicrobial peptides, our study shows that the expression levels of multiple heat shock/stress genes increase in response to Dop1R2 deficiency, including the major heat-inducible proteins (Hsp70Bc, Hsp70Bbc, and Hsp68), and small heat shock proteins (Hsp22 Hsp26, Hsp67Bb and Hsp67Bc) (Fig. 5 and Additional file 3: Dataset 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>High levels of Hsp70 in Drosophila (due to one extra copy of the gene) are sufficient to decrease organismal growth, development and survival to adulthood [103]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Up-regulation of this gene alone in developing Dop1R2 RNAi flies (Figs. 5 and 6) may thus contribute to the observed lethal phenotype that results from reduced Dop1R2 function. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>We postulate that under normal conditions, at the time of ecdysone-responsive early gene induction (i.e., during the L3 stage), Dop1R2 in the salivary glands participates in the co-repression of ecdysone-responsive late genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>We propose that the premature release of the Dop1R2 inhibitory effect (using RNAi approaches) translates into increased expression of the L71 defensin-like polypeptides, as well as a series of antimicrobial peptides, stress proteins/chaperones, cuticle and morphogenesis proteins in a de-synchronized manner. </plain></SENT>
