</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Borrelia species possess highly segmented genomes, harboring multiple circular and linear replicons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The prototype Borrelia burgdorferi B31 genome possesses a linear chromosome and 23 plasmids that are a mix of circular and linear replicons (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed DNA hairpins, structures called hairpin (hp) telomeres (4–6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our current understanding of the replication cycle of the linear replicons is that DNA replication initiates internally and proceeds bidirectionally toward the hp telomeres (7,8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Replication around the hp telomeres would produce an inverted repeat dimer joined by replicated telomere (rTel) junctions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The resulting intermediate has been replicated, but cannot be segregated to daughter cells, until a specialized DNA breakage and rejoining reaction, referred to as telomere resolution, occurs at the rTel junctions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Telomere resolution liberates a pair of linear replicons terminated by hp telomeres. rTel junctions are processed in vivo and in vitro into two hp telomeres (9,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The essential specialized telomere resolvase that performs this reaction for Borrelia is known as ResT (11,12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A similar replication strategy has been demonstrated for the lysogen of the N15 bacteriophage; the N15 prophage exists as a linear plasmid terminated by hp telomeres (13–15). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>ResT, and other characterized telomere resolvases, catalyzes telomere resolution by a 2-step transesterification reaction with similarity to that promoted by type 1B topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases (9,16–20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A detailed view of the reaction mechanism can be found in (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the simplest view, the essential role of ResT in the cell cycle would be to resolve dimeric replication intermediates to allow cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A prediction of this model is that ResT insufficiency would result in a failure to resolve replicated intermediates, leading either to a filamentous phenotype or to a guillotining of the unresolved intermediates by continued cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recent in vivo and in vitro results suggest a more complex role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A B. burgdorferi strain with conditional expression of ResT was examined for the effect of ResT depletion (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Growth arrest occurred 48 h after ResT shutoff. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Among several unexpected phenotypes, were arrest of DNA replication at 48 h and the failure of the cells to filament. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Starting 24 h after ResT shutoff, unit sized linear DNAs disappeared and became progressively more complex, slowly migrating forms that had a roughly equal mix of hp telomeres and replicated, but unresolved, rTel junctions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This suggested the linear plasmids examined were present in partially replicated, and possibly strand-exchanged, forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The observed arrest of DNA replication suggested that ResT may interact directly, or indirectly, with the DNA replication machinery (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>An additional report suggested a more complex role, for ResT, in hp telomere metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>ResT was found to possess single-strand annealing activity and the ability to promote limited strand exchange between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors and homologous partial duplex DNAs (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We speculated that these activities could indicate that ResT may be needed to promote daughter strand gap repair in cases where the replisome was unable to fully denature the template DNA near the hp telomere to complete DNA synthesis (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Daughter strand gap repair is normally promoted by RecA action, mediated by the RecFOR proteins, in the RecF DNA repair pathway (23–26). B. burgdorferi possesses RecA, but otherwise lacks identifiable components of the RecF pathway, excepting RecJ, which also participates in mismatch repair (1,27). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In this report, we extend our findings that ResT can promote annealing of complementary ssDNA to show that ResT can promote this reaction with the physiological substrate of ssDNA complexed with its cognate ssDNA binding protein (SSB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we demonstrate that ResT interacts with SSB via the conserved amphipathic C-terminal tail (Ct) of SSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Eubacterial ssDNA binding proteins serve as general assembly platforms for the recruitment of DNA replication, recombination and repair enzymes to sites of SSB-complexed ssDNA (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The observed interaction of ResT with SSB and its ability to promote single-strand annealing of SSB complexed ssDNA are properties held in common with the recombinational mediator, RecO, of the RecF pathway. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Examples of single-strand annealing proteins that act directly as recombinases include the phage-derived Redβ/RecT and ERF families of recombinases (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Paradigm examples of mediators include the eukaryotic Rad52, E. coli RecO and T4 UvsY proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Recombinational mediators share the properties of (i) promoting the annealing of complementary DNA strands complexed with their cognate ssDNA binding proteins, RPA, SSB and T4 gp32, respectively, for the above examples (38–40); and (ii) they aid and stabilize the loading of their cognate recombinase onto ssDNA substrates complexed with ssDNA binding protein (Rad51, RecA and T4 UvsX; (34–36,41)). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Our demonstration that ResT possesses the first property of canonical recombinational mediators raises the possibility that ResT may play a RecO-like role in Borrelia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Like ResT, RecO is recruited to ssDNA by an interaction with the C-terminal tail of SSB and this interaction is required for RecO to promote single-strand annealing reactions with substrates bound by SSB (42). B. burgdorferi is unusual in not possessing identifiable homologs of the RecFOR and RecQ proteins (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The RecF pathway mediates RecA-dependent events that contribute to recovery from replication stress and/or DNA damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Impediments to replication fork progression have different consequences depending upon whether the impediment occurs on the leading or lagging template strands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The replisome can often skip over a lagging strand lesion, leaving in its wake a daughter strand gap (43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Impediments on the leading strand can cause arrest of the replication fork (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Studies of the genetic requirements, in E. coli, of repair of damage caused by UV-irradiation have revealed a role for the RecF pathway both in promoting recombinational repair of daughter strand gaps and in contributing to replication fork processing events that stabilize arrested forks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>This allows for rapid recovery of replication after fork arrest (45–47). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>In both cases, RecFOR mediates the loading of RecA onto gapped DNA bound by SSB and the DNA pairing activity of RecA is used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>B. burgdorferi is highly unusual in not displaying increased sensitivity to UV-irradiation in strains mutated for a host of recombination and repair functions, including RecA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The only system that has been identified as needed for recovery from UV-irradiation is the nucleotide excision repair system (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Additionally, many recombination and repair functions, including RecA, are not required for the gene conversion reactions that drive antigenic variation at the vlsE locus, though a strong requirement for the RuvAB Holliday junction branch migrase implies some variety of strand exchange reaction is involved (49,50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The most extensively characterized antigenic variation system in bacteria, pilE switching in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is dependent upon RecA action in the RecF pathway (51,52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Either these processes are fundamentally different in B. burgdorferi or there is a functional alternative to the RecF pathway present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that ResT can promote limited strand exchange reactions between ssDNA donors and partial duplex targets (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The finding, in this report, that ResT cannot promote these reactions when the ssDNA present in both the donor and partial duplex target DNA is bound by SSB suggests that ResT function may be limited, in vivo, to single-strand annealing reactions and possibly mediator function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The product of the λ orf gene suppresses recF, recO and recR mutations, demonstrating that RecFOR functions can be provided by a single protein (53). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be needed to establish the degree of specificity of ResT for the chromosomal SSB used here and to establish whether the RecO-like properties also extend to ResT mediating the loading of RecA, or other recombinase, onto ssDNA coated with SSB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>A related Borrelia species that causes relapsing fever, Borrelia hermsii, possesses a plasmid-encoded SSB with homology to the B. burgdorferi protein studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Therefore, some Borrelia species or strains may harbor multiple SSB variants (54). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Similarly, tests for mediator function in recombinase loading will need to take into account that B. burgdorferi possesses not only a chromosomally encoded RecA but also multiple plasmid-encoded copies of an ERF family recombinase (1,2). </plain></SENT>
