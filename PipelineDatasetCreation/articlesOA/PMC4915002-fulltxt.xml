The methyltransferase complex MtrA&#x02013;H of methanogenic archaea has a key function in energy conservation by catalysing the methyl transfer from methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M and its coupling with sodium-ion translocation. The cobalamin-binding subunit MtrA is not homologous to any known B<sub>12</sub>-binding proteins and is proposed as the motor of the sodium-ion pump. Here, we present crystal structures of the soluble domain of the membrane-associated MtrA from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> and the cytoplasmic MtrA homologue/cobalamin complex from <italic>Methanothermus fervidus</italic>. The MtrA fold corresponds to the Rossmann-type &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; fold, which is also found in many cobalamin-containing proteins. Surprisingly, the cobalamin-binding site of MtrA differed greatly from all the other cobalamin-binding sites. Nevertheless, the hydrogen-bond linkage at the lower axial-ligand site of cobalt was equivalently constructed to that found in other methyltransferases and mutases. A distinct polypeptide segment fixed through the hydrogen-bond linkage in the relaxed Co(III) state might be involved in propagating the energy released upon corrinoid demethylation to the sodium-translocation site by a conformational change.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In the methanogenic pathway from H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, the membrane-spanning methyl-tetrahydromethanopterin (CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>MPT):coenzyme M (CoM-SH) methyltransferase complex (MtrA&#x02013;H) catalyses the exergonic methyl transfer from CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>MPT to CoM-SH (&#x00394;G&#x000b0;&#x02032;&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;30&#x02009;kJ/mol) coupled with endergonic sodium-ion gradient formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

Based on the intensively studied coordination and redox chemistry of cobalamins, the histidine ligand is not coordinated to cobalt in the reduced non-methylated cob(I)alamin form (base-off/His-off), which is in contrast to the methylated cob(III)alamin form (base-off/His-on)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.

These cytoplasmic MtrA homologues consist only of a soluble cobalamin-binding domain of 170&#x02013;180 amino acids, which is in contrast to the approximately 250 amino acids of membrane-associated MtrA. Truncated MtrA and MtrA homologues of methanogens have a sequence identity of 60&#x02013;97%. MtrA homologues have also been identified in the genomes of some bacteria and non-methanogenic archaea. Despite their low sequence identity compared to membrane-associated MtrA (~40%), the key residue His84 is mostly conserved.</p><p>Membrane-associated MtrA devoid of the C-terminal transmembrane helix was over-produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 20 years ago in a soluble but cobalamin-free form, and the holoenzyme was reconstituted by unfolding and refolding in the presence of cobalamin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. However, cobalamin appears to bind less tightly to isolated MtrA than to MtrA in the MtrA&#x02013;H complex. Here, we report on the X-ray structures of the B<sub>12</sub>-binding domain of membrane-associated MtrA from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> and of the MtrA homologue from <italic>M. fervidus</italic> in complex with cobalamin. Analyses of these structures reveal a cobalamin-binding site that differs from other B<sub>12</sub>-binding proteins in an unexpected manner and also provides initial hints of how the energy of cobalt demethylation is transformed into conformational energy used for the ultimate sodium-ion translocation process.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental basis</title><p>To structurally characterize cobalamin-binding MtrA, we overproduce the soluble domain of MtrA of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic>, <italic>M. marburgensis</italic>, <italic>M. evestigatum</italic> and <italic>M. kandleri</italic> and the cytoplasmic MtrA homologues from <italic>M. fervidus</italic> and <italic>M. evestigatum</italic>. The use of the cytoplasmic MtrA homologues as models for MtrA in order to increase the crystallization space is justified because of the high sequence identity, e.g. 97% between membrane-associated MtrA and the MtrA homologue of <italic>M. fervidus</italic>. Because of the stability of bound B<sub>12</sub>, we used the MtrA homologue of <italic>M. fervidus</italic> and the genetically truncated MtrA of <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> (see Materials and methods).</p><p>The cytoplasmic MtrA homologue from <italic>M. fervidus</italic> was produced by heterologous expression as the cobalamin-free apoenzyme. The holoenzyme was subsequently reconstituted after unfolding and refolding by dilution with a buffer containing either methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin. Both refolded MtrA solutions were pink and showed characteristic UV/Vis spectra of cob(III)alamin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). After 1&#x02009;day of incubation, the reconstituted MtrA homologue&#x02012;hydroxocobalamin complex solution turned orange; the UV-Vis spectrum revealed the cob(II)alamin state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. The tight binding of cobalamin to the MtrA homologue was verified by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE of unheated samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Crystals of the MtrA homologue containing hydroxocobalamin grew after one year, and a unique crystal diffracted to 3.0&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution. Phases were determined by using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method with cobalt as the anomalous scatterer. The structure revealed three cytoplasmic MtrA molecules in an asymmetric unit arranged as a homotrimer with a three-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The trimer was mainly linked together by a covalent bond between the cobalt of cobalamin of one molecule and His35 of its neighbour. Cytoplasmic MtrA in complex with methyl-cobalamin did not crystallize under these conditions; the methyl group bound to cobalamin may prevent the coordination between cobalt and His35 of the neighbouring molecule. The occupancy of the upper axial ligation site by a histidine is presumably not physiologically relevant because the enzyme needs to switch from Co(I) to CH<sub>3</sub>-Co(III) during the reaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The absence of a significant contact area between the subunits is in line with this assumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>The soluble domain of membrane-associated MtrA from <italic>M. jannaschii</italic> lacking the transmembrane helix was heterologously expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>). We were again able to incorporate cobalamin into the apoenzyme by unfolding and refolding the protein, as verified by UV/Vis spectroscopy. Crystallization failed, possibly because the flexible part of the juxtamembrane segment (amino acids 161&#x02013;220, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>) between the transmembrane helix and the B<sub>12</sub> domain disturbed the crystallization process. We therefore partially digested reconstituted MtrA with trypsin to remove this region. Unfortunately, the cobalamin content decreased to less than 50%, which suggested a role of the juxtamembrane segment in stabilizing the prosthetic group. The proteolysis product of MtrA yielded colourless cobalamin-free crystals that diffracted to 1.85&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the model of cytoplasmic MtrA homologue as a search template. A malate molecule from the crystallization solution was bound to the binding site of the phosphate group of cobalamin of the MtrA homologue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6</xref>). The overall structures of the two MtrA variants were almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>), which was reflected by a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.37&#x02009;&#x000c5; for a 127&#x02009;C<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> backbone and a sequence identity of 65%.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overall architecture of MtrA</title><p>The two MtrA variants studied here consist of a single domain with a Rossmann-like open &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) that, except for dioldehydratases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, ribonucleotide reductases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and reductive dehalogenases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, is characteristic of B<sub>12</sub> enzymes (such as the cobalamin-containing fragment of methionine synthase from <italic>E. coli</italic>, MetH, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). Although they share a common core topology motif &#x003b2;2&#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1&#x003b1;2&#x003b2;3&#x003b1;3&#x003b2;4&#x003b1;4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>), the &#x003b2;-sheet&#x02013;&#x003b1;-helix arrangements, strand twisting and secondary structure linkers drastically vary between MtrA and other Rossmann-type B<sub>12</sub> domains. In fact, MtrA is structurally more related to the functionally distinct pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDB code: 1ik6) or succinyl-CoA synthetase (PDB code: 1euc) domains than to any B<sub>12</sub> enzyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7</xref>). The Z-scores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> of the superimposed structures of MtrA and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDB code: 1ik6) and succinyl-CoA synthase (PDB code: 1euc) are 8.4 and 8.1; the Z-scores of MtrA and the most related B<sub>12</sub> domains of methionine synthase (1bmt) and methanol cobalamin methyltransferase (2i2x) are 4.5 and 5.5, respectively. The B<sub>12</sub>-binding protein, which has the highest Z-score (5.6) to MtrA, is monomethylamine corrinoid protein from <italic>M. barkeri</italic> (3ezx).</p><p>In MtrA, the core motif is extended by an N-terminally fused segment that is partly associated as an antiparallel &#x003b2;-strand (&#x003b2;0) to the central &#x003b2;-sheet and an expanded insertion region between helix &#x003b1;3 and strand &#x003b2;4 consisting of a unique meander-like segment and an &#x003b1;-helix (&#x003b1;3&#x02032;). &#x003b2;0 and the unique meander-like segment are involved in cobalamin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The B<sub>12</sub> domains of the corrinoid iron-sulphur proteins also contain an extra N-terminal antiparallel strand, whereas those of methanol cobalamin methyltransferase, methionine synthetase (MetH) and mutases are alternatively extended at the C-terminal end of the shared core by one strand (&#x003b2;5) and one helix (&#x003b1;5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p><p>The C-terminal stretch (amino acids 156&#x02013;170) of truncated MtrA from <italic>M. jannaschii</italic>, which is classified as part of the juxtamembrane segment, turns back from helix &#x003b1;4 towards the C-terminal side of the central &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). This chain trace does not appear to be due to crystal lattice effects because several salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts between this stretch and the core domain were formed. The remaining 40&#x02013;50 residues of the juxtamembrane segment appear to be flexible, at least in the truncated form because of the accessibility of this segment for proteolytic cleavage. A flexible connection of the B<sub>12</sub> domain to the transmembrane helix is functionally useful for juggling between the methyl donor and acceptor in analogy to methionine synthetase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, corrinoid iron-sulphur protein methyltransferase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> and methanol-corrinoid methyltransferase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, although parts of the juxtamembrane segment might be attached to other subunits of the MtrA&#x02013;H complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The cobalamin binding mode</title><p>The cobalamin bound to the cytoplasmic MtrA homologue was positioned at the C-terminal region of the central &#x003b2;-sheet in a base-off/His-on configuration, which confirms previous EPR and mutational analyses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Cobalamin was bound into a largely preformed binding site inferred from the highly similar structures of the cobalamin-loaded and -unloaded MtrA variants.

In the obtained crystal form, His35 from another MtrA molecule of the asymmetric unit occupied the sixth ligation site of cobalt, which resulted in a hexacoordinated Co(III) oxidation state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, two propionamide substituents of the corrinoid ring were hydrogen bonded with Asn82-NH or bidentately bonded with the Asn55 amide (the latter was observed only in two molecules of the asymmetric unit) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8</xref>).</p><p>The nucleotide tail was accurately embedded into a dominantly hydrophobic pocket lined with &#x003b2;0, &#x003b2;1, &#x003b2;2, helix &#x003b1;2, loop &#x003b2;2-&#x003b1;2 and the N-terminal segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) and firmly fixed by multiple hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds to Asp17-N, Lys52-N, Thr53-OG1 and -N, Gly57-O, and Asn64-ND2. The dimethylbenzimidazole group was sandwiched between the hydrophobic side chains of Tyr18 and Val61.

The corrinoid rings are surrounded by different loops and the nucleotide tails bind at different sides of the central &#x003b2;-sheet. Consequently, none of the cobalamin&#x02013;polypeptide interactions is conserved between MtrA and all other Rossmann-type B<sub>12</sub> enzymes.

In MtrA, His84 pointing from a protrusion of loop &#x003b2;3-&#x003b1;3 towards the corrinoid ring, was coordinated to Co(III) via NE2 and was hydrogen bonded via ND1 to Glu54-OE1. Glu54 projecting from loop &#x003b2;2-&#x003b1;2 further interacted via OE1 and OE2 to Glu54-N and Ile111-N, respectively, which mutually fixes the position of the carboxylate and the interacting loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Ile111 is a residue of the pronounced meander-like segment following helix &#x003b1;3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S13</xref>). In methionine synthase, methanol cobalamin methyltransferase, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, a functionally analogous glutamate or aspartate was identified that was hydrogen bonded with a proton-donating serine, threonine and peptide amide, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, albeit in completely different polypeptide environments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref> for methionine synthase). As determined for methionine synthase, the catalytic His-Asp-hydrogen-bonding donor linkage stabilizes the Co(III) state via histidine protonation and controls conformational signalling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>According to current opinion, the sodium ion translocation process is induced by the demethylation of methyl-cob(III)alamin to cob(I)alamin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This reaction results in a repulsion between the electron-rich species Co(I) and His-imidazolium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. The accompanied displacement of the His-imidazolium is specifically propagated to adjacent polypeptide segments and from there to MtrE (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). We have determined the structure of MtrA in a cobalamin-free and cob(III)alamin-bound form, both representing relaxed conformations, but not in a strained cob(I)alamin form. Although our experimental data do not allow for deeper mechanistic insights, the protrusion after helix &#x003b1;3 and the adjacent insertion region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figs 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5</xref>) are structural elements susceptible to conformational changes. In particular, the unique meander-like segment of the insertion region has only a few contacts to the protein core but is strongly connected to His84 (via Glu54) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S13</xref>), which might oscillate between two positions depending on the oxidation state of cobalt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. This surface region is relatively mobile and deviates between the two MtrA variants more than most other regions. Together with the loops &#x003b2;2-&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b2;3-&#x003b1;3, which contain Glu54 and His84, respectively, the meander-like segment is the most conserved region in MtrA and even allows for the identification of the consensus sequence <sup>109</sup>GAIPF-Y/F-XEN (X: hydrophobic amino acids), which emphasizes its importance. The structural rearrangement could possibly be detected in the structure of a His-unligated Co(I) state, but this structure is not easily obtainable.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Crystal structures of two MtrA variants revealed a detailed view of a novel binding site for cobalamin inside a Rossmann-type domain compared with all other Rossmann-type B<sub>12</sub> enzymes studied so far. Nevertheless, several functionally characteristic features were designed in an equivalent manner. They include an exposed corrinoid ring at the top of loops at the C-terminal side of the central &#x003b2;-sheet, an elongated conformation of cobalamin with the nucleotide tail between the &#x003b2;-sheet&#x02013;&#x003b1;-helix layer, albeit on opposite sides, and a His-Glu-proton donor linkage on the lower axial side of the corrinoid ring.</p><p>The structure of cytoplasmic MtrA complexed with cobalamin and the structure of the soluble domain of MtrA without cobalamin were essentially identical. This finding suggested that the MtrA structures observed in this work were relaxed forms. The possible repellent effect of cob(I)alamin towards the histidine residue probably causes a conformational change in the MtrA protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.
