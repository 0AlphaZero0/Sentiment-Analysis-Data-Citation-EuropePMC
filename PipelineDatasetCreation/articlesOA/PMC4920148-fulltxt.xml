Activating mutations in <italic>ACVR1</italic> are responsible for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare disease characterized by congenital toe malformation and progressive heterotopic endochondral ossification leading to severe and cumulative disability. Until now, no therapy has been available to prevent soft-tissue swelling (flare-ups) that trigger the ossification process. With the aim of finding a new therapeutic strategy for FOP, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify inhibitors of <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene expression among drugs already approved for the therapy of other diseases. The screening, based on an <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter assay, was followed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> test to validate and characterize candidate molecules. Among compounds that modulate the <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter activity, we selected the one showing the highest inhibitory effect, dipyridamole, a drug that is currently used as a platelet anti-aggregant. The inhibitory effect was detectable on <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene expression, on the whole Smad-dependent BMP signaling pathway, and on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes by <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular assays. Moreover, dipyridamole reduced the process of heterotopic bone formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our drug repositioning strategy has led to the identification of dipyridamole as a possible therapeutic tool for the treatment of FOP.

The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (<xref rid="DMM023929C53" ref-type="bibr">Shore et al., 2005</xref>). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously. Inflammatory soft-tissue swellings, commonly called flare-ups, progressively transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and aponeuroses into a second skeleton of heterotopic bone (<xref rid="DMM023929C25" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The FOP gene (<italic>ACVR1</italic>) encodes a type I receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), ACVR1 (also known as ALK-2). The most recurrent <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation is in the glycine-serine (GS) domain (c.617G&#x0003e;A, p.R206H) (<xref rid="DMM023929C54" ref-type="bibr">Shore et al., 2006</xref>). Additional mutations have been identified in the GS and in the kinase domain of the protein in 3% of all known individuals with FOP (for a review, see <xref rid="DMM023929C26" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C4" ref-type="bibr">Bocciardi et al., 2009</xref>). The consequence of <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations is an alteration of inter-intramolecular interaction of the mutant receptor that causes a deregulation of the downstream BMP signaling (<xref rid="DMM023929C54" ref-type="bibr">Shore et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C4" ref-type="bibr">Bocciardi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C57" ref-type="bibr">van Dinther et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C55" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C17" ref-type="bibr">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C5" ref-type="bibr">Chaikuad et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At present, no established medical treatment is available for FOP. Early diagnosis prevents unnecessary interventions, such as biopsies or surgical operations that can exacerbate the progression of the disease, and high-dose glucocorticoids are used in the management of inflammatory flare-ups (<xref rid="DMM023929C27" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, much effort has been devoted to designing new therapeutic approaches to FOP treatment and to identify new, potentially useful, drugs (<xref rid="DMM023929C27" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C45" ref-type="bibr">Sanvitale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C62" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C31" ref-type="bibr">Kitoh et al., 2013</xref>). A promising alternative to the discovery of new drugs is the drug repositioning strategy, in which a drug already developed for a specific disease can be used to treat a different condition. Drug repositioning reduces costs and accelerates the drug development process. Moreover, this approach might contribute to clarify the mechanism of action of a given compound by establishing a relationship between the molecular basis of the disease and the ability of the compound to intervene at a certain step of the disease process (<xref rid="DMM023929C49" ref-type="bibr">Shameer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A possible strategy to find drugs for the treatment of a genetic disease could rely on a sensitive, specific and fast cell-based assay. In this way, a large number of small molecules can be screened [high-throughput screening (HTS)] to find agents that correct the basic defect. The recent identification and characterization of the promoter region of <italic>ACVR1</italic> (<xref rid="DMM023929C15" ref-type="bibr">Giacopelli et al., 2013</xref>) inspired us to develop an HTS assay by generating cells stably expressing the luciferase reporter gene controlled by a 2.9-kb region of the gene promoter. We expected that this type of assay would allow the identification of molecules that, by inhibiting the <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter, would also negatively regulate the downstream signaling that is upregulated and hyper-responsive to BMPs because of the mutation in the receptor.</p><p>In this work, we describe the screening of a library of 1280 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds, in order to identify modulators of <italic>AC</italic><italic>VR1</italic> gene expression. Characterization of hit molecules included a series of second-level assays to evaluate the effect of compounds on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation models <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We found that dipyridamole, commonly used as an antithrombotic and vasodilator drug, has an inhibitory effect on <italic>ACVR1</italic> expression, as well as on the whole BMP signaling pathway, and is able to affect chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, both in cellular assays and in a BMP-induced HO mouse model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Screening of the Prestwick Chemical Library</title><p>Our primary screening was designed to find drugs that downregulate BMP signaling by targeting the expression of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene at the transcriptional level. Accordingly, we developed a quantitative assay based on expression of a reporter gene under the control of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter. To this end, we generated clones of the ATDC5 cell line (mouse chondrogenic cell line derived from teratocarcinoma) stably expressing the luciferase coding sequence under the control of the 2.9-kb promoter of the gene, previously characterized by our group (<xref rid="DMM023929C15" ref-type="bibr">Giacopelli et al., 2013</xref>). We obtained several clones that were expanded and selected for the level and stability of reporter gene expression over time. The availability of different clones, with putative different integration sites of the reporter construct in the genome of ATDC5 cells, allowed us to verify that the effect measured for a given compound was not related to a &#x02018;position effect&#x02019; operated by the genomic region surrounding the reporter construct itself.</p><p>The generated cell system and the compound analysis procedure were tested by screening a small library of 43 molecules with chromatin-modifier properties. This allowed us to validate the protocol for the primary screening and provided us with a positive control because we identified resveratrol as a transcriptional activator of <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene expression (<uri xlink:href="http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dmm.023929/-/DC1">Fig.&#x000a0;S1</uri>).</p><p>We used these cells to screen the Prestwick Chemical Library, which includes 1280 FDA-approved compounds, with the idea that &#x02018;repositioning&#x02019; of an already approved drug could have the great advantage to overcome several steps of the drug discovery process. The screening detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM023929TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> (see also <uri xlink:href="http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dmm.023929/-/DC1">Fig.&#x000a0;S2</uri>) was performed in duplicate: compounds were added to cells seeded in 96-well plates for 24&#x02005;h at the concentrations of 20 and 2&#x02005;&#x000b5;M, respectively. We included in each plate DMSO, the vehicle in which compounds are dissolved, and resveratrol (20&#x02005;&#x000b5;M) as a transcriptional activator of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter and positive control. When we started this work, no transcriptional inhibitors of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> expression were known. However, during the screening of the second plate of the Prestwick Chemical Library, we detected dipyridamole as an inhibitor of <italic>ACVR1</italic> expression. Therefore, this compound was subsequently included in all the remaining plates as an additional control. To monitor the performance of the screening, we used the Z&#x02032;-factor statistical parameter (<xref rid="DMM023929C64" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). The calculated Z&#x02032;-factor was 0.63&#x000b1;0.1 and 0.65&#x000b1;0.1 when considering resveratrol and dipyridamole, respectively. These values are considered optimal for an HTS assay (<xref rid="DMM023929C64" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). During the primary screening, we also evaluated the toxicity of all tested compounds by an <italic>in situ</italic> fluorescence-based assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="DMM023929TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and see Materials and Methods for details). We therefore normalized the activity of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the <italic>ACVR1</italic> promoter with a fluorescence signal proportional to the number of viable cells at the end of the treatment. This allowed us to select molecules not affecting cell viability, inducing a reduction in the luciferase activity of at least 0.4- or an upregulation of at least 2.4-fold compared to cells treated with DMSO (<uri xlink:href="http://dmm.biologists.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1242/dmm.023929/-/DC1">Table&#x000a0;S1</uri>).

Therefore, intense work is being carried out to find potential therapeutic intervention essentially based on inhibition of BMP signaling using different approaches (<xref rid="DMM023929C27" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The rationale basis of a therapeutic approach for FOP is that small molecules might function as inhibitors, thus correcting the hyper-functioning BMP signaling pathway(s), either by inhibiting directly the receptor function or the transcriptional or post-transcriptional expression of the encoding gene, which will in turn result in the quantitative reduction of the receptor protein.</p><p>Following the identification of dorsomorphin as an inhibitor of BMP type I receptors, through HTS in zebrafish (<xref rid="DMM023929C63" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2008b</xref>), other inhibitors have been described (<xref rid="DMM023929C62" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C10" ref-type="bibr">Cuny et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C18" ref-type="bibr">Hao et al., 2010</xref>). Previously published work demonstrated that treatment of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with RAR-&#x003b3; agonists negatively regulates BMP signaling. This is due to the reduction of the intracellular concentration of p-Smads by a post-translational mechanism of degradation, supporting the idea that quantitative reduction of components of this pathway might cause a reduction of signaling function (<xref rid="DMM023929C45" ref-type="bibr">Sanvitale et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C51" ref-type="bibr">Shimono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C50" ref-type="bibr">Sheng et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the current work, we introduced an HTS approach aimed at identifying potential therapeutic candidates acting by modulation of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene expression. The primary screening was made possible by the generation of a cell system consisting of murine ATDC5 cells stably expressing the luciferase gene controlled by the 2.9-kb promoter region of <italic>ACVR1</italic> that was previously identified and functionally characterized by our group (<xref rid="DMM023929C15" ref-type="bibr">Giacopelli et al., 2013</xref>). Our method was able to pinpoint molecules with both positive and negative effects. However, in the context of FOP pathogenesis, in which activating mutations of <italic>ACVR1</italic> cause an inappropriate BMP-mediated signaling, our interest was focused on molecules able to reduce the expression level of the gene.</p><p>In addition to the primary screening, our approach included assays to confirm the effect of candidate molecules on the different steps of the BMP pathway, on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes and on HO <italic>in vivo</italic>. The experimental procedure described in this workflow can also be exploited to test compounds able to affect BMP signaling, even when discovered by other cell-based HTS assays or by <italic>in silico</italic> virtual screening approaches.</p><p>An advantageous approach to search for innovative treatments for rare disease in a relative short time is to perform an HTS approach with a drug repositioning purpose (<xref rid="DMM023929C38" ref-type="bibr">Muthyala, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C32" ref-type="bibr">Li and Jones, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C46" ref-type="bibr">Sardana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C60" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). To this aim, we screened a library of 1280 FDA-approved compounds. We identified a list of interesting molecules with positive or negative effect and decided to focus on the candidate with the most significant effect as a transcriptional inhibitor, dipyridamole.</p><p>Validation assays confirmed a specific negative effect of Dipy on the <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene expression and demonstrated that such an effect resulted in the attenuation of the entire BMP-specific signaling pathway. This was demonstrated by the reduction of BMP2-induced activation tested by the luciferase reporter gene under the control of BMP-responsive element (BRE-Luc). Consistently, this effect was confirmed as reduced expression of the Smad-signaling target genes <italic>Id1</italic>, <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, and as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 mediators.</p><p>Although the highest effect of Dipy treatment was found to impact <italic>ACVR1</italic> (<italic>Alk2</italic>) expression, we found that Dipy could also affect the expression of other BMP receptors that can synergistically contribute to the downregulation of the overall BMP signaling, such as, among type I receptors, Alk3 or, among type II, BMPRII, which cooperates with ACVR1 as a type I partner in the receptor complex. It is of interest to note that Dipy did not affect the expression of specific receptors, such as <italic>Alk5</italic>, which is involved in cascade mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; type I, or <italic>Alk4</italic>, <italic>ActRIIa</italic> and <italic>ActIIb</italic>, which intervene in GDF-BMP signaling. This finding suggests that the downregulating effect of Dipy is mainly, but not exclusively, exerted on Alk2 (ACVR1), possibly because of common regulatory mechanisms for the expression of molecules belonging to the same family and participating in common pathways.</p><p>Because HO in FOP derives from an endochondral ossification process (<xref rid="DMM023929C24" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C35" ref-type="bibr">Medici and Olsen, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C52" ref-type="bibr">Shore, 2012</xref>), we set up assays to evaluate both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. To simulate differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we took advantage of the ability of ATDC5 cells to differentiate towards mature chondrocytes in 3D cultures, with cell morphological changes and deposition of glycosaminoglycans typical of the cartilage extracellular matrix. Using this assay, we observed that Dipy could inhibit chondrogenic differentiation.</p><p>C2C12 cells were used to evaluate osteogenic differentiation, which was inhibited by Dipy as indicated by the reduction in the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression of different markers (Runx2, osterix and osteocalcin).</p><p>The effect of Dipy was also verified <italic>in vivo</italic> in a BMP-induced mouse model of HO (<xref rid="DMM023929C111" ref-type="bibr">Medici et al., 2010</xref>). During the induction of the ectopic ossification process, triggered by the implantation of a BMP2-embedded Matrigel coupled to cardiotoxin (CTX) injection, muscle fibers degenerate and the site of injury is infiltrated by different populations of inflammatory cells that contribute to the orchestration of the subsequent repair/differentiation process (<xref rid="DMM023929C65" ref-type="bibr">Zordan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C44" ref-type="bibr">Rigamonti et al., 2014</xref>). During the first week after injury, progenitor cells of different origin are then recruited to the site of the lesion (<xref rid="DMM023929C3" ref-type="bibr">Bentzinger et al., 2013</xref>) and committed towards the endochondral ossification process by the local presence of BMP2. At 10&#x02005;days, HO lesions are not completely differentiated, and recruitment and activation of cells is ongoing: this was consistent with our finding that, at this stage, the overall number of cells able to respond by activating a specific BMP2/Smad-dependent signaling was higher than what was observed at 21&#x02005;days after BMP2 induction.</p><p>At the earliest time point, the effect of treatment with Dipy became evident as a statistically significant decrease in the number of cells expressing an activated BMP/Smad pathway inside the HO lesions that finally resulted in the reduction of the volume of mineralized heterotopic ossicles, of decreased deposition of extracellular matrix and of a reduced area of calcified nodules that we observed after 21&#x02005;days of treatment.</p><p>Most interestingly, Dipy effect was evident also when mice were treated after the establishment of heterotopic ossification, and resulted in a reduced calcium deposition within the ectopic bone and a decreased mineralization. However, concerning the choice of an <italic>in vivo</italic> prevention strategy versus a treatment on established/ongoing lesions, it is important to consider that the course of FOP is episodic with quiescent phases, lasting even for years, and acute phases that can be triggered by several types of recognizable stimuli (trauma, vaccinations, infection, iatrogenic harms etc.), but that can also occur apparently spontaneously or, more likely, without a recognizable trigger. In this context, a treatment for FOP is ideally a drug that can be administered chronically or for long periods of time in order to prevent the occurrence of even unpredictable flare-ups, thus counteracting their consequences.</p><p>Dipy is a commercially available drug that was introduced on the market more than 50&#x02005;years ago as a coronary vasodilator (<xref rid="DMM023929C22" ref-type="bibr">Kadatz, 1959</xref>). At present, it is widely used as an antithrombotic and vasodilator agent both as monotherapy and in combination with aspirin to prevent secondary stroke or transient ischemic attack (<xref rid="DMM023929C16" ref-type="bibr">Gresele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C2" ref-type="bibr">Balakumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C11" ref-type="bibr">de Vos-Koppelaar et al., 2014</xref>). At the pharmacological level, Dipy acts by different mechanisms. By inhibiting the activity of phosphodiesterases 5 and 3 (PDE5 and PDE3), it increases the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is a potent inhibitor of platelet activation, and of cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP), which has a vasodilator effect on smooth muscle, thus potentiating the platelet inhibitory actions of prostacyclin (PGI2) (<xref rid="DMM023929C16" ref-type="bibr">Gresele et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C11" ref-type="bibr">de Vos-Koppelaar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C30" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Liao, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C61" ref-type="bibr">Yip and Benavente, 2011</xref>). Moreover, Dipy inhibits the re-uptake of adenosine by blocking the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs), thus increasing plasma levels of this nucleoside, which also plays a role in inhibiting platelet aggregation (<xref rid="DMM023929C30" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Liao, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C58" ref-type="bibr">Visser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C12" ref-type="bibr">Dresse et al., 1982</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C14" ref-type="bibr">German et al., 1989</xref>), regulation of vascular tone, vasodilation, immunity and inflammation (<xref rid="DMM023929C30" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Liao, 2008</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that the effect of Dipy in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay of C2C12 cells was not in accordance with other <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments performed to correlate adenosine level to osteoblast differentiation (<xref rid="DMM023929C8" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C20" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). This discrepancy might be due to differences in the cellular model and experimental conditions. Moreover, very recently, <xref rid="DMM023929C36" ref-type="bibr">Mediero and colleagues (</xref><xref rid="DMM023929C36" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported that local daily injection of Dipy administered with a collagen sponge was able to induce bone regeneration and proposed this treatment as an alternative to recombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2). At difference with the above report, in the BMP-induced <italic>in vivo</italic> model that we used, HO was locally triggered in quadriceps muscles, whereas treatment with Dipy was systemic, by daily IP injection. Moreover, it has been shown that, in humans, blood cells tend to accumulate the drug (<xref rid="DMM023929C48" ref-type="bibr">Serebruany et al., 2009</xref>), and Dipy is able to inhibit at the mRNA level the production of TNF-&#x003b1; and MMP-9 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and derived macrophages (<xref rid="DMM023929C34" ref-type="bibr">Massaro et al., 2013</xref>). Because several types of immune cells are recruited at the site of HO lesions, this might contribute to the overall effect observed in our HO model.</p><p>Several observations suggest a role of an immune-mediated response in FOP pathogenesis, in particular a possible relevant contribution to the episodic neo-formation of ectopic bone. In humans, FOP flare-ups can be triggered or exacerbated by trauma, immunizations, medical procedures and infections, all of which are conditions in which the immune response is solicited/stimulated (for a review, see <xref rid="DMM023929C28" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>). Both in humans and in animal models, histological examination of early pre-osseous lesions has clearly demonstrated that several types of immune cells, such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and mast cells, are readily recruited to these sites (<xref rid="DMM023929C24" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C6" ref-type="bibr">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>).

Activin A is a ligand member of the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily that is rapidly released during inflammation and considered a crucial mediator of inflammation and immunity. Its activity is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor ligands and oxidative stress, and it is involved in regulating growth and maturation of mast cells, monocyte/macrophage differentiation, and interaction between natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells (<xref rid="DMM023929C13" ref-type="bibr">Funaba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C40" ref-type="bibr">Ogawa and Funaba, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C1" ref-type="bibr">Aleman-Muench and Soldevila, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="DMM023929C47" ref-type="bibr">Seeger et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the known pleiotropic effect of Dipy, with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties, and the complexity of the action of a drug <italic>in vivo</italic>, related to its absorption, metabolism and distribution, we cannot exclude that the observed decrease of ectopic ossification in our <italic>in vivo</italic> model might depend on the involvement of different pathways.
