</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory soft-tissue swellings, commonly called flare-ups, progressively transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and aponeuroses into a second skeleton of heterotopic bone (Kaplan et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The FOP gene (ACVR1) encodes a type I receptor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), ACVR1 (also known as ALK-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The most recurrent ACVR1 mutation is in the glycine-serine (GS) domain (c.617G&gt;A, p.R206H) (Shore et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Additional mutations have been identified in the GS and in the kinase domain of the protein in 3% of all known individuals with FOP (for a review, see Kaplan et al., 2009; Bocciardi et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The consequence of ACVR1 mutations is an alteration of inter-intramolecular interaction of the mutant receptor that causes a deregulation of the downstream BMP signaling (Shore et al., 2006; Bocciardi et al., 2009; van Dinther et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010; Groppe et al., 2011; Chaikuad et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>At present, no established medical treatment is available for FOP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis prevents unnecessary interventions, such as biopsies or surgical operations that can exacerbate the progression of the disease, and high-dose glucocorticoids are used in the management of inflammatory flare-ups (Kaplan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In recent years, much effort has been devoted to designing new therapeutic approaches to FOP treatment and to identify new, potentially useful, drugs (Kaplan et al., 2013; Sanvitale et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2008a; Kitoh et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A promising alternative to the discovery of new drugs is the drug repositioning strategy, in which a drug already developed for a specific disease can be used to treat a different condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Drug repositioning reduces costs and accelerates the drug development process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this approach might contribute to clarify the mechanism of action of a given compound by establishing a relationship between the molecular basis of the disease and the ability of the compound to intervene at a certain step of the disease process (Shameer et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A possible strategy to find drugs for the treatment of a genetic disease could rely on a sensitive, specific and fast cell-based assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this way, a large number of small molecules can be screened [high-throughput screening (HTS)] to find agents that correct the basic defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The recent identification and characterization of the promoter region of ACVR1 (Giacopelli et al., 2013) inspired us to develop an HTS assay by generating cells stably expressing the luciferase reporter gene controlled by a 2.9-kb region of the gene promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We expected that this type of assay would allow the identification of molecules that, by inhibiting the ACVR1 promoter, would also negatively regulate the downstream signaling that is upregulated and hyper-responsive to BMPs because of the mutation in the receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this work, we describe the screening of a library of 1280 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds, in order to identify modulators of ACVR1 gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Characterization of hit molecules included a series of second-level assays to evaluate the effect of compounds on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation models in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We found that dipyridamole, commonly used as an antithrombotic and vasodilator drug, has an inhibitory effect on ACVR1 expression, as well as on the whole BMP signaling pathway, and is able to affect chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, both in cellular assays and in a BMP-induced HO mouse model. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Our primary screening was designed to find drugs that downregulate BMP signaling by targeting the expression of the ACVR1 gene at the transcriptional level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we developed a quantitative assay based on expression of a reporter gene under the control of the ACVR1 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To this end, we generated clones of the ATDC5 cell line (mouse chondrogenic cell line derived from teratocarcinoma) stably expressing the luciferase coding sequence under the control of the 2.9-kb promoter of the gene, previously characterized by our group (Giacopelli et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We obtained several clones that were expanded and selected for the level and stability of reporter gene expression over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The availability of different clones, with putative different integration sites of the reporter construct in the genome of ATDC5 cells, allowed us to verify that the effect measured for a given compound was not related to a ‘position effect’ operated by the genomic region surrounding the reporter construct itself. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The generated cell system and the compound analysis procedure were tested by screening a small library of 43 molecules with chromatin-modifier properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to validate the protocol for the primary screening and provided us with a positive control because we identified resveratrol as a transcriptional activator of ACVR1 gene expression (Fig. S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We used these cells to screen the Prestwick Chemical Library, which includes 1280 FDA-approved compounds, with the idea that ‘repositioning’ of an already approved drug could have the great advantage to overcome several steps of the drug discovery process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The screening detailed in Table 1 (see also Fig. S2) was performed in duplicate: compounds were added to cells seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h at the concentrations of 20 and 2 µM, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We included in each plate DMSO, the vehicle in which compounds are dissolved, and resveratrol (20 µM) as a transcriptional activator of the ACVR1 promoter and positive control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>When we started this work, no transcriptional inhibitors of the ACVR1 expression were known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, during the screening of the second plate of the Prestwick Chemical Library, we detected dipyridamole as an inhibitor of ACVR1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this compound was subsequently included in all the remaining plates as an additional control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To monitor the performance of the screening, we used the Z′-factor statistical parameter (Zhang et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The calculated Z′-factor was 0.63±0.1 and 0.65±0.1 when considering resveratrol and dipyridamole, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>These values are considered optimal for an HTS assay (Zhang et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>During the primary screening, we also evaluated the toxicity of all tested compounds by an in situ fluorescence-based assay (Table 1 and see Materials and Methods for details). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We therefore normalized the activity of the luciferase reporter gene driven by the ACVR1 promoter with a fluorescence signal proportional to the number of viable cells at the end of the treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to select molecules not affecting cell viability, inducing a reduction in the luciferase activity of at least 0.4- or an upregulation of at least 2.4-fold compared to cells treated with DMSO (Table S1). Table 1.HTS assay protocol </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>According to our inclusion criteria, the primary screening provided a list of compounds putatively working as activators (4 hits) or inhibitors (18 hits) of ACVR1 transcriptional activity (listed in Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Among these latter molecules, we found that dipyridamole (abbreviated henceforth as Dipy), was the compound that, during the retesting of primary hits, generated the most reproducible and significant results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Dipy was selected for further experimental confirmations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Dipy showed a dose-dependent suppression of the luciferase activity driven by the ACVR1 promoter, with the strongest effect at 50 µM (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>To date, no therapy is available to prevent or control HO in FOP patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Therefore, intense work is being carried out to find potential therapeutic intervention essentially based on inhibition of BMP signaling using different approaches (Kaplan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The rationale basis of a therapeutic approach for FOP is that small molecules might function as inhibitors, thus correcting the hyper-functioning BMP signaling pathway(s), either by inhibiting directly the receptor function or the transcriptional or post-transcriptional expression of the encoding gene, which will in turn result in the quantitative reduction of the receptor protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Following the identification of dorsomorphin as an inhibitor of BMP type I receptors, through HTS in zebrafish (Yu et al., 2008b), other inhibitors have been described (Yu et al., 2008a; Cuny et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Previously published work demonstrated that treatment of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with RAR-γ agonists negatively regulates BMP signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This is due to the reduction of the intracellular concentration of p-Smads by a post-translational mechanism of degradation, supporting the idea that quantitative reduction of components of this pathway might cause a reduction of signaling function (Sanvitale et al., 2013; Shimono et al., 2011; Sheng et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the current work, we introduced an HTS approach aimed at identifying potential therapeutic candidates acting by modulation of the ACVR1 gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The primary screening was made possible by the generation of a cell system consisting of murine ATDC5 cells stably expressing the luciferase gene controlled by the 2.9-kb promoter region of ACVR1 that was previously identified and functionally characterized by our group (Giacopelli et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our method was able to pinpoint molecules with both positive and negative effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>However, in the context of FOP pathogenesis, in which activating mutations of ACVR1 cause an inappropriate BMP-mediated signaling, our interest was focused on molecules able to reduce the expression level of the gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In addition to the primary screening, our approach included assays to confirm the effect of candidate molecules on the different steps of the BMP pathway, on chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation processes and on HO in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The experimental procedure described in this workflow can also be exploited to test compounds able to affect BMP signaling, even when discovered by other cell-based HTS assays or by in silico virtual screening approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>An advantageous approach to search for innovative treatments for rare disease in a relative short time is to perform an HTS approach with a drug repositioning purpose (Muthyala, 2011; Li and Jones, 2012; Sardana et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we screened a library of 1280 FDA-approved compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We identified a list of interesting molecules with positive or negative effect and decided to focus on the candidate with the most significant effect as a transcriptional inhibitor, dipyridamole. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Validation assays confirmed a specific negative effect of Dipy on the ACVR1 gene expression and demonstrated that such an effect resulted in the attenuation of the entire BMP-specific signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This was demonstrated by the reduction of BMP2-induced activation tested by the luciferase reporter gene under the control of BMP-responsive element (BRE-Luc). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Consistently, this effect was confirmed as reduced expression of the Smad-signaling target genes Id1, Id2 and Id3, and as reduced phosphorylation of Smad1/5 mediators. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Although the highest effect of Dipy treatment was found to impact ACVR1 (Alk2) expression, we found that Dipy could also affect the expression of other BMP receptors that can synergistically contribute to the downregulation of the overall BMP signaling, such as, among type I receptors, Alk3 or, among type II, BMPRII, which cooperates with ACVR1 as a type I partner in the receptor complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>It is of interest to note that Dipy did not affect the expression of specific receptors, such as Alk5, which is involved in cascade mediated by TGF-β type I, or Alk4, ActRIIa and ActIIb, which intervene in GDF-BMP signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the downregulating effect of Dipy is mainly, but not exclusively, exerted on Alk2 (ACVR1), possibly because of common regulatory mechanisms for the expression of molecules belonging to the same family and participating in common pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Because HO in FOP derives from an endochondral ossification process (Kaplan et al., 1993; Medici and Olsen, 2012; Shore, 2012), we set up assays to evaluate both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>To simulate differentiation in vitro, we took advantage of the ability of ATDC5 cells to differentiate towards mature chondrocytes in 3D cultures, with cell morphological changes and deposition of glycosaminoglycans typical of the cartilage extracellular matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Using this assay, we observed that Dipy could inhibit chondrogenic differentiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>C2C12 cells were used to evaluate osteogenic differentiation, which was inhibited by Dipy as indicated by the reduction in the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and expression of different markers (Runx2, osterix and osteocalcin). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The effect of Dipy was also verified in vivo in a BMP-induced mouse model of HO (Medici et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>During the induction of the ectopic ossification process, triggered by the implantation of a BMP2-embedded Matrigel coupled to cardiotoxin (CTX) injection, muscle fibers degenerate and the site of injury is infiltrated by different populations of inflammatory cells that contribute to the orchestration of the subsequent repair/differentiation process (Zordan et al., 2014; Rigamonti et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>During the first week after injury, progenitor cells of different origin are then recruited to the site of the lesion (Bentzinger et al., 2013) and committed towards the endochondral ossification process by the local presence of BMP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>At 10 days, HO lesions are not completely differentiated, and recruitment and activation of cells is ongoing: this was consistent with our finding that, at this stage, the overall number of cells able to respond by activating a specific BMP2/Smad-dependent signaling was higher than what was observed at 21 days after BMP2 induction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>At the earliest time point, the effect of treatment with Dipy became evident as a statistically significant decrease in the number of cells expressing an activated BMP/Smad pathway inside the HO lesions that finally resulted in the reduction of the volume of mineralized heterotopic ossicles, of decreased deposition of extracellular matrix and of a reduced area of calcified nodules that we observed after 21 days of treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, Dipy effect was evident also when mice were treated after the establishment of heterotopic ossification, and resulted in a reduced calcium deposition within the ectopic bone and a decreased mineralization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, concerning the choice of an in vivo prevention strategy versus a treatment on established/ongoing lesions, it is important to consider that the course of FOP is episodic with quiescent phases, lasting even for years, and acute phases that can be triggered by several types of recognizable stimuli (trauma, vaccinations, infection, iatrogenic harms etc.), but that can also occur apparently spontaneously or, more likely, without a recognizable trigger. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In this context, a treatment for FOP is ideally a drug that can be administered chronically or for long periods of time in order to prevent the occurrence of even unpredictable flare-ups, thus counteracting their consequences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Dipy is a commercially available drug that was introduced on the market more than 50 years ago as a coronary vasodilator (Kadatz, 1959). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>At present, it is widely used as an antithrombotic and vasodilator agent both as monotherapy and in combination with aspirin to prevent secondary stroke or transient ischemic attack (Gresele et al., 2011; Balakumar et al., 2014; de Vos-Koppelaar et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>At the pharmacological level, Dipy acts by different mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>By inhibiting the activity of phosphodiesterases 5 and 3 (PDE5 and PDE3), it increases the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which is a potent inhibitor of platelet activation, and of cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP), which has a vasodilator effect on smooth muscle, thus potentiating the platelet inhibitory actions of prostacyclin (PGI2) (Gresele et al., 2011; de Vos-Koppelaar et al., 2014; Kim and Liao, 2008; Yip and Benavente, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Dipy inhibits the re-uptake of adenosine by blocking the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs), thus increasing plasma levels of this nucleoside, which also plays a role in inhibiting platelet aggregation (Kim and Liao, 2008; Visser et al., 2005; Dresse et al., 1982; German et al., 1989), regulation of vascular tone, vasodilation, immunity and inflammation (Kim and Liao, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the effect of Dipy in our in vitro assay of C2C12 cells was not in accordance with other in vitro experiments performed to correlate adenosine level to osteoblast differentiation (Costa et al., 2011; He et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy might be due to differences in the cellular model and experimental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Moreover, very recently, Mediero and colleagues (2015) reported that local daily injection of Dipy administered with a collagen sponge was able to induce bone regeneration and proposed this treatment as an alternative to recombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>At difference with the above report, in the BMP-induced in vivo model that we used, HO was locally triggered in quadriceps muscles, whereas treatment with Dipy was systemic, by daily IP injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it has been shown that, in humans, blood cells tend to accumulate the drug (Serebruany et al., 2009), and Dipy is able to inhibit at the mRNA level the production of TNF-α and MMP-9 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and derived macrophages (Massaro et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Because several types of immune cells are recruited at the site of HO lesions, this might contribute to the overall effect observed in our HO model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Several observations suggest a role of an immune-mediated response in FOP pathogenesis, in particular a possible relevant contribution to the episodic neo-formation of ectopic bone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In humans, FOP flare-ups can be triggered or exacerbated by trauma, immunizations, medical procedures and infections, all of which are conditions in which the immune response is solicited/stimulated (for a review, see Kaplan et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Both in humans and in animal models, histological examination of early pre-osseous lesions has clearly demonstrated that several types of immune cells, such as lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages and mast cells, are readily recruited to these sites (Kaplan et al., 1993; Chakkalakal et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been demonstrated that in vivo targeted ablation of macrophages or of macrophages and mast cells concomitantly leads to a significant reduction in the ectopic bone formation in FOP mouse models (Kan et al., 2009; Convente et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The deregulated BMP signaling in cells harboring the mutated ACVR1 gene might contribute to the amplification of inflammatory pathways (Convente et al., 2015); moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that the presence of FOP mutations specifically confers to the mutated receptor the ability to respond to activin A (Hatsell et al., 2015; Hino et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Activin A is a ligand member of the TGF-β superfamily that is rapidly released during inflammation and considered a crucial mediator of inflammation and immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Its activity is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor ligands and oxidative stress, and it is involved in regulating growth and maturation of mast cells, monocyte/macrophage differentiation, and interaction between natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells (Funaba et al., 2003; Ogawa and Funaba, 2011; Aleman-Muench and Soldevila, 2012; Seeger et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Given the known pleiotropic effect of Dipy, with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties, and the complexity of the action of a drug in vivo, related to its absorption, metabolism and distribution, we cannot exclude that the observed decrease of ectopic ossification in our in vivo model might depend on the involvement of different pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>However, we showed that Dipy is also able to affect specifically the Smad-dependent pathway in HO lesions of treated mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Summarizing, the overall effect of Dipy on the process of HO in vivo might be mediated by different mechanisms of action, such as the metabolic effect of extracellular adenosine, regulatory properties on differentiation and activation of immune cells, and anti-inflammatory action. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study implicates this molecule as a candidate drug for the treatment of FOP, considering the great advantage that Dipy is already widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular disorders, and that safety and adverse effect profiles have already been evaluated and established. </plain></SENT>
