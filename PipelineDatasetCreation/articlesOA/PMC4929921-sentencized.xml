</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coral cover is declining on reefs around the world through the effects of global and local stressors (mostly) associated with human activities [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A major source of variation in coral physiology and stress tolerance results from their symbiosis with photosynthetic microalgae (Symbiodinium spp.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Coral-associated Symbiodinium are genetically diverse [4] and clades, types and ecomorphs (within types) have pronounced effects on their hosts (e.g. [5,6]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Differences in function and performance by Symbiodinium [7] can affect the growth [8], disease susceptibility [9,10] and thermal tolerance [5,6,11] of coral hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant variation exists in associations between coral host and Symbiodinium types [12,13] and may correlate with environmental variation suggesting the potential for local adaptation in coral–symbiont associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As our understanding of the distribution of Symbiodinium within coral species and among geographical locations increases, questions regarding their relative abundance during ambient and stressful conditions, and the effects on coral hosts' physiology and bleaching susceptibility can now be addressed [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The molecular tools used to quantify metazoan–microbial association (including coral–Symbiodinium associations) have undergone a revolution in recent years with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing vastly increasing our ability to identify and quantify in hospite microbial communities [14,15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Deep sequencing of DNA-barcoded bacteria has revealed the presence of abundant and rare bacterial taxa in tropical sponges that are vital for the health of their hosts [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Temporal variation in the relative abundance of microbial taxa, including pathogenic strains, has been associated with environmental stress [17] and can be detected before visual signs of coral stress emerge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the detection of low-abundance microbes and Symbiodinium in corals has vastly improved with the much higher detection rate and quantitative accuracy offered by qPCR relative to gel fingerprinting [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Predicting the future of reef corals under ongoing climate change depends to a large extent on how accurately processes of genetic, epigenetic and physiological adaptation can be modelled (e.g. [19]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Considered particularly important is ‘shuffling’, a process whereby the relative abundance of sensitive and more tolerant symbiont types changes following acute stress (e.g. [20,21]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Shuffling can increase stress thresholds by 1–1.5°C on time scales that are relevant to the rates of environmental change currently being experienced [5,11,19,22,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While a change from sensitive symbiont ‘C’ to tolerant ‘D’ has been observed in the field following bleaching [23,24], it is not a ubiquitous response [25–27] and this makes projection modelling a challenging exercise [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, defining and measuring predictors of shuffling and survival from bleaching stress in wild populations of corals is a research priority. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We examine here the absolute and relative changes in C and D symbionts in Acopora millepora corals from three populations when exposed to warm summer temperatures that exceeded their upper long-term temperature regimes by 2–4°C for an extended period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This coral species is common on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) where it is dominated by Symbiodinium ITS-1 types: C1, C2, C2* and D (ITS-2 equivalents: C1, C3, C131 and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Background types have been documented in colonies from many locations, particularly turbid inshore reefs, but their roles in bleaching susceptibility, shuffling potential and survival are not yet clear [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We test the role of low-abundance symbiont types in bleaching intensity, survival and recovery of Acopora millepora. We show that the relative abundances of symbiont types are dynamic and that coral survival and recovery following bleaching is associated with an increase in the relative abundance of D-type symbionts through shuffling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We define a threshold minimum density of background D above which recovery and survival was enhanced and discuss ways in which this new knowledge can be applied in natural resource management. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The application of sensitive molecular tools to understand the distribution and abundance of microbial symbionts in Metazoa has revealed their central role in species and ecosystem health [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The role of the dominant Symbiodinium type in coral host physiology and stress tolerance is well recognized [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>However, many key questions regarding natural variability in symbiont distribution and abundance (both environmental and in hospite) remain, including the costs and benefits of symbiosis on coral performance and stress susceptibility under current and future environmental scenarios [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>We add new insights to this emerging literature with a field experiment that demonstrates the dynamic nature of coral–Symbiodinium associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We identify indicators of susceptibility to and survival from bleaching that may be used to monitor the status and trend in coral health and resilience in the face of ongoing environmental change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The abundance of symbionts within corals' tissues can be highly variable in space and time, and can influence coral physiology including bleaching sensitivity (reviewed in [3,21]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Cunning &amp; Baker [44] found more intense bleaching (i.e. reduced S : H ratio) in Pocillopora damicornis with abundant C-type Symbiodinium communities compared to those with less abundant C- or D-type communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The density of symbionts pre-summer (both April and September 2005) did not predict the level of bleaching detected here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Our analyses did, however, reveal contrasting and dynamic patterns in the abundance of C- and D-type symbionts among colonies from the three source populations in response to seasonal and extreme summer temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>An increase in C-type symbionts was observed in corals from the Keppels after five months of transplantation but not in the Davies Reef population where C-type abundance remained stable until early summer (December 2005; figure 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This result might be due to symbiont-specific responses to the novel environment since the transplanted inshore and offshore populations were dominated by C3 and C131, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The specificity of our primers, however, did not allow us to differentiate quantitatively among C-types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The abundance of symbiont types can also be dependent on the ambient temperature environment [45] which was on average 2.2°C above historical averages over winter for the Keppels corals where C-types became more abundant compared with 0.92°C cooler than average for the Davies Reef source population where C-type abundance remained constant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Symbiont densities may be enhanced by environmental nutrient levels [46] and are predicted to be higher on inshore reefs, as a function of higher dissolved nutrients often experienced there. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>We recorded higher S : H ratios in the corals from the two inshore locations (Keppels and Magnetic Island) compared to the offshore location (Davies Reef). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Spatial variation in symbiont density has been hypothesized to underpin larger spatial scale patterns in bleaching on the GBR in 1998 and 2002 [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Our results emphasize the importance of the genetic identity of coral host and/or symbiont type rather than cell abundance for bleaching susceptibility and recovery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Our results confirmed that D-dominated corals are more tolerant to elevated temperatures [5,23,24,48] with all D-dominated colonies but one resisting bleaching regardless of their source population and historical thermal regime. Interestingly, 37.5% of Keppels corals increased their abundance of D over time despite the absence of measurable levels of this type at the beginning of the experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This pattern was also found in Montastraea cavernosa by Silverstein et al. [48] and LaJeunesse et al. [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, we are not able to advance the findings of those studies to reveal whether the source of these D-type symbionts was endogenous or environmental. Symbiodinium D are pandemic [21] and composed of several distinct groups with species-level genetic differentiation [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The D-type is rarely the dominant symbiont in corals, except in environments with high or variable temperatures and high sedimentation and/or turbidity [28,49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>On the GBR these environments are common on inshore reefs, such as Magnetic Island, and also occur in lagoons or other shallow, ponding reef systems [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>It is increasingly recognized that cost–benefit relationships between coral and Symbiodinium associations are not only dependent on the symbiont type [8,33,50] but also the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>For example, the cost in growth of corals that host D may be lost in warmer environments [51,52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>As human impacts on coral reefs intensify, the environmental conditions that promote the distribution and abundance of D may become more frequent and widespread [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Predicting the impacts of shifts towards D-dominated symbiont associations on coral health and resilience will require sensitive molecular tools to distinguish between very low abundance or novel uptake (including environmental abundance of these symbionts), as well as knowledge of host and symbiont genotype by environment interactions that may control the in hospite abundance of these types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Our data highlight the importance of shuffling as a mechanism for corals that are not already dominated by tolerant D-type symbionts to recover from extreme summer heat stress and bleaching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Shuffling can shift stress thresholds within a short time period that is relevant to the rates of environmental change currently being experienced [5,22–24,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>It is ecologically significant that 25% of colonies from the Keppels survived temperatures that far exceeded their historical temperature regimes (figure 1), bleaching and mortality thresholds [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>All but one surviving colony either started off with D or became D-dominant during the course of the experiment (figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The fact that half of the survivors shuffled supports this process as a mechanism of rapid acclimatization to rising temperatures [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the background abundance was important and we estimated a minimum D : C threshold of 0.003 above which the relationship with S : H was more gradual than below (i.e. bleaching was less severe). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Eighteen colonies from the Keppels population increased their D : C ratio over the course of the extreme heat exposure but failed to recover and died before the last sampling point; however, those that started above the threshold tended to live for longer and have higher final S : H ratios. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Two Davies Reef colonies had pre-summer D : C ratios above the 0.003 threshold level but did not shuffle nor survive (figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Clearly, there is still much to learn about the role of background symbionts in the physiological adaptation potential of coral populations under warmer and more variable conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>It is well established that the identity and diversity of Symbiodinium complements greatly affect fundamental aspects of the ecology of their coral hosts including growth rate, resistance to and recovery from environmental stress [3,33] and that multiple Symbiodinium types may be present in low abundance in many (or possibly the majority) of coral species (reviewed in [3]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity modelling by Fabini [53] found higher stability (defined as the duration and number of species that persisted through environmental perturbations) of coral communities with more diverse symbiont complements probably because they provide redundant or complementary functions and increased the potential for local recovery following disturbance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>It follows that an objective for natural resource management would be to identify and conserve species, locations or environmental conditions where symbiont diversity is high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Data on both high- and low-abundance Symbiodinium types can, therefore, provide valuable information on the status and trend of the health and resilience of corals and could provide baseline information for integrated coral reef monitoring and adaptive management [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The diversity and abundance of symbiont complements can be routinely and inexpensively screened with next-generation sequencing methods [18] and could feasibly be analysed on large spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cataloguing of symbiont diversity and abundance within databases and visualization tools such as SymBioGBR and eAtlas provide perspectives that are relevant for natural resource management [55,56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This approach would build integrated knowledge of the status and trend in coral symbiosis and health and (in time) provide a resource to evaluate the cost and benefits of management actions under different environmental scenarios [57,58]. </plain></SENT>
