<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major polyadenylation signal (PAS) represents a nucleotide hexamer that adheres to the AATAAA consensus sequence. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Common variants of PAS hexamers are depleted of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and SNPs within PAS hexamers have a reduced derived allele frequency (DAF) and increased conservation, indicating prevalent negative selection; at the same time, the SNPs that “improve” the PAS (i.e., those leading to higher cleavage efficiency) have increased DAF, compared to those that “impair” it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNPs are rarer at PAS of “unique” polyadenylation sites (one site per gene); among alternative polyadenylation sites, at the distal PAS and at exonic PAS. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Polyadenylation is an essential step of mRNA processing in eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It affects many aspects of mRNA physiology and plays an important role in its dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Over 50% of human genes contain more than one potential site of cleavage and polyadenylation (Tian et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2005; Shepard et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A process called alternative polyadenylation (APA) leads to generation of mRNA isoforms with different lengths of 3′-untranslated region or even truncated protein-coding regions (di Giammartino et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The pattern of mRNA polyadenylation undergoes dramatic changes during cell differentiation, proliferation, and malignant transformation (Sandberg et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2008; Ji et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>2009; Singh et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Polyadenylation includes two major steps: recognition of polyadenylation signals (PAS) leading to mRNA cleavage and nonmatrix addition of polyA tail (Colgan and Manley 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Polyadenylation is a complex process regulated by a variety of trans-acting protein factors and cis-elements of mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>mRNA 3′-processing complex contains up to 85 proteins (Shi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>2009) including CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor), a multisubunit complex which plays a crucial role in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>CPSF binds a specific common PAS, an AATAAA hexamer (or its close variant) usually located within 50 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site (Chan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>PAS is present in almost 90% of mammalian mRNAs, and is the most common and best studied signal of polyadenylation (Proudfoot 1991; Beaudoing et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>2000; Tian et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>2005; Cheng et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>2006). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Polyadenylation is tuned by natural selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Cleavage sites and patterns of their usage are conserved across mammals (Ara et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>2006; Lee et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The regions of 3′-UTRs carrying PAS hexamers are depleted of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Castle 2011), and their deletion or mutation leads to a dramatic decrease in expression of target mRNAs due to changes in polyadenylation (Yang et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>2009; Nunes et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>2010) and/or transcription efficiency (Mapendano et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Additionally, mutations disrupting a PAS located near an alternative cleavage site or affecting its strength influence the site usage and might be clinically relevant (Thomas and Saetrom 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PAS hexamers are expected to be strongly selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>These patterns of selection are informative of the functional significance of mutations and may help to improve clinical predictions of mutation effects (Adzhubei et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>2010; Stecher et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, they have never been studied systematically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Selection may be estimated from data on divergence with related species, or from within-species polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Divergence data provide more power, as SNP densities are still lower than densities of interspecies substitutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, polymorphism is immune to interspecies changes of fitness landscapes, for example, situations when a mutation deleterious in one species is harmless in another (Kondrashov, Sunyaev et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>2002; Kern and Kondrashov 2004; Mustonen and Lassig 2009; Naumenko et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The current avalanche of data on human population-level polymorphism allows measuring patterns of selection with unprecedented resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>From a single genome, selection favoring or disfavoring a signal may be inferred from its genomic over- or underrepresentation, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>From polymorphism data, selection may be inferred from densities of SNPs or allelic frequencies within those SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The dependence of the overall level of polymorphism on selection may be complex even in the simplest single-locus case (McVean and Charlesworth 2000; Kondrashov et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>2006; Schmidt et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>2008), and is further complicated by linkage between sites (Genomes Project et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>2010; Wilkening et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>2013; You et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>However, the situation is simplified when alleles may be a priori subdivided into preferred and unpreferred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Negative selection may then be inferred from underrepresentation of SNPs, or from reduced allele frequencies of such SNPs, at sites occupied by the favored allele, compared to a neutral control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Conversely, positive selection is manifested as an excess of SNPs, and increased allele frequencies of such SNPs, at sites of the disfavored allele, compared to a neutral control (although it simultaneously purges variation at linked sites). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Here, we use the data on divergence between species of placental mammals and human polymorphism data of the 1000 Genomes Project (Genomes Project et al. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The PAS hexamers typically have one of the 13 nucleotide sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The ranking of these PAS hexamers according to their frequencies in the genome is consistent with their ranking according to their efficiency in stimulation of cleavage and polyadenylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In particular, the first two of these sequences—AATAAA and ATTAAA—are by far the most frequent, together comprising 55.4% of all hexamers in the human genome; and their efficiency (Sheets et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>1990) substantially exceeds that of all lower-ranking hexamers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">supplementary table S1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>To measure selection, we analyze two aspects of polymorphism: SNP densities and within-population frequencies of nonancestral nucleotides (DAFs), as well as interspecies conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>These three measurements provide complementary estimates of selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>As multiallelic SNPs are rare in this data set (Genomes Project et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>2010), DAFs are expected to be only dependent on the strength of selection at corresponding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, SNP densities and rate of sequence divergence also depend on the mutation rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>To study selection, we therefore compare the properties of PAS hexamers to those of control hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Control hexamers were chosen so that they have the same nucleotide sequence, and are located in similar regions of 3′-UTRs, but are positioned on the opposite strand, and therefore cannot be functional PAS hexamers (see Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This approach controls for most sources of local as well as global nonuniformity of the mutation rates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Among the 55,856 investigated PAS hexamers (an average of 3.1 hexamers per gene), 2,066 (3.7%) were polymorphic, according to The 1000 Genomes Project database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">supplementary table S2</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/gbe/evw137/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link> online). and only 47 (2.3%) of them carried more than one SNP. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>A few patterns emerged with regard to the densities of SNPs in different classes (fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>First, each gene can have either one polyadenylation-associated cleavage site or multiple alternative sites (fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>SNP density was the lowest at the PAS hexamers corresponding to the only cleavage site in a gene (“unique”), and was higher if multiple cleavage sites were present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>When two cleavage sites were present, the PAS hexamer corresponding to the cleavage site distal from the promoter (i.e., located at the 3′-end of the longest mRNA isoform) had lower SNP densities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Second, several PAS hexamers may be associated with a single cleavage site (fig. 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>At such sites, SNP densities were higher, compared to cleavage sites with unique PAS hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Third, a fraction of PAS hexamers was located in an intron; such hexamers usually corresponded to alternative cleavage sites (fig. 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>They had higher SNP densities than the exonic hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Fourth, a fraction of PAS hexamers fell between the start and the stop codon; such hexamers are, of course, always alternative, and are usually intronic (fig. 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>As expected, these hexamers were enriched in SNPs, compared with the PAS hexamers located within the 3′-UTRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Interspecies conservation data demonstrated similar trends; specifically, the mean phastCons score was significantly higher for the “strongest” AATAAA hexamer and for PAS-hexamers located in exons and 3′-UTRs (fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>While we saw no significant differences between investigated categories in DAFs (fig. 3B), the overall patterns were roughly coincident with those observed for SNPs densities and phastCons scores.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In this work, we use the rich whole-genome data set on human polymorphism, The 1000 Genomes Data Set, and interspecies conservation to study the patterns of selection at PAS hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We find that, overall, DAFs at PAS hexamers are lower, and conservation is higher, than in the control sequences, implying negative selection against mutations at PAS hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>We see no corresponding reduction in SNP densities, although SNP densities are reduced in the two strongest hexamers AATAAA and ATTAAA which together comprise over a half of the sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the typical selection at less strict PAS hexamers has a moderate strength, so that, although it is capable to reduce the frequency of the inferior allele and to prevent its fixation between species, it is seldom able to eliminate it completely. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>However, the overall genome-wide patterns give only a crude understanding of selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Categorization of alleles by their effect on the PAS hexamer efficiency reveals a more complicated picture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>As expected, the DAFs of disrupting SNPs were substantially reduced, indicative of substantial negative selection against such mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The DAFs of the impairing SNPs were also reduced, compared with the control; in contrast, the DAFs of the improving SNPs were increased (fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Although the difference of the impairing and improving SNPs from the control was statistically insignificant, they significantly differed from each other: the DAFs of impairing SNPs were significantly lower than those of improving SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This implies that the impairing SNPs are negatively selected, that the improving SNPs are positively selected, or possibly both. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>In the mutation-selection-drift balance, a continuous influx of deleterious mutations counteracted by selection against them leads to maintenance of an equilibrium concentration of suboptimal alleles in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Under very weak selection, this may lead to alternating fixations of optimal and suboptimal alleles at a locus (Ohta’s turnover) (Kimura and Ohta 1971; Ohta 1992; Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2007; Denisov et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Here, we observe a different manifestation of the same phenomenon: a downward or upward bias in the mean frequency of the derived allele caused by negative and positive selection, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The strength and/or ubiquity of selection depend on the location of the PAS hexamer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>It appears to be primarily determined by whether a mutation within a PAS hexamer may be circumvented by exploiting an alternative PAS hexamer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Mutations at unique PAS hexamers associated with unique cleavage sites are under the strongest selection, while the presence of an alternative PAS hexamer and/or cleavage site relaxes selection against the mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the presence of another PAS hexamer reduced the action of selection both on the distal and the proximal (P &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s test) PAS hexamer, compared to the unique ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Overall, genomic redundancy tends to be associated with reduced selection against mutations within each functional element; for example, alternative splice sites and duplicate genes are under weaker selection than constitutive sites (Kurmangaliyev et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>2013) and single-copy genes (Force et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>1999; Kondrashov, Rogozin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>2002), respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The distal PAS hexamers are under stronger selection than the proximal ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The proximal hexamers tend to be further from the consensus sequence than the distal hexamers (Tian et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This difference may facilitate proximal-to-distal cleavage site usage switching that occurs during a wide range of normal and pathological processes (Tian et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>2005; di Giammartino et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Thus, the less manifested consensus sequence of the proximal PAS hexamers could reduce the effect of the SNPs, compared with the distal PAS hexamers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Additionally, activity of proximal sites could be regulated by other polyadenylation factors (in particular, CSTF proteins) that interact with the downstream GU-rich sequence (Takagaki and Manley 1998; Nunes et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>2010; Yao et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>2012), making the nucleotide sequence of PAS hexamers less critical. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The exonic sites are under stronger selection than intronic sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Also, the PAS hexamers located within the coding regions (which are typically also intronic) are under weaker selection than the 3′-UTR PAS hexamers (which tend to be exonic). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>This is intuitive, as the intronic sites are commonly alternative, whereas many of the exonic sites are constitutive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intronic polyadenylation sites function in a tight cross-talk with splicing, and their usage could be regulated more or less independently of the binding of “classical” polyadenylation factors to the PAS hexamer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Thus, the expression level of splicing factors, which interact with specific signals independently of or even in competition with polyadenylation factors, and the strength of the 5′-splicing sites play an important role in regulation of the activity of intronic polyadenylation sites (Castelo-Branco et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>2004; Kaida et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, almost all the observed differences between the functional groups of PAS hexamers coincide well with the trends of phylogenetic conservation of cleavage sites (Lee et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>2008), supporting the key role of PAS hexamers in regulation of cleavage and polyadenylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Some of the SNPs that affect PAS hexamers might be associated with pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a fraction of these “pathological” SNPs affected alternative sites, suggesting that APA is important for physiological gene expression and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Other germline and somatic mutations that affect alternative PAS hexamers have been previously described as implicated in pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes, IPEX (immune dysfunction, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked), panic disorder (Bennett et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>2001; Shin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>2007; Gyawali et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>2010), and tumorigenesis (Wiestner et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the patterns of polymorphism within PAS hexamers reveal weak selection acting at these sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>This selection appears to be primarily determined by the direction and extent of the effect of the corresponding mutation on polyadenylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>While the destroying SNPs tend to be negatively selected, we find evidence of positive selection favoring the mutations that make the hexamers more similar to the consensus sequence, indicating that the nonconsensus sequences are mostly suboptimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>While SNPs are rare at those hexamers where they substantially disrupt the function, polymorphism within many of the rarely used hexamers appears to be nearly neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Pathogenic mutations may affect polyadenylation via a broad range of mechanisms, including disruption of existing, constitutive, or alternative, sites, improvement of an existing site, or even creation of a spurious site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the link between the changes in polyadenylation and the changes in expression is frequently nonlinear (Spies et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>2013; Gupta et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Annotation of possible effects of SNPs on polyadenylation should be included in any prediction of effects of both somatic and germline mutations; however, the complications listed above make such predictions inherently difficult. </plain></SENT>
