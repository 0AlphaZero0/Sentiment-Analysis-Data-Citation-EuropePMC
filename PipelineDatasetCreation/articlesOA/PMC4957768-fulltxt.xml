To test this hypothesis, we used the freshwater pulmonate snail, <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic>, for which various genetic tools and a draft genome have recently become available, to investigate the effects of two steroid androgens on the development of mollusk secondary sexual organs. Here we present the results of exposures to two potent androgens, the vertebrate steroid; 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the pharmaceutical anabolic steroid; 17&#x003b1;-methyltestosterone (MT), under continuous flow-through conditions throughout embryonic development and up to sexual maturity. Secondary sexual gland morphology, histopathology and differential gene expression analysis were used to determine whether steroid androgens stimulated or inhibited organ development. No significant differences between tissues from control and exposed snails were identified, suggesting that these androgens elicited no biologically detectable response normally associated with exposure to androgens in vertebrate model systems. Identifying no effect of androgens in this mollusk is significant, not only in the context of the suitability of mollusks as alternative model organisms for testing vertebrate androgen receptor agonists but also, if applicable to other similar mollusks, in terms of the likely impacts of androgens and anti-androgenic pollutants present in the aquatic environment.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900802/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jobling</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900802/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Routledge</surname><given-names>Edwin J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900802/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Catherine S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0900802/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Leslie R.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research presented in this manuscript was wholly funded by National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/">https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/</ext-link>. &#x02018;The Snail Assay as an Alternative to the Rodent Hershberger Assay for Detecting Androgens and Anti-androgens&#x02019; funding reference: G0900802/1 to SJ, EJR, CSJ, and LRN.

The possibility that these disorders may, in part, be caused by exposure to environmental pollutants that disrupt the male reproductive endocrine system [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] has led to changes in legislation, resulting in an increased need for animal testing to determine reproductive toxicity. The Hershberger assay [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], originally developed to identify the drivers (hormones) of male sexual development, is a gold standard test used in reproductive toxicity testing as well as the development of pharmaceuticals designed to treat male reproductive disorders and hormone-dependent cancers [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This assay employs castrated peri-pubertal male rats to assess effects of chemical or pharmaceutical exposure on weight, morphology and histopathology of reproductive organs and tissues and is, therefore, both ethically undesirable and costly. To replace the rodents used in reproductive pharmacology and toxicological testing with small invertebrate organisms is desirable, to reduce both the use of rodents and the high costs of such tests. This approach has been successful in, for example, research into Parkinson's disease, axon regeneration and Alzheimer's disease through the use of the worm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, and the fruitfly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Neither of these organisms, however, have a reproductive anatomy similar to mammals and so would not be suitable alternatives with which to investigate the male reproductive system. Few other invertebrates have been extensively investigated as potential surrogates of male (or female) reproductive function, for either biomedical or chemical safety testing, however mollusks have been proposed as potential surrogates for androgen testing, since they have a reproductive anatomy that is, at least superficially, similar to that of vertebrates. Like mammals, the snail&#x02019;s male reproductive tract extends from the testis (or ovotestis in hermaphrodite snails), has seminal vesicles and a prostate gland, and terminates in a penile glandular complex (around the preputium) containing sebaceous glands and a penis.</p><p>Evidence from toxicological studies also indicate possible commonalities in the reproductive development and reproductive responses of some mollusk species with those seen in mammals [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, developmental exposure to the synthetic androgen, 17&#x003b1;-methyltestosterone (MT) caused hyperplasia in the epithelial tissue of reproductive glands and inhibition of spermatogenesis in male <italic>Marisa cornuarietis</italic> (a freshwater prosobranch/gonochoristic gastropod mollusk) [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] while female adult <italic>M</italic>. <italic>cornuarietis</italic> developed imposex (imposition of penis growth in females) after 150 days of MT exposure [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Adult pond snails, <italic>Lymnaea stagnalis</italic> (a pulmonate/hermaphrodite gastropod), demonstrated histological damage to the albumen and prostate glands after 8 weeks of exposure to 100 ng/L of MT [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies with gastropods have also shown exposure to vertebrate androgens (e.g. testosterone), anti-androgens (e.g. cyproterone-acetate) or estrogens could modulate free or esterified testosterone concentrations within the exposed snails [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting exogenous exposures to vertebrate-type endocrine active substances may disrupt androgen homeostasis in mollusks [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, exposure of males of different gastropod species (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>cornuarietis</italic>, <italic>Nucella lapillus</italic> and <italic>Hinia reticulate</italic>a) to the fungicide vinclozolin, shown to have anti-androgenic properties in mammals, were reported to cause a reduction in the length of the penis and penis sheath [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], further supporting the suggestion that mammalian-like mechanisms through which androgens and anti-androgens could act may be present in mollusks. Based on the above literature it was expected that androgen exposure might stimulate the growth of male specific tissues (e.g. prostate) and cells (e.g. sperm), and perhaps inhibit the growth of female specific tissues (e.g. albumen gland) and cells (e.g. oocytes).</p><p>Although their function has yet to be fully elucidated, putative vertebrate-like male hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; as well as steroidogenic androgen- and estrogen-producing enzymes, such as aromatase and 5&#x003b1;-reductase; have been found in the gonads and digestive tract of several invertebrate groups [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], particularly mollusks and annelids. Moreover, the genes encoding for 5&#x003b1;-reductase have been sequenced in several mollusk species (e.g. <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> (ECK36980), <italic>Lottia gigantea</italic> (Pid: 194080)), perhaps suggesting that similar mechanisms exist in invertebrates. Prior to the commencement of the research presented in this manuscript, the presence of a &#x02018;classical&#x02019; androgen receptor (AR) in mollusks had been inferred [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but this has remained an area of controversy [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], since homologues have not been identified despite investigations specifically searching for the gene [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently, systematic searches of mollusk genomes have failed to identify an androgen receptor [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] homolog suggesting that the reported effects of androgens in mollusks must be attributed to a different mechanism, either using different nuclear receptors or potentially through non-genomic membrane-bound receptors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that genes, proteins and physiological processes that are common to both mollusks and mammals underlie the response of the male reproductive system to androgens.</p><p>The tropical freshwater pulmonate snail, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, was selected as a test species. In comparison to other gastropods, it has a relatively well-documented physiology and had been widely studied, including a recent preliminary genome sequence [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], due to its medical importance as the intermediate host for the human parasite <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. It is also easily bred in the laboratory with a short generation time, thus making it an attractive test model for mechanistic research and <italic>in vivo</italic> testing. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> were exposed during development to two potent androgens; the natural vertebrate steroid, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the anabolic steroid methyltestosterone (MT), after which reproductive tissues and organs were assessed for stimulatory (e.g. male tissue reproductive growth or advanced spermatogenesis) or possible disruptive (e.g. to female reproductive tissues or oocyte development) effects using morphological, histopathological and differential gene expression analyses, to test the hypothesis that androgens would elicit similar effects in mollusks to that seen in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Ethical approval of from the Brunel University London Animal Welfare Ethics Review Board (AWERB) and the UK Home Office was not required for this study as gastropod mollusks, such as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, are not protected by the UK Animal [Scientific Procedures] Act 1986.

Quantitative PCR using specific primers was carried out to determine if gene expression levels for the differentially expressed transcripts, found in the pooled samples, were differentially expressed across all individuals.

Therefore, although the genes identified might represent a response to MT, this was not consistent across all the samples and none would therefore make a useful biomarker or indicator of androgen exposure.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0159852.t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0159852.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Identification of sequenced SSH fragments from albumen gland in the MT exposure experiment.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0159852.t002g" xlink:href="pone.0159852.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fragment</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Library</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Size (bp)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Best BlastN match (NCBI NR/ESTs)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acc.

The primary aim of the <italic>in vivo</italic> developmental exposure to two potent androgens, 5&#x003b1;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 17&#x003b1;-methyltestosterone (MT); was to investigate whether developmental exposure to these androgens would affect the growth of reproductive glands and organs in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> and/or whether specific molecular markers of androgen exposure could be determined in a mollusk, thus providing an invertebrate alternative model for male reproductive toxicity testing.

This suggests there may have been some toxicity to the developing snails at these concentrations (although mortality in the MT study was generally lower than in the DHT study). Toxicity has not been previously reported in other gastropod species exposed to similar nominal concentrations of androgens [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and the dosing series for these experiments were designed to mimic concentrations documented to have endocrine effects in mollusks [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and aquatic vertebrates [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] i.e. in the tens to hundreds of ng/L range. However, the experimental design of earlier work with mollusks differs from this study, in that many were static-renewal rather than continuous dosing. Investigators measuring exposure concentrations in static renewal systems often find much lower (sometimes &#x0003c;20%) than nominal exposure concentrations [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], whereas in this study exposure concentrations of 80&#x02013;110% nominal MT and 65&#x02013;70% nominal DHT where measured. Therefore snails in our experiments may have been exposed to higher concentrations than similar species in other studies.</p><p>In vertebrates, exposure to androgens has been reported to increase somatic growth; for example in developmentally exposed fathead minnows (<italic>Pimephales promelas</italic>), DHT significantly increased weight and length in males (20 ng/L DHT) and females (200 ng/L DHT) [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. No dose dependent trend could be identified for shell size or total weight in the DHT study; on average the smallest snails were found in the 62.5 ng/L DHT treatment, and the largest in the 125 ng/L DHT treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159852.s011">S2 File</xref>; Table B). In the MT study, the largest snails were found in the DWC treatment and the smallest in the 250 ng/L MT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159852.s010">S1 File</xref>; Table B), and as with the DHT study, no dose dependent trend could be seen.</p><p><italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, like other pulmonate gastropods, is a typical r-selection reproductive strategist, with large numbers of offspring and relatively high levels of mortality. Therefore, it was expected that a proportion of the hatchlings (~30% from unpublished preliminary work in our laboratory) would not survive to reproductive age, thus reducing the density in the exposure tanks over time. As mortality levels were variable, there were differences in densities of the snails between some of the tanks, perhaps contributing to variable growth rates between tanks. Even in replicate DWC tanks, however, with similar survival and densities, significant differences were found in shell size and total weight of the snails i.e. DWC tanks from the MT study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159852.s010">S1 File</xref>; Table A). To account for these variations in total weight of individual snails between tanks, measurements of size and/or weight of the glandular and ovotestis tissues were normalized by individual total weight prior to statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>No consistent dose-related effects of androgens on reproductive tissue size and histopathology</title><p>One of the primary markers of androgen exposure in vertebrate models, such as the Hershberger test, is increased size/weight of male specific organs. For example, in a pubertal rat assay (enhanced OECD test guideline 407) MT exposure resulted in increased prostate weight in males treated with 200 mg/kg/day [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast, no significant effect on normalized Glandular Complex (GC) (including prostate gland) size was found for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> snails exposed to either MT or DHT. There were also no consistent significant dose-related effects on normalised albumen gland weight in the MT or DHT exposure studies. Although the albumen glands of the 62.5 ng/L and 125 ng/L MT exposed snails were much larger than those from the DWC, SC, 250 ng/L and 500 ng/L treated snails, there were significant intra-replicate differences in albumen gland weight in both the 62.5 and 125 ng/L treatments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0159852.s010">S1 File</xref>; Table H), suggesting this was not an effect of MT exposure, but an artefact or &#x02018;tank&#x02019; effect. In the DHT study, there were no such within-replicate differences and no significant effects of androgen exposure on albumen gland weight. In general, gastropod albumen gland size is thought to be related to accumulation of secretory products in the tissue, due to different stages of the egg-laying cycle [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Enlarged albumen glands were reported just before egg laying in <italic>Helisoma duryi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>stagnalis</italic> egg laying status has also been shown to affect albumen gland size with lower weights in those snails that had laid more eggs [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This factor could account for the variation in albumen gland size in the MT study, as some individuals may have laid eggs whereas others had not.</p><p>In vertebrate models, histopathological changes to gland structure or development are also reported in androgen-exposed individuals. For example, in pubertal male rats, histology of the seminal vesicle and prostate gland show enhanced glandular development (after 1 mg/kg/day Testosterone Propionate by subcutaneous injection) [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In comparison, no histological impact of MT or DHT exposure was observed in the albumen gland or the Glandular Complex (GC) of androgen-exposed <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. Differences were observed between individual snails in the staining of the epithelium of the tubules in the albumen gland, but these variations were found across all treatments, and were due to the presence of more vacuolated cytoplasm and less secretory granules in the epithelium [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], possibly due to variation in the egg-laying cycle of the snails at the time of sampling. A varying appearance in the structure, such as dilation of the tubules of the albumen gland, has been linked with different physiological states due to metabolic processes and sexual activity in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>stagnalis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and has been reported in control snails by Czech <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The lack of effects of MT or DHT exposure on secondary sexual glands in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> is somewhat in contrast to previously reported experiments with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>stagnalis</italic>, which showed a low level of degeneration to the albumen and prostate glands after 8 weeks exposure to 100 ng/L MT in adult snails [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differences in species and the timing of exposure (adult vs. juvenile) may account for the different observations between our study and that of Czech <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In a range of vertebrate models, androgen exposure has been documented to impact gonadal development. For example, female pubertal rats exposed to 200 mg/kg/day MT had significantly reduced ovary weight [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Japanese Medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), developmentally exposed to androgens via the water, in a similar way to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> in this study, exhibited male skewed sex ratios and testis-ova at average concentrations of 27.75 ng/L MT [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In another study juvenile <italic>P</italic>. <italic>promelas</italic> exposed to 20 and 200 ng/L of DHT for 45 days induced significant advancement in spermatogenesis in males and caused sexual disruption in females [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>No differences in oogenesis or spermatogenesis were observed in any of the MT or DHT exposed snails compared to controls and no significant effect of androgen exposure (MT or DHT) was found on the ovotestis weight. The lack of gross histopathological changes to the ovotestis in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> exposed to MT is in contrast to the recent work of Rivero-Wendt <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], in which adult <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> were exposed semi-statically to MT (0.01 mg/L to 1 mg/L MT). Rivero-Wendt <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that nominal MT concentrations of 0.1 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L significantly increased the area of ovotestis acini occupied by mature spermatozoa, compared to the water control. This might suggest much higher concentrations of MT than used in our study (mg/L vs. ng/L) could stimulate spermatogenesis. However, it is also worth noting that in their study the solvent control (0.001% ethanol) snails showed the largest average area occupied by sperm (almost double that of the water control). This suggests MT may not have been the overriding factor in increasing sperm production in these snails and highlights the importance of considering possible solvent mediated affects in toxicology studies [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Gene expression analyses in MT-exposed snails</title><p>In previous studies in fish, SSH has been used to identify possible androgen responsive genes <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We identified differences in gene expression using SSH between pooled <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> albumen gland from MT-exposed (125 ng/L MT) and solvent control samples. However, subsequent investigation of expression of each gene in individual snails revealed that these differences were mainly attributable to one individual, even though equal amounts of RNA had been pooled. This one individual may have been responding to MT, however the difference could be due to other factors, such as whether the individual had just laid an egg mass. The lack of a consistent effect makes the identified genes unsuitable for use as markers of androgen exposure. No differences in gene expression were found between control and MT-exposed ovotestis.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Significance of the negative finding</title><p>The absence of significant dose-dependent physiological (DHT and MT) or molecular responses (MT) on <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> was surprising considering the number of publications that suggest gastropod mollusks have physiological levels of vertebrate-type androgens naturally occurring in their tissues, use vertebrate-type androgens in reproduction or are reproductively disrupted by exogenous androgen or anti-androgen exposure [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For example, in the freshwater prosobranch gastropod, <italic>Marisa cornuarietis</italic>, MT showed masculinizing (imposex) effects in adult female snails from 100 ng/L (nominal) to complete virilization at 1 &#x003bc;g/L (nominal) [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and disruption to both spermatogenesis, oogenesis and overall fecundity above nominal concentrations of 100 ng/L MT [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the majority of publications documenting effects of androgens are in prosobranch (generally gonochoristic) gastropods rather than pulmonate (hermaphrodite) gastropods such as <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. Considering the large evolutionary divergence of gastropods it might not be surprising that they show different responses. However, a number of studies have suggested either a role of vertebrate androgens in pulmonate gastropod reproduction in <italic>Biomphalaria alexandrina</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or stimulatory effects of androgens to reproductive tissues in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As previously discussed, Rivero-Wendt and colleagues may have identified a solvent effect on spermatogenesis, rather than an effect of steroid androgens.

For instance, Scott [<xref rid="pone.0159852.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] documents the following: of the 17 studies which report reproductive or endocrine effects of steroid androgens in mollusks none had within study replication (e.g. replicate dosed tanks) and only one study measured the concentration of chemical dosed into the tank to verify exposure level. Indeed, by using replication and assessing within-treatment variation in our study we found variation between replicate tanks could be more significant than those between treatment concentrations, allowing us to discount possible chemical mediated effects as the driver of the variation.
