</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gastric cancer (GC) is currently the fifth most common cancer being the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with nearly one million new diagnoses per year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>More than three-fourths of those individuals die from the disease (Black et al. 2014; GLOBOCAN 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most of GC cases are sporadic and hereditary cases account for only 1–3 % of GCs, this includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (Monahan and Hopkins 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>HDGC (OMIM #137215) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Between 25 and 30 % of cases of HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 180 different germline CDH1 mutations have been identified in HDGC families in a diverse range of ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Mutation carriers have a cumulative risk of GC at 80 years of 70 % for men and 56 % in women, together with a high probability of lobular breast cancer in females (Corso et al. 2014; Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Germline CDH1 mutations have been identified in approximately 15–50 % of affected kindreds that meet the clinical criteria for HDGC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The wide range of this estimate has to do with both, the background incidence of gastric cancer and the criteria used to define the syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>According to the new guidelines, defined in 2015, CDH1 testing should be considered in patients who meet one of the following criteria (including first and second degree relatives): (1) 2 GC cases regardless of age, at least one confirmed diffuse gastric cancer (DGC); (2) one case of DGC before 40 years old or (3) personal or family history of DGC and LBC, one diagnosed before 50 years old. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, testing could be considered in families with: (1) Bilateral lobular breast cancer (LBC) or family history of 2 or more cases of LBC before 50 years old; (2) A personal of family history of cleft lip/palate in a patient with DGC or (3) in situ signet ring cells and/or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells (van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Because DGC is often asymptomatic until in its advanced stages, the diagnosis is often delayed and, as a result, the prognosis is poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, according to current guidelines, prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) should be strongly advised in asymptomatic carriers of CDH1 pathogenic mutations, since this is the only way to completely eradicate their risk of GC; furthermore, almost 100 % of performed gastrectomies revealed the presence of microscopic cancer foci The optimal timing for the surgery is under debate, although most procedures are performed between the ages of 20 and 30 years, and current guidelines advocate this (Monahan and Hopkins 2016, van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the identification of a family in Spain, affected with HDGC, and carrying a novel germline truncating mutation in the CDH1 gene (c.1220_1220delC, p.P407Qfs10) which presumably leads to a non-functional protein. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In this paper the identification of a novel mutation in the CDH1 gene in a Spanish family diagnosed with GC is described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For HDGC, there are established criteria to determine whether an individual is at risk of and requires genetic testing for the condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In the last revision, the first and second criteria were merged in a new criterion: “Two or more GC cases regardless of age, at least one confirmed DGC”, in first-degree and second-degree relatives, covering now families for whom detailed pathology is incomplete (Fitzgerald et al. 2010; van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In this way, despite our patient did not fulfill the strict criteria for HDGC, due to the young age of diagnosis, the histopathological analysis of the tumour (diffuse adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cells), and with an E-cadherin expression absent, she was tested for CDH1 mutations, and once she was found to have a pathogenic mutation, genetic testing was offered to some of her relatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Our finding reinforces the addition in the last guideline of the recommendation: “other families in which genetic testing may also be considered” that includes a point that our patient had met: “in situ signet ring cells and/or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells” (van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>According to our findings, personal or familial history of DGC, above all at young age, should encourage CDH1 genetic testing, even without fulfilling HDGC criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The detection of well known pathogenic mutations in sporadic cases of GC that do not meet HDGC criteria (Garziera et al. 2013), supports the importance of searching for CDH1 mutations in this type of cancer, not only to better understand the molecular basis underlying the disease, but also to improve genetic testing and therefore the clinical management of patients and families at risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Pathology reports, preferably by an expert GC pathologist, are essential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The pathology of HDGC is unique but requires a high level of expertise in order to maximize recognition of specific findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Because of the detection of in situ signet ring cells and/or pagetoid spread of signet ring cells in the stomach is rarely, if ever, seen in sporadic cases, and in these cases genetic testing should be considered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>First degree relatives of GC patients are known to have twofold to threefold increased risk of GC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This shows the importance of informing family members about positive mutation results, facilitating a faster testing, diagnosis and treatment (Garziera et al. 2013; Onitilo et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The optimal age to screen individuals from affected families is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Rare cases of DGC have been reported in affected families before the age of 18, but the overall risk of cancer before age 20 is very low (&lt;1 %) (Kaurah et al. 2007; Pharoah et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The risk rises to 4 percent by age 30 without prophylactic surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Most groups agree that consideration of genetic testing can begin at the age of informed consent (16 or 18 years of age depending on the geographic place of residence) (Blair et al. 2006; van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>However, decisions as to the age at which to institute testing should also take into account the earliest age of cancer onset in the individual family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>PTG is now strongly recommended for asymptomatic CDH1 mutation carriers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Total gastrectomy for these patients completely eliminates their risk of GC and is truly prophylactic in terms of preventing their death from invasive GC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The current consensus is that the procedure should be discussed and offered to pathogenic CDH1 carriers in early adulthood, generally between ages 20 and 30 and should be carefully considered at an age &gt;75. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Family phenotype, especially age of onset of clinical cancer in probands, should be taken into account. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Some suggest consideration of total gastrectomy in CDH1 mutation carriers at an age 5 years younger than the youngest family member who developed gastric cancer (Cisco et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In CDH1 positive patients who deny or want to delay the PTG endoscopic surveillance should be considered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>According to recent studies, there is a significant difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients who undergo prophylactic total gastrectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated that asymptomatic patients were all cured after the surgery whereas a high percentage of symptomatic ones had tumour recurrence or metastasis, and 60 % of them died within 2 years (Chen et al. 2013; Corso et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In addition, data from over 100 gastrectomies for HDGC have high-lighted the majority already contain a tiny focus of signet-ring carcinoma or the preinvasive lesions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The mutation found in our family: (NM_004360.4:c.1220_1220delC; NM_004360.4(CDH1_i001): p.(Pro407Glnfs*10) generates an early stop codon in the protein leading to a truncated protein and thus, pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>To date, over 180 different germline CDH1 mutations have been identified; the majority are pathogenic mutations but a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have been described (Hansford et al. 2015; van der Post et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The majority has been single nucleotide substitutions leading to non-synonymous changes (splice site or truncating mutations); less commonly, there are insertions or deletions of several base-pairs leading to frameshifts with protein truncation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Approximately 5 % of familial cases are due to large deletions involving multiple exons of the gene (Oliveira et al. 2009; Yamada et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>All germline mutations are evenly distributed along the gene and lead to functional haploinsufficiency of E-cadherin. CDH1 is a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore a somatic second hit is required for initiation of tumor formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The trigger and molecular mechanism by which the second allele of E-cadherin is inactivated appears to be diverse, and includes promoter hypermethylation, mutation, and loss of heterozygosity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The end result is loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are not reliable methods for early detection, and GC patients have often a poor prognosis since it is often detected at advanced states, more aggressive and difficult to treat, being considered not curable (Black et al. 2014; Garziera et al. 2013; Onitilo et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Annual endoscopic surveillance is recommended but direct visualization with endoscopy tends to detect lesions late in the disease process and multiple random endoscopic samples often returns false negatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Better surveillance methods could reduce morbidity by picking up target lesions earlier such that they are amenable to endoscopic therapies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although the HDGC is a rare disease and its incidence is low, due to the high pathogenicity and penetrance importance should be attached to it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The lack of a sensitive screening test for HDGC makes its early diagnosis challenging. </plain></SENT>
