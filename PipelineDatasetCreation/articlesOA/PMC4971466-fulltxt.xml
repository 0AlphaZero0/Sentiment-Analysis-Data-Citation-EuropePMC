By gaining a better understanding of the genetic regulation of IB development, an integrated analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs expression profiling was performed on <italic>Megalobrama amblycephala</italic>. Four key development stages were selected for transcriptome and small RNA sequencing. A number of significantly differentially expressed miRNAs/genes associated with bone formation and differentiation were identified and the functional characteristics of these miRNAs/genes were revealed by GO function and KEGG pathway analysis. These were involved in TGF-&#x003b2;, ERK and osteoclast differentiation pathways known in the literature to affect bone formation and differentiation. MiRNA-mRNA interaction pairs were detected from comparison of expression between different stages. The function annotation results also showed that many miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs were likely to be involved in regulating bone development and differentiation. A negative regulation effect of two miRNAs was verified through dual luciferase reporter assay. As a unique public resource for gene expression and regulation during the IB development, this study is expected to provide forwards ideas and resources for further biological researches to understand the IBs&#x02019; development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>It is well known that most of the freshwater aquaculture fishes around the world, especially Cyprinidae species, possessed a certain amount of intermuscular bones (IBs), which are hard-boned spicules located in the muscle tissue on both sides of the vertebrae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The IBs develop directly from mesenchymal condensation and consist of membranous ossifications of connective tissue in the muscular septum. IBs differ from other axial skeletons, such as the vertebral column, which develops from a mesenchymal cell population derived from the ventral somite<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. IBs reduce the edibleness and economic value of a fish species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. In view of the potential value in eliminating IBs, researchers began to study IBs in fish as early as the 1960s<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Interestingly, prior studies revealed the significant differences in the number of IBs among fish of different ploidy, indicating that genetic improvement methods could have a significant effect on decreasing the number of IBs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. But so far, almost all existing studies have only focused on the morphology of IBs in fish species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Few in-depth studies have been carried out and little information has been obtained regarding the molecular mechanism for development of IBs.

In fish species, the integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles has been performed on zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) for optic nerve regeneration and on darkbarbel catfish (<italic>Pelteobagrus vachelli</italic>) in response to hypoxia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>Perazza <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> has reported that specimens of tambaqui (<italic>Colossoma macropomum</italic>) from one culture population lack IBs, even though this fish normally has IBs. Xu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> has identified an intermuscular bone-deficient grass carp (<italic>Ctenopharyngodon idellus</italic>) mutant in an artificial gynogenetic group. Based on these two reports, it has been speculated that there maybe one or several key genes that regulate the development of IBs.</p><p>In the present study, we used one typical Cyprinidae species, blunt snout bream (<italic>Megalobrama amblycephala</italic>), for which the morphological characteristics, emergent periods and morphogenesis of IBs are known from our previous research<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. IBs gradually appear during the growth and development of <italic>M. amblycephala</italic>. It emerged 20 days post hatching (dph) at a body length of 1.33&#x02009;cm, first in the tail and then toward the head. When fry were 40&#x02009;dph with the body length of 2.36&#x02009;cm, all intermuscular bones had appeared. With the aim to generate the fundamental molecular resources across the different developmental stages from emerging to complete formation of IBs and try to find the putative key genes or miRNAs for regulating IBs&#x02019; development, the transcriptome property, mRNA and miRNA expression profiling were investigated in the four key stages related to IBs development of <italic>M. amblycephala</italic> in this study. A certain amount of bone-related genes, period-specific or period-differential expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were identified, and the related signaling pathways were uncovered through the comparisons of the four development stages. Meanwhile, some interaction networks and regulatory modes of mRNAs and miRNAs were also revealed based on the integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All animals and experiments were conducted in accordance with the &#x0201c;Guidelines for Experimental Animals&#x0201d; of the Ministry of Science and Technology (Beijing, China).

The distribution of unique reads in the 8 DGE libraries was compared as an assay of gene coverage. Similar coverage was obtained for all 8 libraries. More than 34% of the unigene sequences in every library have a gene coverage of more than 70% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1-8</xref>), which is determined as the ratio of the base number in a gene covered by unique mapping reads to the total bases number of that gene. Sequencing saturation analysis showed the number of unique tags reached a plateau shortly after the amount of clean reads reached 20 million. Therefore, the 8 libraries fully represent the transcripts expressed in each developmental stage.

This suggests that these miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs may function in IB formation. Furthermore, in order to detect the functional characteristics of miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs, the mRNAs involved in interaction pairs were subjected to a GO analysis and KEGG functional annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>). The mRNAs identified in these pairs included those involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway, Osteoclast differentiation, MAPK signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway and Calcium signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S11</xref>).

Because extensive researches performed that hundreds of miRNAs interact with thousands of target mRNAs to maintain proper gene expression patterns under various physiological functions, as the results we showed. The complexity of the miRNA-mRNA interaction network presents a great challenge for researchers to reveal the roles for specific miRNAs or miRNA-mRNA interactions in specific biological processes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>.

However, the present results indicated that it was not possible, despite repeated attempts to demonstrate IB specific localization of gene from the transcriptome. The failure to demonstrate IB specific gene expression may be because of the fact that the transcriptome contained genes not only for IB, particularly since genes inducing IB development may be expressed in associated tissues, such as muscle.
