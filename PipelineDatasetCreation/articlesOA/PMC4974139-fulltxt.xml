However, the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 contributes to ALS pathophysiology remain elusive. Here, we have found that TDP-43 accumulates in mitochondria in neurons of subjects with ALS or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Disease-associated mutations increase TDP-43 mitochondrial localization. Within mitochondria, wild type (WT) and mutant TDP-43 preferentially bind mitochondria-transcribed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding respiratory complex I subunit ND3 and ND6, impair their expression and specifically cause complex I disassembly. Suppression of TDP-43 mitochondrial localization abolishes WT and mutant TDP-43-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss, and improves phenotypes of transgenic mutant TDP-43 mice. Thus, our studies link TDP-43 toxicity directly to mitochondrial bioenergetics and propose targeting TDP-43 mitochondrial localization as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">ALS is the most common motor disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration in the brain stem and spinal cord<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, while FTD is the second most common form of early-onset dementia caused by neuron loss in the frontal and temporal cortex<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>.

Both spinal cord motor neurons and cortical neurons in the control cases demonstrated mainly nuclear TDP-43 localization, while both ALS motor neurons and FTD cortical neurons showed characteristically high levels of cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref>). Notably, cytoplasmic TDP-43 co-localized with mitochondrial markers in many ALS spinal cord motor neurons or FTD cortical neurons, but minimally overlapped with markers of Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, autophagosome, endosome or peroxisome (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Despite low abundance, cytoplasmic TDP-43 in control human motor neurons and cortical neurons also significantly co-localized with mitochondria (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a&#x02013;d</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p id="P6">We further isolated highly purified mitochondria with preserved membranes from human spinal cord and cortical tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</xref>), and found TDP-43 present in mitochondria from all samples (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e,f</xref>). There was a markedly higher expression of TDP-43 in mitochondria from ALS or FTD than from age-matched controls. Subsequent sub-mitochondrial fractionation analysis revealed that mitochondrial TDP-43 was exclusively present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) but not in outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), intermembrane-space (IMS) or matrix (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g,h</xref>). Immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) analysis of isolated mitochondria and biopsied human cortex confirmed the main localization of TDP-43 in IMM cristae (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Mitochondria from ALS spinal cords or FTD cortices exhibited more TDP-43 labeling than those from age-matched controls. We also isolated mitochondria from freshly collected mouse tissue samples of spinal cord and cortex, and treated them with trypsin and digitonin to permeabilize OMM but not IMM. OMM-proteins MFN2 and MFF were digested by trypsin alone, IMS facing IMM proteins TIM23 and OPA1 were digested by trypsin after OMM permeabilization, while TDP-43 or matrix facing IMM proteins COXIV and F<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2; (also named ATP5B) remained unchanged under all these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2d</xref>). Like COXIV and F<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;, TDP-43 could be digested by trypsin after complete membrane permeabilization via triton X-100.

We first examined TDP-43 expression in mitochondria isolated from primary human fibroblasts derived from ALS patients bearing TDP-43 mutation G298S or A382T (G298S or A382T fibroblasts) and age-matched normal human individuals (normal human fibroblasts, NHFs). TDP-43 mutations in G298S and A382T fibroblasts were confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). Similar to NHFs, G298S and A382T fibroblasts exhibited the predominantly nuclear localization of TDP-43 without cytoplasmic accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>). Whereas all fibroblasts displayed comparable expression of total TDP-43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2h</xref>), G298S and A382T fibroblasts demonstrated significantly higher levels of mitochondrial TDP-43 than NHFs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Supplementary Fig. 2i</xref>). We also compared WT and mutant TDP-43 mitochondrial localization in HEK293 cells or brain and spinal cord tissue samples from transgenic mice overexpressing WT or mutant human TDP-43. Consistently, despite similar levels in total lysates, exogenously expressed human G298S, A315T or A382T TDP-43 showed greater mitochondrial expression than human WT TDP-43 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref>).

The widely used biotin-labeled recombinant F1&#x003b2; precursor protein (pF1&#x003b2;) was included as a positive control<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, while recombinant GFP was employed as a negative control (not shown). pF1&#x003b2; contained a cleavable signal sequence which was cleaved off after import to generate the shorter mF1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Similar to mF1&#x003b2;, WT rTDP-43 survived digitonin/trypsin co-treatment after import (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), demonstrating the successful import to the innards of IMM.

We investigated the effect of TDP-43 on mitochondrial translation in HEK293 cells by the azidohomoalanine (AHA) incorporation assay in the presence of emetine to block cytosolic translation. The synthesis of ND3/6 was significantly reduced by WT TDP-43 overexpression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), consistent with the preferential binding of TDP-43 to their mRNAs. The steady state levels of ND3/6, but not most mitochondrial-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, were indeed decreased by WT TDP-43 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The WT TDP-43-induced reduction in the synthesis or expression of ND3/6 could be blocked by M1 deletion.

TDP-43 expression did not alter the sedimentation patterns of MRPS18B and MRPL44 (mitochondrial ribosome 28S/39S subunit marker) in sucrose gradients of isolated mitochondria, suggesting no effect on overall mitochondrial ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3d</xref>). However, further RNA distribution analysis found that, in contrast to a high degree of sedimentation with 55S ribosomal complex in control cells, additional peaks of ND3/6, but not COXI, mRNA between 28S and 55S complexes could be induced by WT TDP-43, but not &#x00394;M1, overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4">Supplementary Fig. 3e</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Compared with WT TDP-43, all mutant TDP-43s caused further reductions of ND3/6 expression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f, g</xref>).

IMM proteins with internal sequences are imported across OMM through TOM complex via TOM70 and across IMM by TIM22 complex<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.

The co-expression of both ND3/6 was sufficient to alleviate TDP-43-induced complex I disassembly and dysfunction, supporting ND3/6 as specific targets of TDP-43 in mitochondria.

Disease-associated mutations in TDP-43 do not change its IMM localization and binding efficiency to ND3/6 mRNAs. The toxicity of WT/mutant TDP-43 on mitochondria and neurons is likely due to excess mitochondrial TDP-43, which may explain why PM1 treatment, which reduced but did not completely abolish mitochondrial TDP-43, restored mitochondrial and neuronal function in A315T mice to levels comparable to NTG mice.</p><p id="P21">Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes TDP-43-induced neuronal death, and mitochondria are involved in almost all types of cell death including apoptosis and necrosis<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.
