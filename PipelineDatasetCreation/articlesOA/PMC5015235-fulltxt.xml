Recent studies indicated that 2-DG stimulates the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK defensive pathways, which limits the apoptotic efficacy in tumour cell lines. We hypothesized that co-treatment with selected polyphenols could improve 2-DG-provoked apoptosis by preventing defensive kinase activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting or the MTT assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis and necrosis were determined by propidium iodide staining and/or annexin V labeling followed by flow cytometry. Mitochondria pore transition and depolarization were determined by calcein-ATM or rhodamine 123 labeling followed flow cytometry. Intracellular reactive oxygen species and GSH were determined by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate or monochlorobimane labeling followed by flow cytometry or fluorimetry. Expression and phosphorylation of protein kinases were analyzed by the Western blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">(i) 2-DG-provoked apoptosis was greatly potentiated by co-treatment with the sub-lethal concentrations of the flavonoid quercetin in human HL60 acute myeloblastic leukemia cells. Allowing for quantitative differences, apoptosis potentiation was also obtained using NB4 promyelocytic and THP-1 promonocytic cells, using curcumin or genistein instead of quercetin, and using lonidamine instead of 2-DG, but not when 2-DG was substituted by incubation in glucose-free medium. (ii) Quercetin and 2-DG rapidly elicited the opening of mitochondria pore transition, which preceded the trigger of apoptosis. (iii) Treatments did not affect GSH levels, and caused disparate effects on reactive oxygen species generation, which did not match the changes in lethality. (iv) 2-DG and lonidamine stimulated defensive Akt and ERK phosphorylation/activation, while glucose starvation was ineffective. Polyphenols prevented the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation, and in some cases also ERK phosphorylation. In addition, quercetin and 2-DG stimulated GSK-3&#x003b1;,&#x003b2; phosphorylation/inactivation, although with different isoform specificity. The use of pharmacologic inhibitors confirmed the importance of these kinase modifications for apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The present in vitro observations suggest that co-treatment with low concentrations of selected polyphenols might represent a manner of improving the poor anti-tumour efficacy of some glycolytic inhibitors, and that apoptosis potentiation may be at least in part explained by the regulation of defensive protein kinase activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12935-016-0345-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>2-Deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose</kwd><kwd>Lonidamine</kwd><kwd>Natural polyphenols</kwd><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Protein kinases (Akt, ERKs)</kwd><kwd>Acute myeloid leukemia cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci&#x000f3;n, Plan Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica, Desarrollo e Innovaci&#x000f3;n Tecnol&#x000f3;gica, Direcci&#x000f3;n General de Investigaci&#x000f3;n (http://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/idi)</institution></funding-source><award-id>SAF2010-20256</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aller</surname><given-names>Patricio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>JAE-Predoc fellowship from the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas (http://www.csic.es/web/guest/programa-jae)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par35">A characteristic of tumour cells is the profound re-organization of metabolic parameters in relation to their healthy counterparts, allowing them to obtain the macromolecular constituents required for their rapid de-regulated growth and also as alternative sources of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. One of the best known modifications is the increased dependence on glucose metabolism instead of oxidative phosphorylation, even under aerobic conditions (a property known as &#x0201c;aerobic glycolysis&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Warburg&#x02019;&#x02019; effect). This peculiarity made possible the development of glycolysis-targeting drugs as potential anti-cancer agents. This category includes, among others, the glucose inactive analog 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (2-DG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the indazole derivative lonidamine (Lon) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and the small alkylating drug 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Allowing for the disparity in chemical structure and hence in biochemical and molecular effects, these drugs target critical enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, namely hexokinase II (HKII) in the case of 2-DG and Lon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and to a lower extent HKII in the case of 3-BrP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. While promissory results have been obtained in clinical assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the efficacy of these agents is different. Thus, 3-BrP is quite toxic per se, while 2-DG and Lon are well tolerated but poorly efficacious in monotherapy. Nonetheless, 2-DG and Lon may be useful as radio- and chemo-sensitizing agents, overcoming resistance and increasing cyto-reduction by conventional anti-tumour treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Using combinatory assays with the anti-leukemic agent arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), we recently demonstrated that a common effect of the anti-glycolytic drugs is the stimulation (albeit with different kinetics and intensity) of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK defensive pathways in several human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and that this stimulation restrains the apoptotic efficacy of 2-DG and Lon when used as single agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Akt and/or ERK activation by 2-DG was also observed in other tumour cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Polyphenols represent a large collection of molecules present in the plant kingdom. At the low doses attainable in the daily diet these compounds exert multiple protective functions (e.g., against cellular oxidation, inflammation, aging, tumour initiation&#x02026;). On the other hand, at high albeit still pharmacologically attainable concentrations many polyphenols selectively induce apoptosis in tumour cells, and exhibit clinical efficacy either alone or in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While the multiplicity of biochemical actions makes impossible to unequivocally ascribe their anti-cancer action to a single mechanism, a frequent effect of polyphenols is the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt defensive pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For instance, the flavonoid quercetin (Quer) is the natural analog of 2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), a potent PI3K inhibitor commonly used in laboratory research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We previously observed that prolonged treatment (24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h) with sub-lethal concentrations of Quer, curcumin (Cur) and genistein (Gen) reduced the constitutive Akt phosphorylation in U937 and HL60 AML cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. On this ground, we hypothesized the pre-treatment with polyphenols might prevent Akt activation and as a consequence improve the lethality of glycolytic inhibitors. With this hypothesis in mind, in the present work we analyze the capacity of Quer, Cur and Gen to cooperate with 2-DG and Lon to induce apoptosis in HL60 and other AML cell lines. The regulatory function of Akt and other protein kinases, as well as the potential importance of other factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, are examined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p id="Par37">All components for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen, Inc.

This later procedure gives an indirect estimation of the relative number of viable cells in the culture, based on changes in mitochondrial metabolic activity. Cell cycle phase distribution was routinely determined by cell permeabilization followed by PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. When convenient, the resulting histograms were analyzed with the FlowLogic program (Inivai, Victoria, Canada). This technique also provided an estimation of the frequency of apoptotic cells, characterized by low (sub-G<sub>1</sub>) DNA content. The criterion used for necrosis was the loss of plasma membrane integrity, as determined by free PI uptake into non-permeabilized cells and flow cytometry analysis. In addition, apoptosis and necrosis were determined simultaneously by double labeling with annexin V-FITC and PI followed by flow cytometry measurement using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Immunostep, Salamanca, Spain). This procedure allows the distinction between viable cells (annexin V-negative/PI-negative), early apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive/PI-negative), late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V-positive/PI-positive), and genuine necrotic cells (annexin-V negative/PI-positive). Since the loss of plasma membrane integrity leading to free PI penetration is compatible with both genuine necrosis and late apoptosis (also termed &#x0201c;secondary&#x0201d; necrosis), the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was occasionally used to discriminate between these two possibilities.

Nonetheless, apoptosis was greatly potentiated in more than additive manner when the drugs were used in combination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, c). On the ground of the obtained results, the concentrations of 20&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M Quer and 5&#x000a0;mM 2-DG were selected for the following experiments, except when otherwise indicated. The cooperative apoptotic action between Quer and 2-DG was confirmed using the annexin V/PI assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Moreover, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk almost totally abrogated the formation of apoptotic cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b&#x02013;d), corroborating that cell death represents genuine caspase-dependent apoptosis. Of note, treatment with Quer plus 2-DG resulted in free PI uptake by a high proportion of cells. Nevertheless, this effect was also suppressed by z-VAD-fmk (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e), indicating that these cells represent late apoptosis (or &#x0201c;secondary necrosis&#x0201d;) instead of a genuine necrotic response. Finally, a time-course study (3&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) revealed that significant more than additive drug cooperation was firstly detectable at 6&#x000a0;h of treatment (approx. 15&#x000a0;% apoptosis in the combined treatment), and increased thereafter (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1).

This corroborates the role of Akt as a defensive kinase, and indicates that its inhibition by Quer may be at least in part responsible for the increased apoptosis in the combined (Quer/2-DG) treatment. (ii) Co-treatment with the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) or U0126 (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) increased the apoptotic efficacy of Quer and 2-DG alone, and also augmented apoptosis by the Quer/2-DG combination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). This indicates that ERK functions as a defensive kinase serving to restrain lethality by Quer and 2-DG, but may not account for the increased apoptotic efficacy in the combined treatment. (iii) Co-treatment with the GSK-3 phosphorylation inhibitor SB216763 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) augmented the lethality of Quer and 2-DG alone and (although with lower efficacy) of the Quer plus 2-DG combination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c), indicating that drug-provoked GSK-3 phosphorylation/inactivation plays a defensive role. (iv) Finally, activation of p38-MAPK by Quer alone or Quer plus 2-DG seemed irrelevant for apoptosis, since the lethality was not modified by the pharmacologic inhibitors SB203580 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d) or BIRB 796 (0.1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M: data not shown).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Effect of protein kinase inhibitors.

</p><p id="Par56">In final set of experiments, we analyzed Akt and ERK phosphorylation using other phenolic agents and glycolytic inhibitors, as previously assayed for apoptosis (see Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The results are represented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a&#x02013;c, and may be summarized as follows: (i) Gen (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) produced qualitatively similar effects as Quer, namely rapid abrogation of 2-DG-provoked Akt phosphorylation, and (albeit with lower intensity) stimulation ERK activation when used alone. By contrast Cur (8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) was ineffective at 2&#x000a0;h, and required longer pre-treatment to suppress Akt activation. Moreover, under these conditions Cur, which did not per se affect ERK phosphorylation, prevented the activation of this kinase by 2-DG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). (ii) Lon was assayed at 6 and 14&#x000a0;h, since we previously showed that kinase activations by this agent are delayed in relation to 2-DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It could be observed that Quer abrogated or greatly reduced Lon-provoked Akt activation at both time periods (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). (iii) Finally, by contrast to the strong stimulatory effect of 2-DG, the basal Akt phosphorylation was not affected by glucose starvation (Glu&#x02212;), and co-incubation with Quer either did not affect (6&#x000a0;h) or caused a slight late decrease (20&#x000a0;h) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). This correlates with apparent lack of lethality of glucose-starvation, and the low apoptotic efficacy of Quer under these conditions (Glu&#x02212;/Quer) in comparison to 2-DG/Quer (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). By contrast, ERK phosphorylation was strongly stimulated by the combined (Glu&#x02212;/Quer) treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;8</label><caption><p>Effects of other polyphenols, lonidamine and glucose starvation on protein kinase activities.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par57">The present results indicate that that pre-treatment with low lethal concentrations of the flavonoid Quer strongly potentiates the anti-proliferative and apoptotic action of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG in HL60 AML cells. Apoptosis was assessed using different markers, namely DNA loss, phosphatidyl serine translocation, and &#x00394;&#x003a8;m decrease, and the protective action of z-VAD-fmk proves that it is in fact a caspase-mediated response. Our precedent studies demonstrated that Quer and 2-DG, as well as the other agents used here (Lon, Cur and Gen) activated apoptosis throughout the mitochondrial (&#x0201c;intrinsic&#x0201d;) executioner pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study we show that 2-DG and Quer, both of them characterized as mitochondria-targeting drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], cause the rapid induction of mIMP (4&#x000a0;h), which may therefore represent a trigger or at least a necessary condition for apoptosis. Unfortunately the cause-effect relationship between mIMP and apoptosis could not be corroborated, due to the elevated toxicity of commonly used permeability transition pore modulators (cyclosporine A, bongkrekic acid) in leukemia cell models ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and our data not shown).</p><p id="Par58">Additional experiments corroborated the cooperative effect using other polyphenols (Cur, Gen), anti-glycolytic agents (Lon), and leukemia cell models (NB4 promyelocytic, THP-1 promonocytic), although with different efficacy. For instance, Gen was less efficacious than Quer and Cur, and a moderately lethal concentration of the isoflavone was required to obtain good cooperation with 2-DG. As possible explanations, Gen causes cell arrest at G<sub>2</sub>/M (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Fig. S3) and also stimulates myeloid cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which might temporarily restrain the trigger of the apoptotic response. In the same manner, the efficacy of cooperation between Quer and 2-DG was lower in NB4 and THP1 than in HL60 cells. This might be explained by intrinsic differences in molecular and biochemical properties and in the maturation stage of these cell lines. For instance, in addition to the above indicated different susceptibility to 2-DG, THP-1 promonocytic cells are more resistant to Quer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] (an in our experience also to other cytotoxic agents) than the less mature HL60 and NB4 cells. On the other hand, the finding that Quer plus 2-DG and Quer plus Lon induced apoptosis with similar efficacy allows to exclude that apoptosis potentiation may be a trivial consequence of polyphenol-provoked inhibition of GLUT 1 activity and 2-DG uptake, and hence of subsequent biochemical responses (e.g., 2-DG-provoked activation of defensive kinases, as discussed later). By contrast, the apoptotic efficacy of Quer was only marginally increased when 2-DG treatment was substituted by glucose starvation. This indicates that the partial ATP depletion provoked by both treatments may affect cell proliferation, but it is not a determinant of drug lethality. Finally, a cautionary note must be expressed. We centered the attention on the apoptotic response, and for convenience (better observation of drug cooperation) selected sub-lethal drug concentrations. Nonetheless these concentrations caused appreciable anti-proliferative effects, as measured by the MTT assay (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) or by cell counting (the proliferation inhibition rates at 24&#x000a0;h, in relation to the control, were: 43&#x000a0;% for 5&#x000a0;mM 2-DG; 5&#x000a0;% by 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Lon; 44&#x000a0;% by 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Quer; 21&#x000a0;% by 8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Cur; and 65&#x000a0;% by 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Gen). This may be explained in some cases by cell cycle disruption (e.g., almost total G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest by Gen, and with lower intensity by Quer: see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Fig. S3). The molecular mechanisms responsible for Gen-provoked cycle arrest were investigated in a preceding article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, a possible activation of autophagy, which opposes apoptosis, may not be discarded.</p><p id="Par59">The generation of apoptosis and/or necrosis by anti-tumour drugs is frequently associated to oxidative stress, two manifestations of which are the increase in intracellular ROS accumulation and the decrease in anti-oxidant molecules such as GSH. For instance, we earlier demonstrated that the potentiation of arsenic trioxide (Trisenox)-provoked apoptosis by Lon and Gen was mediated by the stimulation of ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], probably due to the interference of Lon and Gen with the mitochondrial respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. On the other hand, 2-DG was reported to decrease ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], while Quer may exert either inhibitory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] stimulatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] effects. Our present results confirm the drug-dependent variability, and above all prove that the increase in lethality in the combined treatments (Quer plus 2-DG and Quer plus Lon) may not be adequately explained by ROS over-production. Thus, Quer not only reduced the basal ROS content, but exacerbated the decrease caused by 2-DG, and reversed the increase caused by Lon to levels lower than in untreated cells. In another study we observed that prolonged (14&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h) treatment with Quer decreased the intracellular GSH content, and as a consequence potentiated the lethality of the GSH-sensitive drug arsenic trioxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However a regulatory role of GSH may be excluded in the present conditions. In fact, Quer did not cause early changes in GSH content, and the impact on apoptosis of a potential long-term alteration may be discarded, in view of the lack of effects of GSH specific inhibitor BSO.</p><p id="Par60">Finally, the present results corroborate the capacity of 2-DG and Lon to stimulate Akt activation in AML cells, and demonstrate that the stimulation is abrogated or attenuated by co-treatment with Quer, Gen and Cur, which at the same time potentiate apoptosis. The cause-effect relationship between Akt inhibition and apoptosis potentiation was supported by experiments using standard pharmacologic protein kinase inhibitors, and was also strengthened by the results obtained using glucose-free medium, where the lack of Akt activation correlates with poor Quer lethality. There are nevertheless some quantitative differences: thus, Akt activation by Lon was delayed in relation to 2-DG; a prolonged pre-treatment with Cur (14&#x000a0;h) was required to abrogate 2-DG-provoked Akt activation; and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M Gen sufficed to block 2-DG-provoked Akt activation, although the pro-apoptotic action of this Gen concentration was poor. The discrepancies might be explained by the particular action mechanisms of the used drugs, and also indicate that Akt inhibition is an important factor but not the only one accounting for apoptotic potentiation in the combined treatments. Noteworthy, prolonged pre-treatment with Cur also abrogated 2-DG-provoked ERK activation, indicating that at least in some circumstances this kinase also regulates apoptosis potentiation in the combined treatments. Nonetheless the function of ERKs in the present experiments is less clear, mainly because the disparity of effects caused by polyphenols. Thus, ERK phosphorylation was strongly stimulated by Quer, slightly stimulated by Gen, and unaffected by Cur. Of note, co-treatment with MEK/ERK inhibitors increased the apoptotic efficacy of Quer alone. It seems therefore that ERK activation serves to restrain excessive polyphenol toxicity, in the same manner as 2-DG toxicity. In addition Quer, alone or with 2-DG, caused p38-MAP activation, but this response seems irrelevant for apoptosis as judged by the null effect of kinase inhibitors. This conclusion is consistent with results obtained by other authors using a Quer analogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Finally, earlier reports indicated that 2-DG elicits Akt-dependent GSK-3&#x003b2; phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] while quercetin increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] or does not affect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] kinase phosphorylation. Using pharmacologic inhibitors, other articles proved that GSK-3 regulates cell growth and/or apoptosis in leukemia cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Our present results indicate that Quer and 2-DG cause hyper-phosphorylation (Ser21/9)/inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; in HL60 cells, although with certain drug-specificity. Thus, Quer (which only activated ERKs) preferentially stimulated the &#x003b1; isoform, while 2-DG (which activated Akt and ERKs) stimulated both &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; isoforms. Most studies in the literature only centered the attention on GSK-3&#x003b2;, but some reports call attention on the functional importance of the &#x003b1; isoform. As an example, GSK-3&#x003b1; knock-down reduced proliferation and caused spontaneous apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and potentiated bortezomib-induced toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], in leukemia cells. Our results show that the GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) does no cause per se significant lethality, but potentiates apoptosis induction by Quer and 2-DG, alone and in combination, in HL60 cells. Since as commented above Quer preferentially stimulates GSK-3&#x003b1;, we might postulate that this isoform is the most important for regulation of Quer lethality. Unfortunately the lack of specificity of the up to date available pharmacologic inhibitors, and the difficulty to perform satisfactory knock-down procedures in the used leukemia cell model, impeded us until now to obtain more clear conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">De-regulation of the MEK/ERK and especially the PI3K/Akt pathway are among the most frequent alterations associated to the generation of the tumour phenotype, as well as to the intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumour cells to anti-cancer treatments. Dietary phenolic agents are in general well tolerated, and might therefore be preferable to approach the problem instead of synthetic pharmacologic drugs. The present results indicate that co-treatment with low concentrations of selected polyphenols increase the apoptotic efficacy of the glycolytic inhibitors 2-DG and Lon in human acute AML cell models, and that this effect may be at least in part explained by the prevention of defensive protein kinase activation, mainly Akt and in some circumstances ERKs. Of course, we did not attempt performing an exhaustive study: in fact, polyphenols affect multiple biochemical and molecular mechanisms other than Akt inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], 2-DG is a dual glycolysis and N-glycosylation inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and Lon inhibits glycolysis but also lactate transport (causing intracellular acidification) and mitochondrial respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In spite of the conceptual and technical limitations we believe that our in vitro study may offer some ideas to improve the efficacy of this potentially important group of anti-tumour drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
