</text></title><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A characteristic of tumour cells is the profound re-organization of metabolic parameters in relation to their healthy counterparts, allowing them to obtain the macromolecular constituents required for their rapid de-regulated growth and also as alternative sources of energy [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>One of the best known modifications is the increased dependence on glucose metabolism instead of oxidative phosphorylation, even under aerobic conditions (a property known as “aerobic glycolysis” or “Warburg’’ effect). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This peculiarity made possible the development of glycolysis-targeting drugs as potential anti-cancer agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This category includes, among others, the glucose inactive analog 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) [4], the indazole derivative lonidamine (Lon) [5], and the small alkylating drug 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrP) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Allowing for the disparity in chemical structure and hence in biochemical and molecular effects, these drugs target critical enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, namely hexokinase II (HKII) in the case of 2-DG and Lon [5, 7], and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and to a lower extent HKII in the case of 3-BrP [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While promissory results have been obtained in clinical assays [5, 6, 9, 10], the efficacy of these agents is different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thus, 3-BrP is quite toxic per se, while 2-DG and Lon are well tolerated but poorly efficacious in monotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, 2-DG and Lon may be useful as radio- and chemo-sensitizing agents, overcoming resistance and increasing cyto-reduction by conventional anti-tumour treatments [4, 5, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Using combinatory assays with the anti-leukemic agent arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), we recently demonstrated that a common effect of the anti-glycolytic drugs is the stimulation (albeit with different kinetics and intensity) of Akt/mTOR and MEK/ERK defensive pathways in several human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, and that this stimulation restrains the apoptotic efficacy of 2-DG and Lon when used as single agents [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Akt and/or ERK activation by 2-DG was also observed in other tumour cell models [13–15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Polyphenols represent a large collection of molecules present in the plant kingdom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>At the low doses attainable in the daily diet these compounds exert multiple protective functions (e.g., against cellular oxidation, inflammation, aging, tumour initiation…). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, at high albeit still pharmacologically attainable concentrations many polyphenols selectively induce apoptosis in tumour cells, and exhibit clinical efficacy either alone or in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>While the multiplicity of biochemical actions makes impossible to unequivocally ascribe their anti-cancer action to a single mechanism, a frequent effect of polyphenols is the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt defensive pathway [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For instance, the flavonoid quercetin (Quer) is the natural analog of 2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002), a potent PI3K inhibitor commonly used in laboratory research [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We previously observed that prolonged treatment (24–48 h) with sub-lethal concentrations of Quer, curcumin (Cur) and genistein (Gen) reduced the constitutive Akt phosphorylation in U937 and HL60 AML cells [20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>On this ground, we hypothesized the pre-treatment with polyphenols might prevent Akt activation and as a consequence improve the lethality of glycolytic inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>With this hypothesis in mind, in the present work we analyze the capacity of Quer, Cur and Gen to cooperate with 2-DG and Lon to induce apoptosis in HL60 and other AML cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The regulatory function of Akt and other protein kinases, as well as the potential importance of other factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, are examined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The results are represented in Fig. 8a–c, and may be summarized as follows: (i) Gen (50 μM) produced qualitatively similar effects as Quer, namely rapid abrogation of 2-DG-provoked Akt phosphorylation, and (albeit with lower intensity) stimulation ERK activation when used alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>By contrast Cur (8 μM) was ineffective at 2 h, and required longer pre-treatment to suppress Akt activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Moreover, under these conditions Cur, which did not per se affect ERK phosphorylation, prevented the activation of this kinase by 2-DG (Fig. 8a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>(ii) Lon was assayed at 6 and 14 h, since we previously showed that kinase activations by this agent are delayed in relation to 2-DG [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>It could be observed that Quer abrogated or greatly reduced Lon-provoked Akt activation at both time periods (Fig. 8b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>(iii) Finally, by contrast to the strong stimulatory effect of 2-DG, the basal Akt phosphorylation was not affected by glucose starvation (Glu−), and co-incubation with Quer either did not affect (6 h) or caused a slight late decrease (20 h) (Fig. 8c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This correlates with apparent lack of lethality of glucose-starvation, and the low apoptotic efficacy of Quer under these conditions (Glu−/Quer) in comparison to 2-DG/Quer (see Fig. 3f). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par57"><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that that pre-treatment with low lethal concentrations of the flavonoid Quer strongly potentiates the anti-proliferative and apoptotic action of the glycolytic inhibitor 2-DG in HL60 AML cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Apoptosis was assessed using different markers, namely DNA loss, phosphatidyl serine translocation, and ΔΨm decrease, and the protective action of z-VAD-fmk proves that it is in fact a caspase-mediated response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Our precedent studies demonstrated that Quer and 2-DG, as well as the other agents used here (Lon, Cur and Gen) activated apoptosis throughout the mitochondrial (“intrinsic”) executioner pathway [11, 12, 20, 21, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that 2-DG and Quer, both of them characterized as mitochondria-targeting drugs [7, 33], cause the rapid induction of mIMP (4 h), which may therefore represent a trigger or at least a necessary condition for apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately the cause-effect relationship between mIMP and apoptosis could not be corroborated, due to the elevated toxicity of commonly used permeability transition pore modulators (cyclosporine A, bongkrekic acid) in leukemia cell models ([45], and our data not shown). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par58"><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments corroborated the cooperative effect using other polyphenols (Cur, Gen), anti-glycolytic agents (Lon), and leukemia cell models (NB4 promyelocytic, THP-1 promonocytic), although with different efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>For instance, Gen was less efficacious than Quer and Cur, and a moderately lethal concentration of the isoflavone was required to obtain good cooperation with 2-DG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>As possible explanations, Gen causes cell arrest at G2/M (see Additional file 3: Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>S3) and also stimulates myeloid cell differentiation [22], which might temporarily restrain the trigger of the apoptotic response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>In the same manner, the efficacy of cooperation between Quer and 2-DG was lower in NB4 and THP1 than in HL60 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>This might be explained by intrinsic differences in molecular and biochemical properties and in the maturation stage of these cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>For instance, in addition to the above indicated different susceptibility to 2-DG, THP-1 promonocytic cells are more resistant to Quer [46] (an in our experience also to other cytotoxic agents) than the less mature HL60 and NB4 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the finding that Quer plus 2-DG and Quer plus Lon induced apoptosis with similar efficacy allows to exclude that apoptosis potentiation may be a trivial consequence of polyphenol-provoked inhibition of GLUT 1 activity and 2-DG uptake, and hence of subsequent biochemical responses (e.g., 2-DG-provoked activation of defensive kinases, as discussed later). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the apoptotic efficacy of Quer was only marginally increased when 2-DG treatment was substituted by glucose starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the partial ATP depletion provoked by both treatments may affect cell proliferation, but it is not a determinant of drug lethality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Finally, a cautionary note must be expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We centered the attention on the apoptotic response, and for convenience (better observation of drug cooperation) selected sub-lethal drug concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless these concentrations caused appreciable anti-proliferative effects, as measured by the MTT assay (Fig. 1a) or by cell counting (the proliferation inhibition rates at 24 h, in relation to the control, were: 43 % for 5 mM 2-DG; 5 % by 100 μM Lon; 44 % by 20 μM Quer; 21 % by 8 μM Cur; and 65 % by 50 μM Gen). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>This may be explained in some cases by cell cycle disruption (e.g., almost total G2/M arrest by Gen, and with lower intensity by Quer: see Additional file 3: Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms responsible for Gen-provoked cycle arrest were investigated in a preceding article [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>In addition, a possible activation of autophagy, which opposes apoptosis, may not be discarded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par59"><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The generation of apoptosis and/or necrosis by anti-tumour drugs is frequently associated to oxidative stress, two manifestations of which are the increase in intracellular ROS accumulation and the decrease in anti-oxidant molecules such as GSH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>For instance, we earlier demonstrated that the potentiation of arsenic trioxide (Trisenox)-provoked apoptosis by Lon and Gen was mediated by the stimulation of ROS production [11, 29], probably due to the interference of Lon and Gen with the mitochondrial respiratory chain [47, 48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, 2-DG was reported to decrease ROS [49, 50], while Quer may exert either inhibitory [33] stimulatory [37, 38] effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Our present results confirm the drug-dependent variability, and above all prove that the increase in lethality in the combined treatments (Quer plus 2-DG and Quer plus Lon) may not be adequately explained by ROS over-production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Thus, Quer not only reduced the basal ROS content, but exacerbated the decrease caused by 2-DG, and reversed the increase caused by Lon to levels lower than in untreated cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>In another study we observed that prolonged (14–24 h) treatment with Quer decreased the intracellular GSH content, and as a consequence potentiated the lethality of the GSH-sensitive drug arsenic trioxide [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>However a regulatory role of GSH may be excluded in the present conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>In fact, Quer did not cause early changes in GSH content, and the impact on apoptosis of a potential long-term alteration may be discarded, in view of the lack of effects of GSH specific inhibitor BSO. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par60"><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Finally, the present results corroborate the capacity of 2-DG and Lon to stimulate Akt activation in AML cells, and demonstrate that the stimulation is abrogated or attenuated by co-treatment with Quer, Gen and Cur, which at the same time potentiate apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The cause-effect relationship between Akt inhibition and apoptosis potentiation was supported by experiments using standard pharmacologic protein kinase inhibitors, and was also strengthened by the results obtained using glucose-free medium, where the lack of Akt activation correlates with poor Quer lethality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>There are nevertheless some quantitative differences: thus, Akt activation by Lon was delayed in relation to 2-DG; a prolonged pre-treatment with Cur (14 h) was required to abrogate 2-DG-provoked Akt activation; and 50 μM Gen sufficed to block 2-DG-provoked Akt activation, although the pro-apoptotic action of this Gen concentration was poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The discrepancies might be explained by the particular action mechanisms of the used drugs, and also indicate that Akt inhibition is an important factor but not the only one accounting for apoptotic potentiation in the combined treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, prolonged pre-treatment with Cur also abrogated 2-DG-provoked ERK activation, indicating that at least in some circumstances this kinase also regulates apoptosis potentiation in the combined treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless the function of ERKs in the present experiments is less clear, mainly because the disparity of effects caused by polyphenols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Thus, ERK phosphorylation was strongly stimulated by Quer, slightly stimulated by Gen, and unaffected by Cur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Of note, co-treatment with MEK/ERK inhibitors increased the apoptotic efficacy of Quer alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>It seems therefore that ERK activation serves to restrain excessive polyphenol toxicity, in the same manner as 2-DG toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition Quer, alone or with 2-DG, caused p38-MAP activation, but this response seems irrelevant for apoptosis as judged by the null effect of kinase inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is consistent with results obtained by other authors using a Quer analogue [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Finally, earlier reports indicated that 2-DG elicits Akt-dependent GSK-3β phosphorylation [13] while quercetin increases [51] or does not affect [52] kinase phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Using pharmacologic inhibitors, other articles proved that GSK-3 regulates cell growth and/or apoptosis in leukemia cells [53–55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Our present results indicate that Quer and 2-DG cause hyper-phosphorylation (Ser21/9)/inactivation of GSK-3α/β in HL60 cells, although with certain drug-specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Thus, Quer (which only activated ERKs) preferentially stimulated the α isoform, while 2-DG (which activated Akt and ERKs) stimulated both α and β isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Most studies in the literature only centered the attention on GSK-3β, but some reports call attention on the functional importance of the α isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>As an example, GSK-3α knock-down reduced proliferation and caused spontaneous apoptosis [56], and potentiated bortezomib-induced toxicity [57], in leukemia cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the GSK-3 inhibitor SB216763 (10 μM) does no cause per se significant lethality, but potentiates apoptosis induction by Quer and 2-DG, alone and in combination, in HL60 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Since as commented above Quer preferentially stimulates GSK-3α, we might postulate that this isoform is the most important for regulation of Quer lethality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately the lack of specificity of the up to date available pharmacologic inhibitors, and the difficulty to perform satisfactory knock-down procedures in the used leukemia cell model, impeded us until now to obtain more clear conclusions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par61"><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>De-regulation of the MEK/ERK and especially the PI3K/Akt pathway are among the most frequent alterations associated to the generation of the tumour phenotype, as well as to the intrinsic or acquired resistance of tumour cells to anti-cancer treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Dietary phenolic agents are in general well tolerated, and might therefore be preferable to approach the problem instead of synthetic pharmacologic drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that co-treatment with low concentrations of selected polyphenols increase the apoptotic efficacy of the glycolytic inhibitors 2-DG and Lon in human acute AML cell models, and that this effect may be at least in part explained by the prevention of defensive protein kinase activation, mainly Akt and in some circumstances ERKs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Of course, we did not attempt performing an exhaustive study: in fact, polyphenols affect multiple biochemical and molecular mechanisms other than Akt inhibition [16–18], 2-DG is a dual glycolysis and N-glycosylation inhibitor [4], and Lon inhibits glycolysis but also lactate transport (causing intracellular acidification) and mitochondrial respiration [5, 48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In spite of the conceptual and technical limitations we believe that our in vitro study may offer some ideas to improve the efficacy of this potentially important group of anti-tumour drugs. </plain></SENT>
