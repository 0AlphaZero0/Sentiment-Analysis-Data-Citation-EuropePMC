<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many of the proteins encoded by the aforementioned genes participate in intraflagellar transport (IFT) in primary cilia, a sensory organelle present in most tissues and essential for specific signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Ciliary structure and function depends on bidirectional transport (anterograde and retrograde) that mobilizes molecules from the base of the cilia to the tip and back. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Each direction uses a different motor system for transport, kinesins for anterograde and dyneins for retrograde212223. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These motor systems bind IFT-B and IFT-A complexes, respectively, which mediate the intake and release of molecules into the cilia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Postnatal radiographs showed dolichocephaly, a prominent occiput, midface hypoplasia (Fig. 1F), a very small thorax with shortened horizontal ribs (Fig. 1G), markedly short long bones with rounded metaphyses and marked hypoplasia of the radii, ulnae, tibiae and fibulae (Fig. 1H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Other radiographic features included small iliac bones and postaxial polydactyly of all extremities (Fig. 1I), consistent with a form of short rib polydactyly syndrome closely resembling SRPS type II or Mohr-Majewski syndrome38. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The p.Arg512* mutation is predicted to be a null allele since the stop codon is not in the last or penultimate exon, so the transcript most likely undergoes nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A non-specific band, that migrated slightly faster than IFT81, did not differ between control and mutant cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that compound heterozygosity for the mutations led to a significant loss of IFT81, more than could be accounted for by presence of one null allele, suggesting that the missense mutation destabilized IFT81. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Because TTC21B mutations have shown to cause ATD, and this variant was predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen with Bayes probability of 0.999 by the MutationTaster algorithm), mRNA and protein levels were characterized by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>IFT81 is a component of the IFT-B core complex that is responsible for the anterograde transport of tubulin and other molecules to the tip of the cilium. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>IFT74 directly interacts with IFT81 and heterodimers of IFT74/81 bind αβ-tubulin, regulating their transport into the cilia in a concentration dependent manner252627. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>There is also a peripheral IFT-B complex composed of the IFT particles 20, 54, 57, 80, 172, and others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Based on the barely detectable levels of IFT81 protein resulting from the mutations, we tested the hypothesis that loss of IFT81 could lead to destabilization of the core IFT-B complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Quantification of core complex proteins IFT74, IFT52 and IFT88 by Western blot analyses showed markedly decreased levels of all three proteins in R98-443A cells (Fig. 2B,D–F), demonstrating that mutations in IFT81 destabilized the IFT-B complex members at the protein level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To determine if mutated IFT81 also disrupted the stability of the kinesin motor responsible for the movement of the IFT-B complex, we analyzed protein levels of KIF3A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>This key component of the kinesin complex43 showed similar protein levels between mutant and control cells (Fig. 2B,G), demonstrating that, although the anterograde IFT-B complex is altered, a key motor protein remained stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>As the IFT-B complex has been shown to bind tubulin monomers, we analyzed the levels of alpha-acetylated tubulin, a specific form of tubulin that constitutes the microtubules of cilia4445. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Acetylation of tubulin increases the stability of microtubules that comprise the cilium and recent data show that kinesin-1 prefers to travel on acetylated microtubule tracks4546. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In ATD chondrocytes there was an increased FL/R ratio at baseline (Fig. 3G,H) that was exaggerated in response to the Hh agonist SAG (Fig. 3G,H), implying IFT81 mutant cells have permanently dysregulated Hh signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Transfection of the cells with IFT81 rescued the GLI3 FL levels (Fig. 3I,J) and partially rescued the FL/R ratio in mutant cells due to the simultaneous decrease of GLI3FL and R forms (Figs 3I and S3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This residue is in a coiled-coil domain (coiled-coil domain residues 416-456), which in IFT81 mediates interactions with IFT74 suggesting that the mutation may interfere with proper assembly of the IFT-B complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The variant found in TTC21B gene in the R98-443 case could also act as a modifier of the phenotype19 although the high frequency of this variant in the population makes it unlikely. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>To date, two other families with IFT81 mutations have been described53. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In both families the affected individuals had ciliopathy-like phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In one case there was homozygosity for a splice junction consensus sequence mutation predicted to lead to exon skipping and an in-frame deletion, implying loss of part of the second coiled-coil domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The affected individual presented at birth with postaxial polydactyly of the feet, bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys and intellectual disability, with no reported retinal or skeletal findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In the second case there was homozygosity for a small deletion toward the 3′ end of the gene, predicting a frameshift and extension of the IFT81 coding region beyond the normal stop codon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The affected individual showed retinal dystrophy and, over time, developed early-onset cone rod dystrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>He was reported as having normal renal function and a normal skeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Phenotypically the cases reported here are quite distinct in that they primarily affect the skeleton, while the previously reported cases with IFT81 mutations had no skeletal involvement beyond postaxial polydactyly seen in one case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts from the second case showed stable levels of IFT81 protein, and immunofluorescence for other IFT-B core complex components, specifically IFT25 and RABL5/IFT22, was not altered in the cells53. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The fibroblasts had a reduced number of cilia that were shorter overall, findings that differed from what was observed in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Our ATD case showed no alteration in ciliogenesis, an increased average length of cilia, and destabilization of the IFT-B complex at the protein level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of disease in the skeletal ciliopathies studied here thus appear to be distinct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Destabilization of the IFT-B complex is accompanied by accumulation of acetylated-tubulin, the structural unit of the cilia microtubules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>How this accumulation happens is unknown, but a possibility is that the destabilization of IFT-B complex leads to altered transport of acetylated-tubulin within the cilia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>An emerging theme in the skeletal ciliopathies is that the ciliary abnormalities lead to loss of cilia length regulation5225455, a finding observed in the cases studied here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>More specifically, longer cilia has been observed in other SRP cases with disruption of the IFT-B as well as other ciliopathies5225657. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Studies have suggested that longer cilia are associated with increased anterograde IFT velocity and this can negatively impact the dynamic process of trafficking of signaling molecules and receptors into the ciliary compartment58. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>How this variability in length contributes to cellular and tissue abnormalities particularly in the skeleton remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities in Hh processing observed in the ATD mutant cells suggest that IHH signaling in the growth plate is likely to be altered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>There are two aspects to the function of IHH in the growth plate that may be affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>IHH is synthesized by prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells and regulates growth plate chondrocyte differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The markedly abnormal structure of the ATD growth plate reflects defects in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In addition, IHH also determines the site of bone collar formation in the adjacent perichondrium, thus coupling chondrogenesis to osteogenesis during endochondral bone development59. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The band of ectopic mineralized tissue across the growth plate suggests that inappropriate ossification effected through altered GLI3 FL/R ratios may have resulted from defective IFT81. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the data demonstrate that mutations in IFT81 produce ATD and SRPS, and expand the number of genes associated with the skeletal ciliopathies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Markedly diminished levels of IFT81 led to instability of the IFT-B complex, loss of ciliary length regulation, altered post-translation modification of tubulin and abnormal Hh signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Through studies of the human skeletal ciliopathies, identification of mutations in the genes encoding each of the IFT particles have provided us with an integrated understanding of cilia function. </plain></SENT>
