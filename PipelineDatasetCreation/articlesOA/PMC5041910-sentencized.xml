</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TGFβ signaling plays an important role in tumor suppression as well as tumor promotion events such as initiation, progression and metastasis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a tumor promoter, TGFβ, the prototype of the TGFβ superfamily, confers metastatic potential to tumor cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), characterized by the acquisition of invasive phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, growth-inhibitory or apoptosis-inducing effects of TGFβ suppress tumor progression [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The dual roles of TGFβ, as either a tumor promoter or a tumor suppressor, depend on the stage of tumor development; it serves as a tumor promoter for aggressive tumors and a tumor suppressor for normal cells or early carcinoma [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these different responses are still unclear despite extensive studies and numerous hypotheses [1, 4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Considering that tumor microenvironments are often enriched in secreted TGFβ [6], cancer cells are considered to be chronically exposed to TGFβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consistently, emerging reports demonstrate that after chronic TGFβ exposure, cancer cells acquire resistance to the growth-inhibitory effect of TGFβ and concurrently acquire malignancy or/and invasive potential (e.g., EMT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Adaptation to chronic TGFβ exposure is achieved via alterations in the signaling networks of tumor cells that make them more prone to malignant progression [7–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Resistance to TGFβ-mediated growth arrest is attributed to loss-of-function mutations or reduced expression of TGFβ signaling components [10], including Smad4, the common mediator of Smad-dependent (canonical) TGFβ signaling [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, attenuation of TGFβ signaling can also reduce tumor cell malignancy by causing the defective production of key EMT-regulatory factors such as ZEB1, TWIST, SLUG and SNAIL [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this regard, cancer malignancy can be seen as a corollary of the abrogation of the tumor suppressive effect of TGFβ and the simultaneous potentiation of its tumor-promoting effect, mediated by alterations in TGFβ signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>TGFβ receptor activation by TGFβ also transmits signals to Smad-independent (non-canonical) pathways through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Rho-like GTPase pathway, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the protein stability of key EMT-regulatory factors, such as Twist, Slug and Snail, is also regulated by ERK, Akt, and GSK3β [14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is highly plausible that the acquisition of dependence on non-canonical TGFβ pathways accounts for the promotion of cancer malignancy even in the absence of SMAD4 [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we established transdifferentiated (TD) cells by exposing A549 tumor cells to chronic TGFβ exposure [7], which revealed skewed signaling toward Akt-GSKβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The increased invasive properties of TD cells were associated with Akt/GSK3β-mediated up-regulation of Snail protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We also reasoned that integrin β3 might direct TGFβ signals toward Akt and GSK3β to stabilize Snail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Consistently, clinical database analysis revealed a poor survival outcome for cancer patients with high integrin β3 mRNA expression, suggesting that the integrin β3-Akt-GSK3β signaling axis could be used as an important therapeutic target for preventing malignant cancer progression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this study, chronic exposure of A549 tumor cells to TGFβ was sufficient by itself to induce EMT, which is characterized by reduced E-cadherin expression and increased N-cadherin expression and cytoskeletal reorganization (see F-actin staining in green; Figure 1A and 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Additionally, real-time PCR analysis revealed that typical EMT markers, such as ZEB1, ZEB2, SLUG and SNAIL, were highly expressed in TD cells (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these EMT characteristics, TD cells showed greater migration and invasion than control A549 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, additional TGFβ stimulation further promoted the cell migration (Figure 1D) and invasion (Figure 1E) of TD cells, but not that of control A549 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The increased invasiveness of TD cells after chronic exposure to TGFβ occurred concomitantly with the up-regulation of MMP9 activity (Figure 1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>TD cells also exhibited resistance to TGFβ-induced growth inhibition, whereas control cells exhibited sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of TGFβ on cell cycle and cell proliferation (Figure S1A and S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Similar to TD cells, a mesenchymal-like cancer cell model with evident pro-metastatic potential, established via E-cadherin depletion, (shEcad) [19], also exhibited resistance to TGFβ-induced growth arrest (Figure S1C and S1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that TD cells could serve as a model for the study of the ‘tumor-prone signaling shift’ that occurs upon TGFβ stimulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>More importantly, phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 upon TGFβ stimulation was significantly attenuated in TD cells (Figure 2B), and the total protein expression level of not only Smad2 and Smad3 but also Smad4, a key co-factor for Smad2/3 nuclear translocation [20], was markedly reduced in TD cells (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Considering the weak SNAIL and SLUG mRNA expression in TD cells after TGFβ exposure (at 2 hours and 10 hours) (Figure 3B), the increase in Snail and Slug protein levels in TD cells (at 2 hours) (Figure 3A) cannot be explained by Smad-dependent SNAIL or SLUG transcription alone (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that cancer cells become refractory to TGFβ-mediated growth suppression and become more aggressive upon chronic exposure to TGFβ, once the cancer acquires mesenchymal properties [3]; this favors a TGFβ-enriched microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identification of the molecular targets that govern the distinctive TGFβ signaling of mesenchymal cancer cells could help develop novel chemotherapeutic approaches to treating cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>To this end, we established a mesenchymal cancer model by exposing A549 tumor cells to chronic TGFβ exposure, which resulted in them becoming refractory to TGFβ-induced growth arrest and susceptible to TGFβ-induced tumor promotion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This model is similar to the irreversible mesenchymal cancer cell model induced by E-cadherin knockdown (Figure 1 and Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The ‘chronic TGFβ model (TD)’ is distinguishable from the ‘TGFβ-induced EMT model’ because the latter is achieved by a single treatment with TGFβ and its EMT phenotypes are transient [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Based on the roles of Snail in EMT and metastasis [37] and the poor prognostic outcomes of patients with high mRNA expression of Snail (Figure S2), we suggest that the increased Snail protein stability observed within 2 hours after treatment with TGFβ (Figure 3A), which increased the invasiveness of TD cells (Figure 3D and 3E), is important for the metastatic potential of mesenchymal cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Akt activity toward GSK3β that leads to Snail protein stabilization could serve as a therapeutic target for reducing metastatic potential (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this, increased Akt phosphorylation correlates positively with the poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer patients [38], emphasizing the clinical significance of high Akt activity in TD cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrated that the increase in the integrin β3 level in several metastatic cancers with low E-cadherin expression, an indicator of loss of epithelial features [27] (Figure 5A), directed the adhesive signal toward the FAK and Akt signaling, which in turn affected Snail protein stability in TD cells (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In this regard, Akt inhibitors, such as MK-2206 [23], or the FAK inhibitor, PF-562271 [39], could be used as starting points for the development of new drugs against mesenchymal cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Identifying a pivotal signaling molecule that decides the metastatic capacity of a certain type of cancer would be highly advantageous for developing new drug targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>For example, induction of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14 (GalNAc-T14), whose expression is extremely low in normal lung tissue [40], in specific types of cancer cells contributes to metastasis through Wnt signaling [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Thus, a β-catenin inhibitor that abrogates the Wnt-dependent gene responses is highly effective in inhibiting metastasis in GalNAc-T14-expressing cancers [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Similarly, because its high expression indicates a poor prognostic outcome (Figure 6) and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance [42], integrin β3 could serve as an indicator for determining whether or not a therapeutic regimen consisting of Akt or FAK inhibitors would be suitable for the treatment of mesenchymal cancers expressing high levels of Snail protein, as summarized in Figure 6D [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In summary, chronic TGFβ promotes the metastatic potential of lung adenocarcinoma by increasing Snail protein stability via its effect on the integrin β3-FAK-Akt-GSK3β signaling axis, suggesting that integrin β3 could be used as an indicator for determining the effectiveness of Akt- or FAK-targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
