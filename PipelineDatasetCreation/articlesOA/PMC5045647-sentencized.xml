</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Advances in next generation sequencing technology have provided access to studies of whole genome variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This technological jump has pushed the fields of population genetics and phylogeography to a higher level of marker density than was conceivable in the PCR era. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction of costs of whole genome sequencing [1] has led to a predictable shift of gold standard methods towards whole genome sequencing approaches, either whole genome resequencing or de novo DNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This trend has already been applied to research on arthropod vectors in which knowledge of population structure, dispersal and gene flow, especially in the framework of vector control, is of paramount importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To date, most studies using whole genome sequencing methods have targeted mosquitoes which serve as malaria [2] or arbovirus [3] vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In contrast, despite their role as vectors for arboviruses of veterinary and economical importance, and being widely spread in much of the world [4], research on Culicoides has not yet benefited from this technological jump. Culicoides genome size is about 200 Mb, similar to Anopheles mosquitoes [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, as biting midges are very small in size (1–3 mm adult length) and only few species have been reared in the laboratory, genomics resources are rare for Culicoides species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Culicoides brevitarsis was first described in Australia in 1917 [6] and it is known to have a wide geographical distribution across the Oriental and Australasian regions [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In Australia, C. brevitarsis appears to be the principal vector of both bluetongue virus (BTV) and Akabane virus which cause economically significant infections of livestock [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Since the initial detection of BTV in Australia in 1977, 12 serotypes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23) have been isolated from the central northern region of Australia, in the Northern Territory (NT) [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only four serotypes (1, 2, 15 and 21) have been detected in the east of the continent with serotypes 1 and 21 being detected since the 1980s along the east coast down to the New South Wales, while serotypes 2 and 15 have been detected only since 2010, and only in Queensland (Qld) (Fig. 1) [10, 12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This suggests the existence of two Australian BTV systems of transmission (northern and eastern), including virus, vectors, potential hosts and environments, or episystems [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The reasons for these two distinct episystems in Australia are unknown.Fig. 1A map showing the collection sites and the distribution of BTV serotypes in Australia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the BTV serotypes depicts the two BTV epidemiological systems: one in the north of Northern Territory (pale orange) and the other in the eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales (pale blue). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The administrative limits of the Australian states and territories are marked with a continuous black line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The BTV serotypes are tagged with their respective distribution zones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The sites of collection of Culicoides are indicated as purple dots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Note the Carpentarian Gap (in blue) located between the two tropical zones of Cape York (northern Queensland) and the Top End (northern NT), at the junction of the BTV serotype distribution zones </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The distribution of C. brevitarsis encompasses the northern part of Western Australia and the Northern Territory (NT), across the northern and east coastal regions of Queensland (Qld), to the narrow coastal strip of the northern half of New South Wales (NSW) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that C. brevitarsis is able to migrate and maintain gene flow between distant populations, such as between Indonesia and Australia [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Knowing if this vector species encounters barriers to its movement that could explain the BTV serotype distribution would be of great importance in understanding the risk of incursion of new serotypes into the eastern zone. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The Restriction Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) technique, first described by Baird et al. in 2008 [17], is the most popular of reduced-representation library sequencing methods [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>It allows reduction of the complexity of genomes leading to deep sequence coverage of the fragments adjacent to the restriction site, subsequently leading to detection of SNPs [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>It has several advantages over previous marker discovery tools such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) due to its ability to identify, verify and score markers concurrently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The RADseq technique is suitable for organisms without an existing reference genome [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It has been applied previously in phylogeography and population genetics of diverse organisms [19], including mosquitoes [2, 3, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Among the techniques for detecting DNA sequence variation for conservation applications, and by extension to population genetics and phylogeography, RADSeq is one of the more economical [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Briefly, genomic DNA from several samples of interest is digested using a restriction enzyme of choice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Adapters containing barcodes that can identify uniquely the specific samples and an overhang corresponding to the restriction enzyme cut site are ligated to the digested fragments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The ligated fragments are sheared and bands in the size range of 300–700 bp are selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These are subsequently amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before sequencing on an Illumina platform [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>While the significance of the RADseq technique in population genetics studies cannot be overstated, a number of methods with simpler and cheaper library preparation steps have been described. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Genotyping by sequencing (GBS), another reduced representation library method [1], allows highly multiplexed sequencing of genomic subsets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The reduction strategy is similar to RADSeq, with the restriction site length defining the degree of reduction [23], and the potential use of double restriction for a higher reduction [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the GBS method, the genomic DNA, the restriction enzyme of choice and adapters are added to the same well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The ligated fragments are amplified by PCR and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Compared to RADSeq, the shearing and size selection steps are eliminated in the GBS procedure, reducing the amount of hands-on time [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This method has been successfully used to study diversity in several species: black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) [27], wheat [10], a moth, the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) [28] and the bumble bee (Bombus bifarius) [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis to be tested in the present study was that deeper sequence coverage and isolation of SNPs from C. brevitarsis DNA might lead to a better understanding of the gene flow pattern of this important BTV vector in Australia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Resolving this may help in understanding the role played by the migration and population structure of this vector in sustaining the epidemiological pattern of serotypes across the continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Both RADseq and GBS have a significant limitation for organisms with scarce amounts of genomic DNA, such as Culicoides [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Pooling of individual samples limits SNP discovery to those with very high allele frequency in the general population and rare alleles are lost [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The first objective of this study was to overcome the limitations posed by pooling of samples by using whole genome amplified (WGA) DNA of C. brevitarsis individuals to isolate SNP markers generated by GBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The second objective was to apply these SNP markers for population genetic studies on C. brevitarsis collected from the two Australian BTV episystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Because of its useful properties for taxonomic resolution and previous use for several Culicoides species [7, 31–33], sequence variation in the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was chosen for comparison with population structure detected using the GBS generated SNPs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The present study describes a simple workflow that allows the isolation of genetic markers from samples of individuals with limited yields of genomic DNA and the further analysis of population genetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This simplified workflow has great potential for application in ecology, evolution and conservation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The study aimed at providing clues to the geographic basis of the two episystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Genotyping by sequencing, as a reduced representation library method [1], allows highly multiplexed sequencing of genomic subsets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The increase in sampling depth of the genomes (hundreds to thousands of loci) provides a powerful tool for studies of evolutionary, demographic and adaptive mechanisms at a population level [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Small sized insects like mosquitoes have been studied by reduced-representation library sequencing techniques such as RADSeq, either by pool [22] or individually [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Despite their power, the application of NGS methods can be hampered by the limited amount of genomic DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Blair et al. [53] successfully isolated SNPs using RADseq after whole genome amplification of grey mouse lemur DNA with no significant genomic bias due to the previous genomic enrichment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The present study has isolated SNP markers using the GBS method from WGA DNA and used the resultant SNPs to genotype individual arthropods from two BTV episystems in Australia, in order to analyze their genetic structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The approach did not require a previous reference genome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Specimens from the same locations analyzed by microsatellite markers in a previous study revealed a panmictic population [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, phylogenetic analysis conducted using both the isolated SNP markers and mtDNA in this study has revealed a sub population of C. brevitarsis in the NT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This sub-population was resolved as a separate cluster with the remainder of the NT samples gathering with samples from east coast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Using mtDNA (among other molecular markers) Tay et al. [54] demonstrated the existence of genetic discontinuity between the NT and eastern populations of C. brevitarsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in terms of population structure between results obtained by microsatellite markers and SNPs and mtDNA could be expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The mutation rates of SNPs (10 -8–10−9) [55] and mtDNA (10−8) [56] are lower than that of microsatellites (range of 10−3–10−5) [28, 57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>These differences in mutation rates may reveal a difference in the targeted time scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>A higher mutation rate, as occurs for microsatellite markers, would detect more recent events than markers with slower mutation rates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focussed our sampling efforts on the two extreme biogeographic regions, NT and NSW of Australia, with limited sampling carried out in Qld. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>It is noticeable that, in the SNP analysis, all samples from Qld clustered with the NSW samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The Gulf of Carpentaria separates Australia’s Top End, encompassing the northernmost section of the NT, from Cape York, a large peninsula at the far North of Queensland (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>It is a biological barrier for many organisms (for a review, see [58]) including plants, birds, mammals [18] and insects [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>For many organisms, the Cape York populations are closer to the Eastern region populations than to the northern Top End, with several examples of reduced gene flow between these populations [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>We recommend further studies involving a wider sampling of C. brevitarsis from Queensland, including Cape York. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This would shed light on the Carpentarian Gap as geographical barrier blocking gene flow between Qld and NT populations of C. brevitarsis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The subpopulation of the NT could be indicative of founder effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>There is a possibility that some genes present in the founder population of the NT may not have been dispersed to the east coast population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Arrival of a unique population in the NT, possibly from Timor-Leste [15, 16] but not yet dispersed to eastern Australia, could also explain the existence of the separate NT sub-population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>However, our sampling included only one site in the NT and one time point. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The FST estimate value obtained in this study suggests significant gene flow between the two populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This shows that contact between the NT and the east coast populations still exists despite the presence of some alleles in the former population not assorted with the latter population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The presence of few loci showing strong evidence of selection could be due to the strong selection for local adaptation of alleles present in these loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Further studies of the SNPs under selection are recommended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The negative Tajima’s D value could be indicative of either an expansion or a positive selection resulting from acquisition of a favourable trait. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The STRUCTURE results suggest that the individuals in this study had admixed genotypes and the individuals derived their ancestry from the two population clusters inferred in an unequal manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The NT population seemed to derive its ancestry almost equally from both clusters while the east coast population seemed to derive its ancestry mainly from population cluster two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>This could indicate that the NT is the ancestral population within Australia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that a combination of GBS to sample genomes densely [60], without need of reference genome, and the low bias of multiple displacement-based amplification [61] allow the use of small amounts of DNA (such as might be obtained from non-invasive sampling) for population genetics studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The technical workflow described in this study is easily translatable to other species and will facilitate understanding of the distribution of pathogens spread by tiny vectors such as sandflies, fleas, lice, ticks, aphids, psyllids and mites. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Although a heterogeneous population of C. brevitarsis (as shown in this study) could be a factor contributing to the presence of two separate BTV episystems in Australia (northern and eastern), these results should be taken with caution since individuals from the NT were sampled on only one occasion from a single site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>More extensive sampling over a wider spatial and temporal range, including the northern part of Queensland (Cape York) would provide better resolution of the genetic connectivity of midge populations in Australia and shed light on the potential role of the Carpentarian Gap as barrier to gene flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The epidemiological significance of the unique NT population, with loci under selection, also warrants investigation for vector competence studies comparing populations of C. brevitarsis from the NT and from eastern Australia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The described workflow is transferable for genotyping of small, non-model organisms, including arthropod vectors of pathogens of economic and medical importance. </plain></SENT>
