Human IgG heavy chains (HCs) associate with light chains (LCs) of the &#x003ba; or &#x003bb; isotype to form mature antibodies capable of binding antigen. The HC/LC interaction involves 4 domains: VH and CH1 from the HC and VL and CL from the LC. Human Fabs with &#x003ba; LCs have been well characterized for their unfolding behaviors and demonstrate a significant level of cooperativity and stabilization when all 4 domains are intact. Very little is known regarding the thermodynamic properties of human Fabs with &#x003bb; LCs. Here, we dissect the domain contributions to Fab stability for both &#x003ba; and &#x003bb; LC-containing Fabs. We find the cooperativity of unfolding between the constant domains, CH1/C&#x003bb;, and variable domains, VH/V&#x003bb;, within &#x003bb; LC-containing Fabs is significantly weaker than that of &#x003ba; LC-containing Fabs. The data suggests there may not be an evolutionary necessity for strong variable/constant domain cooperativity within &#x003bb; LC-containing Fabs. After investigating the biophysical properties of Fabs with mismatched variable and constant domain subunits (e.g., VH/V&#x003ba; paired with CH1/C&#x003bb; or T cell receptor C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2;), the major role of the constant domains for both &#x003ba;- and &#x003bb;-containing Fabs may be to reduce the hydrophobic exposure at the VH/VL interface. Even though Fabs with these non-native pairings were thermodynamically less stable, they secreted well from mammalian cells as well behaved monodisperse proteins, which was in contrast to what was observed with the VH/V&#x003ba; and VH/V&#x003bb; scFvs that secreted as a mixture of monomer and aggregates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Antibody</kwd><kwd>Fab</kwd><kwd>kappa light chain</kwd><kwd>lambda light chain</kwd><kwd>stability</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>

Immunoglobulins of the &#x003b3; isotype (IgGs) are composed of 2 identical light chains (LCs) of either &#x003ba; or &#x003bb; isotype and 2 identical IgG heavy chains (HCs). The most prevalent isotype found in human serum, IgGs are also commonly used as therapeutics, with &#x0003e;30 monoclonal IgGs approved for therapeutic use in a wide range of indications.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The domain architecture of IgGs is complex, and includes both V- and C-class Ig-fold domains.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The V-class Ig-fold domains of the HC and LC (VH and VL, respectively) are responsible for the immense diversity that allows the immune system to generate an adaptive immune response to eliminate pathogens. The variable domains are a combination of a myriad of V, D and J (VH) or V and J (VL) gene elements, and are paired with one another to provide improved diversity. Upon immune stimulation, these domains undergo hypersomatic mutation directing their affinity toward a particular antigen. The V-genes are spliced with the constant (C-class Ig-fold) HC and LC genes, and the full HC and LC proteins are expressed, assembled via chaperones and secreted by immune B cells.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>Once assembled, IgGs have the well-known &#x02018;Y&#x02019; shape comprising 2 Fab (antigen-binding fragment) moieties consisting of the HC/LC pairing region that are the antibody &#x02018;arms&#x02019; and the Fc (fragment crystallizable) moiety consisting of the HC homodimerization/Fc&#x003b3;R binding region that is the &#x02018;stalk&#x02019;.

Thermal unfolding by DSC of the wild-type pertuzumab Fab compared to the individual VH/V&#x003ba; and CH1/C&#x003ba; subunits demonstrated the typical large increase in both stability and cooperativity that is often observed when combining the variable and constant domain subunits within &#x003ba; LC-containing Fabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3A</xref>).<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,11</sup></xref> Within the scFv, one domain was clearly less stable and was identified below as VH. As a native-like Fab consisting of all 4 domains, VHCH1/V&#x003ba;C&#x003ba;, all the domains are stabilized to the extent that they unfold cooperatively as a single unit. This results in a large (+21&#x000b0;C) increase in the VH T<sub>m</sub> and modest increases in T<sub>m</sub> for V&#x003ba; and the CH1/C&#x003ba; subunit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).

</p><p>We next evaluated the specific ability of the CH1/C&#x003ba; subunit to promote such a dramatic increase in Fab stability when paired with VH/V&#x003ba;. In their 2005 report, R&#x000f6;thlisberger and coworkers describe that the stabilization of the individual VH/V&#x003ba; and CH1/C&#x003ba; subunits is likely not the result of non-covalent stabilizing interactions between the V-genes and C-genes since this interface is quite small, but rather the result of a stronger overall interface between HC and LC, with each subunit acting as an ideal linker for one another, which stabilizes the HC/LC interface.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> Based on this, we wished to learn how specific the CH1/C&#x003ba; subunit stabilization is to VH/V&#x003ba; subunits and whether related constant domain subunits could similarly stabilize the VH/V&#x003ba; subunit. The first and most obvious subunit to replace CH1/C&#x003ba; is CH1/C&#x003bb;. Structurally, C&#x003ba; and C&#x003bb; are similar and use similar residues to interact with antibody CH1 domains; however, the sequence homology is only 40%. We also evaluated replacing the entire CH1/C&#x003ba; subunit with the TCR C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; subunit, which is structurally homologous and has been shown capable of pairing with VH/V&#x003ba;.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>DSC data with the native and chimeric Fab constructs clearly shows that the native and stabilizing pairing of CH1/C&#x003ba; with VH/V&#x003ba; is highly specific and not easily reproduced with structural homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). The pertuzumab Fab containing C&#x003bb; instead of C&#x003ba; does experience some stabilization via the combination; the VH domain T<sub>m</sub> increases by 9&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0002">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), but unfolds at a temperature too low compared to the V&#x003ba; and CH1/C&#x003bb; subunit to observe cooperativity. We identified the VH domain as the domain of least stability by adding destabilizing mutations within VH and analyzing the resulting thermal unfolding profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Fig.&#x000a0;3C</xref>). The C&#x003bb;-containing pertuzumab Fab secreted well from HEK293F cells as a well-behaved heterodimer of roughly 50&#x000a0;kDa, unlike the pertuzumab scFv, which expressed poorly and contained a high percentage of aggregates. Thus, while there is clearly a loss of cooperativity and stability within the multi-domain Fab complex when replacing C&#x003ba; with C&#x003bb;, the presence of CH1/C&#x003bb; reduces aggregation/misfolding that occurs within the Fv subunit lacking constant domains.</p><p>To further investigate differences in stability and cooperativity within the pertuzumab Fabs containing C&#x003ba; and C&#x003bb;, a guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturation was performed and monitored by circular dichroism (CD). There is a clear aromatic shoulder present in the far UV CD spectrum of the wild-type pertuzumab Fab that peaks at 234&#x000a0;nm and can be used to monitor unfolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). This shoulder is present, but slightly reduced in intensity in the C&#x003bb;-containing pertuzumab Fab, possibly due to destabilization/modification of the structural environment of the aromatic residue(s) that give(s) rise to the peak. Although the DSC thermal unfolding data clearly shows 3 separate unfolding events for the C&#x003bb;-containing Fab, only one unfolding transition is visible in the GuHCl denaturation monitored by the far UV CD signal. In agreement with the DSC data, the folded state of the C&#x003bb;-containing pertuzumab Fab is less stable when fit to a 2-state denaturation curve (WT Fab &#x00394;G<sub>U</sub>&#x000b0;(20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) = +62 kJ/mol; C&#x003bb; Fab = +49 kJ/mol; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Fig.&#x000a0;4A</xref>). The <italic>m</italic>-value (slope of the unfolding transition) was slightly lower for the C&#x003bb;-containing Fab if the fit values from both 1 and 2&#x000a0;mg/mL experiments are averaged, although not as much as expected based on the DSC data. If only the higher sensitivity 2&#x000a0;mg/mL data is used, the <italic>m</italic>-value of the wild-type pertuzumab Fab is roughly twice that of the Fab containing C&#x003bb;.

</p><p>We next paired the C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; subunit with the pertuzumab VH/V&#x003ba; subunit to determine the effect of pairing entirely different variable and constant domain subunits.

The C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2;-containing pertuzumab Fab did express well with much less intrinsic aggregation than the scFv or scFv-Fc. Together, the CH1/C&#x003bb; and C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; additions to the pertuzumab VH/V&#x003ba;, have a positive effect on the monomeric behavior of the Fab compared to the scFv, perhaps by limiting the overall dynamics of the VH/V&#x003ba; and the exposure of hydrophobic surface area that is buried at the interface.</p><p>The C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; subunit appears to be significantly less stable than isolated CH1/C&#x003ba; or CH1/C&#x003bb;.

With only the potential observation of a C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; unfolding transition by DSC, we considered whether the C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; subunit is not fully folded within the chimeric Fab, but in a partially unfolded state. Many crystal structures of C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; show large areas of irregular secondary structure within the C&#x003b1; domain with a surprising number of unsatisfied backbone hydrogen bonds.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21,22</sup></xref> We incubated the wild-type and C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2;-containing pertuzumab Fabs with the hydrophobic dye ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate), which associates with partially folded proteins.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> No ANS binding was observed for either Fab.

Like the PGT128 Fab, the Fabs with &#x003bb; LCs: 1) did not demonstrate cooperative unfolding of the Fvs and the CH1/C&#x003bb; subunits, and 2) did not have as dramatic increases in the Tm of the Fv when combined with CH1/C&#x003bb; in the Fab format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0006">Fig.&#x000a0;6D</xref>).

Similar to the observations with pertuzumab (&#x003ba; LC) and PGT128 (&#x003bb; LC), there was strong inter-subunit cooperativity between VH/V&#x003ba; and CH1/C&#x003ba; that was much weaker for VH/V&#x003bb; and CH1/C&#x003bb; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>).

While the CH1/C&#x003bb; subunit itself is more stable than the CH1/C&#x003ba; subunit, CH1/C&#x003bb; does not impart the large inter-subunit cooperativity within an intact Fab that CH1/C&#x003ba; does (even when CH1/C&#x003bb; is natively paired with VH/V&#x003bb;). The CH1/C&#x003bb; domains do, however, improve the biophysical properties of the variable domains to which they are associated regardless of whether they are VH/V&#x003ba; or VH/V&#x003bb;. Less aggregation of the pertuzumab Fab containing C&#x003bb; was observed compared to the pertuzumab scFv even though the improvement in Fv thermal stability (based on Tm) was weak. Additionally, the pertuzumab Fab with C&#x003bb; was stable without aggregating for &#x0003e;6 months in solution under refrigerated conditions. The pertuzumab VH/V&#x003ba; scFv did not express with an appreciable level of monomeric protein without being N-terminally fused to an Fc (some diabody may form, although this was not investigated). Adding the C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2; domains, which had little effect on thermal stability, also improved the expression and level of monomer compared to the scFv. Thus, while the CH1/C&#x003ba; domains impart a large thermal stability benefit to VH/V&#x003ba;, and possibly enable assembly and secretion of mAbs with low stability VH/V&#x003ba; domains, addition of <italic>any</italic> of the constant domains subunits (CH1/C&#x003ba;, CH1/C&#x003bb;, or C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2;) to VH/V&#x003ba; had a highly beneficial effect on monodispersity and expression. This may be biologically the more important role of the CH1/CL domains and of particular importance for CH1/C&#x003bb; where the unfolding cooperativity between constant and variable domain subunits is much weaker.</p><p>It could be hypothesized that the correct constant domain/variable domain pairings (e.g., CH1/C&#x003ba; with VH/V&#x003ba;) may be important for full activity. In fact, a study by Ponomarenko and coworkers showed that the Fab &#x02018;elbow angle&#x02019; and domain dynamics changed considerably when replacing C&#x003bb; with C&#x003ba; in a naturally &#x003bb; LC containing Fab.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> This resulted in multiple CDR residues changing rotomer positions and subtle alterations in substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of the catalytic antibody. We have not observed significant differences in antigen binding by replacing C&#x003ba; with C&#x003bb;<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> or CH1/C&#x003ba; with C&#x003b1;/C&#x003b2;<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> having tested multiple Fabs with mismatched domains. It seems likely, as observed with scFvs, that subtle changes in affinity (2&#x02013;4-fold) may occur when making unnatural variable and constant domain pairings, but that catastrophic changes in affinity/activity are likely not induced by modifying the constant domain subunits within Fabs.</p><p>It was interesting to note that VH/V&#x003bb; subunits were stable for all 6 &#x003bb; LC containing antibodies that were evaluated (PGT128, 10C12, 3P6b_B01, and Antibody1&#x003bb;-3&#x003bb;). For even the less stable Fvs, the VH/V&#x003bb; subunits unfolded cooperatively, either in scFv or Fab formats. Such behavior was observed for only one of the 4 VH/V&#x003ba; scFvs described in this study. Folding cooperativity between VH and V&#x003ba; can be induced by engineering stronger interactions between VH and V&#x003ba;;<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> however, such cooperative unfolding appears not to be the norm. Two of the 4 VH/V&#x003ba; scFv described here formed significant aggregates (pertuzumab and Antibody1&#x003ba;); whereas all 4 of the VH/V&#x003bb; scFvs were predominately monodisperse proteins with between 5&#x02013;15% aggregates when expressed in mammalian cells. There was a trend for the scFvs with V&#x003bb; to be more stable (higher Tm). Such behavior may generally lead VH/V&#x003bb; scFvs to exhibit less aggregation and solubility issues than VH/V&#x003ba; scFvs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of C&#x003ba;, C&#x003bb;, C<sub>H</sub>1/C&#x003ba;, and C<sub>H</sub>1/C&#x003bb;</title><p>The constant domain sequences were obtained from the NCBI, synthesized by GeneArt, and subcloned into the pET21a (C&#x003ba; and C&#x003bb;) or pETDuet (CH1/C&#x003ba; and CH1/C&#x003bb;, Novagen).
