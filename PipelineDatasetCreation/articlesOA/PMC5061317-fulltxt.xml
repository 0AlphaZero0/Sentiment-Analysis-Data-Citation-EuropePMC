Activation of these receptors can lead to adverse drug effects as well as drug-drug interactions. Depending on which nuclear receptor is activated will determine which adverse effect could occur, making identification important. Screening for NR activation by New Molecular Entities (NMEs) using cell-based transactivation assays is the singular high throughput method currently available for identifying the activation of a particular NR. Moreover, screening for species-specific NR activation can minimize the use of animals in drug development and toxicology studies. With this in mind, we have developed <italic>in vitro</italic> transactivation assays to identify compounds that activate canine and rat PXR and CAR3. We found differences in specificity for canine and rat PXR, with the best activator for canine PXR being 10 &#x003bc;M SR12813 (60.1 &#x000b1; 3.1-fold) and for rat PXR, 10 &#x003bc;M dexamethasone (60.9 &#x000b1; 8.4 fold). Of the 19 test agents examined, 10 and 9 significantly activated rat and canine PXR at varying degrees, respectively. In contrast, 5 compounds exhibited statistically significant activation of rat CAR3 and 4 activated the canine receptor. For canine CAR3, 50 &#x003bc;M artemisinin proved to be the best activator (7.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 and 10.5 &#x000b1; 2.2 fold) while clotrimazole (10 &#x003bc;M) was the primary activator of the rat variant (13.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 and 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.3 fold). Results from these studies demonstrated that cell-based transactivation assays can detect species-specific activators and revealed that PXR was activated by at least twice as many compounds as was CAR3, suggesting that there are many more agonists for PXR than CAR.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded solely by Puracyp, Inc., and all authors are employees of Puracyp, Inc.

Among these receptors, both CAR and PXR control the expression of CYP3A by xenobiotic exposure in animals and humans [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] through cross-talk mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], making it difficult to identify which nuclear receptor is activated. The importance in identifying the NR being activated lies more in the adverse effects generated by such activation than with drug-drug interactions (DDIs). For example, PXR activation in transgenic mice can cause disruption of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] while activation of human CAR in these mice does not produce such an effect [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PXR activation also increases lipid synthesis and uptake in the liver producing disorders such as hepatic steatosis [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mechanism involved appears to be an increased expression of human stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and other lipogenic enzymes and transporters [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] leading to enhanced triglyceride accumulation and higher levels of total cholesterol [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, CAR activation exerts a beneficial effect by suppressing lipogenic gene expression and reducing serum triglyceride levels and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion from the liver. Another disorder in which PXR and CAR may exert opposing effects is type II diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The CAR agonist, phenobarbital, was shown to decrease plasma glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, individuals treated with the PXR agonist, rifampicin developed hyperglycemia [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This suggests that a PXR activator may produce an adverse effect while a CAR activator may be beneficial, emphasizing the importance of identifying the NR activated.</p><p>Whether PXR and/or CAR are activated by a compound stems from the ligand binding domain (LBD). This region is the most heterogenous region in NR sequences across vertebrate species and hPXR exhibits greater sequence diversity when compared to hCAR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For CAR, significant heterogeneity is observed within the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which is normally more conserved than the rest of the LBD. With regards to PXR, there is a pronounced diversity within the LBP as witnessed by chemically unrelated compounds binding in the micromolar range [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Whether this holds true for animal PXR and/or CAR is not clear, but recent studies suggest a higher degree of compound specificity with rodent PXR when compared to human PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>While drug-drug interactions are not a major concern in the veterinary field, several animal species, particularly rodents are widely used to predict DDIs and adverse effects in humans and therefore it is crucial to elucidate species-specific differences in their activation. Furthermore, activation of animal NRs has implications in toxicology studies [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Screening for species-specific receptor activation can minimize the use of animals and aid in identification of complications associated with drug metabolism and clearance that may occur during pharmacokinetic analyses. An example of such complications would be cyp3a auto-induction reducing the exposure to the test article and rendering the safety evaluation ineffective. Taken together, this accentuates the need for simple and efficient screening methods for species-specific NR activation.</p><p>Here, we describe novel <italic>in vitro</italic> assays for high throughput screening (HTS) of canine and rat PXR and CAR. Importantly, we describe a cell based transactivation assay of canine PXR for the first time. Canine and rat CAR transactivation assays can be performed with either CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 response elements broadening the spectrum of utility. We demonstrate the species-specificity and report several chemicals that have not previously been shown to activate canine and rat PXR or CAR. Overall, the focus of this study was to address the need for assays that identify reagents that activate PXR and/or CAR in two separate species that play important roles in toxicological evaluations for safety and in overall drug development. Determining which receptor is being activated by an agent, can direct human investigations by supplying a mechanistic understanding of adverse drug effects produced via activation of either CAR or PXR.</p><p>Only <italic>in vitro</italic> systems such as those described here that employ a single receptor, can identify the exact mechanism for induction of specific genes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Reagents and cell lines</title><p>DMSO was obtained from Amresco (Solon, OH).

In the transactivation assays we tested both the CYP2B6 (XREM-PBREM) response elements and the proximal and distal response elements from the CYP3A4 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Given the highly conserved DNA binding domain of PXR and CAR across species, the response elements identified in the human genes were employed. When comparing the two different response elements we found that 50 &#x003bc;M artemisinin produced the greatest activation of the CAR3 receptor regardless of the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). This agent produced slightly higher CAR3 activation with the CYP2B6 promoter (10.5 &#x000b1; 0.5 fold) than with the CYP3A4 promoter (7.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 fold). From remaining compounds examined, 10 &#x003bc;M clotrimazole and 10 &#x003bc;M SR12813 significantly activated canine CAR3 in the presence of the CYP3A4 promoter, 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 and 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). When the CYP2B6 promoter was employed, CAR3 activation was significantly activated by DEHP and clotrimazole at 10 &#x003bc;M, 4.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 and 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.4 fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The remaining compounds produced negligible CAR3 activation when either the CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 promoters were employed. A dose-response curve yielded EC<sub>50</sub> and E<sub>max</sub> values for artemisinin of 11.3 &#x003bc;M &#x000b1; 1.4 and 9.2-fold &#x000b1; 1.4 above DMSO, respectively, for cCAR3/2B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). When the CYP3A4 promoters (cCAR3/3A4), were employed artemisinin produced an atypical dose-response curve (data not shown). The primary difference between the two enhancers was that DEHP produced significant activation only when the CYP2B6 promoter was used and SR12813 exhibited activation only in the presence of the CYP3A4 promoter (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone.0164642.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164642.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Compounds Activating One or More Nuclear Receptors.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0164642.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0164642.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Agent</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concentration</th><th align="center" colspan="4" rowspan="1">Nuclear Receptor (Fold Activation<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn001"><sup>a</sup></xref>)</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003bc;M</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Canine PXR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Canine CAR3</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rat PXR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rat CAR3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dexamethasone</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002"><sup>b</sup></xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">-</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.9 &#x000b1;

When the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer were utilized, only 4 agents significantly activated rat CAR3, clotrimazole (10 &#x003bc;M) exhibiting the most significant fold activation reaching 26.9 &#x000b1; 1.3 fold above DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Artemisinin (50 &#x003bc;M) significantly activated rCAR3/3A4 producing a 10.5 &#x000b1; 2.2 fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) which was slightly higher than that produced by rCAR3/2B6 (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Efavirenz (10 &#x003bc;M) and miconazole (10 &#x003bc;M) also exhibited rCAR3/3A4 activation with 7.4 &#x000b1; 3.3 fold and 5.9 &#x000b1; 1.9 increases above DMSO treated cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, all test agents producing a significant activation, exhibited higher activation when the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer was employed (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because clotrimazole produced the greatest fold activation of rCAR3/2B6 and rCAR3/3A4, dose-response curves were constructed to assess potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Typical dose-response curves with concentrations ranging from 0.01 &#x003bc;M to 20 &#x003bc;M (rCAR3/2B6) or 0.1 &#x003bc;M to 20 &#x003bc;M (rCAR3/3A4) were generated and from the curves we obtained an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.4 &#x003bc;M &#x000b1; 0.3 and an E<sub>max</sub> of 13.6 &#x000b1; 2 fold for rCAR3 activation of the CYP2B6 promoter/enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). When the CYP3A4 promoter was employed the EC<sub>50</sub> value was only slightly higher, 4.1 &#x003bc;M &#x000b1; 0.6, but the E<sub>max</sub> was more than twice as high, 29.9 fold &#x000b1; 0.9 above DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0164642.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164642.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Effects of various compounds on transactivation of rat CAR3.</title><p>HepG2 cells were transfected with rat CAR3 or empty expression vector and the CYP2B6 promoter and enhancer linked to a luciferase reporter vector (A) or luciferase reporter vector with CYP3A4 proximal and distal promoter regions (B) before seeding in 96-well plates as described in Materials and Methods.

Results from such assays suggest that PXR and CAR from various species may have evolved to have different functions, such as the promiscuousness of PXR and high basal activity of CAR, while sharing some similarities [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With regards to functionality, differences that exist in ligand-specificity between species have been well documented. However, comparisons between CAR activators and those of PXR have largely been ignored primarily due to a lack of availability of adequate CAR test systems. One reason for the small number of assays available to assess CAR activation may be that several alternative splice variants of CAR are concurrently expressed in liver that exhibit different ligand specificities [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another reason is that transient transfection of CAR in tumor cells normally results in spontaneous nuclear translocation with subsequent high constitutive activity [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This makes identification of CAR activators challenging and to date, a relatively limited number of CAR modulators have been reported. In an attempt to overcome this challenge, one splice variant, hCAR3, that contains an in-frame insertion of five amino acids (APYLT) in the LBD of wild-type (wt) CAR (hCAR1), was found to produce lower constitutive activity allowing xenobiotic activation to be assessed [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This has greatly facilitated the development of cell-based reporter gene assays, including assays to assess CAR activation in various species [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Full-length CAR3 variants from mouse, rat and dog maintained species specificity in ligand binding and molecular modeling verifying that the 5 amino acid insertion present in CAR3 results in a receptor with virtually an identical LBD to that of wt CAR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This indicates that &#x0201c;humanized CAR3&#x0201d;, i.e. species-specific wt CAR with the human CAR3 signature may serve as a unique surrogate for wt CAR where ligand specificity is to be determined. We utilized this approach here to compare the ligand-specificity for rat and canine CAR receptors employing compounds implicated in the activation of human, rat and mouse CAR.</p><p>The compounds selected for these studies reflect species-specific CAR activation stemming from variations in the LBD of the NR or because a single compound may have the opposite species-specific effect on the receptor. For example, CITCO is a prototypical human CAR activator [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] while 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) is selective for mouse CAR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Clotrimazole binds to CAR from most species, but functions as a human CAR inverse agonist and an agonist for mouse and rat CAR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the studies presented here, several known human CAR direct activators, including CITCO and artemisinin, along with indirect activators, phenobarbital, efavirenz, and phenytoin [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] were tested to demonstrate species-specificity of canine and rat CAR3. DEHP, a plasticizer that activates PPAR&#x003b1;, was also selected because it may activate CAR in human hepatocytes and mouse livers [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, identifying which NR, PXR or CAR, is activated in primary hepatocytes by DEHP is complicated because of cross-talk between the receptors for the DNA response elements.</p><p>Cross-talk between hCAR and hPXR reflects an efficient and coordinated mechanism in defending the human body from xenobiotic challenges [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, this feature also generates difficulties in defining the exact biological function of these receptors. CAR binds to both proximal and distal (XREM) CYP3A response elements [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and PXR binds to DR-4 type NR1 and NR2 sequences present in the CYP2B PBREM region [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This cross-talk feature was exhibited in the present investigation by use of human DNA binding element. We employed both the XREM-PBREM response elements from the prototypical CAR promoter, CYP2B6 [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as well as proximal (PXRE) and distal (XREM) response elements from CYP3A4 promoter [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">4A and 4B</xref>). Human response elements, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and animal homologs of these elements exhibit a high degree of conservation. This conservation is also present in the DNA binding domain of the receptor which is typically greater than 95% homologous [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ability to utilize different promoters/enhancers in the assays described here is an advantage over other systems because the best pair of a NR and a response element can be selected for optimal results. Furthermore, employing response elements from human genes for assessing activation of NRs from other species indicates that this system is highly efficient based on the high levels of transactivation by compounds witnessed here. Indeed, ligand-binding assays, such as fluorescence polarization, time-resolved FRET and mammalian two hybrid systems employ only the LBD of the receptor and in the case of the two hybrid system a GAL4 promoter from yeast and a DNA region that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS) are utilized for assessing species specificity. These assays are very useful tools for identifying species specific ligands particularly during early drug discovery [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but it can be argued that utilizing human response elements and a full-length receptor in our species-specific transactivation assays provides a distinct advantage over these systems in data extrapolation to <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>When comparing the two separate promoter and enhancer regions, we found that for all four assays systems, 50 &#x003bc;M artemisinin and 10 &#x003bc;M clotrimazole activated CAR3 (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results are similar to those previously described [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For canine CAR3, artemisinin proved to be the better activator while clotrimazole was the best activator of rat CAR3 regardless of the promoter and enhancer (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">2A, 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">4A and 4B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, canine CAR3 was activated by 10 &#x003bc;M SR12813 only in the presence of the CYP3A4 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) but 10 &#x003bc;M DEHP significantly activated only canine CAR3/2B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), a finding that has not been described previously. A similar trend was observed for the rat CAR3 where ANF activated this receptor only in the presence of the CYP2B6 promoter and produced a negligible effect when the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer were employed (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Differences were also observed in the extent of activation among the two promoters and enhancers; greater activation by clotrimazole was observed for rCAR3/3A4 than rCAR3/2B6 (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, all compounds activating rat CAR3 produced greater activation when the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer were employed with the exception of ANF, suggesting that although somewhat lower activation was observed for CYP2B6 and CAR3, more compounds were activated in the presence of this pair. In contrast, artemisinin and clotrimazole produced similar activation of canine CAR3 regardless of the promoter and enhancer. The fewer compounds activating rat CAR3 when the CYP3A4 promoter was employed may be due to the ER6 motif of PXRE which does not contain DR4 type NR1 and NR2 sequences as does the PBREM region of CYP2B6 promoter and enhancer [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This suggests that CAR3 might bind more efficiently to the CYP2B6 promoter than the CYP3A4 promoter. However, this does not explain the results obtained with the canine CAR3 and the CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 promoters where an equal number of compounds activated the receptor. Overall, the exact reason for different responses between the two P450 promoters is unclear but illustrates the inherent difficulty of using test systems such as primary cultures to elucidate the mechanisms involved in induction of P450 enzymes. Of the 19 agents tested here for activation of rat or dog PXR and CAR3, 9 compounds activated dog PXR and 10 were capable of activating rat PXR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">3A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, only 4 of the agents tested activated dog CAR3 and 5 activated rat CAR3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">4A</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The three agents that activated rat CAR3/2B6 but not dog CAR3/2B6 were efavirenz, ANF, and miconazole, which constitutes a novel finding (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When comparing PXR and CAR3 from both species, the only agent that activated both receptors, albeit to different extents, was clotrimazole (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This drug exhibits broad range of specificity as it has previously been shown to activate human, rat, mouse, and canine PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], confirming our results. Comparison of rat PXR and CAR revealed that efavirenz, clotrimazole and miconazole produced activation of both receptors (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) whereas, dexamethasone only activated rat PXR but had no effect on rat CAR3 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">4A and 4B</xref>). Activation of rat PXR by clotrimazole and miconazole has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and results were similar to those shown here.</p><p>Other differences between CAR3 and PXR activation were noted. First, the fold activation for compounds other than clotrimazole, exhibiting significant differences from control (DMSO-treated) cells is much greater for PXR than for CAR3 (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The most potent activators of CAR3 produced only 3 to 27&#x02014;fold activation above DMSO treated cells while those of PXR produced between 5&#x02013;60 fold. Second, there are more compounds exhibiting statistically significant differences when compared to control when PXR is the nuclear receptor (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This is not surprising given that a recent report [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], using cell-based HTS assays to identify novel human CAR agonists and antagonists showed that of 2816 compounds in the NIH Chemical Genomics Center Pharmaceutical Collection library, 115 were agonists and 152 were antagonists, demonstrating the low number of compounds that ligand to human CAR. We would anticipate similar findings for rat and canine CAR. In contrast, screening for PXR agonists from the same library identified 750 compounds that displayed activation of human PXR and 512 that activated both rat PXR and human PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study of compounds that significantly activated canine PXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), only SR12813, rifampicin and clotrimazole have been reported previously as canine PXR activators with SR12813 exhibiting the most significant activation [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], consistent with our results (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, activation of canine PXR by forskolin, troleandomycin, ritanovir, omeprazole, CITCO and felodipine is a novel finding. Compounds activating rat PXR that have not previously been reported include felodipine, omeprazole, ritonavir and efavirenz (<xref rid="pone.0164642.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results demonstrate the ability of PXR to accommodate a much more diverse population of xenobiotics in its ligand binding region whereas CAR3 has a much more limited ability to bind xenobiotics. These results demonstrate further the importance of employing systems that only contain a single nuclear receptor to identify the receptor responsible for any potential DDIs.</p><p>When comparing results from canine and rat PXR transactivation assays, considerable differences were observed. For example, troleandomycin, rifampicin, and CITCO activate canine PXR, but not rat PXR. Dexamethasone, miconazole, and PCN activate rat PXR, but not canine PXR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">3A</xref>). Overlapping function was also observed. Forskolin, felodipine, OMP, ritonavir, SR12813 and clotrimazole activated both, canine and rat PXR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">3A</xref>). We also identified compounds that overlap in activation capabilities between canine and human PXR including rifampicin, felodipine, troleandomycin, omeprazole, CITCO, ritonavir and SR12813 [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, differences were also observed. Phenobarbital and phenytoin have been shown to activate human PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] but failed to elicit a significant activation of canine or rat PXR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">3A</xref>). It is well known that phenobarbital increases the expression of rat and dog cyp3as and cyp2bs [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], but our results were unable to delineate which NR was involved in this induction. In a similar system, phenobarbital produced substantial activation of hPXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but not rat PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], so it is not surprising that this agent had a negligible effect on rat PXR. It is possible that phenobarbital activates NRs by ligand independent pathways that may be absent in these cell systems.</p><p>Recently, it was determined that human and mouse CAR are regulated by phosphorylation. When the receptor is phosphorylated at Thr<sup>38</sup> [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, CAR is sequestered in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Phenobarbital and possibly other indirect activators bind to EGFR preventing its interaction with epidermal growth factor, thereby repressing its function and decreasing phosphorylation, allowing CAR to translocate to the nucleus and producing activation of target genes. Results presented here suggest that some indirect activators, such as phenobarbital may not activate canine and rat CAR3, consistent with previously published findings [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One explanation may be that phenobarbital may activate a different variant of CAR other than the CAR3 employed here or different/multiple NRs in these species. With regards to the human CAR variants, it has been shown that indirect activators, such as phenobarbital, efavirenz and phenytoin activate CAR1 [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], suggesting that a different CAR variant may lead to activation of the canine or rat receptor by phenobarbital or phenytoin.</p><p>The goal of this investigation was to develop species-specific cell-based transactivation assays to identify NME&#x02019;s with the ability to activate canine and rat PXR and CAR. We demonstrated the species-specificity, shown that PXR and CAR ligands differ, and have established potent and suitable positive controls for each assay; SR12813 for canine PXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), artemisinin for canine CAR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), PCN for rat PXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and clotrimazole for rat CAR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164642.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, there have been only one other study that examined rat and dog CAR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and two other studies that examined rat PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164642.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Results from the investigations described here were similar to those in the three studies. However, different from those previously published, many more compounds were employed in the studies described here and several unique activators were identified. One additional study examined dog PXR [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the latter study utilized only the ligand-binding domain of the receptor and examined very few compounds, making direct comparisons to our studies difficult, given that we utilized the full-length receptor. Few advances have been made in establishing <italic>in vitro</italic> assays that can determine canine PXR activators. Importantly, this is the first investigation to compare PXR and CAR activators in a single study for these two species.

Furthermore, ligand specificity of NRs from different species can lead to alterations in biotransformation causing inaccurate predictions due to auto-induction. Employing the NR assays prior to animal treatment would allow identification of auto-induction that could potentially alter the outcome of pharmacokinetics <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, these assays would be valuable for the drug discovery process in selecting nonhuman pharmacological model systems [<xref rid="pone.0164642.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In summary, we demonstrate that canine and rat PXR and CAR3 transactivation assays are useful for medium and high throughput screening of species-specific PXR and CAR activators. Furthermore, these assays allow for a more definitive identification of the NR involved in the induction of a particular P450 enzyme and in predicting potential adverse drug effects.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANF</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-naphthoflavone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CAR</term><def><p>constitutive androstane receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cCAR3/2B6</term><def><p>combination of canine CAR3 and the human CYP2B6 promoter and enhancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>cCAR3/3A4</term><def><p>combination of canine CAR3 and human CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CITCO</term><def><p>6-(4-Chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DDIs</term><def><p>drug-drug interactions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEHP</term><def><p>bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEX</term><def><p>dexamethasone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMSO</term><def><p>dimethyl sulfoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFR</term><def><p>epidermal growth factor receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hCAR</term><def><p>human CAR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hPXR</term><def><p>human PXR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMEs</term><def><p>new molecular entities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NR</term><def><p>nuclear receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OMP</term><def><p>omeprazole</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBREM</term><def><p>phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCN</term><def><p>pregnenolone-16 &#x003b1;
