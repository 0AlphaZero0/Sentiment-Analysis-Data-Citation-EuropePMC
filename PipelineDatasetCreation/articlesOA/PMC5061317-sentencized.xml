</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Various nuclear receptors have been implicated in gene regulation of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters [1] including the glucocorticoid receptor, vitamin D receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR); all of which are regulated by endobiotics (such as steroid hormones) and many different xenobiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Among these receptors, both CAR and PXR control the expression of CYP3A by xenobiotic exposure in animals and humans [2] through cross-talk mechanisms [1], making it difficult to identify which nuclear receptor is activated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The importance in identifying the NR being activated lies more in the adverse effects generated by such activation than with drug-drug interactions (DDIs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>For example, PXR activation in transgenic mice can cause disruption of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid homeostasis [3] while activation of human CAR in these mice does not produce such an effect [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>PXR activation also increases lipid synthesis and uptake in the liver producing disorders such as hepatic steatosis [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The mechanism involved appears to be an increased expression of human stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 and other lipogenic enzymes and transporters [4] leading to enhanced triglyceride accumulation and higher levels of total cholesterol [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CAR activation exerts a beneficial effect by suppressing lipogenic gene expression and reducing serum triglyceride levels and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion from the liver. Another disorder in which PXR and CAR may exert opposing effects is type II diabetes [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The CAR agonist, phenobarbital, was shown to decrease plasma glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, individuals treated with the PXR agonist, rifampicin developed hyperglycemia [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a PXR activator may produce an adverse effect while a CAR activator may be beneficial, emphasizing the importance of identifying the NR activated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Whether PXR and/or CAR are activated by a compound stems from the ligand binding domain (LBD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This region is the most heterogenous region in NR sequences across vertebrate species and hPXR exhibits greater sequence diversity when compared to hCAR [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For CAR, significant heterogeneity is observed within the ligand-binding pocket (LBP) [8–10], which is normally more conserved than the rest of the LBD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>With regards to PXR, there is a pronounced diversity within the LBP as witnessed by chemically unrelated compounds binding in the micromolar range [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Whether this holds true for animal PXR and/or CAR is not clear, but recent studies suggest a higher degree of compound specificity with rodent PXR when compared to human PXR [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>While drug-drug interactions are not a major concern in the veterinary field, several animal species, particularly rodents are widely used to predict DDIs and adverse effects in humans and therefore it is crucial to elucidate species-specific differences in their activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of animal NRs has implications in toxicology studies [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Screening for species-specific receptor activation can minimize the use of animals and aid in identification of complications associated with drug metabolism and clearance that may occur during pharmacokinetic analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>An example of such complications would be cyp3a auto-induction reducing the exposure to the test article and rendering the safety evaluation ineffective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Taken together, this accentuates the need for simple and efficient screening methods for species-specific NR activation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe novel in vitro assays for high throughput screening (HTS) of canine and rat PXR and CAR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we describe a cell based transactivation assay of canine PXR for the first time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Canine and rat CAR transactivation assays can be performed with either CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 response elements broadening the spectrum of utility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the species-specificity and report several chemicals that have not previously been shown to activate canine and rat PXR or CAR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Overall, the focus of this study was to address the need for assays that identify reagents that activate PXR and/or CAR in two separate species that play important roles in toxicological evaluations for safety and in overall drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Determining which receptor is being activated by an agent, can direct human investigations by supplying a mechanistic understanding of adverse drug effects produced via activation of either CAR or PXR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Only in vitro systems such as those described here that employ a single receptor, can identify the exact mechanism for induction of specific genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Several compounds in this panel are known activators of human PXR, including rifampicin, omeprazole (OMP), tetraethyl 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl-1,1-bisphosphonate (SR12813), phenobarbital, α -naphthoflavone (ANF), phenytoin, forskolin, ritanovir, and troleandomycin [12, 18, 20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 compounds examined, SR12813 (10 μM) exhibited the greatest canine PXR activation with a 60.1 ± 3.1 fold increase, followed by troleandomycin (100 μM), exhibiting a 26.8 ± 3.7 fold activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Clotrimazole (10 μM), OMP (100 μM), and 10 μM rifampicin each produced 15.6 ± 0.07, 9.6 ± 1.3, and 11.3 ± 1.4 fold increases above DMSO treated cells, respectively (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Other canine PXR activators tested here that produced between 5 and 10- fold activation included ritanovir (10 μM), forskolin (10 μM), felodipine (30 μM), and CITCO (10 μM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The remaining compounds produced less than 5-fold activation, values not statistically different from DMSO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>A dose-response curve with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 μM was constructed for the most efficient canine PXR activator, SR12813 (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Cell-based reporter assays facilitate the identification of chemicals activating NRs, including those from human, rabbit, rat, mouse, monkey, pig, zebrafish, and other species [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Results from such assays suggest that PXR and CAR from various species may have evolved to have different functions, such as the promiscuousness of PXR and high basal activity of CAR, while sharing some similarities [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>With regards to functionality, differences that exist in ligand-specificity between species have been well documented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>However, comparisons between CAR activators and those of PXR have largely been ignored primarily due to a lack of availability of adequate CAR test systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>One reason for the small number of assays available to assess CAR activation may be that several alternative splice variants of CAR are concurrently expressed in liver that exhibit different ligand specificities [24–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Another reason is that transient transfection of CAR in tumor cells normally results in spontaneous nuclear translocation with subsequent high constitutive activity [27–30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>This makes identification of CAR activators challenging and to date, a relatively limited number of CAR modulators have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to overcome this challenge, one splice variant, hCAR3, that contains an in-frame insertion of five amino acids (APYLT) in the LBD of wild-type (wt) CAR (hCAR1), was found to produce lower constitutive activity allowing xenobiotic activation to be assessed [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>This has greatly facilitated the development of cell-based reporter gene assays, including assays to assess CAR activation in various species [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Full-length CAR3 variants from mouse, rat and dog maintained species specificity in ligand binding and molecular modeling verifying that the 5 amino acid insertion present in CAR3 results in a receptor with virtually an identical LBD to that of wt CAR [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>This indicates that “humanized CAR3”, i.e. species-specific wt CAR with the human CAR3 signature may serve as a unique surrogate for wt CAR where ligand specificity is to be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>We utilized this approach here to compare the ligand-specificity for rat and canine CAR receptors employing compounds implicated in the activation of human, rat and mouse CAR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The compounds selected for these studies reflect species-specific CAR activation stemming from variations in the LBD of the NR or because a single compound may have the opposite species-specific effect on the receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>For example, CITCO is a prototypical human CAR activator [33] while 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) is selective for mouse CAR [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Clotrimazole binds to CAR from most species, but functions as a human CAR inverse agonist and an agonist for mouse and rat CAR [17, 35–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>In the studies presented here, several known human CAR direct activators, including CITCO and artemisinin, along with indirect activators, phenobarbital, efavirenz, and phenytoin [32, 33, 38–40] were tested to demonstrate species-specificity of canine and rat CAR3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>DEHP, a plasticizer that activates PPARα, was also selected because it may activate CAR in human hepatocytes and mouse livers [41, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>However, identifying which NR, PXR or CAR, is activated in primary hepatocytes by DEHP is complicated because of cross-talk between the receptors for the DNA response elements. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Cross-talk between hCAR and hPXR reflects an efficient and coordinated mechanism in defending the human body from xenobiotic challenges [1, 43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>However, this feature also generates difficulties in defining the exact biological function of these receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>CAR binds to both proximal and distal (XREM) CYP3A response elements [30, 34, 44–47] and PXR binds to DR-4 type NR1 and NR2 sequences present in the CYP2B PBREM region [48–50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>This cross-talk feature was exhibited in the present investigation by use of human DNA binding element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>We employed both the XREM-PBREM response elements from the prototypical CAR promoter, CYP2B6 [16] as well as proximal (PXRE) and distal (XREM) response elements from CYP3A4 promoter [18] (Figs 2A, 2B, 4A and 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Human response elements, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 and animal homologs of these elements exhibit a high degree of conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>This conservation is also present in the DNA binding domain of the receptor which is typically greater than 95% homologous [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>The ability to utilize different promoters/enhancers in the assays described here is an advantage over other systems because the best pair of a NR and a response element can be selected for optimal results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, employing response elements from human genes for assessing activation of NRs from other species indicates that this system is highly efficient based on the high levels of transactivation by compounds witnessed here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Indeed, ligand-binding assays, such as fluorescence polarization, time-resolved FRET and mammalian two hybrid systems employ only the LBD of the receptor and in the case of the two hybrid system a GAL4 promoter from yeast and a DNA region that binds to an upstream activating sequence (UAS) are utilized for assessing species specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>These assays are very useful tools for identifying species specific ligands particularly during early drug discovery [21], but it can be argued that utilizing human response elements and a full-length receptor in our species-specific transactivation assays provides a distinct advantage over these systems in data extrapolation to in vivo [14, 20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>When comparing the two separate promoter and enhancer regions, we found that for all four assays systems, 50 μM artemisinin and 10 μM clotrimazole activated CAR3 (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those previously described [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>For canine CAR3, artemisinin proved to be the better activator while clotrimazole was the best activator of rat CAR3 regardless of the promoter and enhancer (Figs 2A, 2B, 4A and 4B and Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In contrast, canine CAR3 was activated by 10 μM SR12813 only in the presence of the CYP3A4 promoter (Fig 2B) but 10 μM DEHP significantly activated only canine CAR3/2B6 (Fig 2A), a finding that has not been described previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed for the rat CAR3 where ANF activated this receptor only in the presence of the CYP2B6 promoter and produced a negligible effect when the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer were employed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Differences were also observed in the extent of activation among the two promoters and enhancers; greater activation by clotrimazole was observed for rCAR3/3A4 than rCAR3/2B6 (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Indeed, all compounds activating rat CAR3 produced greater activation when the CYP3A4 promoter and enhancer were employed with the exception of ANF, suggesting that although somewhat lower activation was observed for CYP2B6 and CAR3, more compounds were activated in the presence of this pair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>In contrast, artemisinin and clotrimazole produced similar activation of canine CAR3 regardless of the promoter and enhancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>The fewer compounds activating rat CAR3 when the CYP3A4 promoter was employed may be due to the ER6 motif of PXRE which does not contain DR4 type NR1 and NR2 sequences as does the PBREM region of CYP2B6 promoter and enhancer [48–50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CAR3 might bind more efficiently to the CYP2B6 promoter than the CYP3A4 promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>However, this does not explain the results obtained with the canine CAR3 and the CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 promoters where an equal number of compounds activated the receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Overall, the exact reason for different responses between the two P450 promoters is unclear but illustrates the inherent difficulty of using test systems such as primary cultures to elucidate the mechanisms involved in induction of P450 enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 agents tested here for activation of rat or dog PXR and CAR3, 9 compounds activated dog PXR and 10 were capable of activating rat PXR (Figs 1A and 3A and Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 4 of the agents tested activated dog CAR3 and 5 activated rat CAR3 (Figs 2A and 4A, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>The three agents that activated rat CAR3/2B6 but not dog CAR3/2B6 were efavirenz, ANF, and miconazole, which constitutes a novel finding (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>When comparing PXR and CAR3 from both species, the only agent that activated both receptors, albeit to different extents, was clotrimazole (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>This drug exhibits broad range of specificity as it has previously been shown to activate human, rat, mouse, and canine PXR [14, 18, 23], confirming our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Comparison of rat PXR and CAR revealed that efavirenz, clotrimazole and miconazole produced activation of both receptors (Table 1) whereas, dexamethasone only activated rat PXR but had no effect on rat CAR3 (Figs 3A and 4A and 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Activation of rat PXR by clotrimazole and miconazole has been described previously [14] and results were similar to those shown here. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Other differences between CAR3 and PXR activation were noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>First, the fold activation for compounds other than clotrimazole, exhibiting significant differences from control (DMSO-treated) cells is much greater for PXR than for CAR3 (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The most potent activators of CAR3 produced only 3 to 27—fold activation above DMSO treated cells while those of PXR produced between 5–60 fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Second, there are more compounds exhibiting statistically significant differences when compared to control when PXR is the nuclear receptor (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising given that a recent report [51], using cell-based HTS assays to identify novel human CAR agonists and antagonists showed that of 2816 compounds in the NIH Chemical Genomics Center Pharmaceutical Collection library, 115 were agonists and 152 were antagonists, demonstrating the low number of compounds that ligand to human CAR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>We would anticipate similar findings for rat and canine CAR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>In contrast, screening for PXR agonists from the same library identified 750 compounds that displayed activation of human PXR and 512 that activated both rat PXR and human PXR [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>In the present study of compounds that significantly activated canine PXR (Fig 1A), only SR12813, rifampicin and clotrimazole have been reported previously as canine PXR activators with SR12813 exhibiting the most significant activation [23], consistent with our results (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Importantly, activation of canine PXR by forskolin, troleandomycin, ritanovir, omeprazole, CITCO and felodipine is a novel finding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Compounds activating rat PXR that have not previously been reported include felodipine, omeprazole, ritonavir and efavirenz (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the ability of PXR to accommodate a much more diverse population of xenobiotics in its ligand binding region whereas CAR3 has a much more limited ability to bind xenobiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate further the importance of employing systems that only contain a single nuclear receptor to identify the receptor responsible for any potential DDIs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>When comparing results from canine and rat PXR transactivation assays, considerable differences were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>For example, troleandomycin, rifampicin, and CITCO activate canine PXR, but not rat PXR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Dexamethasone, miconazole, and PCN activate rat PXR, but not canine PXR (Figs 1A and 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Overlapping function was also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Forskolin, felodipine, OMP, ritonavir, SR12813 and clotrimazole activated both, canine and rat PXR (Figs 1A and 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>We also identified compounds that overlap in activation capabilities between canine and human PXR including rifampicin, felodipine, troleandomycin, omeprazole, CITCO, ritonavir and SR12813 [12, 18, 20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>However, differences were also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Phenobarbital and phenytoin have been shown to activate human PXR [11, 18, 37] but failed to elicit a significant activation of canine or rat PXR (Figs 1A and 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>It is well known that phenobarbital increases the expression of rat and dog cyp3as and cyp2bs [52–54], but our results were unable to delineate which NR was involved in this induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>In a similar system, phenobarbital produced substantial activation of hPXR [18] but not rat PXR [14], so it is not surprising that this agent had a negligible effect on rat PXR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>It is possible that phenobarbital activates NRs by ligand independent pathways that may be absent in these cell systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was determined that human and mouse CAR are regulated by phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>When the receptor is phosphorylated at Thr38 [55–59] via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, CAR is sequestered in the cytoplasm [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Phenobarbital and possibly other indirect activators bind to EGFR preventing its interaction with epidermal growth factor, thereby repressing its function and decreasing phosphorylation, allowing CAR to translocate to the nucleus and producing activation of target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Results presented here suggest that some indirect activators, such as phenobarbital may not activate canine and rat CAR3, consistent with previously published findings [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>One explanation may be that phenobarbital may activate a different variant of CAR other than the CAR3 employed here or different/multiple NRs in these species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>With regards to the human CAR variants, it has been shown that indirect activators, such as phenobarbital, efavirenz and phenytoin activate CAR1 [39], suggesting that a different CAR variant may lead to activation of the canine or rat receptor by phenobarbital or phenytoin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>The goal of this investigation was to develop species-specific cell-based transactivation assays to identify NME’s with the ability to activate canine and rat PXR and CAR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the species-specificity, shown that PXR and CAR ligands differ, and have established potent and suitable positive controls for each assay; SR12813 for canine PXR (Fig 1B), artemisinin for canine CAR3 (Fig 2C), PCN for rat PXR (Fig 3C) and clotrimazole for rat CAR3 (Fig 4C and 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, there have been only one other study that examined rat and dog CAR [17] and two other studies that examined rat PXR [11, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Results from the investigations described here were similar to those in the three studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>However, different from those previously published, many more compounds were employed in the studies described here and several unique activators were identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>One additional study examined dog PXR [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>However, the latter study utilized only the ligand-binding domain of the receptor and examined very few compounds, making direct comparisons to our studies difficult, given that we utilized the full-length receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Few advances have been made in establishing in vitro assays that can determine canine PXR activators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this is the first investigation to compare PXR and CAR activators in a single study for these two species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>[14, 17] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>The significance of employing assays such as those described here for assessing canine and rat PXR and CAR activation is several fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>First, the number of animals utilized for toxicology studies can be decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Second, selecting an appropriate animal species for toxicology testing in preclinical drug safety trials which has demonstrated to be challenging, [61] may be facilitated by in vitro studies such as those described here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ligand specificity of NRs from different species can lead to alterations in biotransformation causing inaccurate predictions due to auto-induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Employing the NR assays prior to animal treatment would allow identification of auto-induction that could potentially alter the outcome of pharmacokinetics in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Finally, these assays would be valuable for the drug discovery process in selecting nonhuman pharmacological model systems [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrate that canine and rat PXR and CAR3 transactivation assays are useful for medium and high throughput screening of species-specific PXR and CAR activators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these assays allow for a more definitive identification of the NR involved in the induction of a particular P450 enzyme and in predicting potential adverse drug effects. </plain></SENT>
