</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Carcinogens are a large group of substances, organic and inorganic, that are directly involved in causing cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>According to their mode of action they can be categorized as either genotoxic (GTX) or not genotoxic (NGTX). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The former induces specific mutations or chromosome aberrations through direct interaction with DNA, usually by formation of covalent bonds (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Such alterations are detected by a battery of tests (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, micronucleus assays) that measures the integrity and the structure of the DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Non-genotoxic drugs, on the other hand, represents chemicals capable of producing tumorigenesis by some secondary mechanism not directly related to DNA damage (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Their activities are so diverse, that it is easier to define the properties they lack rather than the properties they possess. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In general they are chemicals that do not induce DNA repair, and are negative in in vivo and in vitro tests for mutagenicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor mediated endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, regenerative proliferation, oxidative stress, xenobiotic receptor activation, peroxisome proliferation, induction of inflammatory response and/or gap junction intercellular inhibition (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Free radical production (particularly ROS) is a common sub-mechanism enhanced by several non-genotoxic carcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Basically, cellular damage is promoted when the balance between pro and anti-oxidants is disturbed and the oxidants are not properly neutralized. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The diverse mechanisms of action, the tissue specificity and the lack of genotoxicity make non-genotoxic identification a challenging task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Rodent bioassays are considered the best available method for detecting such carcinogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment is done combining data from bioassays, epidemiological data, toxico-kinetic and disposition studies (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The rationale behind this approach is that many of the drugs known to be carcinogens to humans are also carcinogens to animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Classical studies in rats involve exposures for periods that range from 13 to 14 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, a proportion of chemicals are detected at the end of a 2 year period, making the animal chronic exposure assay elaborate and costly intensive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>A rapid and sensitive method for detecting hepatocarcinogenicity in drug screening is a long sought target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Control of gene transcription is the main regulatory mechanism of biological systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Gene expression precedes protein synthesis, cell proliferation and ultimately pathological modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it should be the most sensitive point to detect early changes (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The aim of this analysis was to build a model that distinguishes non-genotoxic liver carcinogens by using expression profiles from short term exposure chemical treatments in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Experimental data were obtained from the toxicogenomic database DrugMatrix™, The National Toxicology Program (U.S. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The resulting groups are described in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We used Random Forest (RF) for classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Its performance is comparable to other machine learning methods and combined with variable selection aggressively reduces the set of genes (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In this approach, training and test sets are constructed internally and randomly, by iteratively partition of the dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Many decision trees are constructed (in this case 10,000 per RF). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For the kth tree, a random vector θk is created, independent of the other generated vectors but with the same distribution, and a tree is grown casting a unit vote for the most popular class at input × (12). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The process fits random forests iteratively in the training set, at each step discarding the less important variables of previous models, but keeping the OOB error until it drops substantially (fraction dropped = 0.1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Toxicogenomics is defined as the application of genomics technologies to study the adverse effects of pharmaceutical and environmental chemicals, with the hope of improving risk assessment and hazard screening (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In this paradigm, public databases are essential tools for multiple actions, such as comparing profiles, discovering patterns or integrating networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The largest databases available to date are the Japan Project Database (TG-GATE) and DrugMatrix (National Toxicological Program, NTP, USA) (5,6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Their diversity and standardized protocol make them the current reference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>In recent years other databases were made available (CBES, CTD, etc.) and the challenge has been extended to data mining (15). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogenicity are well described, although not well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that most non-genotoxic carcinogens induce neoplasm and exhibit threshold tumor dose-responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Classically, NGTX are regarded as tumor promoters but mechanisms such as regenerative hyperplasia, cytotoxicity or induction of oxidative damage are also key events for tumor initiation (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>There is still uncertainty whether NGTX are capable of initiate tumor events by themselves or whether they need coincidental factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused our efforts to rodent hepatocarcinogens, a common target of safety assessment in drug development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>One of the most, if not the most, important step in class prediction is the correct assignment of the training set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>New experimental data may change the status of a substance to another category limiting applicability of the predictor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Generalization of data is also critical, and in agreement with previous studies, false positives are often difficult to avoid (or “unavoidable”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate a complex process like carcinogenesis, we have selected compounds with three modes of action to train our model: oxidative stressors, peroxisome proliferators and hormone modulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that in some point, similarities among gene profiles would allow discrimination between non-genotoxic carcinogens and other class of chemicals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>We chose Random Forest as our machine learning method because is a robust classification algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Feature reduction was performed by recursive variable elimination while maintaining class error (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>We report a predictor of 54 variables, a number that may be reduced to 24 without losing much prediction accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>After training the model, we applied our classifier to the DrugMatrix test set, which resulted in a relatively low total error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Only three false positives were detected and no false negatives among the OOB samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The small sample size could explain why the prediction error of the test set was lower than the estimation of the training set (0.13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that prediction accuracy increased with increasing doses in the validation set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This behavior could be explained by the fact that DrugMatrix doses for 3 day treatments were higher than TG-GATE in almost all compounds, frequently several times higher than the therapeutic dose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>One of the false positives detected was clotrimazole (CTL), an imidazole antimitotic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>It is an inhibitor of p450, blocker of intracellular Ca++ stores and activator of the xenobiotic response (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>It has important correlation with our predictor, particularly in the induction of ZDHHC2 (Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC2), a protein responsible for membrane binding and protein localization (receptors). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Imidazole agents modulate p450 response by different gene subfamilies and display different actions (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The other two miss-classified drugs were Dexamethasone (DXM) and Stavudine (d4T). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>When compared to our predictor, we found proximity in genes related to stress and inflammation (Cyp1a2, IL1A, COL4A3BP, SDC2, PTTG1, C5ar1, CFH, Cfi). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In line with previous studies, a mechanistic approach is a promising strategy for prediction as well as for pathway or functional category analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In this study, the most significant biological processes comprised those related to cellular respiration, energy derivation by oxidation of organic compounds and generation of precursor metabolites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This observation is in agreement with the known action of nongenotoxins and the role oxidative stress in carcinogenesis (3,19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the presence of genes related to lipid metabolism is typical of profiles delivered by peroxisome proliferators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Others genes involved complement cascade, inflammation response, and some of them were related to cellular attachment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Our signature included synthetic sex steroids (cyperone acetate, 17-methyltestosterone, diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Several of them were shown to produce liver tumors in rats when given at therapeutic doses (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Initially, the non-genotoxic effects of steroids were thought to be triggered by downstream genes of specific receptors, although increasing data suggest that they possess genotoxic action as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>We decided to keep them as NGTX carcinogens because the effect was complementary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Increased CYP activities and alterations in sterol metabolism are frequently associated with hepatomegaly in a non-genotoxic manner (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>A steroid responsive gene, Interleukin-1a (IL-1a), is a high scoring gene in our signature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>It is a critical cytokine whose expression is related with various aspects of human reproduction and expressed in a number of solid tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>IL-1a serves as attractant by lymphocytes that keep the inflammation state that precedes malignancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Sex steroid receptors downregulate and confine IL-1a expression, but its deregulation is a key inducer of proteolytic enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix and remodel tissue (21). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Several studies have provided gene predictors for nongentoxic hepato-carcinogens (22–28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Most of the methodologies used were based on support vector machines (SVM) coupled with a feature reduction algorithm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Published gene classifiers ranged from 9 to more than 100 probes and prediction accuracies were roughly equivalent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In general, data from rats under longer exposures provided higher accuracies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The composition of predictors differed among studies in length and diversity and only few genes overlapped. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The reason for such heterogeneity is given by the differences in experimental designs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, all these factors make biological interpretability more complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>A recent study developed by Gusenleitner et al. (2014) scanned most of the NTP database and built a classifier that englobed liver carcinogenesis (combining both genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens) (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>They validated their model with TG-GATE liver data and estimated liver carcinogenesis with an AUC of 0.78 (56.8% sensitivity and 82.91% specificity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that our signature, although confined to a non-genotoxic subgroup of short term exposure, had in common CYP1a2 and ZDHHC2 as high scoring genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Also, the presence of members of the superfamily of solute carrier proteins (SCL genes) in both signatures indicates the importance that membrane transporters have for drugs that “hitch-hike” one or another to enter the cells (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the inclusion of genotoxic compounds to predict global carcinogenesis resulted in a signature with several cell cycle control genes, essential to the regulation of growth and apoptosis during mutagenic stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Toxicogenomics is a promising field with the hope of aid both the earlier elimination of toxic compounds in the drug pipeline and the discovery of new toxicity mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The biggest target is accurately predict the toxicity of unknown drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, we presented a classifier that can predict non-genotoxic carcinogenicity by using short term exposure treatments from the NTP database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Although we are aware that the classifier does not have the prediction accuracy of signatures of long term exposure, early screening is an advantage that would allow prioritizing compounds for further testing. </plain></SENT>
