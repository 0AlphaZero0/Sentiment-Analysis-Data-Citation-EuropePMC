In normal hearing cochleae the SGNs depend on endogenous neurotrophins secreted by sensory cells in the organ of Corti for survival. SGNs gradually degenerate following deafness and consequently there is considerable interest in developing clinically relevant strategies to provide exogenous neurotrophins to preserve SGN survival. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of a drug delivery system for the cochlea using nanoengineered silica supraparticles. In the present study we delivered Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) over a period of four weeks and evaluated SGN survival as a measure of efficacy. Supraparticles were bilaterally implanted into the basal turn of cochleae in profoundly deafened guinea pigs. One ear received BDNF-loaded supraparticles and the other ear control (unloaded) supraparticles. After one month of treatment the cochleae were examined histologically. There was significantly greater survival of SGNs in cochleae that received BDNF supraparticles compared to the contralateral control cochleae (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0.009). SGN survival was observed over a wide extent of the cochlea. The supraparticles were well tolerated within the cochlea with a tissue response that was localised to the site of implantation in the cochlear base. Although mild, the tissue response was significantly greater in cochleae treated with BDNF supraparticles compared to the controls (repeated measures ANOVA, p = 0.003). These data support the clinical potential of this technology particularly as the supraparticles can be loaded with a variety of therapeutic drugs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1064375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9715-8784</contrib-id><name><surname>Wise</surname><given-names>Andrew K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1005071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Robert K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>National Institutes of Health (USA)</institution></funding-source><award-id>HHS-N-263-2007-00053-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Robert K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Australian Research Council, Australian Laureate Fellowship</institution></funding-source><award-id>120100030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caruso</surname><given-names>Frank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Health and Medical Research Council Project Grant APP1005071 and APP1064375, Australian Research Council under the Australian Laureate Fellowship scheme (120100030), and National Institutes of Health (USA) HHS-N-263-2007-00053-C.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory deficits affecting over 5.3% of people worldwide (approximately 360 million people: World Health Organization, 2012). Deafness can have a significant impact on communication in a hearing world and affect the development of language in children [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with social, vocational and mental health implications throughout life [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The number of people impacted by deafness is expected to rise as the population ages.</p><p>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common form of deafness and typically results from damage to the delicate sensory hair cells within the cochlea, or loss of their synaptic connections with the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The only therapeutic option for people with profound to severe SNHL is a cochlear implant; a bionic device that restores hearing function via electrical stimulation of the remaining SGNs to effectively bypass the lost sensory modality.</p><p>However, one major consequence of SNHL is the progressive degeneration of the SGNs that occurs in both humans [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and animal deafness models [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A primary cause of SGN degeneration is the loss of the endogenous supply of neurotrophins, in particular Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), which are normally produced by hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Both BDNF and NT-3 are required for normal neural development and innervation of cochlear hair cells with NT-3 particularly important for synaptogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As the SGNs are the target neurons for the cochlear implant a functional population of SGNs is essential for the implant to perform effectively. For example, a recent study has shown a strong correlation between word recognition scores and SGN counts indicating that a greater population of SGNs results in better cochlear implant performance [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As such, clinically relevant strategies that can prevent the progressive degeneration of SGN with cochlear implantation have received substantial interest.</p><p>Exogenous administration of neurotrophins using implantable mini-pumps has been shown to improve the survival of SGNs in animal deafness models [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with the SGN peripheral fibres becoming larger and more numerous compared to untreated cochleae [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the supply of neurotrophins from pump-based devices is finite, necessitating the need for pumps to be refilled or replaced and thus leading to concerns over the long-term safety of these devices as a result of infection [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although the long-term survival-promoting effects following the cessation of exogenous neurotrophin delivery are yet to be established there is some evidence that improved SGN survival may persist for at least a short period of time (weeks) following the removal of the exogenous neurotrophin supply [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, this is not a universal finding with one previous study showed no sustained survival effect following cessation of neurotrophin delivery [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is therefore likely that long-term neurotrophin delivery strategies will be required for the survival effects to be maintained over time. Encouragingly, SGN survival can be enhanced when exogenous neurotrophins are applied in concert with electrical stimulation from a cochlear implant (with SGNs also exhibiting lower electrical thresholds) [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] meaning that even at low levels, neurotrophin delivery might remain therapeutically beneficial when combined with cochlear implant use.</p><p>Although there are potential benefits of neurotrophin therapy for clinical application a significant factor limiting translation is the need for a drug delivery mechanism that provides a long-term supply of the neurotrophins in a safe and effective manner. Given the potential infection risks of implantable pump devices [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the limitations of systemic delivery in crossing the blood-labyrinth barrier, research has focused on localised neurotrophins delivery strategies that are clinically translatable and that can be combined with a cochlear implant. These include cell-based therapies [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], gene therapies [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], electrode coating materials [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and biocompatible carrier systems including nanoparticles [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although each approach has advantages and limitations, the use of nanoengineered carriers offers promise of delivering therapeutic levels of neurotrophins in a safe manner that is effective over the long term.</p><p>Recently we have developed a new drug carrier system that uses mesoporous silica nanoparticles as building blocks to form larger (~ 500 &#x003bc;m) supraparticles (SPs) [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments showed that the SPs could be loaded with high payloads of BDNF and a pilot <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment showed that BDNF loaded SPs could be surgically implanted into the cochlea of the guinea pig.</p><p>In the present study we have evaluated the efficacy of BDNF-loaded SPs to protect SGNs from deafness-induced degeneration and assessed the biocompatibility of the SP carrier system by quantifying the tissue response following chronic implantation. The results showed that SPs were biocompatible and able to deliver a therapeutic level of BDNF that resulted in significant SGN survival that was observed throughout a wide extent of the cochlea compared to deafened control cochleae. This finding highlights the clinical suitability of the supraparticle system that can overcome some of the significant safety concerns of pump-based drug delivery devices yet yield similar therapeutic effects in terms of the level and extent of SGN survival throughout the cochlea, an outcome that has proven difficult to achieve in other drug delivery strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>Six young adult pigmented guinea pigs of either sex (mean 550 g) were used in this study.

Prior to any surgical procedure the hearing status was assessed under anesthesia (ketamine, 60mg/kg (Parnell Australia) and xylazine, 4mg/kg (Ilium, Australia); intramuscular injection). Click-evoked auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were measured to assess the hearing status of the guinea pigs before and after deafening using procedures described previously [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

ABRs were measured to acoustic clicks delivered by a calibrated speaker at intensities up to 100 dB peak equivalent (p.e.) sound pressure level (SPL). The ABR was amplified, recorded to computer and averaged over 200 trials that were presented at stimulus intensities ranging from 0 dB to 100 dB p.e. SPL.

Approximately four days after the deafening procedure ABRs were re-measured as described above, to confirm deafness.

Guinea pigs were anaesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (60 mg per kg body weight) and xylazine (4 mg per kg body weight). Using a post-auricular approach, the bulla was exposed and a small hole was drilled to expose the basal turn of the cochlea. A cochleostomy (approximately 800 &#x003bc;m) was made using a 0.8 mm diamond drill and gentle suction was applied to remove bone debris from the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164867.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

There was a significantly greater density of peripheral fibres as indicated by a greater proportion of nerve fibres within the osseous spiral lamina in the BDNF-SP treated cochleae.

Many of the other clinically translatable approaches to deliver neurotrophins to the cochlea described above (e.g. gene therapy, cell-based therapy, electrode coatings and hydrogels placed on the round window) have observed SGN survival effects typically restricted to the basal cochlear regions, in close proximity to the drug delivery device. The results of the current study showed that there was no significant difference in SGN survival between BDNF-SPs and Control-SPs in the apical cochlear region (region 6&#x02013;8). It is known that SGNs in the apical cochlear regions are less susceptible to degeneration following aminoglycoside exposure, even when there is complete destruction of the organ of Corti, indicating that apical SGNs are less susceptible to deafness-induced degeneration [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, a lack of a statistical difference in SGN survival in apical regions does not necessarily indicate that a therapeutic level of BDNF was not present.

The tissue response was primarily located in the lower basal turn (Region A), principally around the site of the cochleostomy and was restricted to a small proportion of the scala tympani. Further along the cochlea, in the middle turns (Region B) the tissue response, if present, occupied an even smaller proportion of the scala tympani. The tissue response was only observed in the scala tympani, with the other cochlear compartments (the scala vestibuli and scala media) devoid of any tissue response. These finding provide evidence that the SPs were well tolerated <italic>in vivo</italic>. There was a significantly greater tissue response in Region A of the BDNF-SP treated cochleae compared to the Control-SP treated cochleae.

The current study has used a SP carrier system with characteristics that make it uniquely suited for drug delivery to the cochlea. Firstly, the relatively large size of the SPs (~500 &#x003bc;m) meant that they were easily handled during surgical implantation into the cochlea and would ensure that they could not disperse far from the implantation site. Dispersal of smaller particles or cells from the cochlea to the central nervous system and/or the vestibular end organs is problematic because it reduces the therapeutic load to the target SGNs within the cochlea. A number of researchers have used hydrogels or foams to minimise the dispersal of particles or cells from the cochlea [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Secondly, the SPs provide sustained released of BDNF [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] meaning that longer durations of drug delivery are possible. Thirdly, the SPs can be loaded with high payloads of therapeutics and deliver therapeutic levels of these drugs. Fourthly, the immobilization of the BDNF in the pores of the SPs serves to protect the protein from denaturing <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and thus maintains its bioactivity [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] whereas protein instability over time is a problem when stored in mini-pumps [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This is important as neurotrophins have a relatively rapid half-life <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The results showing significant SGN survival support the conclusion that the released BDNF was biologically effective. Fifthly, the SP technology enables the use of multiple drugs, each loaded in separate SPs that can potentially have release characteristics tailored for best effect for each drug type. Finally, the SP system offers the clinician the option of implanting the SPs into the cochlea, for instance along with a cochlear implant, or implanting them onto to round window membrane (external to the cochlea). The round window membrane is permeable to small molecules and drugs [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A current clinical approach to deliver therapeutic compounds to the cochlea to treat hearing loss is to inject drugs into the middle ear cavity and rely on passive diffusion of the drug across the round window membrane. However, with this technique much of the drug is quickly lost, thus limiting the efficacy of the technique for delivering drugs to the cochlea. Implantation of drug-loaded SPs onto the round window membrane would be expected to improve drug entry into the cochlea [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Clinical Relevance for Cochlear Implants</title><p>Due to the progressive nature of many types of SNHL it is highly likely that delivery techniques providing localised drug delivery over extended durations will be most successful. Because the cochlea becomes accessible during implantation surgery, it provides the opportunity of implanting a therapeutic delivery device inside the cochlea, along with the electrode array. The features of the SP delivery system (as discussed above) make it a suitable drug delivery strategy for combination with cochlear implantation in order to improve nerve survival and/or to protect residual hearing.</p><p>There is a strong correlation in SGN survival and cochlear implant performance with greater numbers of surviving SGNs resulting in improved cochlear implant performance [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The development of clinically translatable neurotrophin delivery strategies that increase SGN survival and the survival of their peripheral fibres, and reduce the electrical thresholds [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] would therefore be likely lead to improvements in cochlear implant function in contemporary devices. Furthermore, ongoing SGN degeneration and cell loss is a significant impediment to the clinical implementation of current focussing strategies that aim to provide more precise neural activation within the cochlea [<xref rid="pone.0164867.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164867.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Technology that prevents SGN and nerve fibre loss, and promotes SGN fibre regrowth, may improve the clinical outcomes of future stimulation strategies designed to improve the precision of neural activation within the cochlea.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study has shown that SPs can provide a safe and effective strategy to delivery therapeutics to the inner ear for SGN survival, with survival effects observed over a wide extent of the cochlea. The SPs were well tolerated by the cochlea providing evidence that the technique is clinically relevant. Future studies to evaluate the supraparticle distribution and the pharmacokinetics of the released therapeutic would pave the way for clinical translation of the drug delivery strategy. The technology could potentially be combined with a cochlear implant to improve implant performance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks to Associate Professor James Fallon, Ms. Nicole Critch, Ms. Prudence Nielsen, Mr. Damian Robb and Dr Sue Peirce for their contributions to this research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0164867.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Geers</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Moog</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schick</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>. <article-title>Acquisition of spoken and signed English by profoundly deaf children</article-title>. <source>J Speech Hear Disord</source>. <year>1984</year>;<volume>49</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>378</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>88</lpage>.
