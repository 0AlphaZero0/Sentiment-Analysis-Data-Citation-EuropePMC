</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss is one of the most common sensory deficits affecting over 5.3% of people worldwide (approximately 360 million people: World Health Organization, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Deafness can have a significant impact on communication in a hearing world and affect the development of language in children [1], with social, vocational and mental health implications throughout life [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The number of people impacted by deafness is expected to rise as the population ages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common form of deafness and typically results from damage to the delicate sensory hair cells within the cochlea, or loss of their synaptic connections with the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The only therapeutic option for people with profound to severe SNHL is a cochlear implant; a bionic device that restores hearing function via electrical stimulation of the remaining SGNs to effectively bypass the lost sensory modality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, one major consequence of SNHL is the progressive degeneration of the SGNs that occurs in both humans [3, 4] and animal deafness models [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A primary cause of SGN degeneration is the loss of the endogenous supply of neurotrophins, in particular Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), which are normally produced by hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti [8–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Both BDNF and NT-3 are required for normal neural development and innervation of cochlear hair cells with NT-3 particularly important for synaptogenesis [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As the SGNs are the target neurons for the cochlear implant a functional population of SGNs is essential for the implant to perform effectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, a recent study has shown a strong correlation between word recognition scores and SGN counts indicating that a greater population of SGNs results in better cochlear implant performance [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>As such, clinically relevant strategies that can prevent the progressive degeneration of SGN with cochlear implantation have received substantial interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Exogenous administration of neurotrophins using implantable mini-pumps has been shown to improve the survival of SGNs in animal deafness models [17–24] with the SGN peripheral fibres becoming larger and more numerous compared to untreated cochleae [20, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, the supply of neurotrophins from pump-based devices is finite, necessitating the need for pumps to be refilled or replaced and thus leading to concerns over the long-term safety of these devices as a result of infection [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although the long-term survival-promoting effects following the cessation of exogenous neurotrophin delivery are yet to be established there is some evidence that improved SGN survival may persist for at least a short period of time (weeks) following the removal of the exogenous neurotrophin supply [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, this is not a universal finding with one previous study showed no sustained survival effect following cessation of neurotrophin delivery [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that long-term neurotrophin delivery strategies will be required for the survival effects to be maintained over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Encouragingly, SGN survival can be enhanced when exogenous neurotrophins are applied in concert with electrical stimulation from a cochlear implant (with SGNs also exhibiting lower electrical thresholds) [29–32] meaning that even at low levels, neurotrophin delivery might remain therapeutically beneficial when combined with cochlear implant use. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although there are potential benefits of neurotrophin therapy for clinical application a significant factor limiting translation is the need for a drug delivery mechanism that provides a long-term supply of the neurotrophins in a safe and effective manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Given the potential infection risks of implantable pump devices [26] and the limitations of systemic delivery in crossing the blood-labyrinth barrier, research has focused on localised neurotrophins delivery strategies that are clinically translatable and that can be combined with a cochlear implant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These include cell-based therapies [32–34], gene therapies [35–41], electrode coating materials [42–45] and biocompatible carrier systems including nanoparticles [46–49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although each approach has advantages and limitations, the use of nanoengineered carriers offers promise of delivering therapeutic levels of neurotrophins in a safe manner that is effective over the long term. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Recently we have developed a new drug carrier system that uses mesoporous silica nanoparticles as building blocks to form larger (~ 500 μm) supraparticles (SPs) [50]. In vitro experiments showed that the SPs could be loaded with high payloads of BDNF and a pilot in vivo experiment showed that BDNF loaded SPs could be surgically implanted into the cochlea of the guinea pig. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have evaluated the efficacy of BDNF-loaded SPs to protect SGNs from deafness-induced degeneration and assessed the biocompatibility of the SP carrier system by quantifying the tissue response following chronic implantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The results showed that SPs were biocompatible and able to deliver a therapeutic level of BDNF that resulted in significant SGN survival that was observed throughout a wide extent of the cochlea compared to deafened control cochleae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This finding highlights the clinical suitability of the supraparticle system that can overcome some of the significant safety concerns of pump-based drug delivery devices yet yield similar therapeutic effects in terms of the level and extent of SGN survival throughout the cochlea, an outcome that has proven difficult to achieve in other drug delivery strategies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the relatively large size of the SPs (~500 μm) meant that they were easily handled during surgical implantation into the cochlea and would ensure that they could not disperse far from the implantation site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Dispersal of smaller particles or cells from the cochlea to the central nervous system and/or the vestibular end organs is problematic because it reduces the therapeutic load to the target SGNs within the cochlea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>A number of researchers have used hydrogels or foams to minimise the dispersal of particles or cells from the cochlea [46, 67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the SPs provide sustained released of BDNF [50] meaning that longer durations of drug delivery are possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the SPs can be loaded with high payloads of therapeutics and deliver therapeutic levels of these drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Fourthly, the immobilization of the BDNF in the pores of the SPs serves to protect the protein from denaturing in vivo [53], and thus maintains its bioactivity [54] whereas protein instability over time is a problem when stored in mini-pumps [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This is important as neurotrophins have a relatively rapid half-life in vivo [68–70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The results showing significant SGN survival support the conclusion that the released BDNF was biologically effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Fifthly, the SP technology enables the use of multiple drugs, each loaded in separate SPs that can potentially have release characteristics tailored for best effect for each drug type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Finally, the SP system offers the clinician the option of implanting the SPs into the cochlea, for instance along with a cochlear implant, or implanting them onto to round window membrane (external to the cochlea). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The round window membrane is permeable to small molecules and drugs [71, 72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>A current clinical approach to deliver therapeutic compounds to the cochlea to treat hearing loss is to inject drugs into the middle ear cavity and rely on passive diffusion of the drug across the round window membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>However, with this technique much of the drug is quickly lost, thus limiting the efficacy of the technique for delivering drugs to the cochlea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Implantation of drug-loaded SPs onto the round window membrane would be expected to improve drug entry into the cochlea [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Clinical Relevance for Cochlear Implants </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Due to the progressive nature of many types of SNHL it is highly likely that delivery techniques providing localised drug delivery over extended durations will be most successful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Because the cochlea becomes accessible during implantation surgery, it provides the opportunity of implanting a therapeutic delivery device inside the cochlea, along with the electrode array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The features of the SP delivery system (as discussed above) make it a suitable drug delivery strategy for combination with cochlear implantation in order to improve nerve survival and/or to protect residual hearing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>There is a strong correlation in SGN survival and cochlear implant performance with greater numbers of surviving SGNs resulting in improved cochlear implant performance [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The development of clinically translatable neurotrophin delivery strategies that increase SGN survival and the survival of their peripheral fibres, and reduce the electrical thresholds [30, 41, 73] would therefore be likely lead to improvements in cochlear implant function in contemporary devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ongoing SGN degeneration and cell loss is a significant impediment to the clinical implementation of current focussing strategies that aim to provide more precise neural activation within the cochlea [56, 74, 75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Technology that prevents SGN and nerve fibre loss, and promotes SGN fibre regrowth, may improve the clinical outcomes of future stimulation strategies designed to improve the precision of neural activation within the cochlea. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This study has shown that SPs can provide a safe and effective strategy to delivery therapeutics to the inner ear for SGN survival, with survival effects observed over a wide extent of the cochlea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The SPs were well tolerated by the cochlea providing evidence that the technique is clinically relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Future studies to evaluate the supraparticle distribution and the pharmacokinetics of the released therapeutic would pave the way for clinical translation of the drug delivery strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The technology could potentially be combined with a cochlear implant to improve implant performance. </plain></SENT>
