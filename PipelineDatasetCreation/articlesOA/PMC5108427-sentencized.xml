</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Most patients with psoriasis vulgaris1 can effectively manage their disease with topical use of vitamin D3 analogues and corticosteroids, either as separate products used in combination or as fixed combination formulations.2, 3 The fixed combination of calcipotriol 50 μg/g (Cal) and betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate; BD) has demonstrated increased efficacy and fewer adverse events (AEs) compared with the individual active components.4, 5 An innovative alcohol‐free aerosol foam formulation of the fixed combination (Cal/BD aerosol foam) has been developed to enhance drug delivery and improve treatment acceptability and adherence for patients with psoriasis vulgaris. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Enhanced drug delivery has been demonstrated in an in vitro skin penetration study, whereby steady‐state Cal/BD levels were significantly higher following Cal/BD aerosol foam application compared with the fixed combination ointment.6 Moreover, Phase II trials have demonstrated improved treatment efficacy.7 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Many topical corticosteroids for psoriasis treatment are available in differing potencies and formulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In Europe, corticosteroids are classified into four types according to increasing potency, from I (mild) to IV (very potent), whereas in the US, corticosteroids are divided into seven classes based on decreasing potency, from 1 (super‐potent) to 7 (lowest potency). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of topical corticosteroid potency is vital to ensure appropriate use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although corticosteroids have favourable tolerability profiles when used within routine therapeutic ranges, excessive exposure to very potent corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of cutaneous and systemic side effects.8, 9 Corticosteroid potency is often assessed by vasoconstriction assays.10 The McKenzie and Stoughton vasoconstriction assay (human skin blanching test)11 evaluates the blanching (whitening) response induced in healthy skin by topical corticosteroid application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since it is a measure of corticosteroid diffusion through the outermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum), the intensity of blanching has been shown to be directly related to the inherent potency of topical corticosteroids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, corticosteroid potency, as determined by the vasoconstriction assay, correlates with clinical activity in psoriasis,12 and as such is considered a measure of corticosteroid efficacy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>If topical corticosteroids are used appropriately, the incidence of side effects is rare; however, used inappropriately, corticosteroids can cause serious local (e.g. skin atrophy) or systemic effects (e.g. suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis).13 The risk of side effects is higher the greater the potency of topical corticosteroid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a change in topical formulation can result in greater total absorption of corticosteroid, which could have important implications for the patient in terms of safety and/or efficacy.14, 15 Therefore, it is important to determine the steroid potency of topical therapies to ensure appropriate use and minimize the risks associated with treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The aim of this vasoconstriction study in healthy volunteers was, therefore, to evaluate the steroid potency of BD in Cal/BD aerosol foam and compare it with other well‐known topical products containing corticosteroids of different potencies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Enrolled healthy volunteers were 18–50 years old, with skin type I to IV (Fitzpatrick scale).16 All demonstrated adequate vasoconstriction prior to the study, which was defined as visual skin blanching score of at least one unit (scale 0–4) after non‐occlusive Cal/BD ointment application for 4–6 h on a 2.2‐cm diameter forearm test area (different to study test sites). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Volunteers were excluded if they received systemic treatments (including corticosteroids, other vasoactive drugs and acetylsalicylic acid) or any medications that could interfere with the blanching reaction within 2 weeks, or used topical corticosteroids on the test areas within 4 weeks prior to enrolment. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>This was a Phase I, single‐centre, investigator‐blinded, vehicle‐controlled, intra‐individual comparison study (NCT01946386). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Each volunteer received a single application of each test product: Cal/BD aerosol foam, clobetasol propionate 0.5 mg/g cream [CP; very potent (EU); super‐potent (US)], Cal/BD ointment [BD; potent (EU and US)], fluocinolone acetonide 0.25 mg/g ointment [FA; moderately potent (EU); medium‐strength potency (US)], BD aerosol foam and aerosol foam vehicle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Treatment application was randomized per volunteer to six anterior forearm test sites (a seventh site remained untreated as a negative control; each circular test site was 2.2‐cm in diameter, delineated using a disposable device and outlined with an indelible marker). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Each volunteer received a unique randomization number that determined application scheme; the randomization schedule was based on five Latin squares (7 × 7) generated by LEO Pharma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>A calibrated Eppendorf® pipette (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) was used to transfer 20 μL of CP cream, Cal/BD ointment and FA ointment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Cal/BD aerosol foam, BD aerosol foam and aerosol foam vehicle were sprayed onto pre‐weighed dishes and propellants allowed to evaporate for at least 30 s until 14.5–19.5 mg of active ingredients remained (corresponding to 20 μL ± 15%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Treatments were administered by trained study centre personnel, gently rubbed in with different gloved fingers, and treatment site protected with non−occlusive gauze. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>According to the McKenzie–Stoughton11 vasoconstriction trial design, the treatment period was 6 h, after which remaining treatments were removed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Colorimetric and visual vasoconstriction assessments occurred at 6 h and 10 min (allowing for remaining topical product to be removed after 6 h) and at 8, 10, 12, 24, 28 and 32 h post‐application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>A colorimetric assessment occurred within 30 min prior to application to determine baseline skin colour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>For visual assessments, two independent, trained observers scored the degree of skin blanching for each test site and the mean was calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Visual assessment of skin blanching was evaluated on a 5‐point scale [0, no change in skin colour; 1, slight (barely visible) blanching; 2, obvious blanching; 3, intense blanching; 4, maximal blanching]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Colorimetric measurements were performed with a chromameter (Konica Minolta CR 400) using the L* a* b* system, commonly used for evaluation of the human skin blanching test.17, 18, 19 This study evaluated the L* value (luminance), which represents relative brightness ranging from total black (L* = 0) to total white (L* = 100), and the a* value, representing the balance between red (positive values) and green (negative values); b* was not analysed as it is not modified by the blanching phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Before use, the chromameter was calibrated to a standard white calibration plate (CR‐A); calibration was performed each time the instrument was switched on. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Due to a Food and Drug Administration regulatory requirement, post‐hoc analysis of visual skin blanching assessment was performed for measurements recorded 2 h after investigational product removal (using 8‐h assessment measurements). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For each treatment site and time point, colorimetric parameters a* and L* were normalized to baseline and then to the untreated site to eliminate diurnal variation in skin colour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>All AUC0–32 scores were compared between treatment groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with individuals, treatments and sites as factors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The degree of skin blanching is a measure of the inherent potency of a corticosteroid and its ability to diffuse into the skin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that the skin blanching response elicited by the innovative aerosol foam formulation of Cal/BD is significantly greater than Cal/BD ointment, but less than that elicited by CP cream, when evaluated by visual assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The greater skin blanching effect observed with Cal/BD aerosol foam compared with Cal/BD ointment, according to the colorimetric parameters, did not reach statistical significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the fact that the vasoconstriction test is usually performed to evaluate monocomponent steroid products, whereas in our study we have evaluated a combination formulation of steroid (BD) and vitamin D3 analogue (Cal). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an additional consideration was that Cal‐induced redness20 could have affected colorimetric measurement of the blanching effect of BD, such that the steroid potency may have been underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Indeed, chromametric measurement non‐discriminately assesses skin colour over the entire test area, whereas by visual assessment, a trained reader may differentiate between blanching effect and red spots due to Cal irritation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Thus, the more pronounced blanching detected visually with Cal/BD may appear reduced when using the chromameter that evaluates concomitant skin blanching and redness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Although the aerosol foam and the ointment both contain fixed combination Cal/BD, this study demonstrated enhanced potency of the aerosol foam formulation compared with the ointment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This could be attributed, in part, to the differing properties of each vehicle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that vehicle properties may impact upon drug delivery and local bioavailability.15 The explanation for this is not fully understood, although it has been suggested that formulations containing volatile components may improve drug delivery.15 Rapid evaporation of the vehicle may lead to ‘super‐saturation’ of active components on the skin and greater transfer into the skin compared with traditional formulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, an in vitro skin penetration model demonstrated increased penetration of Cal and BD into skin with the aerosol foam formulation compared with the ointment, resulting in significantly higher steady‐state levels of both individual components.6 This enhanced penetration of active ingredients following a change in vehicle type has been observed previously; clinical trials demonstrated that betamethasone valerate foam and clobetasol propionate foam were absorbed more rapidly with greater total absorption than their comparison formulations, betamethasone valerate lotion and clobetasol propionate solution, respectively.14 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In addition to the enhanced potency demonstrated by this study, a Phase III study has demonstrated that Cal/BD aerosol foam is highly efficacious and well‐tolerated.21 Phase II studies have demonstrated significantly greater efficacy of Cal/BD aerosol foam compared with each individual active component used alone (Cal aerosol foam and BD aerosol foam),22 and compared with Cal/BD ointment.23 A further Phase III trial has been performed (NCT02132936). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Enhanced delivery and increased bioavailability of the active components in the skin,6 as well as increased treatment efficacy,7, 22 may translate into less medication and exposure to corticosteroid being required for effective disease management; however, this requires further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>No AEs were reported during this study, although it must be considered that the study was in healthy volunteers and the treatment period was very short (32 h), meaning that very few AEs would be expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>However, Phase II7, 22 and Phase III21 trials have demonstrated that Cal/BD aerosol foam maintains the favourable safety and tolerability profile established with Cal/BD ointment and gel.5, 24, 25, 26 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in this vasoconstriction study in healthy volunteers, the fixed combination Cal/BD aerosol foam showed a significantly greater skin blanching response than Cal/BD ointment but less than CP cream, indicating that the corticosteroid potency of fixed combination Cal/BD aerosol foam is greater than that of Cal/BD ointment (a potent corticosteroid) but less than that of a very potent corticosteroid, CP 0.5 mg/g cream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The enhanced potency of Cal/BD aerosol foam is not associated with compromised safety, as demonstrated by Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>As such, Cal/BD aerosol foam may provide greater efficacy than Cal/BD ointment, highlighting the importance of vehicle formulation in topical psoriasis treatments. </plain></SENT>
