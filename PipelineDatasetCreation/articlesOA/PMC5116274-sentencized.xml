<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A major challenge at the interface of developmental and systems neuroscience is to relate this spatiotemporal trajectory of maturation to circuit‐level functional organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study examined the development of two extraocular motor nuclei (nIII and nIV), structures in which a motoneuron's identity, or choice of muscle partner, defines its behavioral role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used retro‐orbital dye fills, in combination with fluorescent markers for motoneuron location and birthdate, to probe spatial and temporal organization of the oculomotor (nIII) and trochlear (nIV) nuclei in the larval zebrafish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe a dorsoventral organization of the four nIII motoneuron pools, in which inferior and medial rectus motoneurons occupy dorsal nIII, while inferior oblique and superior rectus motoneurons occupy distinct divisions of ventral nIII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dorsal nIII motoneurons are, moreover, born before motoneurons of ventral nIII and nIV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The order of neurogenesis can therefore account for the dorsoventral organization of nIII and may play a primary role in determining motoneuron identity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Trajectories of sensory neuron development were recently linked to their mature sensitivity profiles (Li et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the motor system, links between spatiotemporal organization and functional circuitry exist among interneuron subtypes involved in motor circuits (Lewis and Eisen, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the zebrafish spinal cord, interneuron birth order is related not only to dorsoventral topography but also to electrophysiological properties and recruitment order during progressively faster swimming behaviors (Fetcho and McLean, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Spatiotemporal organization has likewise been observed for mammalian spinal cord interneuron populations with distinct functional roles (Tripodi et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Similar evidence at the level of motoneuron organization is sparse, but would be welcome given the clear correspondence of motoneuron‐to‐muscle wiring and behavioral outputs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This study seeks to address the outstanding question of developmental organization of extraocular motoneuron pools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The oculomotor periphery consists of three cranial motor nuclei whose connectivity has been well characterized across vertebrate species, thanks to their participation in highly conserved goal‐driven and reflexive behaviors (Büttner‐Ennever, 2006): the oculomotor (nIII), trochlear (nIV), and abducens (nVI) nuclei. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>nIII comprises motoneuron populations innervating four of the six extraocular muscles and is the only one of these nuclei to house multiple pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Motoneurons targeting each extraocular muscle are organized into pools within nIII, the coherence of and overlap between pools varying between species (Evinger, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Such clustering also exists among motoneurons in the spinal cord, which form pools that innervate distinct muscles (Jessell et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Pool clustering is dependent on cadherin signaling but independent of underlying motoneuron identity, or choice of muscle target (Price et al., 2002; Demireva et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The development of nIII motoneuron identity is controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>One proposal for how individual motoneurons come to acquire their identity is post‐hoc self‐identification following random extraocular muscle innervation (Glover, 2003), consistent with target‐derived signals regulating motoneuron connectivity (Ladle et al., 2007) but not with a stereotyped order of subpopulation birth (Shaw and Alley, 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Others propose that a caudal‐to‐rostral order of differentiation of both extraocular muscle and motoneuron groups allows each newly‐born pair to match (Evinger, 1988), although this conflicts with the observed order of motor nucleus development (Altman and Bayer, 1981; Varela‐Echavarría et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We set out to elucidate the process of motoneuron fate determination in larval zebrafish. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A model vertebrate, the larval zebrafish has contributed much to our understanding of the organization and development of oculomotor circuitry and behavior (Miri et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recent work described the timecourse of axonal pathfinding and synaptogenesis between oculomotor neurons and their target extraocular muscles (Clark et al., 2013), but no characterization of either nIII motoneuron pool organization or its development yet exists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As part of a rich behavioral repertoire (Fero et al., 2010), 3–4‐day‐old larval zebrafish begin to perform eye movements (Easter and Nicola, 1997) involving all six extraocular muscles: two for nasal/temporal horizontal saccades (Schoonheim et al., 2010), and the remaining four for the vertical and torsional vestibulo‐ocular reflexes (Riley and Moorman, 2000; Mo et al., 2010; Bianco et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We took advantage of the external development, transparency, and genetic tractability of the larval zebrafish to probe nIII development using transgenic reporters of motoneuron location (Higashijima et al., 2000) and methods to mark birthdate in vivo (Caron et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here we found that larval zebrafish extraocular motoneuron pools in nIII are organized along a dorsoventral axis, and that a similar axis defines their birth order. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We first measured the distribution of extraocular motoneurons across nIII and nIV labeled in Tg(isl1:GFP) larvae, and used these data to construct a spatial framework for motoneuron localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Using targeted retro‐orbital dye fills, we localized extraocular motoneuron somata in nIII and nIV of larval zebrafish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We found that nIII is divided into dorsal and ventral halves; nIV aligns with the dorsal half of nIII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Dorsal nIII contains mostly inferior/medial rectus (IR/MR) motoneurons, while inferior oblique (IO) and superior rectus (SR) motoneurons occupy largely distinct regions of ventral nIII. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Next, we measured the time of terminal differentiation of motoneurons across nIII and nIV, and discovered a dorsoventral order to birthdate, complementary to the spatial organization of motoneuron pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We propose that birth order is the primary determinant of the spatial organization and fate of extraocular motoneurons in nIII. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>For IO motoneurons the maximum was only 13, a likely underestimate reflecting the challenge of calling a soma GFP– in the presence of dense GFP+ nIII neuropil and/or signal from surrounding GFP+ cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Our data agree with their observation of neurogenesis in nIII preceding nIV, consistent with the order of isl1 expression in chick (Varela‐Echavarría et al., 1996) but in contrast to their concurrent development in mammals (Altman and Bayer, 1981; Shaw and Alley, 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The oculomotor nerve begins projection at 30 hpf, before birth of SR motoneurons has begun. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The projecting nerve therefore contains only IR/MR, and possibly IO, axons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>nIII nucleogenesis is mostly complete by 48 hpf, when the axon front pauses at the edge of the orbit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Because most SR motoneurons are not postmitotic until after 43 hpf, their axons are likely delayed in reaching this location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Indeed, axon extension toward the IR, IO, and MR muscles resumes at 54 hpf, but Clark et al. (2013) do not observe a branch innervating the SR muscle until 66 hpf. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Our data speak to two prior hypotheses about the developmental organization of extraocular motoneurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>One proposition was that a shared caudal‐to‐rostral sequence of extraocular motoneuron and extraocular muscle development allows progressive innervation of earliest‐born muscles by earliest‐born extraocular motoneurons (Evinger, 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis does not match the true order of events, since the IR and MR muscles, which are the latest to differentiate (Noden et al., 1999) and still a paired anlage when invaded by motoneuron axons (Clark et al., 2013), are innervated by the earliest motoneurons to differentiate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nIV motoneurons innervating the earlier‐differentiating SO muscle are born only after IR/MR motoneuron birth is complete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Nor do our results agree with a random innervation model of nIII development (Glover, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Such a model predicts no correlation between motoneuron birthdate and muscle target, in contrast to the dorsal‐to‐ventral progression we observe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Other factors thus are likely to define the organization of nIII/nIV, at least in larval zebrafish. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The dorsoventral organization of nIII in larval zebrafish is similar to that seen in avians and other teleosts (Evinger, 1988); embryonic avian nIIIs feature particularly well‐delineated dorsolateral IR, dorsomedial MR, and ventral IO (lateral) and SR (medial) regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The timing of nIII development we observe likewise agrees with previous studies: Hasan et al. (2010) found a dorsal‐to‐ventral gradient of neurogenesis in the chick oculomotor complex (which includes Edinger‐Westphal motoneurons). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Since avian and zebrafish nIII dorsoventral spatial organizations are comparable, the dorsoventral temporal gradient in chick implies birth of IR/MR before IO/SR motoneurons, as we report here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Shaw and Alley (1981) found an IR‐MR‐IO‐SR progression in the birth order of rabbit nIII subpopulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In rabbits and other mammals, the dorsoventral spatial organization is inverted relative to avians and teleosts, with IR and MR populations generally ventral to IO and SR populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The temporal order of motoneuron birth thus appears to be conserved, while migration pattern / eventual location within the nucleus may not be. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>We propose that our finding in the larval zebrafish of motoneuron pools organized according to birthdate is likely general, even when the final spatial layout is different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis could be tested in a species in which motoneuron identity and spatial order are partially uncoupled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In adult frog (Rana esculenta), SR motoneurons occupy most of ventromedial nIII, while the ipsilaterally innervating nIII subpopulations overlap in dorsolateral nIII (Matesz and Székely, 1977). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Spatiotemporal determination of identity is a fundamental theme of neurogenesis (Moore and Livesey, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>One possible mechanism for temporally ordered development is to ensure that motoneuron precursors sit in particular spatial locations within nIII, where external cues then specify identities of each subpopulation (Shaw and Alley, 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Experiments in which oculomotor complexes were ectopically induced laterally and rostrally in the chick midbrain, with normal dorsoventral positioning of visceral vis‐a‐vis somatic MNs, suggest that major spatial cues working on the developing nIII lie along the dorsoventral axis (Hasan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Other extrinsic contributions might resemble the negative feedback cues onto retinal cell progenitors that inhibit prolonged production of early‐born retinal ganglion and amacrine neurons (Waid and McLoon, 1998; Belliveau and Cepko, 1999; Poggi et al., 2005), as retinoic acid produced by early‐born spinal cord motoneurons acts on progenitors as a cue for late‐born motoneuron generation (Sockanathan and Jessell, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>However, cell‐autonomous intrinsic factors such as the “temporal series” of transcription factors inherited by the offspring of Drosophila neuroblasts (Isshiki et al., 2001; Jacob et al., 2008) may also play a role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of GFP+ neurons from Tg(isl1:GFP) donor embryos into particular spatial locations in the dorsal or ventral midbrain would allow us to differentiate intrinsic and extrinsic factors, as well as to discover the precise timing of extraocular motoneuron commitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments performed in cortex (McConnell and Kaznowski, 1991; Frantz and McConnell, 1996) and spinal cord (Appel et al., 1995) have defined time windows within which progenitors' competence to respond to external cues shifts or narrows, representing a convergence of intrinsic and extrinsic cues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>As the final target for all oculomotor circuits, multiple upstream inputs must find partners within particular extraocular motoneuron pools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Our data support a model in which, by the time motoneurons occupy their final positions within nIII, they possess sufficient information to choose a target extraocular muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Our study thus supports molecular profiling of developing motoneurons at this time, specifically a comparison of dorsal and ventral GFP+ neurons from Tg(isl1:GFP) at later stages of nucleogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that each subpopulation will express a unique complement of terminal effectors (Hobert, 2016) that allow it to respond appropriately to cues arising from potential muscle targets responsible for motoneuron matching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Similarly, our model suggests that motoneurons may be competent to signal upstream partners, even before synaptogenesis onto target extraocular muscles (72 hpf). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Since the motoneurons occupy fairly stereotyped regions, neurons projecting to the extraocular motor nuclei might themselves rely on spatial cues to aid targeting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>This strategy is employed by sensory afferents projecting to the expected locations of motor pools in the spinal cord (Sürmeli et al., 2011), as well as in the Drosophila nerve cord at spatial scales on the order of 10 μm (Zlatic et al., 2009), suggesting the potential for sufficiently fine spatial patterning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Vestibular projection neurons mediating the “nose‐down/eyes‐up” response of the vestibulo‐ocular reflex (joint activation of IO and SR motoneurons/muscles) might thereby be able to target ventral nIII with little chance of incorrect innervation (Bianco et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Spatial segregation is likely to complement rather than replace more traditional molecular recognition cues, due to imperfect segregation of motoneuron pools within nIII. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Together, transplantation and molecular profiling experiments can uncover candidate mechanisms and factors downstream of isl1 expression that define extraocular motoneuron subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Understanding the contributions of temporal and spatial factors in nIII motoneuron identification should clarify how they find, and are found by, partners during circuit construction. </plain></SENT>
