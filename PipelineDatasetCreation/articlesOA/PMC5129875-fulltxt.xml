This is particularly relevant as proliferating neural precursors rather than postmitotic mature neurons need to be transplanted. Thus, safety mechanisms to eliminate proliferating cells are needed.

In conclusion, the cell cycle promoter-driven suicide gene approach described in this study allows killing of proliferating undifferentiated precursor cells without expression of the suicide gene in mature neurons.

Besides these challenges, the safety of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cells for transplantation is a concern. Human pluripotent stem cells, including embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), have the ability of self-renewal and therefore represent an unlimited source of cells for cell therapy. However, this advantage comes with a potential threat: there is a risk of tumor formation if transplanted cells continue to proliferate for a prolonged time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> PSC tumorigenicity can be divided into two different types: (i) teratoma formation from residual undifferentiated PSC, <italic>i.e.</italic>, tumors containing cells of all three germ layers, and (ii) uncontrolled growth of PSC-derived partially differentiated cells. This potential tumor risk is particularly relevant with respect to transplantation of neurons. Indeed, mature neurons are large complex structures that poorly survive transplantation. Thus, for neural cell therapy, precursors rather than mature neurons need to be transplanted and as discussed above, precursor cells have the potential to proliferate and form tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup></p><p>To overcome tumor risk, suicide gene approaches have been evaluated. The most widely used suicide gene is Herpes simplex I thymidine kinase (TK), which renders cells sensitive to killing through ganciclovir. Indeed, TK phosphorylates ganciclovir, and phosphorylated ganciclovir is a nucleotide analog which upon integration into newly synthesized DNA leads to DNA breaks and ultimately to apoptosis. TK has mostly been used in the context of cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and graft versus host disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7 bib8 bib9">7&#x02013;9</xref></sup> There are suggestions that TK suicide gene system could also be useful for eliminating proliferating cells in the context of cell therapy. An <italic>in vitro</italic> study using PSC expressing TK under the control of the Oct4 promoter demonstrated upon ganciclovir treatment survival of PSC-derived neurons, but killing of undifferentiated PSC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Three studies have investigated the potential of TK as a suicide gene for cell therapy. Transplantation of hepatocytes expressing TK under the control of a tissue specific constitutive promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> have shown that ganciclovir efficiently eradicates transplanted cells. Two cell therapy studies have used PSC that express TK under the control of pluripotency promoters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Based on these studies, it appears that activity of pluripotency promoters decreases rapidly, and only immediate treatment (3 hours) with ganciclovir prevented tumor formation. In contrast, when mice were treated at later time points, tumor formation was not prevented.</p><p>Here, we propose a technology that allows selective expression of TK not only in pluripotent, but in all proliferating cells. For this purpose, we have generated a PSC line expressing TK under the control of the previously characterized cell cycle-dependent promoter Ki67.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> We show that ganciclovir kills proliferating PSC <italic>TK</italic> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic>. In contrast, postmitotic neurons do not express TK and are resistant to killing by ganciclovir. We propose that the safety switch technology described in this manuscript might be a useful security feature in clinical studies using PSC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of TK-PSC line</title><p>It was the ultimate aim of this study to develop a suicide gene approach toward the prevention of uncontrolled overgrowth of PSC-derived transplanted neural cells. For many reasons, ganciclovir and herpes simplex thymidine kinase is an attractive system for such a suicide gene technology. Indeed ganciclovir is widely used in patients and penetrates into the central nervous system. However, constitutive expression of HSV-TK would not be desirable, as this could lead to immune rejection of transplanted cells, and the use of ganciclovir could potentially lead to killing of functional transplanted neurons. We therefore decided to express HSV-TK under the control of a cell cycle-dependent Ki67 promoter fragment. For this purpose, the human pluripotent ESC (hPSC) line HS415 was transduced with a lentivector coding for the expression of HSV-TK under the control of the Ki67 promoter fragment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> As the lentivector transduction efficiency of hPSC is in the range of 10&#x02013;20%, a tool for selection of transduced cells was required. We thus used a construct that with the HSV-TK sequence fused to a zeocin resistance sequence (see Materials and Methods). HSV-TK-positive cells were selected by culturing transduced hESC in the presence of zeocin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We thereby obtained a polyclonal HSV-TK-expressing PSC line, that will be referred to throughout the text as TK-PSC. Neural precursor cells and mature neurons were obtained from TK-PSC as described in Materials and Methods and will be referred to as TK-NPC and TK-neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Highly proliferative cells expressing Ki67/TK are sensitive to ganciclovir <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We next investigated TK expression in TK-PSC and in TK neurons. In TK-PSC, virtually 100% of cells expressed TK in concordance with high expression of Ki67 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, upper panel). In contrast, TK neurons did not express any TK, as predicted from them being postmitotic cells. It should however be mentioned that there were still Ki67-positive cells in the neuronal preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, lower panel). We do not think that these Ki67-positive cells reflect the presence of proliferating cells: many of the Ki67-positive cells in the neuronal preparation clearly showed a morphology of mature neurons with long neurite extension. We also investigated expression of Ki67, together with expression of the pluripotency markers nanog and Oct3/4 by flow cytometry. In PSC, virtually all cells were Ki67-positive, Nanog-positive, and Oct3/4-positive. NPC rapidly lost pluripotency markers (already after 1 week of neurosphere differentiation), while Ki67 expression decreased more slowly with levels slightly above background after 3 weeks of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the impact of ganciclovir on TK cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">d</xref>). TK PSC were highly sensitive to ganciclovir exposure (96 hours) and already at ganciclovir concentrations of 2.5 &#x000b5;mol/l, loss of cells was observed, which was almost complete at 10 &#x000b5;mol/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">c</xref>). In contrast, regular PSC (not transduced with the TK construct) were resistant to ganciclovir even at concentrations of 40 &#x000b5;mol/l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, F). As expected from the lack of TK expression in TK neurons (see above), TK neurons were not affected by ganciclovir concentrations up to 40 &#x000b5;mol/l, similar as seen for control neurons.</p><p>We also investigated time course of the ganciclovir effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). TK PSC were killed by Ganciclovir (40 &#x000b5;mol/l) within 4 days. TK-NPC after 1 week of neurosphere differentiation were still sensitive to Ganciclovir (40 &#x000b5;mol/l), however the time course of killing was markedly slowed down and complete killing was observed only after 8 days. TK-NPC after 2 weeks of neurosphere differentiation showed only little cell growth and were not killed by ganciclovir.</p></sec><sec><title>Early, but not late ganciclovir treatment prevents tumor formation upon transplantation of highly proliferative pluripotent stem cells</title><p>Given the encouraging results <italic>in vitro</italic>, we proceeded to investigate whether ganciclovir could prevent tumor formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For this purpose, TK-PSC were transplanted into the striatum of NOD/SCID mice. In the absence of ganciclovir, mice, sacrificed 49 days post-transplantation, consistently developed tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), which consisted of human cells (HCM-positive) and showed abundant expression of Ki67 and Ki67 promoter-driven HSV-TK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>,A). There was a moderate amount of mouse microglia invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,b). In contrast in mice that were treated for 15 days with ganciclovir (starting 4 days post-transplantation), no tumor was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). There are hardly any human cells left in the ganciclovir-treated animals, and the few surviving human cells were negative for HSV-TK and&#x02014;to a large extent&#x02014;also negative for Ki67, suggesting that the few surviving human cells had become postmitotic and therefore lost sensitivity to ganciclovir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>,A). Thus, ganciclovir prevented tumor formation by transplanted TK-PSC. We next wanted to investigate whether ganciclovir could also be used to treat already established tumors. We therefore let tumor formation progress for 30 days (preliminary results had shown that within this time delay there was consistent tumor formation upon transplantation of PSC) and treated with ganciclovir (or PBS) for day 30&#x02013;45 post-transplantation. Mice were sacrificed 30 days after the end of the ganciclovir treatment. Under these conditions, there was tumor formation in both, the PBS and the ganciclovir-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). CD31 staining showed that tumors were vascularized, suggesting that lack of perfusion did not account for the absence of a ganciclovir therapeutic effect in established tumors. Similarly, many tumor cells showed high level expression of HSV-TK suggesting that downregulation of the transgene was not the explanation for the lack of a therapeutic response.</p><p>A previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> had suggested that alternative splicing, due to cryptic splice donor and acceptor sites, can lead to formation of an inactive TK. Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> had suggested that various nonsense mutations may occur in the TK sequence in rapidly growing cells and might explain ganciclovir resistance. We therefore extracted mRNA from the tumors formed upon injection of undifferentiated pluripotent cells. From these mRNA preparations, we amplified five regions of the TK protein covering a total of 1,162 nucleotides, corresponding to 85% of the total TK sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The sequenced regions also included the proposed cryptic splice sites (amplicon 3). We first directly sequenced the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). The results of this sequencing allowed the following conclusions:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The all over sequence found in the tumors was identical to the plasmid HSV-TK sequence, suggesting that&#x02014;if mutations had occurred&#x02014;they were not representing the majority of HSV-TK sequences within the tumor. We also directly inspected the sequencing results and did not observe evidence for ambivalent sequencing signals.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The cryptic splice sites described previously were not present in our version of the sequence (neither in the plasmid sequence nor in the tumor-derived sequences)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Accordingly no splice variant was detected in our sequencing results.</p></list-item></list></p><p>To investigate whether minority sequences with mutations had occurred within the tumor, we also subcloned two of the PCR amplicons and sequenced individual subclones. No mutation was observed in subclones of amplicon 5; in contrast, in two of the sublclones of amplicon 3, there was a single point mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) not located at critical sites of the TK enzyme (ATP and nucleotide-binding sites)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9QNF7">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9QNF7</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Transplantation of TK-NPC produced mature neurons which were not sensitive to ganciclovir treatment</title><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> results, shown so far, were obtained with transplantation of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells. However, the final goal of neuronal cell therapy is the transplantation of neural precursor cells, which should differentiated into mature neurons and resist to ganciclovir treatment. We therefore transplanted 2&#x02013;3 weeks-NPC containing neurospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Under these conditions, no tumor formation was observed, even in the absence of ganciclovir treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). In line with these observations, the transplanted cells (assessed by immunofluorescence 7 weeks after transplantation) were abundantly positive for beta 3 tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, upper panel), while a smaller fraction of cells was TH-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, lower panel). None of these markers were affected by ganciclovir treatment.</p><p>We next investigated markers of cellular proliferation by staining of the transplants with antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Surprisingly, many of the transplanted cells were PCNA positive, while Ki67 staining of the transplants was low to absent. Ganciclovir treatment did not alter this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, left panels, control and right panels, ganciclovir treatment). To verify whether the PCNA-positive, Ki67-negative cells were proliferating cells, we performed BrdU experiments (see Materials and Methods). In region of the transplant, no BrdU (5 bromo-2&#x02019;-deoxyuridine)-labeled cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, left panel). As an internal positive control, we used the periventricular region, which was clearly BrdU-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>, right panel). This demonstrates that the absence of Ki67 correctly indicates postmitotic cells, while PCNA expression may persist even after proliferation arrest.</p><p>To compare tumor formation and response to ganciclovir under our different experimental conditions, we quantified graft surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>). When PSC were transplanted, large tumors (graft surface ~10&#x02013;15&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup>) develop, which was completely prevented by early ganciclovir treatment, while late ganciclovir treatment did not have any effect on tumor size. Finally, upon transplantation of NPC (derived from 2&#x02013;3 weeks old neurospheres), small nontumoral transplants (graft surface ~2&#x02013;3&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup>) were observed. The size of these transplants was not affected by ganciclovir.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have developed a novel tool that allows <italic>in vivo</italic> to remove proliferating, potentially tumorigenic cells from neural transplants. The system is based on the expression of HSV-TK under the control of the cell cycle-dependent Ki67 promoter. It will be particularly useful for the transplantation of pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Indeed, HSV-TK expressing cells can be eliminated by treatment of patients with the clinically used, CNS (Central Nervous System)-permeant drug ganciclovir. As the Ki67 promoter will be inactive in mature neurons, treatment with ganciclovir will only eliminate proliferating precursors, but preserve the integrity of differentiated postmitotic neurons. Our system provides a switch-off in suicide gene activity when cells progress from precursors to mature postmitotic neurons and we will refer to it as &#x0201c;safety switch technology&#x0201d;.</p><p>We chose HSV-TK as a suicide gene because the clinically used compound ganciclovir has a well-documented penetration into the central nervous system and efficiently eliminates HSV-TK expressing cells. Ganciclovir is clinically used as a treatment for viruses of the herpes family, in particular cytomegalovirus CMV. Interestingly, the drug used for the treatment of Herpes simplex virus, acyclovir was&#x02014;at relevant concentrations&#x02014;not efficient to induce suicide gene activity. The reason for this difference between the two nucleotide analogues seems to be a more efficient phosphorylation of ganciclovir as compared to acyclovir.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> The following alternatives for HSV-TK as an <italic>in-vivo</italic> suicide gene exist:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(i) Inducible caspase-9, which can be activated by the small molecule AP1903, would be an interesting alternative to HSV-TK as a suicide gene. We have not used this system because the penetration of AP1903 into the central nervous system has not been documented and there is only limited clinical experience with the compound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>(ii) Cytosine deaminase can be used as a suicide gene in combination with 5-fluorocytine as prodrug. To our knowledge 5-fluorocytine has not been used in patients and hence has a limited translational potential. Also, cytosine deaminase has a poor binding affinity towards 5-FC compared to the natural substrate cytosine, unless a mutated form of the enzyme is used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>(iii) Selective elimination of PSC by an oleate synthesis inhibitor discovered in a high-throughput screen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>; however these compounds have so far been given only pretransplantation and most likely act only on cells in the pluripotency stage and not on proliferating neuroprecursors.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iv) A recent study has suggested that irradiation of transplanted cells could be an alternative to a suicide gene technology to achieve elimination of proliferating cells. Given the potential toxicity of CNS irradiation, we do not think that this approach is the most promising for future application in patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup></p></list-item></list></p><p>Our construct was designed to avoid expression of HSV-TK in postmitotic neurons, while rendering proliferative cells (<italic>i.e.</italic>, PSC and proliferating neuroprecursors) sensitive to ganciclovir. Given the mechanisms of action of ganciclovir, namely strain-breaks in nascent DNA molecules, one might wonder whether it is important to avoid expression of HSV-TK in mature, nondividing neurons. The answer is yes, for two reasons:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>In postmitotic neurons, renewal of mitochondria requires mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Thus, ganciclovir (in the presence of TK), will damage nascent mitochondrial DNA and thereby lead to cell death through apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Ubiquitous expression of the viral HSV-TK protein has the potential to lead to immune rejection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> of transplanted neurons.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In initial experiments, we attempted to transplant postmitotic neurons, however, cell survival was poor. In contrast, when NPC, derived from 2&#x02013;3-week-old neurospheres, were transplanted, cell survival was observed. We were worried because fractions of these NPC still express Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Interestingly, despite this Ki67 expression in the injected cell material, no tumor was observed, and there was no difference in implant size between ganciclovir- and control-treated animals. Thus, upon transplantation, these NPC rapidly differentiate into postmitotic neurons. However, translation to human therapy requires a much higher number of cells, and thus implicitly will lead to a higher tumor risk. For example, for Parkinson&#x02019;s therapy, the following number of neurons will need to be transplanted for different species: mice 10<sup>5</sup>; rats 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>; rhesus monkeys 6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> and by extrapolation 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> in humans. Thus, approximately 300 times more cells need to be transplanted into humans, as compared to mice, which will lead to a proportional (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 300-fold) increase in poorly differentiated, tumorigenic cells. Note that a priori there is no difference between embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells with respect to tumor risk.</p><p>As expected, transplantation of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells led to tumor formation. This tumor formation was entirely abolished by early (<italic>e.g.</italic>, 5 days post-transplantation) ganciclovir treatment of transplanted animals. However, when ganciclovir treatment was initiated at a later time point (30 days post-transplantation), the treatment had strictly no effect on tumor size. This is in line with several previous observations that established TK-expressing tumors do not respond to ganciclovir treatment. Several reasons might account for these observations:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(i) In some studies, TK was expressed under the control of pluripotency-associated promoters (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Oct4), which are downregulated much faster than cell proliferation antigens. Thus, these tumors might consist of proliferating cells that have had lost the Oct4 promoter activity and therefore did not respond to ganciclovir.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>(ii) One study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> suggested that a cryptic splice site in the HSV-TK sequence leads to the formation of a nonfunctional TK, which could account for ganciclovir resistance. This was not the case in our experiments, as we used a HSV-TK sequence devoid of these splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iii) Another study suggested that upon ganciclovir treatment of HSV-TK-expressing tumors, there is a selection of HSV-TK point mutations and this mechanism could account for ganciclovir resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> We have experimentally verified this possibility and indeed observed several HSV-TK clones with point mutations. Interestingly, these point mutations were located in a strategically relevant area of the TK enzyme (<italic>e.g.</italic>, between the catalytic site and the nucleotide binding site). In contrast, none of the clones of the region coding for the HSV-TK C-terminus showed point mutations. Thus, it is possible that&#x02014;in the presence of a large tumor mass&#x02014;ganciclovir selects certain point mutations. However, we do not think that this is the main mechanism of resistance. Indeed, the direct sequencing of PCR products without subcloning showed 100% identity with the plasmid sequence without any ambiguous nucleotides in the sequence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iv) We therefore think that the most likely explanation for the resistance of established tumors to ganciclovir treatment is tumor size. In order to be effective against solid tumors, drugs must penetrate to the inside of the tumor and reach concentrations sufficient to exert a therapeutic effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> In our studies, we observed a certain extent of tumor vascularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>,E).

However in order to allow dedicated neural precursors to differentiate into postmitotic neurons, a time window between transplantation and initiation of ganciclovir treatment needs to be respected. We chose a time window of 5 days based on <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments showing the arrest of proliferation of differentiating NPCs within this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Experimental <italic>in vivo</italic> verification confirmed the choice of this time window, as it allowed establishment of mature, ganciclovir resistant neurons when dedicated neural precursors were transplanted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), while it allowed a complete elimination of tumor-forming PSC.</p><p>We describe here a &#x0201c;safety switch technology&#x0201d;, which allows elimination of proliferating cells shortly after transplantation of PSC-derived neuronal precursors. The essential elements behind this system are the control of HSV-TK expression by the Ki67 promoter, which allows selectively, through treatment with the HSV-TK substrate ganciclovir, killing of proliferating cells, while preserving the integrity of mature neurons. Treatment needs to be installed early (~5 days post-transplantation) because of treatment resistance of established tumors. We think that the safety switch technology should be systematically applied in human neural cell transplantation to avoid risk of tumor formation. It is likely that our technology might also be useful for the transplantation of other cells where final transplant will be postmitotic cells (<italic>e.g.</italic>, cardiomyocytes, islet cells, etc.).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Culture of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells</title><p>Human ES cell line HS415 (used from passage 17 to 30, kindly provided by Outi Hovatta, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden) was cultured onto extracellular matrix (Matrigel, dilution 1/100, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a feeder-free culture medium (Nutristem, Biological Industries, Cromwell, CT).
