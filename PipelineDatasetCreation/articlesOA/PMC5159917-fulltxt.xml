Here we adapted this technology to establish a novel modular antibody labeling approach which is based on isopeptide bond formation between two recognition peptides, SpyTag and KTag. Our labeling strategy allows the attachment of a reporting cargo of interest to an antibody scaffold by fusing it chemically to KTag, available via semi-automated solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), while equipping the antibody with SpyTag. This strategy was successfully used to engineer site-specific antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that exhibit cytotoxicities in the subnanomolar range. Our approach may lead to a new class of antibody conjugates based on peptide-tags that have minimal effects on protein structure and function, thus expanding the toolbox of site-specific antibody conjugation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The conjugation of small molecule drugs to antibodies represents a promising strategy for the development of cancer therapeutics. By harnessing the capacity of antibodies to home in on specific targets and combining that with the cytotoxic capability of small molecule drugs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) can be generated to deliver lethal payloads to cancer cells with precision, while minimizing the off-target effects of cytotoxic drugs to increase the therapeutic index<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.</p><p>First generation ADCs employing statistic conjugation of cytotoxic payloads via reduced cysteines or lysines led to heterogenous populations with limited therapeutic index suffering from a low efficacy and inconsistent <italic>in vivo</italic> performance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

Spontaneously forming intramolecular isopeptide bonds&#x02014;peptide bonds that form outside of the protein main chain&#x02014;were first discovered a decade ago and were found to provide remarkable stability to outer-membrane proteins of Gram-positive bacteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Using these protein scaffolds, Zakeri <italic>et al</italic>. engineered a series of genetically programmable peptide-protein partners that are able to spontaneously reconstitute via covalent and irreversible isopeptide bond formation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. One of these peptide-protein partners was obtained by engineering and splitting the <italic>C</italic>-terminal beta-strand of the CnaB2 domain from the fibronectin adhesion protein FbaB of <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> that is able to reconstitute with the protein by forming an intramolecular isopeptide bond between an aspartate and a lysine residue catalyzed by an opposed glutamate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Further engineering of the CnaB2 domain and splitting it into three parts generated the synthetic enzyme SpyLigase that is able to direct the formation of an isopeptide bond between the two peptides SpyTag and KTag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Since the tags can be genetically fused to various proteins, these protein superglues have emerged as useful tools to covalently and specifically assemble linear and branched protein structures, thereby enabling the generation of new protein architectures via modular assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Expression of peptide-tagged IgG1 antibody Fc domains, SpyLigase and synthesis of labeled peptides</title><p>To test whether the SpyLigase-catalyzed peptide ligation approach could also be applied for the covalent attachment of small reporting molecules such as fluorescent dyes, biotin or cytotoxins to antibody scaffolds, we fused SpyTag (13aa) and KTag (10aa) genetically to the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of an Fc domain from an IgG1 antibody via a short GS-linker. In order to facilitate analysis of conjugates, an N297A mutation was introduced into the IgG1-Fc gene by site-directed mutagenesis to remove the natural glycosylation site. The peptide-tagged antibody fragments were transiently expressed in HEK293F cells and subsequently purified by protein A affinity chromatography. SpyTag and KTag-peptides with adjacent <italic>N</italic>-terminal GSG-spacer were synthesized on solid support by semi-automated SPPS using a Rink amide (RAM) resin yielding peptide carboxamides after cleavage. KTag was further extended with a GY-dipeptide at the carboxy terminus as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. 5/6-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA), a fluorophore commonly used for the preparation of protein conjugates, and biotin were coupled to the resin-bound peptide amino terminus via standard amide coupling chemistry using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). After cleavage from the resin, labeled peptides were purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and analyzed by ESI-MS. SpyLigase and its inactive mutant SpyLigase EQ were obtained in yields of 20&#x02009;mg per liter by expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purification by affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The purity of the proteins was &#x0003e;95% as determined by denaturing SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper panel, and S1, lane 2&#x02013;4).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Conjugation of labeled peptides to antibody Fc domains by SpyLigase-mediated isopeptide bond formation</title><p>We next performed conjugation reactions of labeled-peptides to the peptide-tagged Fc domains at pH 7.0 in the presence of the protein stabilizer trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) for 18&#x02013;24&#x02009;h at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Each reaction contained peptide-tagged IgG1-Fc, labeled peptide counterpart (20 eq.), and SpyLigase (1&#x02013;10 eq.). All possible combinations of SpyTag and KTag with the respective TAMRA or biotin labeled counterpart were assayed. Covalent ligation reactions were analyzed by boiling the samples for 5&#x02009;min in SDS-loading buffer and subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis. Reaction products were visualized by Coomassie staining, fluorescence readout or western blotting (not shown). For all combinations the formation of a new product, stable to boiling in SDS, with a slightly slower migration behavior consistent with isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and KTag was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper panel, and S1, lane 5&#x02013;7). This product was not observed when SpyLigase was replaced by its inactive Glu77 to Gln mutant (SpyLigase EQ). This mutant was not able to catalyze the spontaneous isopeptide bond formation due to the lack of the required glutamate residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper panel, and S1, lane 8). These results suggested that SpyLigase covalently links KTag and SpyTag in a site-specific manner. The conjugation efficiencies for Fc-SpyTag with TAMRA-KTag were estimated to be 40&#x02013;60%. Here, reactions with three equivalents of SpyLigase seemed to be most efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>, upper panel, lane 6). Conjugation of the Fc-KTag with TAMRA-SpyTag was observed to be less efficient, which may be caused by a shorter GS-linker that was used to fuse KTag to the Fc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S1</xref> lane 5&#x02013;7).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SpyLigase-mediated conjugation of labeled peptides to Spy-tagged antibodies</title><p>Having proven our site-specific labeling approach on antibody domains, we extended the application for the preparation of defined antibody conjugates of the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab (Erbitux<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The cetuximab fusion proteins with SpyTag at the <italic>C</italic>-terminus of the heavy chains, the light chains, and at both chains were obtained by expression in HEK293F cells and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. The yields were comparable to those obtained for the unmodified antibody (40&#x02013;60&#x02009;mg per liter cell culture). SEC analysis revealed no significant aggregation behavior of the peptide-tagged antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S2</xref>). Antibodies were then conjugated to TAMRA-KTag using SpyLigase under previously determined reaction conditions. Reaction products were analyzed by in-gel fluorescence and Coomassie staining following SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent bands corresponding to the conjugated antibody&#x02019;s heavy and light chains and a mobility shift of the conjugated light chain confirmed that SpyLigase-promoted site-specific labeling can also be applied on full-length IgG1-antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S3</xref>, lane 2&#x02013;4). These results indicated a chemically highly specific conjugation reaction due to the required assembling of SpyTag/KTag and SpyLigase to form an active complex mediating isopeptide bond formation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Synthesis of cytotoxin-peptide payloads and conjugation to Spy-tagged antibodies</title><p>Next, we wanted to investigate whether SpyLigase-catalyzed conjugation could also be applied for the coupling of drug molecules to antibodies to generate site-specific ADCs. For this purpose, we designed and synthesized a set of Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)-peptide payloads differing in the nature of the used linker and the chemistry used for peptide-coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>, compound <bold>5</bold>&#x02013;<bold>7</bold>). MMAE was designed with either a non-cleavable (nc) maleimide-thiol linker (compound <bold>5</bold>), without linker (compound <bold>6</bold>), or with a cleavable valine-citrulline-<italic>p</italic>-aminobenzylcarbamate (vc-PABC) linker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> (compound <bold>7</bold>). In general, all payloads contained polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer-units to increase the overall toxin solubility and to increase the toxin-peptide distance. To persue two different chemical strategies, toxins were either provided with an azide functionality for copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) or with an carboxyl group for amide coupling. For peptide-toxin coupling in solution by CuAAC, resin-bound KTag was first coupled to propargylacetic acid to obtain an <italic>N</italic>-terminal alkyne moiety before it was cleaved from the resin and purified. The carboxy functionalized MMAE was coupled directly to the <italic>N</italic>-terminus of the resin-bound peptide, requiring an acidic cleavage step of the entire MMAE-payload. As a proof of principle, cetuximab fused to SpyTag at the heavy chains was used for conjugation. These reactions were carried out in phosphate-citrate buffer pH 7.0 in the presence of TMAO for 18&#x02013;24&#x02009;h at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Each reaction contained Spy-tagged antibody, 15 eq. of the toxic payload, and 3 eq. of SpyLigase. Reactions were analyzed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and drug-to-antibody ratios (DAR) were determined. Using payload <bold>5</bold>, the highest observable DAR was only 0.57 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S4</xref>). With the payloads from peptide-coupling via click-chemistry, formation of about 80% of the desired species with two drug molecules was obtained, resulting in a DAR of 1.76 for payload <bold>5</bold> and a DAR of 1.66 for <bold>7</bold>. Control reactions with either SpyLigase EQ, without SpyLigase, and without payload did not result in the formation of a new product. This was analyzed by HIC, confirming also the specificity of the reaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S5</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>MS analysis of Spy-tagged ADCs</title><p>Next, we confirmed the identity of the peptide-tagged ADCs and the specificity of the conjugation reaction by mass spectrometry. Intact mass analysis of ADCs by MALDI-MS indicated the attachment of two payload molecules per antibody by a mass shift of 5252&#x02009;Da (calc. 5349&#x02009;Da) for payload <bold>6</bold> and 6202&#x02009;Da (calc. 6159&#x02009;Da) for payload <bold>7</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S7</xref>) compared to unmodified Spy-tagged cetuximab. This observation was verified by mass analysis of reduced ADCs showing a mass shift of 2735&#x02009;Da (calc. 2675&#x02009;Da) and 3116&#x02009;Da (calc. 3080&#x02009;Da) for payload <bold>6</bold> and <bold>7</bold>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S8</xref>). In order to confirm the identity of the ADCs, a more accurate mass determination was obtained by LC-ESI-MS showing a mass shift of 2677&#x02009;Da for compound <bold>6</bold> (calc. 2675&#x02009;Da) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S9</xref>). Tryptic digestion of the ADCs resulted in a peptide fragment composed of amino acids derived from both SpyTag and KTag which are connected to each other via an isopeptide bond between Asp and Lys residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S13</xref>). This fragment was successfully identified in both ADC samples but not in the unconjugated antibody control. Further identification of the peptide was conducted by sequencing using Tandem-MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figures S14&#x02013;S16</xref>). Unmodified SpyTag fragment, however, was only observed in minor amounts confirming the efficiency of our approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S17</xref>). No unspecific conjugation of the antibody light chain was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Figure S18</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity of Spy-tagged ADCs</title><p>To determine the cell killing activities of the Spy-tagged cetuximab-based ADCs <italic>in vitro</italic>, ligation reactions were scaled up and ADCs were purified by protein A chromatography in order to remove excess payload and SpyLigase. <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxicity was determined using two different breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7, the former one expressing high levels of EGFR (epidermal grow factor receptor, EGFR+), the latter one without EGFR expression (EGFR-)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. ADCs with payloads that were synthesized by CuAAC with either non-cleavable linker (compound <bold>6</bold>) or with cleavable linker (compound <bold>7</bold>) were compared to each other to investigate an effect of the different linkers on efficacy and potency. The ADCs were tested in a serial dilution with the highest concentration of 50&#x02009;nM for three days. As expected, cetuximab-based ADCs effect on MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, upper panels). For the ADC with a non-cleavable linker the half-maximal cytotoxic effect was in the subnanomolar range (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, &#x025a0;). In contrast the ADC with a cleavable linker showed an even higher <italic>in vitro</italic> potency (IC<sub>50</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, &#x025a1;) which was probably due to the cathepsin B-mediated cleavage of the linker in the lysosome releasing the free toxin upon cellular uptake. No effect on cell viability was observed with the same ADCs on the EGFR-negative cell line MCF-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>, lower panels). To confirm the receptor-mediated internalization and cell killing of the anti-EGFR ADCs, anti HER2 (human epidermal grow factor receptor 2) Spy-tagged trastuzumab ADCs were prepared with the same payloads under identical reaction conditions and tested as isotype controls. The free payload was also used as control. MDA-MB-468 cells do not express HER2 whereas MCF-7 cells exhibit a low expression of HER2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The cell viability of both cell lines was not affected by the isotype control ADCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, &#x025cb; and &#x025cf;), demonstrating that the anti-EGFR ADCs generated by using the catalytic activity of SpyLigase selectively kill EGFR-overexpressing cells in a receptor-dependent manner. A cell killing effect of free payload <bold>7</bold> was observed at the highest concentration of 50&#x02009;nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, &#x025b2;).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have developed a modular bioconjugation approach based on isopeptide bond formation between two peptide tags catalyzed by SpyLigase.
