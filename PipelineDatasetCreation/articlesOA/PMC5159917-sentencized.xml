<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By harnessing the capacity of antibodies to home in on specific targets and combining that with the cytotoxic capability of small molecule drugs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) can be generated to deliver lethal payloads to cancer cells with precision, while minimizing the off-target effects of cytotoxic drugs to increase the therapeutic index1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>First generation ADCs employing statistic conjugation of cytotoxic payloads via reduced cysteines or lysines led to heterogenous populations with limited therapeutic index suffering from a low efficacy and inconsistent in vivo performance23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Initial attempts to generate homogenous ADCs with a defined stoichiometry relied on the mutation of selected interchain cysteines to serines and conjugation of the cytotoxic payload to the remaining accessible cysteines originating from reduction4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since then, several elegant methods have been developed to conjugate drugs to antibodies in a site-specific manner56. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Chemical methods include the site-specific chemical conjugation through engineered cysteines7 or selenocysteines89, cysteine containing tag with perfluoroaromatic reagents10 and conjugation to reduced intermolecular disulfides by re-bridging dibromomalemides11, bis-sulfone reagents12, and dibromopyridazinediones13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, several enzymatic and chemoenzymatic conjugation approaches have been reported including the use of engineered galactosyl- and sialyltransferases14, formyl glycine generating enzyme (FGE)15, phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases)16, sortase A17, and microbial transglutaminase181920, an enzyme forming an isopeptide bond between a glutamine side-chain and an amine-donor substrate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spontaneously forming intramolecular isopeptide bonds—peptide bonds that form outside of the protein main chain—were first discovered a decade ago and were found to provide remarkable stability to outer-membrane proteins of Gram-positive bacteria21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Using these protein scaffolds, Zakeri et al. engineered a series of genetically programmable peptide-protein partners that are able to spontaneously reconstitute via covalent and irreversible isopeptide bond formation2223. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One of these peptide-protein partners was obtained by engineering and splitting the C-terminal beta-strand of the CnaB2 domain from the fibronectin adhesion protein FbaB of Streptococcus pyogenes that is able to reconstitute with the protein by forming an intramolecular isopeptide bond between an aspartate and a lysine residue catalyzed by an opposed glutamate22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Further engineering of the CnaB2 domain and splitting it into three parts generated the synthetic enzyme SpyLigase that is able to direct the formation of an isopeptide bond between the two peptides SpyTag and KTag (Fig. 1A)24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Since the tags can be genetically fused to various proteins, these protein superglues have emerged as useful tools to covalently and specifically assemble linear and branched protein structures, thereby enabling the generation of new protein architectures via modular assembly25. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>As a proof of principle, cetuximab fused to SpyTag at the heavy chains was used for conjugation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>These reactions were carried out in phosphate-citrate buffer pH 7.0 in the presence of TMAO for 18–24 h at 4 °C. </plain></SENT>
