</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The goal of radiation biodosimetry is to accurately predict radiation dose, as a surrogate of radiological injury, in a large-scale radiation emergency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Most approaches focus on the first week after an event, when radiological triage is most needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A wide range of different methods have been used to identify cellular responses to radiation, ranging from cytogenetic measurements, specifically dicentric assays, to high throughput proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Several groups have reported gene expression-based analyses, with the development of predictive gene sets that correlate with dose [2–5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Radiation quality plays an important role in driving gene expression, and different signaling pathways may be triggered in response to the different types of irradiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition, various genes and biological functions are induced in cells at different time points after radiation exposure [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>To date, most of the gene expression signatures for the purpose of radiation biodosimetry have been obtained in response to photon (γ- and x-rays) exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, there have been a limited number of studies that have compared gene expression profiles in mice or human blood cells after exposures involving heavy ions and α-particles, the latter representing isotopes likely to be used in a radiological dispersal device [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For example, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Chauhan et al. [10] found that the gene expression profile induced by α-particle radiation was very similar to the x-ray responses, despite the fact that α-particles are characterized by a higher linear energy transfer coefficient compared with x-rays [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In contrast, comparison of α-particle and x-ray irradiation impact on human tumor and endothelial cells [12], as well as human epidermal keratinocytes [13] produced distinct gene expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>An improvised nuclear device (IND) detonation is capable of producing a mixture of γ-rays and fast neutrons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as neutrons generally have a higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) for most physiological endpoints, it is important to understand the impact that neutrons would have on the biodosimetry methods that are being developed for medical triage purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Radiation affects multiple biological processes, including immune system and inflammatory responses, cell cycle progression, cell death, DNA repair, as well as metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of neutron radiation on any of these processes has not been studied in detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This study presents an initial characterization of gene expression responses following exposure to IND-spectrum neutrons or x-rays. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the present study, gene expression signatures were analyzed after in vivo irradiation of mice with either neutrons or x-rays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The doses used were selected based on the limited RBE information available for IND-spectrum neutrons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Using the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay [14] in peripheral human blood lymphocytes, Xu et al. [15] calculated the RBE of our neutron spectrum to be between 3 and 5 for micronucleus induction with 250 kVp x-rays used as the reference radiation, with similar results for micronucleus induction in mice (Helen Turner, personal communication). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We therefore exposed mice to 0.25 Gy or 1 Gy of neutron radiation and, separately, 1 Gy or 4 Gy of x-ray radiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We describe biological processes significantly over-represented only in the neutron response, or only in the x-ray radiation response, as well as processes shared by both types of radiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal is to investigate whether we can separately estimate the photon and the neutron component after a mixed photon/neutron exposure, and to develop gene expression signatures capable of discriminating between neutron and photon exposures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>tRNA pools in cells can be divided into those that favor proliferation and those that support differentiation [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>As a result, modifications in tRNA and their corresponding enzymes are implicated in diseases, including diabetes and cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>For example, upregulation of certain tRNAs increases metastasis in breast cancer patients [32]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>A difference observed between neutron and x-ray response was the enrichment in biological processes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism that was seen only in response to x-ray exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>It has long been known that the cellular targets of ionizing radiation, such as x-rays, are not limited to nuclear DNA, but that proteins and lipids in other cellular compartments, such as the plasma membrane [34], are also affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The action of x-rays has been attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species that oxidize DNA, lipids and proteins [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We can speculate that in response to x-rays, cells upregulate lipid, coenzyme, and vitamin biosynthetic and metabolic processes as a means of repairing the damage caused by x-ray irradiation to the cell membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The latter two processes could also serve as anti-oxidant responses [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In addition, fatty acid oxidation processes, which are also overrepresented in the x-ray irradiation, would be required by the cells to meet the energy demands of various metabolic processes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>DNA damage that cannot be repaired efficiently leads to cell death or senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Although protein abundance and activity do not always follow gene expression changes, our Gene Ontology analysis suggests an apparent down regulation of several DNA repair pathways after neutron but not after x-ray irradiation, especially at day 7, perhaps reflecting a failure to repair the more complex damage resulting from high LET radiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>At day 1 after 1 Gy neutron exposure, GO analysis suggested suppression of MMR, whereas at day 7, in addition to MMR, NER, BER, and NHEJ genes were all significantly over-represented among downregulated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In contrast, exposure to 4 Gy of x-rays transiently downregulated expression of MMR genes at day 1 and BER genes at day 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Homologous recombination, which along with NHEJ constitutes the major DNA double-strand break repair mechanism, was not significantly over-represented among differentially expressed genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>It has been shown previously that high-LET radiation induces complex DNA damage that is not easily repaired and NHEJ is not involved [37–40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has been shown that high-LET irradiation with protons or carbon ions causes a shift away from NHEJ toward HRR in the repair of double-strand breaks [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these data, our observed downregulation of genes in the NHEJ and other DNA repair pathways in response to neutron exposure may reflect the fact that these lesions are not repaired by these processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Regulation at the gene expression level suggests a potential mechanism for favoring the homologous recombination pathway in the attempted repair of neutron damage, and is worthy of further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>A major biological function that is affected by radiation is the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle regulating genes are important determinants of radiosensitivity and cell fate in response to DNA damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of neutron radiation on mouse cell cycle-regulated genes and compared it with that of x-rays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Unlike genes in other biological processes, which were either up or downregulated after neutron or x-ray irradiation, many cell cycle genes showed a bidirectional expression based on time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>A group of 5 genes, namely Ube2c, Fzr1, Ccna2, Cdc25b, and Nusap1, were downregulated 1 day after irradiation, whereas the same genes were overexpressed 7 days post-irradiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>These temporal changes were further confirmed by qRT-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>A literature search revealed that these genes play important roles in the control of mitosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Additionally, their protein products are related to the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) either as subunits of APC/C (Ube2c, Fzr1) or as substrates (Ccna2, Nusap1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The APC/C is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is composed of at least 14 core subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>The APC/C is active during mitosis and G1 phase of the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Because of its role in cell cycle regulation, APC/C is important for maintaining genomic integrity [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, APC/C has been implicated in an array of diverse functions ranging from cell differentiation to apoptosis and senescence, as well as cellular metabolism, cell motility, and gene transcription through the degradation of specific substrates [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>APC/C targets a large repertoire of substrates and recruits them for ubiquitylation via one of two co-activators, Cdc20 and Cdh1 (Fzr1, the mouse homolog) [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The physiological role of Cdh1 has been extensively studied in the context of human cancer, since downregulation of Cdh1 has been reported in many cancers, including those of prostate, ovary, liver, brain, and during the malignant progression of a B-lymphoma cell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>In mice, Fzr1 heterozygosity results in the development of epithelial tumors, suggesting that Fzr1 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of Cdh1 in post-mitotic neurons has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role in mitosis, Cdh1 has important functions in mediating DNA damage response to genotoxic stress [45] that ensure genomic integrity [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Cdh1-null cells fail to maintain DNA damage-induced G2 arrest and APC/Ccdh1 is activated by x-irradiation-induced DNA damage (but not UV irradiation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the levels of mitotic cyclins in Cdh1-/- cells after DNA damage were similar to those of wild-type cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>These data imply that cyclin A and cyclin B cannot be substrates for APC/Ccdh1 when it is activated irregularly by DNA damage at G2 [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Protein ubiquitination-mediated degradation involves two distinct steps: the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins catalyzed by the sequential actions of the activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligating (E3) enzymes, followed by the degradation of the poly-ubiquitylated protein by the 26S proteasome complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>For APC/C the E2 enzymes are Ube2c, which is one of the temporally controlled cell cycle genes in this study, and Ube2s [48], which is not differentially regulated in response to either neutrons or x-rays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Abundant experimental evidence has shown a role for Ube2c in human tumor initiation and progression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Cyclin A2 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in several types of cancer [55]. Cyclin A2 mRNA as well as protein are cell cycle regulated [56] with mRNA and protein abundance increasing 4-fold and 20-fold, respectively, as cells progress from G1 to G2 phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>APC/C degrades Cyclin A2 at the end of mitosis, while mRNA persists longer than the protein in cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>To fully appreciate the significance of the temporal differential expression of APC-related genes in the radiation response, we will require knowledge about the status of protein levels and their posttranslational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>However, we can speculate that these changes may be relevant to cell cycle progression, and especially mitosis, thus ensuring genomic stability after irradiation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Another cell cycle regulated gene that appears in the list of temporally bi-directionally expressed genes in the present study is E2f2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The E2f family of transcription factors has well known functions in the control of cell cycle, and E2f1-3, especially, in promoting G1/S cell cycle transition and thus cell proliferation [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Target genes of E2f include several hundred genes that are involved not only in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, but also in DNA damage repair, apoptosis, differentiation and development [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The role of E2fs in mitosis has been shown in cancer cells [59–63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Although the specific function of E2f2 in response to radiation has not been studied, E2f2 transcript and protein levels increase in response to genotoxic stress and maintain genomic stability in neuronal cells [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Why E2f2 shows bi-directional expression changes, whereas other E2f members (i.e., E2f1, E2f3, E2f4, and E2f8) do not, is currently not known. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>In the current work we identify genes that are differentially expressed following exposure to neutrons or x-rays, as well as genes that showed similar responses to the two radiation modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results show that genes involved in cell cycle regulation are differentially regulated by neutron and x-ray radiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>However, a few cell cycle genes show a consistent temporal regulation that is common across the two radiation modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>These genes are functionally interconnected and play important roles during mitosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>We have found differing patterns of gene expression response to x-rays and neutrons that vary with both dose and time since exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>These findings support the possibility of using gene expression to detect the neutron component of exposures resulting from an IND detonation, thus providing triage information more relevant to the actual radiation injury than an estimate of total dose alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Further work will be needed to develop gene expression patterns specific to neutron exposure that would be useful for triage following an IND event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>The identification of biomarkers predictive of both dose and type of radiation would be an important advancement in biodosimetry to determine an individual’s exposure and allow more accurate triage for further medical treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal of our neutron studies is to investigate whether we can separately estimate the photon and the neutron component after a mixed photon/neutron exposure, and to develop gene expression signatures capable of discriminating between photon/neutron and pure photon exposures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Following our initial investigation of the gene expression response to neutrons, reported here, our future studies will focus on mixed exposures, including the possibility of synergistic responses. </plain></SENT>
