<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a genome-wide study for age-at-onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed familial and non-familial PD separately, per prior evidence for strong genetic effect on age-at-onset in familial PD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GWAS was conducted in 431 unrelated PD individuals with at least one affected relative (familial PD) and 1544 non-familial PD from the NeuroGenetics Research Consortium (NGRC); an additional 737 familial PD and 2363 non-familial PD were used for replication. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Genetics plays a significant role in PD [MIM*168600], both in determining risk (if one will develop PD: cause) as well as age-at-onset (when a disease might manifest: modifier) (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Several rare causative genes (2–11) and 28 common risk alleles (12–16) have been confirmed for PD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The known genes and risk factors account for ∼5% of the heritability (17), hence much of the genetic component of PD is still missing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Age-at-onset of PD varies by approximately 80 years (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The factors that contribute to the variation in age-at-onset are unknown, although genes are thought to be important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Heritability of PD has been estimated as 98% (SE = 0.25) for age-at-onset and 60% (SE = 0.10) for risk (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Data from the most recent PD meta genome-wide association study (GWAS) have provided significant evidence for a polygenic component to age-at-onset (18), although no specific genes were identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Three independent complex segregation analyses have reported a significantly better fit for a genetic model than for an environmental model for PD, and found the genetic effect on age-at-onset to be significantly greater than the genetic effect on risk (19–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In one study, the best-fit model was rare alleles with large effects on age-at-onset in familial PD (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Another study estimated an average decrease in age-at-onset of approximately 18 years for each copy of the putative allele (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, taken collectively, the clues from complex segregation analyses were “rare variant”, “large impact on age-at-onset”, and “positive family history”. Figure 1.Variation in age-at-onset of PD Age-at-onset distribution in NGRC subjects shows nearly 80 years of variation in both familial and non-familial PD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The tails (age at onset ≤20 or ≥89 years) were excluded from analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The loci that affect risk have little effect on age-at-onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The International PD Genetic Consortium (6,249 PD cases) (18) and studies from Denmark (1,526 cases) (22) and from Norway and Sweden (1,340 cases) (23) independently reported that the risk alleles identified to date account for &lt;1% of the variation in age-at-onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, 99% of the 80-year variation in age-at-onset of PD remains unexplained. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Here, we report evidence for the existence of variants with low allele frequencies and large effects on age-at-onset of familial PD, which we identified via GWAS and replicated independently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We analyzed familial and non-familial PD separately because complex segregation analyses had suggested a strong genetic effect on age-at-onset of familial PD specifically (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>About one-fourth of persons with PD report a positive family history (Table 1), but their families rarely show a Mendelian inheritance pattern and most are not caused by known PD mutations (3–11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of familial PD remains idiopathic, and like non-familial PD, is thought to involve complex interactions between the genome and environmental exposures (24–27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is usually assumed that the same genes operate in familial and non-familial PD; in fact, GWAS for risk have successfully uncovered numerous susceptibility loci without separating the subtypes (12–16,26–28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, familial and non-familial PD might differ in the relative burden of genetic and non-genetic modifiers (13,29,30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>If certain variants are involved predominantly in one subtype (e.g. in familial PD as segregation analysis has suggested for age-at-onset modifiers), their signal may become diluted and undetectable if familial and non-familial PD are mixed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>A positive family history does not necessarily imply a genetic aetiology because non-genetic disease can also cluster in families due to a common exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Similarly, genetic disease may present as non-familial due to incomplete penetrance (e.g. LRRK2 mutations (29)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a familial case may be classified as non-familial given the difficulty in recall and knowledge of family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Despite these uncertainties, stratifying by presence/absence of family history proved to be key to identifying two genes that each affect age-at-onset by a decade.

<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, LHFPL2 is expressed in all normal tissues and cell lines except brain and leukocytes (40); however, while healthy brain tissue has no detectable LHFPL2 transcript, LHFPL2 protein is abundant in malignant brain tissue (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The 15q22.2 signal maps to the tropomyosin 1 gene (TPM1 [MIM*191010]). TPM1 encodes a highly conserved actin-binding protein that plays a central role in calcium-dependent regulation of muscle contraction. TPM1 is a tumour suppressor gene (42). </plain></SENT>
