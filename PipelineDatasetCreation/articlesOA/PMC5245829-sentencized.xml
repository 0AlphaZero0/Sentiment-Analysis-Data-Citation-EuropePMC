</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The circadian rhythm of bioluminescence in the marine dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum involves control over the synthesis of two proteins involved in the light emitting reaction, luciferase and luciferin binding protein (LBP) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Both proteins are synthesized at the start of night phase and assembled into small organelles termed scintillons which then migrate toward the cell periphery [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The number of scintillons [3], as well as the cellular levels of both luciferase [4] and LBP [5] all correlate with the bioluminescence capacity of the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The regulation of both luciferase and LBP synthesis occurs at a translational level since mRNA levels for both are constant [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for this is still unclear, however, as there are conflicting reports concerning the action of an inhibitory protein binding to cis-acting sequences in lbp RNA during the day phase [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No studies to date have examined a potential role for small regulatory RNA in regulating LBP synthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In many different eukaryotes, including plants [9], animals [10] and diverse protists [11], double stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to induce gene silencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be related to a cellular defense against dsRNA viruses and involves degradation of the dsRNA into small 21–30 nucleotide fragments by an RNase III-like enzyme called Dicer [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The small RNA fragments, also known as small interfering RNA (siRNA), bind to Argonaute-Piwi (Ago-Piwi) family members and form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Proteins in the complexes are thought to cleave one of the two RNA strands [14], and the remaining strand on the RISC is used to target mRNA with a complementary sequence for degradation [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition to recognition of dsRNA, RISC-mediated gene silencing can also involve small regulatory RNA termed micro-RNA (miRNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These miRNA are transcribed from the genome and also bind RISC, although their effect lies principally in an inhibition of protein synthesis [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is conceptually similar to that described for siRNA, although in animals, most miRNA pair imperfectly with their targets and do not cleave their RNA targets [17], while in plants, translational inhibition by miRNA is genetically distinguishable from cleavage [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus, while these effects of miRNA on protein synthesis occur by a mechanism independent of RNA cleavage, inhibition of gene expression is the common endpoint of both types of RNAi-mediated mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Several studies have now reported the presence of miRNAs in dinoflagellates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Small RNA sequencing of Symbiodinium microadriaticum revealed that 21 high quality miRNA candidates were present [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In S. kawagutii, 367 miRNAs were predicted from the genome sequence and 102 were identified by small RNA sequencing [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This latter study also reported that the levels of a miRNA predicted to target Hsp70 RNA decreased at higher temperatures, suggestive of a functional role in regulating HSP protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Lastly, computational analysis suggested the presence of 18 miRNAs in the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In L. polyedrum, all the bioluminescence substrate (luciferin) is bound to LBP [22], which together with luciferase, constitutes the entire protein complement of the bioluminescent organelles termed scintillons [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Since luciferin is naturally fluorescent, scintillons can be readily observed in individual cells by fluorescence microscopy [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We tested if miRNAs were present in L. polyedrum using Northern blots and RNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed that both Dicer and Argonaute are found in the L. polyedrum transcriptome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Lastly, we tested if double stranded lbp RNA, introduced into cells using biolistics, would inhibit the nightly bout of LBP synthesis and thus block the synthesis of fluorescent scintillons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Our results show no evidence for inhibition of LBP synthesis by RNA interference. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>For this, we developed a microscopy-based assay for the amount of luciferin binding protein (LBP) in single cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>LBP binds the bioluminescence substrate luciferin with high affinity [22], and, since unbound luciferin is rapidly oxidized, the amount of luciferin fluorescence in unstimulated cells is proportional to the amount of protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>LBP synthesis is restricted by a circadian clock to a period of several hours just after the onset of the night phase [5], and is degraded at the end of the night phase resulting in a roughly ten-fold difference in luciferin fluorescence between day and night phase cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since all the LBP is sequestered in bioluminescence organelles termed scintillons, the number of these organelles also varies ten-fold over the night (Fig 7) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>We predicted that blocking LBP synthesis in the cell by introducing double stranded LBP RNA prior to the bout of protein synthesis would result in night phase cells having levels of LBP fluorescence and a number of scintillons corresponding to what would normally be found in day phase cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>This agrees with a visual estimate of the number of scintillons, so a visual estimate was also made for cells containing beads coated with antisense LBP RNA corresponding to 45 bases taken from the 3’UTR, or of 1000 bases antisense sequence corresponding to the 3’ region, or of 2000 bases of antisense sequence; none of the cells bombarded in these experiments showed day phase numbers of scintillons. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have evaluated the possibility that the dinoflagellate L. polyedrum uses RNA-mediated gene silencing to control gene expression, in particular to try and understand the circadian regulation of in vivo protein synthesis at a translational level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>One experimental approach used small RNA sequencing to test for the presence of miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Out of three samples, only one contained sufficient small RNA for sequencing, and this sample returned 4.9 million filtered and size-selected reads that did not match to known organellem RNA, to rRNA or tRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>To search among these for miRNAs, we applied a single criterion—the ability to form duplexes with 2 base 3’ overhangs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In a final data set of 94,239 collapsed reads, from which we removed reads found in less than 5 copies and those able to assemble together into contigs, we found 53 small RNAs fulfilling this criterion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Twenty of these small RNAs had potential targets in the transcriptome as judged by psRNATarget (S2 Table), yet none of the potential targets represented a known circadian regulated gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when the direction of the target genes in the transcriptome was determined using BLAST searches to the protein databanks, most of the potential miRNAs were found to be in an antisense orientation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Thus, while our data do not rule out the presence of miRNAs in Lingulodinium, they do rule out a role for miRNA in regulating the translation of known circadian-regulated transcripts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>We also examined reads assembling to the lbp RNA directly, as these had been removed from the duplex search described above because they assembled together into a long contig (Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Among the 4.9 million reads, 9,787 reads assembled to lbp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Among these, six antisense reads were found, and these potentially formed duplexes with two-nucleotide 3’ overhangs with six sense reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>However, it does not seem likely that the 6 antisense reads are miRNAs since the number of miRNAs should normally exceed the number of miRNA* [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>In addition to LBP, reads mapping to other transcripts whose translation is regulated by the circadian clock are also primarily sense strand, ruling out potential regulatory small antisense RNA sequences as a general method mediating circadian clock control over translation (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>As a more direct test for RNA-mediated interference with LBP synthesis, we developed a test for evaluating if LBP synthesis could be inhibited in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Normally, L. polyedrum cells display a transient spike in the synthesis rate of luciferase and LBP at the start of the night phase [5, 48] which results in a roughly ten-fold increase in the amount of both luciferase and LBP [4, 5] and an increase in the bioluminescence capacity of the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The newly synthesized LBP assembles, along with the reaction catalyst luciferase, into cytoplasmic bodies termed scintillons [2], and increased protein levels at the start of the night phase thus causes a ten-fold increase in the number of scintillons [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The regulatory mechanism has been reported to involve a trans-acting factor, found in day phase cells and able to bind a UG-rich region in the LBP 3' UTR [7], thus leading to the hypothesis that this factor might represent a circadian translational inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However, attempts to replicate the specific and circadian factor binding to this region were unsuccessful [8], leaving the mechanism of translational regulation open. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>One alternative, RNA-mediated gene silencing, is a wide-spread phenomenon that has been documented in plants, animals, and in various protists [11] including members of the Excavata (Trypanosoma), Chromalveolata (Tetrahymena), Archaeplastida (Chlamydomonas), Amoebozoa (Dictyostelium) and Opisthokonts (Neurospora). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miRNA complementary to RNA encoding heat shock protein has a decreased abundance in heat-shocked S. kawagutii [20], consistent with a role in regulating protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>RNAi-mediated gene silencing thus represents a potential mechanism for mediating clock control over LBP synthesis that should be tested by experiment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>We tested the ability of several different antisense or double stranded lbp RNA preparations to block the normal circadian increase in scintillon numbers that occurs during the night phase of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium as a result of LBP synthesis [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>We predicted that night phase cells in which LBP synthesis had been blocked would have only day phase numbers of scintillons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>However, in observations of over a hundred swimming cells that contained visible microparticles by microscopic evaluation, no cells with day phase numbers of scintillons were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Instead, the only phenotype observed was the presence of "dark" cells, apparently lacking scintillons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>We ascribe this dark phenotype to a lack of the bioluminescence substrate, as luciferin fluorescence in the scintillons is reduced by bioluminescence [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Since mechanical agitation of the cells results in bioluminescence, the dark cells likely arose because of bioluminescence emission occurring during the centrifugation of cells for microscopic observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>We conclude from this that RNAi-mediated gene silencing is unable to account for the circadian rhythm in LBP synthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In these studies, RNA has been introduced into dinoflagellates by microparticle bombardment, a technique known to induce gene silencing in both plants [52] and animals [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, RNA purified from HcRNAV, a single stranded RNA genome virus infecting Heterocapsa circularisquama [54] is functional after bombardment of cells as assessed by replication of viral RNA and synthesis of viral like particles in the cytoplasm by transmission electron microscopy [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>This suggests that bombardment with RNA-coated microparticles can be used to test involvement of miRNAs in circadian control of translation if gene expression can be measured on a cell-by-cell basis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>While experiments of this nature have not yet been reported for dinoflagellates, introduction of heterologous RNA may be useful for study of gene expression, as despite other reports of dinoflagellate transformation [55, 56], we have so far been unable to express reporter genes in L. polyedrum. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="?"><plain>Is it possible that the scintillons in L. polyedrum can form without LBP? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Some bioluminescent dinoflagellates, such as Pyrocystis fusiformis, do contain scintillons [57] yet have no detectable LBP activity [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>However, while these structures clearly form in the absence of LBP, their composition is unknown, so it is difficult to determine if they could serve as a model for a L. polyedrum scintillons lacking LBP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In contrast, scintillons from L. polyedrum have been purified and characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>These contain only luciferase and LBP in roughly equimolar amounts [23], and it seems unlikely that they could still form if one of their two protein constituents was absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the fluorescent substrate luciferin binds to LBP [22], and even if scintillons could form without this protein, they would not be visible by fluorescence microscopy as the luciferin would not be sequestered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that in the protists where RNA-mediated gene silencing has been demonstrated, the genome sequence has now been shown to encode Dicer-like, Argonaute-Piwi and RdRP proteins [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miRNA has now been characterized from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas [59, 60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The broad taxonomic range of species containing components used for RNA-mediated gene silencing suggests this mechanism may have evolved prior to the divergence of the different eukaryotic lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>However, among the Alveolates (encompassing Dinoflagellates and Apicomplexans), no homologs to Dicer, Ago or RdRP are found in the sequenced genomes of the apicomplexans Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium [11, 61, 62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no definitive demonstration of RNAi mediated gene silencing has appeared for Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>However, the apicomplexan Toxoplasma expresses a truncated Ago that has been implicated in an effect on gene expression [63], so that RNA-mediated gene silencing may not necessarily have been lost in all Alveolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>DICER and AGO have been reported in S. microadriaticum [19] although no functional assessments of miRNA function were performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>However, it is clear that RNAi does not significantly modulate lbp gene expression in L. polyedrum. </plain></SENT>
