</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>LINE-1 is repeated half a million times in the human genome, interspersed throughout, and comprises approximately 17% of the human genome [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It has a high density of CpG dinucleotides in its 5′ untranslated region, and these CpG sites are usually heavily methylated in normal cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Because of both the extremely high frequency of LINE-1 and the heavy methylation in its 5′ CpG sites, the level of LINE-1 methylation has been thought to be closely associated with genomic DNA methylation levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In 2005, Weisenberger et al. demonstrated a strong relationship between the levels of LINE-1 methylation and genomic DNA methylation [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In that study, the LINE-1 methylation level was assessed using the MethyLight assay, a probe-based real-time PCR assay for the detection of methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>More recently, however, instead of using the MethyLight-based LINE-1 methylation assay, a pyrosequencing-based LINE-1 methylation assay has become widely used because the pyrosequencing-based assay has been validated for its precision and reliability in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples by Irahara et al. [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>LINE-1 hypomethylation in tumors has been demonstrated in virtually all tissue types of human cancer except for thyroid cancer and renal cell carcinoma [4–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, prior to the report of Tournier et al. in 2012, there had been no study which compared the results of the PCR-based LINE-1 methylation assay between paired fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Tournier and colleagues analyzed paired FF and FFPE tissue samples for their LINE-1 methylation levels using a pyrosequencing assay to identify whether formalin fixation induced deviations in the measured value of methylation levels in individual genes or in LINE-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Tournier et al. found that a significant discrepancy existed in the measured LINE-1 methylation levels between paired FF and FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy raised doubts regarding the utility of the pyrosequencing LINE-1 methylation assay in FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In formalin-fixed tissue samples, formaldehyde induces several types of DNA damage on either double strand or single strand, including formaldehyde-induced crosslinks, DNA fragmentation, abasic sites, and deamination of cytosine bases [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Of various formaldehyde-induced crosslinks, inter-strand DNA crosslinks and protein-DNA crosslinks are thought to affect the efficacy of bisulfite modification which is an essential step for genomic DNA methylation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because the reaction of bisulfite with cytosine residues is highly single strand-specific and cannot occur on double-stranded DNA [14], inter-strand DNA crosslinks are thought to cause some resistance against heat and alkaline denaturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Incomplete denaturation of DNA leads to incomplete bisulfite conversion, which might cause the discrepancy in the measured values of LINE-1 methylation between paired FF and FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Because formaldehyde-induced crosslinks are known to be reversible by heat treatment [15, 16], the application of prolonged heat treatment during DNA preparation process might increase the performance of bisulfite modification in DNA samples obtained from FFPE tissues [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to identify whether formalin fixation is related to the increased values of LINE-1 methylation detected in FFPE tissues and whether the addition of a heating step during the DNA extraction process helps to decrease the discrepancy in the measured values of LINE-1 methylation between paired FF and FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>From five cancer cell lines, we generated 10 xenograft samples that were analyzed for the effects of formalin fixation and for heating in the pyrosequencing-based assay of LINE-1 methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Finally, we attempted to identify the effect of heating in the methylation analysis of LINE-1 or of single genes in human FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>FFPE tissue is an invaluable resource for oncologic epigenetic studies because large collections of FFPE tissue samples with clinical annotations are managed in hospitals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination and delineation of areas with the highest tumor cell content is important for the quantitative methylation analysis of cancers to prevent dilution of the neoplastic cell signal by contributions from non-neoplastic cells in the cancer tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>FFPE tissue samples are more suitable for manual microdissection than FF tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Minimal amounts of tissue, even a 10-μm-thick section from an endoscopic biopsy specimen, are required for the PCR-based quantitative methylation analysis of single genes or repetitive DNA elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Tissue samples dissected from the mounted tissue slices are subjected to incubation in lysis buffer containing proteinase K at 55 °C for 2 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Then, the lysed tissue solutions are subjected to bisulfite conversion using commercially available kits, including the EpiTect or EZ DNA methylation kit, which generate bisulfite-modified DNA samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In our study, the addition of a heating step, 95 °C for 30 min, between the 2-day incubation step and the bisulfite conversion procedure was found to decrease the discrepancy between the measured values of LINE-1 methylation of paired fresh and fixed tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In the present study, formalin fixation was found to increase the measured value of LINE-1 methylation levels compared to the paired FF xenograft tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>But, the measured value of the LINE-1 methylation levels was not different among FFPE xenograft tissue samples of varying fixation lengths from 1 to 5 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that formation fixation, rather than duration of fixation, plays an important role in the causation of deviation in the measured value of LINE-1 methylation level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, because we did not examine the effect of fixation duration &gt;7 days or &lt;1 day on the performance of pyrosequencing-based LINE-1 methylation assay, we could not insist that the duration of fixation does not affect the pyrosequencing assay of LINE-1 methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study which investigated how duration of formalin fixation affects bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA and its performance in downstream methylation analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Formaldehyde reacts with amino groups in nucleobases, leading to the formation of methylene bridges between complementary strands of DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Because the generation of methylene crosslinks is a time-dependent process [17], longer fixation time is expected to form more inter-strand crosslinks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>However, we did not find any difference in the measured value of LINE-1 methylation among fixation time from 1 to 5 days. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>As a surrogate marker for genomic DNA methylation content, methylation of LINE-1 has been measured by various assays, including the combined bisulfite restriction assay [18], the MethyLight assay [2], pyrosequencing, and absolute quantitative analysis of methylated alleles [19], which target CpG sites located in the 5′ untranslated region of LINE-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>However, 85% of LINE-1 elements are truncated in their 5′ sequences [20], and thus, PCR-based assays only assess 15% of the LINE-1 elements in the human genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Weisenberger et al. demonstrated that the MethyLight assay-based measurement of LINE-1 methylation level correlates with genomic DNA methylation content as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>However, before the study of Lisanti et al. [21], there had been no study that directly analyzed the correlation between the pyrosequencing-based measurement of LINE-1 methylation and genomic DNA methylation content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Lisanti et al. showed a strong correlation between the methylation levels in LINE-1 measured via a pyrosequencing assay versus a high-performance liquid chromatography. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that hypomethylation of LINE-1 in tumors is closely associated with poor patient prognosis for many types of human cancers, including gastric carcinoma [6, 22], colorectal carcinoma [9], esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [23], and lung adenocarcinomas [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In particular, the association between LINE-1 hypomethylation in gastric carcinoma and poor prognosis has been reported by three studies [6, 11, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>However, all three of these studies, including Shigaki et al. [6], used FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>In the Shigaki study, DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue samples using the QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit, which includes a heating step for 60 min at 90 °C in its protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>However, our previous studies did not use commercial DNA purification kits, and the extraction protocol did not include any prolonged heating step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed the effect of heat during DNA extraction from FFPE tissue samples by comparing the survival curves of four groups for both heat-treated DNAs and untreated DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>With heat-treated DNA samples, PFS and OS decreased as tumoral LINE-1 methylation decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>This trend was not observed with unheated DNA samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Regardless of whether the heating step was included during DNA extraction, tumoral LINE-1 hypomethylation was found to be an independent parameter for identifying gastric cancer patients with a poor prognosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>When we examined the methylation frequencies and levels of eight CIMP panel markers between DNA samples with and without heat treatment, all of the genes except for MLH1 showed increased methylation frequencies and levels in the heat-treated DNA samples relative to the unheated DNA samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Consequently, heat treatment enabled identification of more cases of CIMP-high CRCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>At present, it is unclear why assessment of methylation at the MLH1 CpG island locus was not affected by heat treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the increased methylation level of individual genes in association with heat treatment is in contrast to the decreased methylation levels of LINE-1 under the same conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The question arises why heat treatment led to a decrease in methylation levels in repetitive DNA elements but an increase in individual genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The reason of this apparent discrepancy is unclear, but it might be attributable to the difference in the methylation assays employed: LINE-1 methylation was analyzed using a pyrosequencing assay, which measures the mean methylation level of all the DNA alleles at individual CpG sites [2], whereas the methylation levels of individual genes were assessed by the MethyLight assay, which evaluates the relative amount of specific DNA alleles with concurrent methylation of serial CpG sites [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>When the region of interest is incompletely converted and thus contains non-converted CpG and non-CpG cytosines, the MethyLight probe cannot anneal to the incompletely converted region of interest and does not generate a fluorescent signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Thus, on the condition that all CpG sites located in the region of interest are methylated, complete conversion leads to an increase in the measured value of methylation levels compared to an incomplete conversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the MethyLight assay, enzymatic cascade of the pyrosequencing reaction cannot discriminate incompletely the converted template sequence (region of interest) and generates luciferase light signals not only from methylated CpG cytosines but also from non-converted unmethylated CpG cytosines, which causes an increase in the measured value of methylation levels compared to complete conversion. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that formalin fixation can result in elevated values of the LINE-1 methylation level, irrespective of the duration of fixation, but prolonged heating of the DNA solution prior to bisulfite conversion helps decrease the discrepancy between paired FF and FFPE tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>However, heating did not offset the discrepancy in FFPE tissue samples prepared using delayed fixation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that prolonged heating of DNA samples obtained from FFPE tissues is necessary for proper evaluation of DNA methylation levels, regardless whether single genes or repetitive DNA elements are assayed. </plain></SENT>
