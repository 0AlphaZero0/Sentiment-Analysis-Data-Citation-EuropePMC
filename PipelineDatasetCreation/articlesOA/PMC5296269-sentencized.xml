</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Migraine is a chronic neurologic disease characterized by recurrent episodes of headache associated with a wide array of disruptive symptoms, including photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and/or vomiting [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is the most common neurological disease for which people seek medical consultation, affecting about 12% of adults in the United States, three quarters of them women [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Nearly all migraineurs (93%) have some degree of attack-related impairment, and more than half (54%) are severely impaired by their attacks [3]; among women, migraine ranks in the top 10 causes of disability worldwide [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Because migraine is heterogeneous and often spans decades of patients’ lives, clinical presentations and acute treatment needs can vary considerably over time, and patients often require different formulations of acute medications to optimize treatment outcomes [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true when attacks are severe, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, or rapid in onset, and parenteral formulations are needed to control symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sumatriptan — the first, most widely studied, and most frequently prescribed member of the “triptan” class of medications [2, 8, 9] — is available as a subcutaneous (SC) injection, intranasal spray, oral tablet, and, in some countries, a rectal suppository. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The 6 mg SC injection has long been considered optimal for acute therapy of migraine [2]; in large double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, 70% of subjects with moderate to severe attacks experienced pain relief within 1 h of dosing, and 50% were pain-free [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The rapid onset of action of SC sumatriptan is especially important for patients whose attacks become disabling soon after onset [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Despite its well-established efficacy and rapid onset of action, sumatriptan 6 mg SC injection has a suboptimal tolerability profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Many patients (42%) experience triptan sensations [13], such as paresthesia and chest symptoms, that appear to be dose-related [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Concerns about drug-related adverse events (AEs), which have caused two thirds of migraine patients to delay or avoid taking a prescription medication, may help to explain why fewer than 10% of eligible migraine patients use the SC formulation of sumatriptan to treat their disease [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These concerns can be particularly important in patients with various types of medical conditions (eg, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and some psychiatric illnesses) and/or treated with various medications (eg, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Based on previous research [16], we hypothesized that a formulation using a lower doses of sumatriptan may improve safety and tolerability while maintaining efficacy similar to 6 mg SC sumatriptan, and that a 3-mg dose may be sufficient in many patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The objective of this exploratory study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 3 mg SC sumatriptan (using DFN-11 and matching placebo autoinjectors consecutively) with 6 mg SC sumatriptan (using 2 DFN-11 autoinjectors consecutively) for the acute treatment of episodic migraine attacks. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Migraineurs consistently rate rapid onset of pain relief and tolerability of treatment among the most important attributes of acute migraine medication [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>With an onset of action of approximately 10 min and unparalleled relief of migraine headache and associated symptoms [14], SC sumatriptan has been the most effective acute migraine therapy since its introduction nearly 25 years ago [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The primary limitations to its use as an acute therapy are medication-related AEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Understanding the tolerability of treatment is important as to why migraine patients settle for less effective alternatives [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>For many, the relatively high likelihood of experiencing triptan sensations is a barrier to effective parenteral migraine-specific therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, the characteristics believed to be responsible for the high rate of efficacy seen with the injectable forms — faster bioavailability and greater systemic exposure compared with oral formulations — may also contribute to the relatively high rate of triptan sensations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that novel sumatriptan formulations with pharmacokinetics similar to SC sumatriptan are promising for use in clinical practice [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In this study of subjects with rapidly-escalating attacks of episodic migraine, treatment with DFN-11, a 3 mg SC sumatriptan autoinjector, was comparable to SC sumatriptan 6 mg on all clinically relevant efficacy endpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The pain-free results at 60 min postdose suggest that DFN-11 may be a fast-acting alternative to commercial formulations of injectable sumatriptan, especially for patients who awaken with full-blown attacks already in progress [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In our study, the lower, 3-mg dose of sumatriptan in DFN-11 did not appear to impede the overall therapeutic effect, and DFN-11 maintained an efficacy timecourse similar to SC sumatriptan 6 mg — a finding in accord with a previous report comparing 3 and 6 mg SC sumatriptan [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The most common AEs were triptan sensations known to be associated with SC triptan usage; all were mild to moderate and similar in frequency and severity to those seen in previous studies of the SC formulation of sumatriptan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Notably, while most subjects experienced symptoms with both sumatriptan doses, fewer subjects had triptan sensations only after treatment with the 3-mg dose than with the 6-mg dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In addition, the triptan sensation of chest pain, which has been shown to cause up to 10% of sumatriptan-treated patients to discontinue therapy [21] and may lead to substantially increased medical costs for migraine care [22], was not observed after the 3-mg dose of DFN-11 treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>With the 6 mg SC sumatriptan treatment, 10% of subjects were affected, and the mean duration of the events exceeded 6 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The implications of these findings deserve to be explored in future research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>While the results with DFN-11 are similar in many aspects to those seen in previous dose-comparing studies of SC sumatriptan, there may be clinically important differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>For example, an open-label trial comparing the 3 and 6 mg SC doses (in which 80% of subjects preferred the 3-mg dose) found, as in the current study, that the proportions of subjects with pain-free responses were similar between the 2 doses at 1 and 2 h after treatment [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, the 1-h pain relief rate for the 3-mg SC dose in this study exceeded previous reports for the 6-mg SC dose at that timepoint (83% vs 70%) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The higher treatment response may reflect the benefits of treating at the first sign of migraine pain, as subjects in the earlier studies [14, 20] waited for pain to reach moderate intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>AEs were overall slightly more frequent with the 6-mg dose than with the 3-mg dose [14, 20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The current study has strengths and limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Its main strength is its originality; this is the first well-controlled study to compare the efficacy and tolerability of 3- and 6-mg SC doses of sumatriptan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Another strength is that because subjects in this study treated at the first sign of migraine, which can prevent the development of central sensitization [23] and optimize pain-free efficacy [24–26], the performance of DFN-11 was assessed under conditions that simulate actual treatment scenarios. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Limitations of the study include the lack of power and sample size calculation, as well as the small sample size, which restrict the validity and generalizability of results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that outcomes might have been affected by subjects’ using 2 consecutive injections to provide a 6-mg dose of sumatriptan, but there is no evidence that this method of administering study medication influences response to sumatriptan. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In this randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study comparing 3 mg SC sumatriptan with 6 mg SC sumatriptan for acute treatment of rapidly-escalating attacks of episodic migraine, both the 3- and 6-mg doses demonstrated comparable efficacy on all efficacy endpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The 3-mg and 6-mg SC doses were also similar on safety parameters, but DFN-11 was associated with better tolerability, as shown by a lower incidence of triptan sensation AEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest was the lack of chest pain as an AE with DFN-11. </plain></SENT>
