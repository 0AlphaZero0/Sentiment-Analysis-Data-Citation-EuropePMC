</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It is well established that intra-articular deposition of particulates, such as gout-associated monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and osteoarthritis (OA)-associated basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals, drives joint degeneration through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cartilage-degrading proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>BCP crystals are a heterogeneous group of ultramicroscopic crystalline substances composed mainly of hydroxyapatite (HA), along with smaller proportions of its precursor forms octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and tricalcium phosphate [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The concentration of BCP crystals found in the synovial fluid is reported to be between 20 and 100 μg/ml [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a 3-year prospective analysis of synovial fluid (SF) samples obtained from 330 patients with knee OA showed that the initial presence of BCP crystals was associated with worsening of radiographic lesions [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The concentration in the tissues is more difficult to quantify; however, Fuerst and colleagues demonstrated that human knee and hip cartilage specimens (n = 120 and n = 80, respectively), harvested at the time of total joint arthroplasty for primary OA, contained BCP crystals in 100% of cases [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sun et al. have also reported calcium deposition in all eight OA menisci harvested at the time of joint replacement surgery and that calcium crystal formation could be generated by both the meniscal and cartilage cells of patients with end-stage OA [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As crystal deposition does not occur in healthy cartilage, it is becoming more widely accepted that cartilage calcification plays a pathogenic role in OA and that BCP crystals are not the “innocent bystanders” that they were once believed to be. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the crystals are now considered to be a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) as they can activate fibroblasts through a variety of signalling pathways involving protein kinase C (PKC), ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and transcription factors such as NFκB which, in turn, leads to the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Cytokine induction has also been observed in BCP-activated chondrocytes [12] and macrophages [13–16], with IL-1β, in particular, implicated as a key player in the inflammatory and degradative responses observed in OA joints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is induced early on in the disease and has the ability to upregulate matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and aggrecanases, induce cell infiltration into the joints, promote osteoclastogenesis, and suppress the biosynthesis of type II collagen and aggrecan, crucial components of cartilage [17–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that BCP crystals can inhibit anti-osteoclastogenic cytokine signalling, and therefore the crystals may also contribute to joint destruction by promoting the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Together, these events lead to an imbalance in the production of anabolic versus catabolic mediators and, in many cases, total joint replacement is eventually required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Current therapies for OA focus merely on pain relief and improvement of joint function rather than halting disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While much progress has been made in elucidating the cellular and molecular events contributing to OA, the complex nature of the disease has hampered the development of a successful disease-modifying drug despite a multitude of potential targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We and others have previously reported that BCP crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro leading to potent IL-1β production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, conflicting results from in vivo models have called into question the relevance of these findings to a clinical setting, and additional targets are currently being sought [14, 16, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Another potential target of interest in particulate-mediated disease is the membrane-proximal kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Belonging to the tyrosine kinase family, Syk is activated during phagocytosis and following Fc receptor engagement on immune cells [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Syk has been implicated in both the internalisation of MSU crystals and subsequent MSU-induced signalling in neutrophils and dendritic cells (DC) [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In addition to MSU crystals, alum particles and cholesterol crystals have also been reported to activate Syk in a receptor-independent manner, by a process known as membrane affinity-triggered signalling (MATS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>This involves direct binding of the particulates to the cell membrane which results in lipid raft formation and aggregation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing molecules which mediate the recruitment of Syk to the plasma membrane and its subsequent activation [26, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that BCP crystals activate Syk and its downstream interacting partner, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), in murine macrophages [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether BCP crystals activate similar pathways in human macrophages and DC and to examine the downstream effect of inhibiting these pathways in order to identify potential therapeutic targets to treat crystal-induced inflammation in OA. </plain></SENT>
