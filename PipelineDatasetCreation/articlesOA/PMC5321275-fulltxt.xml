We undertook a longitudinal study involving health evaluation over an entire marine production cycle on one salmon farm in British Columbia (Canada). In previous production cycles at this farm site and others in the vicinity, cardiac lesions not linked to a specific infectious agent or disease were identified. Histologic assessments of both live and moribund fish samples collected at the farm during the longitudinal study documented at the population level the development, peak, and recovery phases of HSMI. The fish underwent histopathological evaluation of all tissues, Twort&#x02019;s Gram staining, immunohistochemistry, and molecular quantification in heart tissue of 44 agents known or suspected to cause disease in salmon. Our analysis showed evidence of HSMI histopathological lesions over an 11-month timespan, with the prevalence of lesions peaking at 80&#x02013;100% in sampled fish, despite mild clinical signs with no associated elevation in mortalities reported at the farm level. Diffuse mononuclear inflammation and myodegeneration, consistent with HSMI, was the predominant histologic observation in affected heart and skeletal muscle. Infective agent monitoring identified three agents at high prevalence in salmon heart tissue, including <italic>Piscine orthoreovirus</italic> (PRV), and parasites <italic>Paranucleospora theridion</italic> and <italic>Kudoa thyrsites</italic>. However, PRV alone was statistically correlated with the occurrence and severity of histopathological lesions in the heart. Immunohistochemical staining further localized PRV throughout HSMI development, with the virus found mainly within red blood cells in early cases, moving into the cardiomyocytes within or, more often, on the periphery of the inflammatory reaction during the peak disease, and reducing to low or undetectable levels later in the production cycle. This study represents the first longitudinal assessment of HSMI in a salmon farm in British Columbia, providing new insights on the pathogenesis of the disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was part of the Strategic Salmon Health Initiative, co-funded by the Pacific Salmon Foundation &#x0201c;Salish Sea Marine Survival&#x0201d; project, Genome British Columbia, and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Canada.

Since then, the number of HSMI outbreaks has steadily increased to a peak of 181 cases reported in Norway in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although HSMI is not notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), HSMI is considered to be the third most important salmon disease in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease has been reported also in Scotland [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Chile [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The current diagnostic criteria for HSMI are based on histopathologic lesions in the heart and skeletal muscles that distinguish this disease from other known diseases in salmon [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the heart, moderate to severe myocarditis (in both compact and spongy layer) is characterized by infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes and macrophages). The epicardium is also strongly affected by an inflammatory reaction, while the atrium is less involved; the latter may show lesions similar to those occurring in the spongy layer of the ventricular myocardium, but are usually milder [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Along with the inflammatory pattern, myodegeneration and necrosis can be present. The skeletal muscle also shows moderate to severe myodegeneration and necrosis occurring in the red muscle fibres only as well as inflammatory infiltration [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, lesions in the heart are more frequently observed when fish are in a compromised disease state (initial stage of the disease, peak of the disease and recovery phase), while the skeletal muscle is generally impacted during peak occurrence of HSMI lesions and, to a lesser extent, in the recovery phase [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For this reason, a tentative histopathological diagnosis of HSMI at the individual fish level requires at least the presence of described heart lesions. Cardiac lesions in the later stage of HSMI, however, can overlap the pattern of lesions seen in other diseases, like Cardiomyopathy Syndrome (CMS), and hence the lesions in the red fibers of skeletal muscle act as a differentiating element [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other histopathological lesions concurrently found are generally considered the result of circulatory disturbance due to heart failure, like multifocal zonal or patchy liver necrosis and congestion or hemorrhages occurring in liver, kidney, spleen and gills, while the pancreas remains unaffected by any inflammatory or degenerative reaction [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Additional features characteristic of the disease are a low mortality, from negligible up to 20%, and high morbidity, up to 100% of the farm population [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Outbreaks often occur 5&#x02013;9 months after transfer to seawater, although the disease has been reported to occur also in freshwater [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Clinically-affected fish can show abnormal swimming behaviour and anorexia, and ascites, pale heart and liver, splenomegaly, and visceral petechiae are the typical gross lesions reported [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, increased mortality and clinical signs are not reliable indicators for the extent of an outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, unlike outbreaks of salmonid Pancreas Disease (PD), which also affects the heart and where up to 15% of the survivors can fail to grow [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], &#x0201c;poor performers&#x0201d; have not been commonly associated with HSMI [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Although HSMI in Atlantic Salmon has been reported with concurrent presence of <italic>Piscine orthoreovirus</italic> (PRV) and has not been reproduced in the absence of PRV [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], to date, a causal relationship between the virus and disease has not been demonstrated. Questions on PRV&#x02019;s role in the development of HSMI stem from the relatively ubiquitous nature of the virus in farmed populations [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], high qPCR loads of PRV occasionally found in apparently healthy fish (farmed and wild) with no HSMI lesions [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and lack of success in culturing the virus in continuous cell lines [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, PRV has been reported in fish presenting CMS concurrently with <italic>Piscine Myocarditis Virus</italic> (PMCV) [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in farmed Atlantic Salmon, where PRV was considered acting as an &#x0201c;opportunistic&#x0201d; pathogen. A further study also demonstrated the concurrent presence of PRV with Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) in farmed Atlantic Salmon [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, two studies attempting to sequence any agent with a RNA genome related to cell culture passage preparation or tissues from two different HSMI outbreaks in Norway, only revealed PRV [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A third study identified a novel calicivirus (<italic>Atlantic salmon calicivirus</italic>&#x02014;ASCV) associated with HSMI fish; a challenge study using pure ASCV resulted in lesions consistent with HSMI, but it was later determined that these fish also had PRV [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Analysis of field outbreaks of HSMI found no correlation between ASCV and HSMI [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>While myocarditis lesions have been reported sporadically across multiple farms in British Columbia (BC) dating as far back as 2002, no particular disease, including HSMI, has been diagnosed in association with these lesions. Our study involved longitudinal sampling of apparently healthy and moribund fish through a marine production cycle to evaluate temporal changes in prevalence of observed histopathologic lesions and how they may relate to multiple agents associated with diseases in salmon worldwide. In a parallel study by our group, assessing associations between histopathologic lesions and agents in regulatory audit samples collected throughout the industry, we observed four farm cases of myocarditis lesions between 2011 and 2013 in the region where we had collected the longitudinal farm samples in 2013&#x02013;2014. Careful examination of dying fish from these four farms through the regulatory Fish Health and Surveillance program (Department of Fisheries and Oceans&#x02014;Aquaculture Management Division) revealed lesions consistent with HSMI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171471.s001">S1 File</xref>). The study herein documents the analyses that were then undertaken to characterize the pathological development of these lesions. The samples included moribund (or recently dead when no moribund fish were available) and apparently healthy salmon collected on the farm over the entire ocean production cycle and were assessed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, molecular monitoring of 44 infectious agents, and on-site clinical data. Throughout, we use the case definition for the diagnosis of HSMI outlined by Biering and Garseth [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] that is applied broadly across Norway, which bases the diagnosis of the disease strictly on the occurrence of pathological lesions. However, we incorporated by association clinical signs, mortalities, and pathogen data that, while not used specifically in the diagnosis of HSMI, were used to compare with published reports of HSMI outbreaks in Norway. By applying a longitudinal study design, we document the first diagnosis of HSMI on a farm in British Columbia, which was evident over an 11-month period and was highly consistent with similar outbreaks on Norwegian farms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Case definition of HSMI</title><p>In this study, we followed the diagnostic case definition used by Biering and Garseth [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], wherein the diagnosis of HSMI is based on histological inflammatory lesions occurring in heart and skeletal muscle, but not in the pancreas. However, while inflammatory lesions in the skeletal muscle may indicate HSMI at the population-level, and in particular can help to differentiate HSMI from CMS, skeletal muscle lesions are not consistently present throughout an entire HSMI outbreak, and hence are not always a useful differential at the level of the individual fish [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Details of the histological classification of the heart and skeletal muscle lesions are reported in the Histopathology section. We did not use any other inclusion criteria (e.g. mortality, concurrent clinical signs, or molecular results with specific cut-off values) to modify our case definition for HSMI disease, as these criteria have been previously considered to be unreliable indicators throughout an entire HSMI outbreak [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Sampling protocol</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All work with animals was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC) Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals.

The brackets in the &#x0201c;IHC (PRV Sigma-1)&#x0201d; column indicate the samples tested also with a second PRV antibody (PRV Mu1c).</p><p>All fish were euthanized with overdose of tricaine methanesulfonate (250mg/l; Aqualife TMS, Syndel laboratories Ltd., Nanaimo BC, Canada) and dissections were conducted on-site using aseptic technique. Dissections provided six tissues for molecular testing, including brain, liver, head kidney, heart, muscle and gill, although only heart tissue was included in this study for molecular testing; the tissues were preserved individually in RNAlater, held at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, then stored at -80&#x000b0;C degrees until homogenization. Tissues for histopathological investigations were collected from the same fish and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin; tissues included gills, heart, brain, eye, liver, anterior and posterior kidney, spleen, stomach, pyloric caeca including pancreas and skin at the lateral line to include red and white muscle. Blood samples were also collected, transported to the laboratory where they were centrifuged and frozen (-20&#x000b0;C) as soon as possible (6&#x02013;24 hrs post-collection), for use in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Clinical findings and mortality data</title><p>During the field sampling events, the veterinarian involved in this study took general and specific notes reflecting observations including clinical signs and gross lesions for all moribund/dead fish, but not for live fish sampled, while farm-level observations were provided by farm technicians. All findings were transferred electronically into an Excel spreadsheet, capturing their original descriptions. Briefly, the dataset consisted of columns for each description of clinical sign or gross lesion (n = 82), and the cells were populated with fish totals for moribund and recently dead fish for each farm sampling event. The descriptions of clinical signs and lesions were later aggregated to include five broad categories for: sea lice, mouth rot disease (MMY; myxobacteriosis), poor performers (PP), central nervous system (CNS; e.g. inflammation, hemorrhage, etc.), and HSMI-related. For the latter category, any of the following were included: slow-swimmer, off-feed, ascites (e.g. ascites, hemorrhagic ascites, visceral petechiae, etc.), liver (e.g. enlarged, congested, etc.; excluding &#x0201c;green&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;haemorrhagic&#x0201d;), spleen (e.g. enlarged, congested, etc.), and heart (e.g. enlarged, pericardial effusion, etc.). Although these findings have all been reported to be present concurrently to HSMI outbreaks in Norway, they do not represent pathognomonic signs or lesions of the disease, as they can be reported for other conditions too.</p><p>Daily mortality data were provided, by the Company owning the farm in this study, for every pen throughout the production cycle. The mortality counts were aggregated at the farm-level and summarized into weekly records for each of the following six categories recorded as the causes associated with mortalities: handling, predatory attack (e.g. otters), MMY, skin- and fin-related lesions, environmental (i.e. harmful algal bloom and low dissolved oxygen levels), and other (all remaining mortality counts). Mortalities are shown as percentages calculated from the closing fish count from the previous week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Laboratory tests</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Histopathology</title><p>All tissues fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin were dehydrated through an ascending gradient of alcohol solutions, embedded in paraffin wax, cut at 3.5&#x003bc;m thickness and stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) for morphological evaluation by light microscope.</p><p>H&#x00026;E stained slides were prepared for all moribund fish collected across all four farms included in the project, and examined initially to gauge the range of lesions and diseases expected within the single farm samples. These histopathological examinations were then extended to include live (apparently healthy) and freshly dead fish on a single farm showing distinctive inflammatory lesions in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, with a total of 469 fish assessed over a 16-month period (June 2013 to September 2014) for that farm.</p><p>Upon diagnosis of HSMI at the farm, we considered that the other two major viral diseases representing differentials for HSMI (namely PD and CMS) and their respective agents are not known to be present in BC and were not present in our samples. Therefore, all fish with any degree of myocarditis consistent with HSMI were considered to be within the &#x0201c;HSMI complex&#x0201d; and classified according to the scoring system used by Finstad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Under this scoring regimen, lesions were classified in a range from 0 (no lesions) to 3 (most severe lesions) for each of the two heart components (epicardium and compact/spongy myocardium). Fish having a cumulative score from both components of 4 or higher were diagnosed as HSMI fish [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and thereby represented fish with the most severe lesions. Fish with a cumulative score between 3 and 3.5 were considered as moderate lesions, and a score of 1.5 to 2.5 was indicative of mild lesions. Finally, fish scoring 1 or less were considered to be HSMI negative fish (no lesions). Previous challenge [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and farm-level [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studies have demonstrated that HSMI-diagnostic lesions in the heart move from the outside inward (i.e. from epicardium and small myocardial blood vessels to compact myocardium to spongy myocardium) over the course of the disease. We devised a scheme to further classify our fish with mild to moderate lesions as fish in a &#x0201c;developing stage&#x0201d; of HSMI or a &#x0201c;recovery stage&#x0201d;. The developmental pathway of the disease was therefore assessed by observing the presence, extent and position of the lesions in the heart and using the ratio between lesion severity scores in the epicardium versus the myocardium (which included the spongy layer). A ratio &#x0003e; 1 indicated that a fish was in the &#x0201c;developing stage&#x0201d; of the disease (more damage in the epicardium than the myocardium), while a ratio &#x02264;1 was considered to be a &#x0201c;recovering stage&#x0201d; fish (damage moving to the interior of the heart).</p><p>Skeletal muscle lesions were also analysed and scored according to a semi-quantitative scoring system. In detail, lesions occurring in the red fibres were classified in a range from 0 to 3. A score equal to 0 designated no inflammatory reaction, while a score of 1 was assigned when the area involved in the inflammatory response represented less than 30% of the red fibers on the histology section. A score of 2 was assigned when the area involved comprised between 30 and 60%, and finally a score of 3 when more than 60% of the red fibres were involved in the inflammatory reaction. It is worth mentioning that previous studies did not use a scoring system to classify the lesions occurring in the skeletal muscle, other than categorizing them as no lesions, mild, moderate or severe.</p><p>Morbidity, defined in our study as the percentage of fish with heart scores &#x02265;1.5 (i.e. fish with some degree of histopathological lesions in the heart consistent with HSMI, including all live and moribund fish sampled) was also assessed.</p><p>Two pathologists were involved in the diagnosis of disease. One pathologist read the histology slides from all 469 fish, and after initial analyses, focussed primarily on heart and skeletal muscle tissue. A second pathologist conducted a complete pathological analysis (blinded to the initial results) of all tissues on a sub-sample of 99 fish, covering the whole sampling period and including a mixture of fish initially deemed positive or negative to HSMI. Specifically, those sub-sampled included fish from before HSMI occurrence (August 14, 2013, n = 33), a random selection of samples from the beginning of the episode (September 11, 2013, n = 10), fish sampled during the peak phase at the farm level (November 5, 2013, n = 43) and a random selection of samples from the recovery stage (January 2014, n = 13). Agreement between the two pathologists was assessed using McNemar&#x02019;s chi-square test and qualitative interpretation of kappa was based on Landis and Koch [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Histochemistry</title><p>A subset (n = 22, from the total of 469) of samples showing high load of the two most prevalent parasites in the heart (as determined by quantitative q-PCR described below) with and without concomitant heart lesions underwent Twort&#x02019;s Gram staining, in order to localize the organisms in the tissues. In essence, we tested eight samples for <italic>Kudoa thyrsites</italic> and 14 samples for <italic>Paranucleospora theridion</italic> (syn. <italic>Desmozoon lepeophtherii</italic>). It is noteworthy to mention that the samples tested with this staining procedure included (1) specimens in which these parasites were the only organisms present in the heart as per our independent infective agent monitoring, (2) slides where both parasites were present, and (3) a random selection of samples during the peak phase of the HSMI occurrence and with both parasites present at high load.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Throughout the entire production cycle, sections from all fish with a histological score for heart lesions &#x02265;4 (n = 56), sampled between June 2013 and January 2014, underwent immunohistochemistry staining using a polyclonal rabbit antibody against PRV Sigma-1 protein (Anti PRV &#x003c3;1, #K275) [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This was done to determine whether PRV, detected by molecular screening of heart tissue, was localized in the affected area of the heart in a manner similar to that observed in farmed Norwegian salmon with HSMI. In addition, a selection of fish without histopathological lesions in the heart and negative for PRV (n = 4) and fish presenting high loads of PRV without histopathological lesions in the heart (n = 7) or mild lesions (n = 4) also underwent the same staining procedure to determine the localization of the virus in these samples. To further confirm the presence of PRV in the heart lesions in a second laboratory, a subset of fish (n = 17out of the 56) with score &#x02265;4 were also stained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against PRV Mu1c protein (Anti PRV &#x003bc;1c, #K265), accordingly to a previously-published protocol [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Fish showing high load of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic> in the heart (Ct &#x02264;10, as determined by qPCR; n = 8 out of 469) and fish showing concomitant heart lesions (n = 5 out of 469) underwent IHC with mouse anti <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic> monoclonal antibody (clone IPA-2F4, Thermo Scientific, Rockford CA, USA), in order to localize the parasite in the tissue and its possible association with the lesions.</p><p>For all the antibodies, 3.5 &#x003bc;m thick paraffin wax embedded sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Portsmouth, USA). These were heated at 60&#x000b0;C for 20 min, dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by autoclave treatment (121&#x000b0;C for 10 min) in citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.0). The sections were successively treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1h to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted 1:10 in 1% bovine serum albumin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) in TBS [pH 7.6, 0.05 M Tris/HCl, 0.15 M NaCl] for 1h. The same diluent solution was used for primary antibodies (1:3000 for anti PRV Sigma-1 and Mu1c, as for Finstad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; 1:20 for anti <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic>, as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions) and then incubated in a humidity chamber at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. A Vectastain ABC-peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) was used for detection of bound antibody according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, and ImmPACT NovaRED (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as substrate.

Agent loads were normalized (transformed) by using a base 10 logarithmic scale [log10(copy number + 1)]. Ranges, means, medians, and standard errors were analysed for agent load over sampling dates, heart scores, condition of fish at time of sampling, and PRV prevalence. A 3-category heart lesion score was created from the histopathologists&#x02019; findings: HS0 = total heart score&#x02264;1, HS1 = total heart score &#x0003e;1 and &#x0003c;4, and HS2 = total heart score &#x02265;4; these cutpoint values were based on the Finstad et al.&#x02019;s semi-quantitative scoring system [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

To capture as much histological information as possible, an ordinal logistic regression was used to model the 3-category heart lesion score. The presence of PRV in the heart was included as a dichotomous predictor (0/1), and we also accounted for time (5 categories) and the fish condition (D, M, or L). All predictors were included as fixed effects, and potential interaction terms were included between PRV, sampling dates, and fish condition. Given the sparseness of data over time and across heart scores, we simplified the evaluation of statistical interaction of predictors and imposed assumptions during the model building process. As such, we limited our interactions to dates, simplified predictors (e.g. using dichotomous PRV instead of load or copy numbers) for parsimony, and assumed proportional odds across the histological scores.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec016"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec017"><title>Descriptive epidemiology of the events occurring on the farm</title><p>The timeline of events occurring at the farm is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171471.g001">Fig 1</xref>.

[<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Lesions diagnostic of HSMI (according to Biering and Garseth [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) at various degrees of severity were reported for an 11-month timespan. In the heart, lesions first appeared 6 weeks after a harmful algal bloom event and ensuing development of mouth rot disease on the farm. These initial lesions preceded by 1 month the first fish diagnosed with HSMI (heart score &#x02265;4), while the peak of the HSMI event occurred 2 months later (7 months post sea transfer). The following two months showed a decrease in number of HSMI fish but, unlike Kongtorp&#x02019;s longitudinal study, by February 2014 a second spike in HSMI fish occurred, coinciding with a high number of sea lice and corresponding delousing treatment. Handling procedures and different types of stressors have been identified in Norway as potential risk factors for the disease [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; therefore we speculate that the occurrence of this disease could have been triggered by the harmful algal bloom event (creating hypoxic conditions) that occurred in the late summer 2013, and that handling associated with the delousing treatment may have further compromised the fish, bringing about new HSMI cases in February 2014. However, because fish were collected from different pens at each sampling date, we can&#x02019;t exclude the possibility that fluctuations in severity of histopathological lesions reported in these samples could be a sampling artefact; but we can conclude that the study documents a farm-level case of HSMI.</p><p>The high farm-wide prevalence of inflammatory lesions in the heart reported in our study is also consistent with HSMI, which in Norway can reach up to 100% of the farm population, even when mortality is low or negligible [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, more than 80% of the sampled fish had lesions consistent with HSMI across multiple pens for a span of 7 months, from November 2013 to June 2014, including live-sampled and dying fish.</p><p>While our study did not undertake a systematic approach to the notation of gross clinical signs, observations on moribund and recently dead fish included abnormal behavior (&#x0201c;fish off feed&#x0201d;) and the presence of macroscopic lesions, such as ascites, pale heart, brain congestion, inflammation and haemorrhages, congestion of liver and spleen associated with circulatory disturbance, that are consistent with findings reported for HSMI in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], although not specific (i.e. pathognomonic) of the disease. In particular, ascites, common outcome of heart failure, was the gross lesion most strongly tracking the development of HSMI, affecting over 40% of fish during the peak of HSMI in October-November 2013. Gross signs of brain inflammation showed the same HSMI-related pattern, although no lesions were reported microscopically. This represents the first report of brain lesions concurrently found with HSMI, but given discordance between gross and microscopic evidences, should be further evaluated. Unusual mortality and clinical signs were also noted on two laboratory submissions from the farm veterinarian sent for further analysis and coinciding with the peak of HSMI fish in October-November 2013; mortality data suggest that farm-wide mortality during that period was not unusually high, but there was slightly increased mortalities affecting predominantly three out of twelve pens. In Norway, HSMI does not always result in elevated mortality (range 0&#x02013;20% [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), production impacts [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or even clinical signs of disease [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; and in fact, laboratory challenge studies with HSMI positive tissues have emulated the lesions, but not the mortality or clinical signs [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>The pattern and distribution of histopathological lesions occurring in heart and skeletal muscle described in our study are consistent with the findings reported in Kongtorp&#x02019;s longitudinal study. In addition, our study demonstrated the temporal shift in presence, severity and distribution of lesions in heart tissue, providing a fine-scale resolution of disease development at the farm level. The vast majority of fish in the developing stage of HSMI were reported in the period between August and October 2013, indicating the progression of the lesions from outside (epicarditis and perivasculitis) to inside of the heart tissue, spreading to the myocardium and inducing a myocarditis involving principally the compact layer. In November 2013, HSMI fish showed moderate to severe lesions occurring in both epicardium and myocardium. At this point, both compact and spongy layers of the myocardium were involved, although the compact layer was still more affected. Just after the peak in occurrence of fish diagnosed with HSMI, we recorded a substantial decrease in the proportion of fish in developing stage HSMI, while the number of fish in the recovery stage of HSMI steadily increased, reaching a first peak in January 2014. In this time frame, lesions were generally milder, in particular in the epicardium and compact myocardium, while they remained quite consistent in the spongy layer of the myocardium, demonstrating the end point of the &#x0201c;centripetal pattern&#x0201d; of HSMI development. Interestingly, no fish in the developing stage of HSMI were reported concurrently to the second peak of HSMI occurring later in February 2014, indicating that these HSMI cases might more likely represent a deterioration of the pre-existing recovery condition rather than a recrudescence of the disease. As previously mentioned, we cannot exclude that this finding is an artefact due to sampling from different pens along the study, but the presence of a second peak of recovery stage fish in June 2014 might suggest that the second spike of HSMI fish in February 2014 was real. In September 2014 (the last sampling date available for this study), no HSMI fish were detected, although there still remained some mild to moderate lesions principally in heart and liver tissues, suggesting the slow pace of recovery of affected fish surviving HSMI.</p><p>Lesions in the skeletal muscle usually started from the interface between red and white muscle, and tended to infiltrate the remaining red fibres, a pattern that was easily differentiated from the nodular/granulomatous lesions induced by <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic>.

Despite the fact that, to date, HSMI has never been reproduced in the laboratory or reported at a farm-level in the absence of PRV [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a causal relationship between PRV and HSMI has not been demonstrated. Two recent challenge studies on BC salmon concluded that they were unable to replicate HSMI or any evidence of disease or mortality in Atlantic Salmon from PRV-positive inoculum from healthy Atlantic Salmon [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or from tissues associated with jaundice Chinook salmon (<italic>Onchorynchus tshawytscha</italic>) which also contained PRV [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A low pathogenic strain of PRV in BC, or lack of a causative relationship between PRV and HSMI were hypothesized to account for these results. These studies demonstrated the transmission of PRV via intra-peritoneal (IP) injection [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and cohabitation [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and its active replication in Atlantic Salmon. Mild heart lesions (lymphohistiocytic endocarditis and/or epicarditis) were reported in a few, mostly na&#x000ef;ve, fish cohabiting with PRV IP-injected fish in the most recent study [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and approximately 20% of challenge fish (but no control fish), in the other study [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>Our farm-level study was not designed to investigate causal relationships between any agent and histopathologic lesions. However, our analytical evaluation of longitudinal samples demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between PRV prevalence and load with the occurrence and severity of HSMI lesions in the heart, a correlation that had previously been demonstrated in laboratory-based challenges [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as in the field [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Setting this study apart from all others performed to date, we conducted both a broad surveillance of known microbial agents, virtually all with pathogenic potential in salmon, and follow-up RNA-seq on two affected fish to obtain a full genome sequence of PRV. We demonstrated that of the agents tested in the heart samples, PRV was the only agent detected in heart tissue that was correlated with HSMI lesions in the heart. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>theridion</italic> was consistently present in nearly all of the farm population, at high load in some individuals, but without statistical correlation with live-sampled and moribund/dead fish or with HSMI lesions in heart tissues. The other common agent, <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic>, was observed as a co-infection most notably in the summer months, decreasing around the time that the first HSMI fish were observed. Using IHC, we demonstrated the presence of <italic>K</italic>. <italic>thyrsites</italic> in heart and skeletal muscle, but no inflammatory reaction was detected in the heart and was different (multi-focal/granulomatous type) and straightforward to distinguish from the diffuse, infiltrative pattern induced by HSMI in the muscle, in which PRV in the heart tissue was commonly observed. In our study, along with the demonstration that all fish with a heart score &#x02265; 3 were positive for PRV (and most with scores between 1.5 and 2.5), the odds for PRV-positive fish to have higher heart scores compared to PRV-negative fish were approximately 9:1. In addition, PRV load was significantly higher in fish with heart lesions than in fish without lesions, as also demonstrated by L&#x000f8;voll et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Along with the molecular evidence showing a statistical correlation between PRV replication and developing HSMI lesions, our IHC evaluation localized PRV to the areas of HSMI-associated inflammation and within the cardiomyocytes, findings consistent with IHC from laboratory-based challenges [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but reported for the first time from a field setting. We found that early in the development of the disease, in fish with high load of PRV without evidence of inflammatory lesions in the heart, the virus was distributed strictly in the RBCs, consistent with the findings of Finstad et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] who demonstrated that erythrocytes are the primary infective cells for PRV. During the peak of the disease, PRV loads were generally high and the virus was mostly localized in the cardiomyocytes within the inflamed areas of the myocardium and/or (more often) on the periphery of the inflammatory infiltrate. This localization of the virus could be associated with the phase of cell-mediated response of the organism that is expressed by a typical mechanism of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction (characterized by CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages, as described for HSMI by Mikalsen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). If PRV were to have a role in the development of HSMI, it is possible that the virus may replicate and be tolerated in long-lived erythrocytes moving through the circulatory system, but when the virus is released due to stress or other factors (such as hypoxia), it could pass to the cardiomyocytes, inducing degeneration of the cells and activating an autoimmune reaction caused by the release of myocardial myosin. This mechanism would be consistent with the action of myocarditic reoviruses in other species [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as well as several other viruses inducing myocarditis [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. During the recovery phase of HSMI, when farm-level PRV loads were generally reduced, we had more difficulties visualizing PRV in individual fish, as others have reported [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], despite the continued presence of lesions. Finstad and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] suggested that if PRV plays a role in the development of HSMI, the immune system could clear the virus more quickly and effectively than the time it takes to repair the damage induced by inflammation, an observation that could also explain why occasionally fish with HSMI lesions can have lower PRV loads than apparently healthy fish, or even no PRV at all.</p><p>Another causal hypothesis is that, given the relatively high prevalence of this virus in farmed salmon, background PRV infection may be one of the few agents detected when health is compromised by other extraneous factors [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Alternatively, compromised health from any source may provide the opportune host for PRV proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this case, PRV may simply represent a component cause of HSMI, rather than a necessary cause of HSMI. While intriguing, this hypothesis does not explain the changes in PRV concentration in erythrocytes predominantly seen in the early stages of HSMI to cardiomyocytes in the peak of the disease at an individual level nor the specific spatial localization in tissues between the virus-infected cardiomyocytes and inflammatory lesions.</p><p>PRV was localized (though immunohistochemnistry with anti PRV Sigma-1 antibody) in tissues additional to the heart. As PRV primarily infects RBCs, the virus should be present across multiple organs; however, the localization of the virus within tissues other than RBCs was quite cell-specific. In the brain, PRV was detected primarily in cells of the saccus vasculosus, a sac-like structure in strict contact with the blood, and the inner layer of the cells covering the third ventricle receiving the cerebrospinal fluid produced by the saccus vasculosus. The enterocytes also showed positivity to the antibody, confirming the finding of Hauge et al. [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who demonstrated a transmission of PRV (and HSMI) through anal administration of PRV. In the spleen, positivity was primarily found in macrophages and melanomacrophages; we cannot distinguish whether these cells were positive because they were phagocyting virus particles or damaged infected RBCs. Finally, the presence of PRV in the gills might represent a possible transmission route for either viral infection or shedding. These findings could add information regarding the PRV infection in other organs and cell types than heart and erythrocytes; however, confirmative studies are required to fully understand the pathogenesis of the infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>HSMI in BC</title><p>In the regulatory disease surveillance program for farmed BC salmon (the DFO Audit program), farms to be sampled are chosen at random on a quarterly basis, not in response to mortality events, although they may occasionally be captured, with only a small number of fresh silver fish (recently dead; generally 2&#x02013;6) assessed per farm on a given sampling event. While myocarditis lesions have been reported within this program sporadically across multiple BC farms since 2002, no specific disease, including HSMI, has been diagnosed in association with these lesions. The case definition applied to diagnose HSMI by BC veterinarians required the presence of inflammatory lesions in both the heart and concurrent skeletal muscle lesions in individual fish (where skeletal muscle tissue was provided), and accompanying clinical signs and increased mortality at the farm level [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Our study focussed intensive analysis on one farm in the region where these lesions were observed across four regulatory farm audits from 2011&#x02013;2013 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171471.s001">S1 File</xref>). Using the international standard of specific pathological lesions in heart and skeletal tissues as the case definition for HSMI, we diagnosed HSMI at both the farm and individual level occurring from seven months post seawater entry until close to harvest 11 months later. HSMI is one of three viral heart diseases in Norway, and we were able to definitively rule-out the other two diseases (CMS and PD) because of lack of detection of the causative agents and through the differential tissue distribution of the lesions. As a result, it is conceivable that some of the occasionally observed myocarditis lesions on farms in BC dating back as far as 2002 may have been HSMI.</p><p>There are two plausible explanations why the disease HSMI was diagnosed in this longitudinal study, but not previously. Firstly, our study focussed intensive temporal sampling of live and dying salmon on one farm in the region where heart lesions have most commonly occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171471.s001">S1 File</xref>) and was able to capture the full development of the disease over hundreds of fish sampled. We showed that, at very early and late stages of the disease, the linkage between heart and skeletal muscle lesions within individual fish could be relatively weak. The inconsistency between heart and skeletal muscle pathology at early and late stages of HSMI has also been observed in farm outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and laboratory challenges [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in Norway. Hence, skeletal muscle pathology is an important differential for the diagnosis of HSMI at the farm level, but it is not an appropriate differential at the individual fish level. However, in our study, at the peak of the disease, a large proportion of fish were affected with severe heart and skeletal muscle lesions, as would be expected; as such, our data provide high confidence in the diagnosis of HSMI on this farm. Alternately, in sampling programs that may capture only a small number of fish on a farm, whether in response to a mortality event or as in the Audit program, as a random sampling event at non-peak stages of disease, it may be difficult to diagnose HSMI with a high degree of confidence. Moreover, if the disease is not associated with elevated mortality, or if clinical signs are missing, the farm would be unlikely to conduct diagnostic testing on their fish, and thus may not capture the disease, or may observe the lesions at a time when there is a background of other common infections.</p><p>Secondly, the disease would likely be missed under case definitions that require elements other than histopathological lesions in HSMI diagnosis, again especially if small sample sizes are used. Our study did document some clinical evidence consistent with HSMI outbreaks in Norway, with the occurrence of clinical signs maximized during the peak of the outbreak. However, previous studies have shown that fish with HSMI do not necessarily all have the same clinical signs, and many appear healthy with no clinical signs, even with high lesion scores [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For this reason, clinical signs are not a differential for HSMI in Norway. In our study, there were no unusually high numbers of mortalities coinciding with HSMI fish at the farm-level, as observed between September 2013 and February 2014, although up to three pens showed slightly increased mortality in that timeframe. However, because in Norway HSMI is not always associated with elevated mortality, this parameter is not used as a differential for the disease. Finally, we showed that PRV is statistically associated with the development of heart lesions, but also that some fish carry PRV without lesions, especially early in the disease, as has also been reported in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and we were further able to resolve through immunohistochemistry that in these fish, PRV appears to be confined to red blood cells rather than cardiac cells. We showed as well that while PRV was always detected in HSMI fish (heart score &#x02265; 4), and mostly at high load, PRV was detected in fairly low load in some recovering fish; this is consistent with other studies [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and is one reason (in addition to the lack of a confirmed causative relationship) that PRV is not used as a differential in the diagnosis of HSMI in Norway, but is often used in a confirmatory role (Dr. Torunn Taksdal, Personal Communication).</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Wild Pacific salmon</title><p>In BC, the farmed Atlantic Salmon industry shares waters with large and abundant wild Pacific salmon stocks, and there is a strong interest in ensuring that the salmon aquaculture industry is sustainable in an environment with pathogen exchange potential between wild and farmed salmon. Policy decisions require strong scientifically-defensible data to support this overall objective [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The longitudinal farm study reported herein was motivated by these information needs, specifically addressing whether the historically reported heart lesions on the targeted farm and in that Aquaculture Management Area could, in fact, derive from the emerging disease HSMI. Our data clearly show that the pathological lesions diagnostic for this disease were broadly present within the Atlantic Salmon on this single farm, and that the only known virus to routinely associate with the disease is also associated with HSMI lesions on the farm.</p><p>The obvious next question becomes, what is the risk of this disease in Pacific salmon, and/or the risk of transmission of this virus between wild salmon and farmed salmon? Risk assessment will require further studies, but PRV has been detected in most Pacific salmon species that have been tested in BC, Washington and Alaska, at lower prevalence than on farms (0&#x02013;21% vs &#x0003e;70%) [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although HSMI has never been diagnosed in any Pacific salmon species in BC [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or in wild Atlantic Salmon in Norway [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to date, lack of access to representative samples throughout the life cycle limits the conclusions possible for the natural history of the complex relationship between PRV and HSMI in wild fish populations. However, HSMI-like lesions have been reported concurrent with anemia and necrotic lesions in the kidney and liver (often resulting in a jaundice appearance in the fish) in farmed <italic>Oncorhynchus</italic> species in Norway (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and Chile (<italic>Oncorhynchus kisutch</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In both farm studies, PRV was also observed, but whether this was due to its high prevalence on farms in general, or to a role in the development of the disease is unknown. Jaundice and anemia has also been reported in farmed BC Chinook salmon, <italic>O</italic>. <italic>tshawytscha</italic>, coincident with PRV infection, but a challenge study failed to reproduce mortality, clinical signs, or the lesions found on fish dying of jaundice on the farms [<xref rid="pone.0171471.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The study did, however, identify mild lymphohistiocytic endocarditis lesions exclusive to challenged fish and in all the three species tested (Chinook [60%], Sockeye [70%] and Atlantic [20%] salmon), but none of these fish carried lesions in the skeletal muscle. Just as in Atlantic Salmon, future studies are required to address whether there is a causal relationship between PRV and disease in any salmon species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our longitudinal study identified HSMI over an extended period in 2013&#x02013;2014 on one farm in BC, Canada, and documented the same correlation between PRV and HSMI lesions in heart tissues as reported for HSMI occurrences in Norway. This is the third country in which PRV has been associated with HSMI lesions, providing supporting evidence that PRV appears to be a component for HSMI development, but falling short of demonstrating that PRV alone is sufficient to cause HSMI. However, it is important to put these data into perspective given what we do not know about the role that PRV has on HSMI in BC salmon. Our data describe the occurrence of HSMI lesions on one of four Atlantic Salmon farms we followed through an entire ocean production cycle. Hence with these data alone, we cannot comment on the spatial extent of this disease or potential impacts on other species, such as wild Pacific salmon. Future epidemiological studies need to be extended both geographically and temporally, to identify the extent of the disease, to further evaluate the relationship with PRV, and to further elucidate predisposing factors that may contribute to the development of HSMI in the field, including environmental and husbandry practices, and strain variation derived through full viral genome sequencing. In addition, challenge studies should be conducted using HSMI positive tissues in both Atlantic and Pacific salmon to assess the disease potential across species and the contribution of PRV (or other identified agents) and additional contributing factors to the development of HSMI lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171471.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data extrapolated from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans&#x02014;Aquaculture Management Division&#x02014;Fish Health and Surveillance Audit program.</title><p>The data show heart lesions identified on four farms located in the region of the farm of interest, for years 2011&#x02013;2013.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171471.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171471.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Complete sample inventory detailing the fish number, sampling date, associated metrics, histopathological and molecular results, and analysis carried out for each fish collected.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171471.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171471.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>List of all the infective agents tested through Fluidigm BioMark<sup>&#x02122;</sup> microfluidics-based qPCR system.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171471.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171471.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemical detection of PRV using PRV Sigma-1 antibody on the brain.</title><p>A) Interstitial cells of the saccus vasculosus (arrows) show presence of PRV (red&#x02014;Novared).
