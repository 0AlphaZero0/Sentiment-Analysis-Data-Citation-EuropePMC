</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic Salmon was reported for the first time in Norway in 1999 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Since then, the number of HSMI outbreaks has steadily increased to a peak of 181 cases reported in Norway in 2014 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although HSMI is not notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), HSMI is considered to be the third most important salmon disease in Norway [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disease has been reported also in Scotland [4] and Chile [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The current diagnostic criteria for HSMI are based on histopathologic lesions in the heart and skeletal muscles that distinguish this disease from other known diseases in salmon [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the heart, moderate to severe myocarditis (in both compact and spongy layer) is characterized by infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells (primarily lymphocytes and macrophages). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The epicardium is also strongly affected by an inflammatory reaction, while the atrium is less involved; the latter may show lesions similar to those occurring in the spongy layer of the ventricular myocardium, but are usually milder [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Along with the inflammatory pattern, myodegeneration and necrosis can be present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The skeletal muscle also shows moderate to severe myodegeneration and necrosis occurring in the red muscle fibres only as well as inflammatory infiltration [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, lesions in the heart are more frequently observed when fish are in a compromised disease state (initial stage of the disease, peak of the disease and recovery phase), while the skeletal muscle is generally impacted during peak occurrence of HSMI lesions and, to a lesser extent, in the recovery phase [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For this reason, a tentative histopathological diagnosis of HSMI at the individual fish level requires at least the presence of described heart lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Cardiac lesions in the later stage of HSMI, however, can overlap the pattern of lesions seen in other diseases, like Cardiomyopathy Syndrome (CMS), and hence the lesions in the red fibers of skeletal muscle act as a differentiating element [1,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Other histopathological lesions concurrently found are generally considered the result of circulatory disturbance due to heart failure, like multifocal zonal or patchy liver necrosis and congestion or hemorrhages occurring in liver, kidney, spleen and gills, while the pancreas remains unaffected by any inflammatory or degenerative reaction [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Additional features characteristic of the disease are a low mortality, from negligible up to 20%, and high morbidity, up to 100% of the farm population [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Outbreaks often occur 5–9 months after transfer to seawater, although the disease has been reported to occur also in freshwater [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Clinically-affected fish can show abnormal swimming behaviour and anorexia, and ascites, pale heart and liver, splenomegaly, and visceral petechiae are the typical gross lesions reported [1,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, increased mortality and clinical signs are not reliable indicators for the extent of an outbreak [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, unlike outbreaks of salmonid Pancreas Disease (PD), which also affects the heart and where up to 15% of the survivors can fail to grow [14], “poor performers” have not been commonly associated with HSMI [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although HSMI in Atlantic Salmon has been reported with concurrent presence of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) and has not been reproduced in the absence of PRV [15–17], to date, a causal relationship between the virus and disease has not been demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Questions on PRV’s role in the development of HSMI stem from the relatively ubiquitous nature of the virus in farmed populations [18,19], high qPCR loads of PRV occasionally found in apparently healthy fish (farmed and wild) with no HSMI lesions [19–21], and lack of success in culturing the virus in continuous cell lines [12,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PRV has been reported in fish presenting CMS concurrently with Piscine Myocarditis Virus (PMCV) [23] in farmed Atlantic Salmon, where PRV was considered acting as an “opportunistic” pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A further study also demonstrated the concurrent presence of PRV with Salmonid Alphavirus (SAV) in farmed Atlantic Salmon [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, two studies attempting to sequence any agent with a RNA genome related to cell culture passage preparation or tissues from two different HSMI outbreaks in Norway, only revealed PRV [17,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A third study identified a novel calicivirus (Atlantic salmon calicivirus—ASCV) associated with HSMI fish; a challenge study using pure ASCV resulted in lesions consistent with HSMI, but it was later determined that these fish also had PRV [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Analysis of field outbreaks of HSMI found no correlation between ASCV and HSMI [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>While myocarditis lesions have been reported sporadically across multiple farms in British Columbia (BC) dating as far back as 2002, no particular disease, including HSMI, has been diagnosed in association with these lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Our study involved longitudinal sampling of apparently healthy and moribund fish through a marine production cycle to evaluate temporal changes in prevalence of observed histopathologic lesions and how they may relate to multiple agents associated with diseases in salmon worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In a parallel study by our group, assessing associations between histopathologic lesions and agents in regulatory audit samples collected throughout the industry, we observed four farm cases of myocarditis lesions between 2011 and 2013 in the region where we had collected the longitudinal farm samples in 2013–2014. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Careful examination of dying fish from these four farms through the regulatory Fish Health and Surveillance program (Department of Fisheries and Oceans—Aquaculture Management Division) revealed lesions consistent with HSMI (S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The study herein documents the analyses that were then undertaken to characterize the pathological development of these lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The samples included moribund (or recently dead when no moribund fish were available) and apparently healthy salmon collected on the farm over the entire ocean production cycle and were assessed by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, molecular monitoring of 44 infectious agents, and on-site clinical data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Throughout, we use the case definition for the diagnosis of HSMI outlined by Biering and Garseth [7] that is applied broadly across Norway, which bases the diagnosis of the disease strictly on the occurrence of pathological lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>However, we incorporated by association clinical signs, mortalities, and pathogen data that, while not used specifically in the diagnosis of HSMI, were used to compare with published reports of HSMI outbreaks in Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>By applying a longitudinal study design, we document the first diagnosis of HSMI on a farm in British Columbia, which was evident over an 11-month period and was highly consistent with similar outbreaks on Norwegian farms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>However, while inflammatory lesions in the skeletal muscle may indicate HSMI at the population-level, and in particular can help to differentiate HSMI from CMS, skeletal muscle lesions are not consistently present throughout an entire HSMI outbreak, and hence are not always a useful differential at the level of the individual fish [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Details of the histological classification of the heart and skeletal muscle lesions are reported in the Histopathology section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We did not use any other inclusion criteria (e.g. mortality, concurrent clinical signs, or molecular results with specific cut-off values) to modify our case definition for HSMI disease, as these criteria have been previously considered to be unreliable indicators throughout an entire HSMI outbreak [11,18]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>Through intensive analyses of both live, moribund and recently dead fish over the entire production cycle of one farm, our study documented the development, peak and recovery phases of HSMI occurring over an extended duration, in a manner that was consistent temporally and pathologically with findings of HSMI in Norway, as reported in the longitudinal study by Kongtorp et al. [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>Lesions diagnostic of HSMI (according to Biering and Garseth [7]) at various degrees of severity were reported for an 11-month timespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>In the heart, lesions first appeared 6 weeks after a harmful algal bloom event and ensuing development of mouth rot disease on the farm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>These initial lesions preceded by 1 month the first fish diagnosed with HSMI (heart score ≥4), while the peak of the HSMI event occurred 2 months later (7 months post sea transfer). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>The following two months showed a decrease in number of HSMI fish but, unlike Kongtorp’s longitudinal study, by February 2014 a second spike in HSMI fish occurred, coinciding with a high number of sea lice and corresponding delousing treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>Handling procedures and different types of stressors have been identified in Norway as potential risk factors for the disease [9,18,23]; therefore we speculate that the occurrence of this disease could have been triggered by the harmful algal bloom event (creating hypoxic conditions) that occurred in the late summer 2013, and that handling associated with the delousing treatment may have further compromised the fish, bringing about new HSMI cases in February 2014. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>However, because fish were collected from different pens at each sampling date, we can’t exclude the possibility that fluctuations in severity of histopathological lesions reported in these samples could be a sampling artefact; but we can conclude that the study documents a farm-level case of HSMI. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="521" pm="."><plain>The high farm-wide prevalence of inflammatory lesions in the heart reported in our study is also consistent with HSMI, which in Norway can reach up to 100% of the farm population, even when mortality is low or negligible [9,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="522" pm="."><plain>Indeed, more than 80% of the sampled fish had lesions consistent with HSMI across multiple pens for a span of 7 months, from November 2013 to June 2014, including live-sampled and dying fish. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="523" pm="."><plain>While our study did not undertake a systematic approach to the notation of gross clinical signs, observations on moribund and recently dead fish included abnormal behavior (“fish off feed”) and the presence of macroscopic lesions, such as ascites, pale heart, brain congestion, inflammation and haemorrhages, congestion of liver and spleen associated with circulatory disturbance, that are consistent with findings reported for HSMI in Norway [9], although not specific (i.e. pathognomonic) of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="524" pm="."><plain>In particular, ascites, common outcome of heart failure, was the gross lesion most strongly tracking the development of HSMI, affecting over 40% of fish during the peak of HSMI in October-November 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="525" pm="."><plain>Gross signs of brain inflammation showed the same HSMI-related pattern, although no lesions were reported microscopically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="526" pm="."><plain>This represents the first report of brain lesions concurrently found with HSMI, but given discordance between gross and microscopic evidences, should be further evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="527" pm="."><plain>Unusual mortality and clinical signs were also noted on two laboratory submissions from the farm veterinarian sent for further analysis and coinciding with the peak of HSMI fish in October-November 2013; mortality data suggest that farm-wide mortality during that period was not unusually high, but there was slightly increased mortalities affecting predominantly three out of twelve pens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="528" pm="."><plain>In Norway, HSMI does not always result in elevated mortality (range 0–20% [1]), production impacts [9], or even clinical signs of disease [11]; and in fact, laboratory challenge studies with HSMI positive tissues have emulated the lesions, but not the mortality or clinical signs [17,27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="529" pm="."><plain>The pattern and distribution of histopathological lesions occurring in heart and skeletal muscle described in our study are consistent with the findings reported in Kongtorp’s longitudinal study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="530" pm="."><plain>In addition, our study demonstrated the temporal shift in presence, severity and distribution of lesions in heart tissue, providing a fine-scale resolution of disease development at the farm level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="531" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of fish in the developing stage of HSMI were reported in the period between August and October 2013, indicating the progression of the lesions from outside (epicarditis and perivasculitis) to inside of the heart tissue, spreading to the myocardium and inducing a myocarditis involving principally the compact layer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="532" pm="."><plain>In November 2013, HSMI fish showed moderate to severe lesions occurring in both epicardium and myocardium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="533" pm="."><plain>At this point, both compact and spongy layers of the myocardium were involved, although the compact layer was still more affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="534" pm="."><plain>Just after the peak in occurrence of fish diagnosed with HSMI, we recorded a substantial decrease in the proportion of fish in developing stage HSMI, while the number of fish in the recovery stage of HSMI steadily increased, reaching a first peak in January 2014. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="535" pm="."><plain>In this time frame, lesions were generally milder, in particular in the epicardium and compact myocardium, while they remained quite consistent in the spongy layer of the myocardium, demonstrating the end point of the “centripetal pattern” of HSMI development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="536" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no fish in the developing stage of HSMI were reported concurrently to the second peak of HSMI occurring later in February 2014, indicating that these HSMI cases might more likely represent a deterioration of the pre-existing recovery condition rather than a recrudescence of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>As previously mentioned, we cannot exclude that this finding is an artefact due to sampling from different pens along the study, but the presence of a second peak of recovery stage fish in June 2014 might suggest that the second spike of HSMI fish in February 2014 was real. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>In September 2014 (the last sampling date available for this study), no HSMI fish were detected, although there still remained some mild to moderate lesions principally in heart and liver tissues, suggesting the slow pace of recovery of affected fish surviving HSMI. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>Lesions in the skeletal muscle usually started from the interface between red and white muscle, and tended to infiltrate the remaining red fibres, a pattern that was easily differentiated from the nodular/granulomatous lesions induced by K. thyrsites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>Overall, these lesions were quite inconsistent in summer 2013, before HSMI was evident, but became highly prevalent during autumn 2013, primarily in the fish with the most severe lesions in the heart, while they were less common and milder during winter and spring 2014, as the recovery phase developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>This finding is also consistent with Kongtorp’s longitudinal study and others [10,11], confirming the necessity for the presence of these lesions at a farm level to diagnose HSMI and differentiate it from CMS, but not at the individual level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>Negative molecular tests for SAV and PMCV along with the absence of typical lesions reported for PD (pancreas involvement) and CMS (epi-myocarditis, but only atrium and spongy layer of the myocardium typically affected, and no skeletal muscle involvement) further strengthened the final diagnosis.The two diseases might be found mixed with HSMI, making the diagnostic pathway more challenging in that region [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the absence of these particular concomitant infections in BC salmon might help explain why mortality was low. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>A typical element of reported HSMI cases in Atlantic Salmon has been the concurrent presence of PRV [17,18,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that, to date, HSMI has never been reproduced in the laboratory or reported at a farm-level in the absence of PRV [15,16], a causal relationship between PRV and HSMI has not been demonstrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>Two recent challenge studies on BC salmon concluded that they were unable to replicate HSMI or any evidence of disease or mortality in Atlantic Salmon from PRV-positive inoculum from healthy Atlantic Salmon [34] or from tissues associated with jaundice Chinook salmon (Onchorynchus tshawytscha) which also contained PRV [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>A low pathogenic strain of PRV in BC, or lack of a causative relationship between PRV and HSMI were hypothesized to account for these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrated the transmission of PRV via intra-peritoneal (IP) injection [34,35] and cohabitation [34], and its active replication in Atlantic Salmon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>Mild heart lesions (lymphohistiocytic endocarditis and/or epicarditis) were reported in a few, mostly naïve, fish cohabiting with PRV IP-injected fish in the most recent study [34], and approximately 20% of challenge fish (but no control fish), in the other study [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>Our farm-level study was not designed to investigate causal relationships between any agent and histopathologic lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>However, our analytical evaluation of longitudinal samples demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between PRV prevalence and load with the occurrence and severity of HSMI lesions in the heart, a correlation that had previously been demonstrated in laboratory-based challenges [17,25] as well as in the field [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>Setting this study apart from all others performed to date, we conducted both a broad surveillance of known microbial agents, virtually all with pathogenic potential in salmon, and follow-up RNA-seq on two affected fish to obtain a full genome sequence of PRV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that of the agents tested in the heart samples, PRV was the only agent detected in heart tissue that was correlated with HSMI lesions in the heart. P. theridion was consistently present in nearly all of the farm population, at high load in some individuals, but without statistical correlation with live-sampled and moribund/dead fish or with HSMI lesions in heart tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>The other common agent, K. thyrsites, was observed as a co-infection most notably in the summer months, decreasing around the time that the first HSMI fish were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>Using IHC, we demonstrated the presence of K. thyrsites in heart and skeletal muscle, but no inflammatory reaction was detected in the heart and was different (multi-focal/granulomatous type) and straightforward to distinguish from the diffuse, infiltrative pattern induced by HSMI in the muscle, in which PRV in the heart tissue was commonly observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>In our study, along with the demonstration that all fish with a heart score ≥ 3 were positive for PRV (and most with scores between 1.5 and 2.5), the odds for PRV-positive fish to have higher heart scores compared to PRV-negative fish were approximately 9:1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>In addition, PRV load was significantly higher in fish with heart lesions than in fish without lesions, as also demonstrated by Løvoll et al. [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>Along with the molecular evidence showing a statistical correlation between PRV replication and developing HSMI lesions, our IHC evaluation localized PRV to the areas of HSMI-associated inflammation and within the cardiomyocytes, findings consistent with IHC from laboratory-based challenges [26], but reported for the first time from a field setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>We found that early in the development of the disease, in fish with high load of PRV without evidence of inflammatory lesions in the heart, the virus was distributed strictly in the RBCs, consistent with the findings of Finstad et al. [26] who demonstrated that erythrocytes are the primary infective cells for PRV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>During the peak of the disease, PRV loads were generally high and the virus was mostly localized in the cardiomyocytes within the inflamed areas of the myocardium and/or (more often) on the periphery of the inflammatory infiltrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>This localization of the virus could be associated with the phase of cell-mediated response of the organism that is expressed by a typical mechanism of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction (characterized by CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages, as described for HSMI by Mikalsen et al. [17]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>If PRV were to have a role in the development of HSMI, it is possible that the virus may replicate and be tolerated in long-lived erythrocytes moving through the circulatory system, but when the virus is released due to stress or other factors (such as hypoxia), it could pass to the cardiomyocytes, inducing degeneration of the cells and activating an autoimmune reaction caused by the release of myocardial myosin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>This mechanism would be consistent with the action of myocarditic reoviruses in other species [36,37], as well as several other viruses inducing myocarditis [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="565" pm="."><plain>During the recovery phase of HSMI, when farm-level PRV loads were generally reduced, we had more difficulties visualizing PRV in individual fish, as others have reported [26], despite the continued presence of lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="566" pm="."><plain>Finstad and colleagues [26] suggested that if PRV plays a role in the development of HSMI, the immune system could clear the virus more quickly and effectively than the time it takes to repair the damage induced by inflammation, an observation that could also explain why occasionally fish with HSMI lesions can have lower PRV loads than apparently healthy fish, or even no PRV at all. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="567" pm="."><plain>Another causal hypothesis is that, given the relatively high prevalence of this virus in farmed salmon, background PRV infection may be one of the few agents detected when health is compromised by other extraneous factors [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="568" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, compromised health from any source may provide the opportune host for PRV proliferation [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="569" pm="."><plain>In this case, PRV may simply represent a component cause of HSMI, rather than a necessary cause of HSMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="570" pm="."><plain>While intriguing, this hypothesis does not explain the changes in PRV concentration in erythrocytes predominantly seen in the early stages of HSMI to cardiomyocytes in the peak of the disease at an individual level nor the specific spatial localization in tissues between the virus-infected cardiomyocytes and inflammatory lesions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>PRV was localized (though immunohistochemnistry with anti PRV Sigma-1 antibody) in tissues additional to the heart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>As PRV primarily infects RBCs, the virus should be present across multiple organs; however, the localization of the virus within tissues other than RBCs was quite cell-specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="573" pm="."><plain>In the brain, PRV was detected primarily in cells of the saccus vasculosus, a sac-like structure in strict contact with the blood, and the inner layer of the cells covering the third ventricle receiving the cerebrospinal fluid produced by the saccus vasculosus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="574" pm="."><plain>The enterocytes also showed positivity to the antibody, confirming the finding of Hauge et al. [39], who demonstrated a transmission of PRV (and HSMI) through anal administration of PRV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="575" pm="."><plain>In the spleen, positivity was primarily found in macrophages and melanomacrophages; we cannot distinguish whether these cells were positive because they were phagocyting virus particles or damaged infected RBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="576" pm="."><plain>Finally, the presence of PRV in the gills might represent a possible transmission route for either viral infection or shedding. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="579" pm="."><plain>In the regulatory disease surveillance program for farmed BC salmon (the DFO Audit program), farms to be sampled are chosen at random on a quarterly basis, not in response to mortality events, although they may occasionally be captured, with only a small number of fresh silver fish (recently dead; generally 2–6) assessed per farm on a given sampling event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="580" pm="."><plain>While myocarditis lesions have been reported within this program sporadically across multiple BC farms since 2002, no specific disease, including HSMI, has been diagnosed in association with these lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="581" pm="."><plain>The case definition applied to diagnose HSMI by BC veterinarians required the presence of inflammatory lesions in both the heart and concurrent skeletal muscle lesions in individual fish (where skeletal muscle tissue was provided), and accompanying clinical signs and increased mortality at the farm level [40,41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="582" pm="."><plain>Our study focussed intensive analysis on one farm in the region where these lesions were observed across four regulatory farm audits from 2011–2013 (S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="583" pm="."><plain>Using the international standard of specific pathological lesions in heart and skeletal tissues as the case definition for HSMI, we diagnosed HSMI at both the farm and individual level occurring from seven months post seawater entry until close to harvest 11 months later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="584" pm="."><plain>HSMI is one of three viral heart diseases in Norway, and we were able to definitively rule-out the other two diseases (CMS and PD) because of lack of detection of the causative agents and through the differential tissue distribution of the lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="585" pm="."><plain>As a result, it is conceivable that some of the occasionally observed myocarditis lesions on farms in BC dating back as far as 2002 may have been HSMI. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="586" pm="."><plain>There are two plausible explanations why the disease HSMI was diagnosed in this longitudinal study, but not previously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="587" pm="."><plain>Firstly, our study focussed intensive temporal sampling of live and dying salmon on one farm in the region where heart lesions have most commonly occurred (S1 File) and was able to capture the full development of the disease over hundreds of fish sampled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="588" pm="."><plain>We showed that, at very early and late stages of the disease, the linkage between heart and skeletal muscle lesions within individual fish could be relatively weak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="589" pm="."><plain>The inconsistency between heart and skeletal muscle pathology at early and late stages of HSMI has also been observed in farm outbreaks [11] and laboratory challenges [1] in Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="590" pm="."><plain>Hence, skeletal muscle pathology is an important differential for the diagnosis of HSMI at the farm level, but it is not an appropriate differential at the individual fish level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="591" pm="."><plain>However, in our study, at the peak of the disease, a large proportion of fish were affected with severe heart and skeletal muscle lesions, as would be expected; as such, our data provide high confidence in the diagnosis of HSMI on this farm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="592" pm="."><plain>Alternately, in sampling programs that may capture only a small number of fish on a farm, whether in response to a mortality event or as in the Audit program, as a random sampling event at non-peak stages of disease, it may be difficult to diagnose HSMI with a high degree of confidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="593" pm="."><plain>Moreover, if the disease is not associated with elevated mortality, or if clinical signs are missing, the farm would be unlikely to conduct diagnostic testing on their fish, and thus may not capture the disease, or may observe the lesions at a time when there is a background of other common infections. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="594" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the disease would likely be missed under case definitions that require elements other than histopathological lesions in HSMI diagnosis, again especially if small sample sizes are used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="595" pm="."><plain>Our study did document some clinical evidence consistent with HSMI outbreaks in Norway, with the occurrence of clinical signs maximized during the peak of the outbreak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="596" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies have shown that fish with HSMI do not necessarily all have the same clinical signs, and many appear healthy with no clinical signs, even with high lesion scores [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="597" pm="."><plain>For this reason, clinical signs are not a differential for HSMI in Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="598" pm="."><plain>In our study, there were no unusually high numbers of mortalities coinciding with HSMI fish at the farm-level, as observed between September 2013 and February 2014, although up to three pens showed slightly increased mortality in that timeframe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="599" pm="."><plain>However, because in Norway HSMI is not always associated with elevated mortality, this parameter is not used as a differential for the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="600" pm="."><plain>Finally, we showed that PRV is statistically associated with the development of heart lesions, but also that some fish carry PRV without lesions, especially early in the disease, as has also been reported in Norway [20,26], and we were further able to resolve through immunohistochemistry that in these fish, PRV appears to be confined to red blood cells rather than cardiac cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="601" pm="."><plain>We showed as well that while PRV was always detected in HSMI fish (heart score ≥ 4), and mostly at high load, PRV was detected in fairly low load in some recovering fish; this is consistent with other studies [26] and is one reason (in addition to the lack of a confirmed causative relationship) that PRV is not used as a differential in the diagnosis of HSMI in Norway, but is often used in a confirmatory role (Dr. Torunn Taksdal, Personal Communication). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="603" pm="."><plain>In BC, the farmed Atlantic Salmon industry shares waters with large and abundant wild Pacific salmon stocks, and there is a strong interest in ensuring that the salmon aquaculture industry is sustainable in an environment with pathogen exchange potential between wild and farmed salmon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="604" pm="."><plain>Policy decisions require strong scientifically-defensible data to support this overall objective [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="605" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal farm study reported herein was motivated by these information needs, specifically addressing whether the historically reported heart lesions on the targeted farm and in that Aquaculture Management Area could, in fact, derive from the emerging disease HSMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="606" pm="."><plain>Our data clearly show that the pathological lesions diagnostic for this disease were broadly present within the Atlantic Salmon on this single farm, and that the only known virus to routinely associate with the disease is also associated with HSMI lesions on the farm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="607" pm="?"><plain>The obvious next question becomes, what is the risk of this disease in Pacific salmon, and/or the risk of transmission of this virus between wild salmon and farmed salmon? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="608" pm="."><plain>Risk assessment will require further studies, but PRV has been detected in most Pacific salmon species that have been tested in BC, Washington and Alaska, at lower prevalence than on farms (0–21% vs &gt;70%) [19,43,44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="609" pm="."><plain>Although HSMI has never been diagnosed in any Pacific salmon species in BC [19] or in wild Atlantic Salmon in Norway [20,21] to date, lack of access to representative samples throughout the life cycle limits the conclusions possible for the natural history of the complex relationship between PRV and HSMI in wild fish populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="610" pm="."><plain>However, HSMI-like lesions have been reported concurrent with anemia and necrotic lesions in the kidney and liver (often resulting in a jaundice appearance in the fish) in farmed Oncorhynchus species in Norway (Oncorhynchus mykiss) [45] and Chile (Oncorhynchus kisutch) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="611" pm="."><plain>In both farm studies, PRV was also observed, but whether this was due to its high prevalence on farms in general, or to a role in the development of the disease is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="612" pm="."><plain>Jaundice and anemia has also been reported in farmed BC Chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, coincident with PRV infection, but a challenge study failed to reproduce mortality, clinical signs, or the lesions found on fish dying of jaundice on the farms [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="613" pm="."><plain>The study did, however, identify mild lymphohistiocytic endocarditis lesions exclusive to challenged fish and in all the three species tested (Chinook [60%], Sockeye [70%] and Atlantic [20%] salmon), but none of these fish carried lesions in the skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="614" pm="."><plain>Just as in Atlantic Salmon, future studies are required to address whether there is a causal relationship between PRV and disease in any salmon species. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="616" pm="."><plain>In summary, our longitudinal study identified HSMI over an extended period in 2013–2014 on one farm in BC, Canada, and documented the same correlation between PRV and HSMI lesions in heart tissues as reported for HSMI occurrences in Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="617" pm="."><plain>This is the third country in which PRV has been associated with HSMI lesions, providing supporting evidence that PRV appears to be a component for HSMI development, but falling short of demonstrating that PRV alone is sufficient to cause HSMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="618" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to put these data into perspective given what we do not know about the role that PRV has on HSMI in BC salmon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="619" pm="."><plain>Our data describe the occurrence of HSMI lesions on one of four Atlantic Salmon farms we followed through an entire ocean production cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="620" pm="."><plain>Hence with these data alone, we cannot comment on the spatial extent of this disease or potential impacts on other species, such as wild Pacific salmon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="621" pm="."><plain>Future epidemiological studies need to be extended both geographically and temporally, to identify the extent of the disease, to further evaluate the relationship with PRV, and to further elucidate predisposing factors that may contribute to the development of HSMI in the field, including environmental and husbandry practices, and strain variation derived through full viral genome sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="622" pm="."><plain>In addition, challenge studies should be conducted using HSMI positive tissues in both Atlantic and Pacific salmon to assess the disease potential across species and the contribution of PRV (or other identified agents) and additional contributing factors to the development of HSMI lesions. </plain></SENT>
