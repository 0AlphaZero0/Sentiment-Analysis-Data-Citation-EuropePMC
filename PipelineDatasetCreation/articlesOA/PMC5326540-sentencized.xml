</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Tree frogs are able to climb smooth surfaces such as broad leaves or smooth rock faces by using expanded toe pads on each of their digits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Each pad adheres by secreting a watery fluid, generating capillary forces resulting from the thin fluid layer between the pads and the surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have investigated the details of the attachment mechanisms and the attachment performance of various tree frog species [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although tree frogs are often found resting on broad and flat surfaces such as leaves, they have to reach the leaves by climbing smaller curved objects such as twigs and smaller branches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An obvious way is to grip around objects by using their long digits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This gripping and clamping technique relies mostly on the friction between the digits (or other body parts) and the (cylindrical) object and has been studied intensively in many arboreal animals including primates [5,6], reptiles [7,8], some insects [9,10] and robots [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A recent study by Herrel et al. [12] tested the impressive climbing ability of phyllomedusan tree frogs on very narrow substrates and could show that frogs use different sets of digits depending on the substrate's diameter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Manzano et al. [13] studied the detailed limb anatomy in two species of arboreal frogs, highlighting the capability and dexterity of their limbs to grasp and climb challenging terrains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, electrostimulations of limb muscles and manually pulling the frog away from a cylindrical dowel showed that frogs are able to exert a powerful grip [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, studies investigating the clamping forces in climbing frogs are otherwise absent as tree frogs have been studied mostly for the adhesive capabilities of their expanded toe pads against flat surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition to those pads, each digit also bears subarticular tubercles which could aid in friction and/or adhesion when the digits clamp an object [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, no other studies have yet addressed the function of these structures in tree frogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Our observations on White's tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) have shown that these structures barely come into contact with a flat surface [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We propose that these structures will be more relevant when frogs clasp around objects and are mainly used for increasing the friction between the fingers and the grasped surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, many tree frogs have fairly long digits in comparison with the size of the palm [13,16] which would not necessarily help in adhesion but could be very important for a prehensile grip. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It is therefore interesting to study the function of individual digits and the forces they can generate when tree frogs climb cylindrical objects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigate how Chinese gliding frogs (Rhacophorus dennysi) climb and hold on to cylindrical objects by (i) measuring the ground reaction forces involved in climbing one fixed-sized cylindrical column, (ii) measuring the contact area of the adhesive pads and subarticular tubercles coming into contact when climbing differently-sized cylindrical tubes, and (iii) by comparing the maximum friction and adhesion forces generated by individual pads and tubercles in restrained animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="?"><plain>We ask the following questions: do tree frogs use clamping forces to climb cylindrical structures or do they rely solely on tangential friction forces to propel themselves upwards (similar to climbing a flat surface)? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="?"><plain>Is their clamping grip affected by surface roughness? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="?"><plain>How much do the subarticular tubercles come in contact with the surface when digits are wrapped around an object and do they aid the friction forces generated by the pads? </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To measure ground reaction forces of frogs climbing a cylindrical column, 24 separate custom-built three-dimensional force transducers (similar to [18]) were arranged around the front half of an octagonally shaped tube (figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The size of the tube was limited to a minimum diameter of 79 mm for the size of the component force transducers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The individual force transducer platforms (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>30 × 30 mm each) were arranged in four columns and six rows, where two columns were placed on the left-hand sides of the octagon and two on the right-hand sides with one row in the middle left blank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This way the forces involved in a clamping grip of opposing limbs can be obtained (see also electronic supplementary material, video S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We defined the x-axis as the left–right axis of each force transducer which would resolve the lateral force component (Fx) of a climbing frog. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The y-axis was defined along the direction of gravity and would resolve the fore–aft components of a climbing frog. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The z-axis was defined as the normal component, perpendicular to the surface of each transducer (Fz) and would resolve the tensile and compressive forces. Figure 1.Set-up for measuring ground reaction forces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>An array of 24 three-dimensional force transducers was arranged in four columns and six rows (with one blank column in the centre) to make up half of an octagon (inscribing circle with r = 36 mm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The normal force component (Fz) along the z-axis is pointing from the centre of each sensor to the centre of the column with the tangential force (Fx) perpendicular to it (x-axis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The y-axis was defined along the direction of gravity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Inset: owing to the arrangement of the sensors at 45° to each other, an oblique pull by the frog on the sensor can have a normal force component; therefore, only if Fz &gt; Fx, can a ‘true’ clamping force be distinguished. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>As the hindlimbs of a vertically upwards climbing animal usually push into the surface (compressive normal forces) in order to compensate for the pivoting torque around the centre of gravity, these normal forces would mask the clamping forces; we therefore focused our force analysis on the forelimbs only. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>However, as the sensors were arranged around the sides of an octagon, i.e. in a 45° angle towards each other, positive normal force could also occur when a frog pulled on a sensor in an oblique way (figure 1 inset). ‘True’ clamping forces thus are only visible when the (compressive) normal forces are greater in magnitude than the lateral forces. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In addition to the force measurements, climbing animals were filmed using three synchronized high-speed video cameras filming the position of the animal from two sides (2 × Basler A602f, 695 × 465 pixels, triggered at 50 Hz) and one top view (Olympus i-Speed 3, 1280 × 1024 pixels, triggered at 100 Hz). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>From the different camera perspectives, we extracted the positions of the limbs placed on the corresponding force sensors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To examine the effect of gripping force (which is dominated by compressive normal force and friction) versus attachment force (tensile normal force), we used different ‘coatings’ on the force transducer platform tiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We used the bare platforms as a smooth surface, and the platform segments covered with a rough sandpaper (P320 from 3M, Minnesota, USA; average particle diameter 46.2 μm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Adhesive pads adhere well to smooth surfaces [16,19] but are often challenged on rough surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Rough surfaces thus may promote larger compressive forces. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The anti-adhesive nature of the rough sandpaper substrate was tested by challenging the frogs to stay attached to a flat, platform covered with the sandpaper which could be tilted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>By slowly rotating the platform from a horizontal into a vertical position at approx 16 ± 9 deg s−1 (mean ± s.d.; N = 17) frogs eventually slipped and detached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In only two out of 17 trials, did frogs manage to stay attached until the board reached a vertical position (90°). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In all other cases, frogs detached on reaching an angle of 75 ± 6° (mean ± s.d.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the attachment of the frogs to a flat smooth vertical surface, where frogs adhered without any problems. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We allowed the frogs to climb a flat sheet and two cylindrical tubes (44 mm and 120 mm diameter; see also images in figure 3) illuminated with arrays of small LEDs positioned on the top and bottom of the sheet/tubes, so that the light would be directed inwards into the Perspex material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>This technique, developed from a ‘cat walk’ [20], has been used before on climbing frogs [15,16], revealing high contrast images of the bright body parts in contact against a dark background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>For the cylindrical tubes, we used three synchronized high-speed video cameras (details see above) arranged in a triangular fashion around the tube in order to maximize the chance of seeing the frog's limbs centred in one view, whereas for the flat substrate a single high-speed camera was sufficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>To minimize distortion effects of the curved surface, we selected frames where the limb of concern was placed near the centre of the tube. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Any cylinder substantially smaller in diameter would have not allowed us to measure the contact area accurately enough, due, in part, to optical distortions and in part to digits masking the camera's view of the area of contact. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We restrained the frog with both hands and separated individual toes for probing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To minimize movements of the frog or operator, the dorsal side of the toe was attached carefully to a soft tube attached to a vacuum pump which held the exposed toe fixed in one position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The tube with the arrested toe pad was then positioned with help of a manual micro-manipulator underneath a two-axis force transducer (noise level in both axes ≈0.5 mN; bending stiffness in both axes approx. 108 N m−1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>By moving the force transducer with a motorized stage controlled through a customized LabView program, we performed two sets of measurements: (i) a lateral movement to measure friction (travel of 6 mm in 10 s with a preload of 2 mN) in the proximal and distal direction of the pad to test for directionality and (ii) three detachment movements (2 mm in 10 s) to measure adhesion, namely after an initial attachment of the pad and after the two lateral movements. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>As tree frogs use adhesive pads to climb even flat surfaces, it was unclear to what extent clamping forces would be used on the force measurement array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, our force platform did not allow us to distinguish in all cases between ‘true’ adducting forces and normal forces resulting from an oblique pull. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>However, the cases where normal forces were greater than the lateral forces showed a difference between the two substrates tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In addition, the overall normal forces (i.e. all cases) increased significantly when frogs struggled to attach to non-adhesive surfaces, whereas the lateral forces did not change which points towards a clamping grip. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>By clasping around the object and creating adducting forces, the friction between the limb skin surface and the substrate can increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The clamping grip we describe here was caused by opposing limbs and not within a hand, foot or even tail as described for many other arboreal animals using prehensile grips [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>However, in few instances, the frogs placed their feet such that neighbouring toes touched separate platforms and thus also revealed gripping forces within individual feet (see also electronic supplementary material, video S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>On both surfaces (smooth and rough) frogs generated large shear forces by positioning their fore limbs around the structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Against a flat platform, vertically climbing animals usually pull on the surface with their forelimbs (tensile normal forces) and push into the surface with their hind limbs (compressive normal forces) in order to compensate the pitching moment of their body (for frogs: [2]; for cockroaches: [26] and for geckos: [27]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>On our octagonal platform, the tensile normal forces of the forelimbs were replaced by the lateral forces as the frogs' arms reached far enough around the structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The friction between two hard bodies is governed by Amontons' friction law whereby the friction is proportional to the compressive (loading) force. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Although adhesive pads in frogs are very soft and thus only need very little loading force for good attachment, an increase in compressive force helps friction when adhesion is compromised on a non-adhesive surface. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study testing the grasping forces of climbing animals using adhesive pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>An earlier study by Manzano et al. [13] investigated the grasping force in frogs by pulling away a frog from a horizontally placed dowel, which does not show the clasping forces directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Most other studies looked at grasping forces of animals attaching to flat surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>For example, Han et al. [28] measured the left–right grasping forces of locusts grasping on to a flat substrate covered in different grades of rough sandpaper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The authors showed that the grasping forces increased with increasing slope angle, highlighting how the adduction forces keep the claws engaged. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a comparative study by Federle &amp; Brüning [29] on the climbing behaviour of closely related ant species (genus Crematogaster) showed that two species were able to climb the (narrow) slippery stems of their host plant (Macaranga) by not only interlocking their fine claws with the waxy layer but by stretching their limbs further outwards and thus using adduction forces. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>When frogs climbed our transparent surfaces, in all cases, the adhesive pads came into contact with the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, on curved surfaces, the frogs additionally recruited subarticular tubercles for an increased contact area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Frogs increased the contact area to the substrate further by employing ventral skin from other parts of their body too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Not only did they often use the ventral skin on their toes, lying between the pads and tubercles but sometimes even large parts of the thighs and belly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>However, it was evident from a few cases in our study and other earlier studies [16,30], that frogs only use belly and thigh skin in contact when resting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>During locomotion, only the feet are in contact with the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>We believe that the recruitment of the tubercles is a crucial part when climbing curved surfaces as they can presumably withstand a larger amount of friction (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, it is worth mentioning that apart from the pads and tubercles, other ventral skin areas of the feet also bear nanopillars which are thought to promote friction forces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>As we found in our study, these areas also came into contact with the surface during climbing of the cylinders. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The possible function of these tubercles as friction pads was mentioned by Noble &amp; Jaeckle [31] and Ernst [32] and the pads' morphology was investigated in greater detail by Drotlef et al. [33]; however, this study is the first to address the role of tubercles for climbing curved surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Herrel et al. [12] showed that monkey tree frogs (genusPhyllomedusa) managed to walk on even narrower (e.g. 1 mm and 4 mm diameters), horizontally placed tubes by wrapping individual digits around the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The fact that the frog's centre of mass needs to be balanced above the substrate suggests that the skin on the digits has to compensate for potentially strong torques around a cylindrical substrate, and highlights the need for friction pads. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The force measurements on individual pads and tubercles in restrained frogs showed that tubercles exhibited higher frictional stresses than pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This finding supports our idea that tubercles are used to enhance a friction grip. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>However, tubercles also showed larger adhesive stresses, which was surprising given that the pads are usually the primary attachment devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>We believe that the pads still perform this role as main attachment devices as they are the only structures coming into contact when the frog is climbing a flat vertical surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Individual contact area of tubercles are about five times smaller than the average pad area (measured during our pull-off experiments), but the sum of all tubercles in contact on curved surfaces is very close to the area of the pads (figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe that tubercles are far more important than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Our results showed only weak evidence for directionality on the pads or tubercles for friction and a small but significant increase in adhesion after a pull. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Previous research [30,34] has shown a dramatic change in contact area between a pull and push for the pads which we saw in some of our trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>We believe that our method of holding the toe and pad/tubercle firmly in place prevented the buckling of the structure during a push and thus a peeling of the pad from the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>We believe that had we measured pads and tubercles in a ‘footloose’ condition (i.e. not immobilized), similar to the study of Bullock et al. [34] on insects, adhesive pads would have been more prone to buckling owing to their larger size (more liquid filled) and distal location on the toe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, there is no obvious evidence from the topological structures of the pads or tubercles themselves which would point towards a directionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, a recent study by Nakano &amp; Saino [35] showed that pads bear internal tonofilaments which are angled proximally and may cause directionality as proposed by previous studies [36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>We furthermore predict that tubercles would be stiffer than pads, as indicated from their smaller size and shallower channels surrounding the cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The chances of buckling and collapsing of the structures are less likely when the structures are subject to a pull and confirms the reorientating behaviour of frogs to climb up or down a vertical surface with their heads pointing upwards [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>When doing so, even their hindlimbs are rotated so that all toes are orientated more or less along the gravity vector and are in pulling orientation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>A similar behaviour was recorded for geckos [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In contrast, insects might be more restrained in this regard as only their first leg joint at the trochanter is able to rotate the leg in the dorsal–ventral plane; as a consequence, their fore legs tend to point towards the front, whereas the hindlegs point towards the back. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown the use of additional friction pads when insects have to use their legs for pushing [39–41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>As these frictional pads are located more proximal on the digit or the tarsus, they are less prone to buckling when the leg is subject to a pushing force and thus can maintain (or even increase) the contact area under a pushing load [42]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated how tree frogs using adhesive pads for climbing smooth surfaces can cope with curved and anti-adhesive substrates by applying clamping grips. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Such grips use not just the adhesive pads found on the distal ends of each digit but also recruit additional adhesive structures located proximally to the adhesive pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Compared with the adhesive pads, subarticular pads can withstand higher friction forces in potentially different directions and are thus ideal for climbing narrow substrates like twigs or branches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Understanding how animals with adhesive pads use gripping forces to aid their climbing will provide insights that will be beneficial for the development of climbing robots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The use of gripping forces on curved structures increases climbing efficiency and reduces the dependence on specialized adhesive structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In addition, because adhesive structures often depend on shear and loading forces for effective function, gripping forces will actually aid the adhesive forces (e.g. in geckos [43] or artificial mimics [44,45]). </plain></SENT>
