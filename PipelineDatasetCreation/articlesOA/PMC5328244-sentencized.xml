<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DNA replication commences approximately halfway through the intracellular development following invasion and parasite growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The schizont stage is associated with multiple rounds of DNA replication and nuclear division without cytokinesis resulting in a multinucleated cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nuclei divide asynchronously through schizogony, with only the final round of DNA replication and segregation being synchronous and coordinated with daughter cell assembly2,3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the control mechanisms for this divergent mode of replication are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we show that the Plasmodium-specific kinase PfCRK4 is a key cell cycle regulator that orchestrates the multiple rounds of DNA replication throughout schizogony in P. falciparum. PfCRK4 depletion led to a complete block in nuclear division and profoundly inhibited DNA replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling identified a set of PfCRK4-regulated phosphoproteins with greatest functional similarity to CDK2 substrates, particularly proteins involved in origin of replication firing. PfCRK4 was required for the initial and subsequent rounds of DNA replication during schizogony, and in addition was essential for development in the mosquito vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results identified an essential S phase promoting factor of the unconventional P. falciparum cell cycle. PfCRK4 is required for both a prolonged period of the intraerythrocytic blood-stage of malaria infection, as well as for transmission, revealing a broad window for PfCRK4-targeted chemotherapeutics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the synchronous nuclear division observed in other multinucleated cells, such as the early drosophila embryo4, P. falciparum nuclei divide asynchronously during the blood-stage despite sharing the same cytoplasm2,3, suggesting that cell cycle progression is not governed by diffusible cytoplasmic factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Knockout screens have identified non-essential blood-stage Plasmodium kinases, and suggested those that could be essential for the regulation of schizogony5,6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms regulating this diverged mode of replication are largely unknown yet the recent development of conditional gene expression technologies now allows to unequivocally demonstrate gene essentiality in P. falciparum7–9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To directly identify critical regulators of schizogony and simultaneously determine protein function, we adopted the destabilization domain (DD) conditional knockdown approach7,10,11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We generated endogenous DD fusions of 23 schizont-stage kinases in the P. falciparum D10 strain and screened for vulnerability to destabilization by DD (Fig. 1a, b, Supplementary Information Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Using this approach, we found that two kinases, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) and the cdc2-related protein kinase 4 (PfCRK4), had profound proliferation defects in absence of Shield-1 and showed dose-dependency (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Information Fig. 1b, c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Chemical inhibition of PfPKG has previously established its essential role in parasite egress from erythrocytes at the end of schizogony12,13, now confirmed by conditional destabilization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As previously observed14,15, we found little correlation between the level of protein knockdown and the ability to reveal essentiality of other kinases previously thought to be essential6 using the DD approach (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Information Fig. 1d, 9c, d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This could be due to insufficient destabilization of these proteins or because they are required at inherently different levels for asexual proliferation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The biological function of PfCRK4 is unknown and we confirmed its essentiality in a different parental line, P. falciparum P2G1216, which also produces gametocytes (Supplementary Information Fig. 2). PfCRK4 is a member of an Apicomplexa-specific kinase subfamily related to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (Supplementary Information Fig. 3, Supplementary Data table 1)17,18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In many organisms CDKs in complex with cyclins regulate key steps of the cell cycle and other cellular functions19,20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Compared to human CDK2, the kinase domain of PfCRK4 possesses multiple sequence inserts of unknown function (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Information Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>PfCRK4 is localized to the nucleus of late trophozoites and schizonts, with the signal greatly diminished in segmented schizonts that had undergone cytokinesis (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Following conditional depletion of PfCRK4 (Fig. 1d) parasites arrested at the trophozoite-to-schizont transition (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>At ≥40 hours post invasion (hpi), parasites [+] Shield-1 (i.e., wild type PfCRK4 levels) segmented into daughter cells, containing nuclei and rhoptries (apical organelles required for merozoite invasion), which are characteristic of mature schizonts (Fig. 2d, top). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In contrast, parasites cultured [−] Shield-1 (i.e., PfCRK4 is depleted) showed no nuclear division or apical organelle biogenesis (Fig. 2d, bottom, Supplementary Information Fig. 5a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Analysis of nuclei stained with fluorescent DNA-specific dyes confirmed that the nuclei did not divide and revealed a substantially distorted nuclear morphology (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Information Fig. 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Hemispindle structures were evident in PfCRK4-depleted cells (Fig. 2f; Supplementary Information Fig. 5c, d); however, they were greatly enlarged relative to spindles in wild type parasites and might account for the nuclear distortion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Concordantly, division of the centriolar plaque3,21, the parasite’s microtubule organizing centre, was diminished (Fig. 2g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To ascertain whether PfCRK4 affects DNA replication, we quantified the parasite’s DNA content by flow cytometry22,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While in wild type parasites DNA replication commences at 29–32 hpi, i.e., parasites with C-values &gt;1 appear, we found DNA replication to be profoundly inhibited in PfCRK4-depleted parasites (Fig. 2h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the development of the mitochondria and apicoplast organelles was unaffected following depletion of PfCRK4 (Supplementary Information Fig. 5e, f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The PfCRK4-dependent block was completely reversible up to 38 hpi by addition of Shield-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, reversion at 48 hpi led to very poor recovery (Fig. 2i), identifying a window within which PfCRK4 depletion is cytostatic before becoming cytotoxic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To elucidate processes regulated by PfCRK4, we assessed changes in the phosphoproteome of PfCRK4-depleted parasites at two time points (Fig. 3a): at 29 hpi, when PfCRK4 is already expressed at the onset of DNA replication (Fig. 2b, h), and also at 37 hpi, where in wild type parasites DNA replication is evident and when the PfCRK4-dependent arrest was still reversible (Fig. 2h, i) (Supplementary Information Fig. 6; Supplementary Data table 2–5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Large changes occur in the phosphoproteome at 29 hpi indicating that PfCRK4 is active when the first round of DNA replication commences (Fig. 2h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We used k-means clustering to identify the phosphosites most affected by the PfCRK4 depletion, which showed a reduction of about 2-fold (Supplementary Information Fig. 6b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Applying a threshold based on a ≥2-fold decrease in phosphorylation and p-values &lt;0.05, we identified 220 proteins (80 from 29 hpi, 215 from 37 hpi with 75 proteins shared), suggesting that these belong to a PfCRK4-regulated set of phosphoproteins (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed differential phosphorylation of histone H3 (serine 28) in a different genetic background (Supplementary Information Fig. 6c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The most enriched phosphorylation motif within these proteins was a previously undescribed SΦxK motif (Φ, hydrophobic; x, any amino acid), with S being phosphorylated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The canonical CDK motif S/TP24,25, with S or T phosphorylated, was also enriched (Supplementary Information Fig. 6d, e). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>To examine the functional significance of the PfCRK4-regulated set of proteins, we used gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The most enriched biological process GO term was ‘DNA replication’, and ‘nucleus’ was the most enriched cellular component GO term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, six of the seven identifiable P. falciparum homologues (or subunits thereof) of the 16 Saccharomyces cerevisiae factors required for origin licensing and firing in vitro26 showed reduced phosphorylation in PfCRK4 depleted parasites (Fig. 3c, box; Supplementary Information Fig. 6f, Supplementary Data table 3, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>GO terms of proteins with a ≥2-fold increase in phosphorylation (p-value &lt;0.05) were enriched for biosynthetic and intracellular transport processes at 37 hpi, perhaps indicating secondary effects; however, no statistically significant enrichment was observed at 29 hpi (Supplementary Information Fig. 6g). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We next compared the GO terms of the PfCRK4-regulated set with GO terms of other available kinase substrate sets–one S. cerevisiae kinase27 and 19 human kinases28 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>)–each with ≥30 confirmed substrates (Fig. 3d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The substrate set of human CDK2, a major S phase promoting factor, showed the highest percentage of shared annotations, suggesting that PfCRK4 acts in a related fashion to promote S phase in P. falciparum. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>PfCRK4 expression increases through schizogony (Fig. 2b) and its transcripts peak the latest of all putative Plasmodium CDK-like kinases29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that PfCRK4 is crucial for all rounds of DNA replication seen in schizogony. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>When we depleted PfCRK4 at points later in schizogony, we detected no further increase in DNA content (Fig. 4a), premature termination of nuclear division (Fig. 4b), and parasites failed to proliferate (Fig. 4c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Thus demonstrating that PfCRK4 function is critical throughout schizogony. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To determine a role for PfCRK4 in other life cycle stages, we used the P2G12-PfCRK4-HA-DD line that produces high levels of gametocytes to analyse PfCRK4 function during parasite transmission to the Anopheles gambiae mosquito vector. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>While we detected nuclear expression of PfCRK4 in gametocytes (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Information Fig. 7a), depletion during the latter portion of gametocyte development (i.e. from day 6 to 16 post-induction) had no effect on gametocytemia nor on the male-to-female gametocyte ratio (Supplementary Information Table 1). PfCRK4 depletion also did not impair exflagellation (Supplementary Information Fig. 7b, c, d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We observed a reduced PfCRK4 signal in ookinetes (Supplementary Information Fig. 7e), and the numbers of oocysts on An. gambiae female midguts was greatly diminished upon PfCRK4 depletion (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Information Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Oocysts derived from gametocyte cultures in the presence of PfCRK4 showed multiple nuclei, well-expanded organelles, and a well-developed capsule (Fig. 4f, top). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In contrast, infections with PfCRK4-depleted gametocytes resulted in necrotic parasites reminiscent of dead ookinetes, the motile zygote of Plasmodium parasites (Fig. 4f, bottom; Supplementary Information Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This indicates that PfCRK4 is required at some point during ookinete formation and early oocyst development, and likely plays a role during DNA replication in zygotes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence that PfCRK4 is an essential protein kinase promoting S phase through the initiation of multiple rounds of DNA replication during schizogony. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>While phosphorylation is likely important for the regulation of PfCRK4 (Supplementary Information Fig. 3b, 4a), a potential cyclin-dependence is in question as the cyclin binding domain is poorly conserved (Supplementary Information Fig. 4a)17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, homologues of Group I cyclins are not found in the Plasmodium genome, including cyclin E, which is critical for G1 to S transition in other systems30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Interventions targeting PfCRK4 function would be efficacious throughout the extended period of schizogony in the clinically relevant blood-stage, as well as at the transmission stages, which taken together are attractive features for future drug development. </plain></SENT>
