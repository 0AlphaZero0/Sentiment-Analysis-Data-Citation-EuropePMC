<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It constitutes ~6% of all cancers detected among children younger than 15 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of Wilms’ tumor varies geographically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The occurrence rate of Wilms’ tumor is ~1/8,000 children, with 400–650 new cases annually, in the USA1,2 and ~1/10,000 children in Western populations.3 Wilms’ tumor is also one of the most common renal tumors in children in China but less prevalent than that in Western countries, with an incidence rate of ~3.3 per million.4 Up to 2% of Wilms’ tumor cases are familial, with a known causal genetic lesion.5 No more than 5% of cases can be attributed to known causes, and the genetic basis underlying most Wilms’ tumors remains largely unknown.6,7 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The human TP53 gene, encoding a 53 kDa protein (p53), is located on chromosome 17p13.1. TP53 gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers.8 The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene, playing an important role in the maintenance of DNA integrity, cell cycle control, and apoptosis.9–11 According to dbSNP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP</ext-link>), at least 1,462 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the TP53 gene so far, supporting its highly polymorphic nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Among them, the most commonly reported SNP is a non-synonymous Arg72Pro (rs1042522 C.G) polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is located in the exon 4 of the TP53 gene and can lead to the replacement of arginine (Arg) with proline (Pro) at codon 72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This polymorphism is able to alter the primary structures as well as biochemical functions of the p53 protein.12–14 It has been reported that the Arg72 form of p53 is more effective in inducing apoptosis and protecting cells from malignant transformation than the Pro72 variant.12,15 Numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the association between this polymorphism and cancer susceptibility.16–20 However, very few studies have investigated its association with Wilms’ tumor susceptibility and clinical outcomes until now.21,22 In light of the important tumor-suppressing role of TP53 gene, we investigated the association between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor susceptibility in the current hospital-based case–control study with 145 cases and 531 cancer-free controls. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the current hospital-based case–control study with 145 cases and 531 unrelated cancer-free controls, we did not observe any significant association between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor susceptibility among Southern Chinese children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that the carriers of CG/GG genotypes, if 18 months old or younger, had a significantly increased Wilms’ tumor risk compared with counterparts carrying wild-type CC genotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The TP53 gene (gene ID: 7157) is also known as P53 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>It encodes a p53 tumor suppressor protein that contains DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and oligomerization domains.32,33 The p53 protein can regulate the expression of target genes in response to diverse cellular stresses, thereby inducing DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, metabolism changes, apoptosis, and cellular senescence accordingly.9–11,34 The p53 protein has been recognized as the guardian of human cells against cancer.9,35 However, this gene is highly mutated, and mutations in the TP53 gene have been implicated in the various types of cancer in human beings.36 Apart from the predisposition to mutations, TP53 is also highly polymorphic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A great number of SNPs has been identified in the TP53 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Several TP53 gene SNPs have been shown to confer cancer susceptibility, such as the rs78378222 A&gt;C polymorphism discovered by whole-genome sequencing in 2011. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>We recently performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association between TP53 gene rs78378222 A&gt;C and overall cancer risk.37 Evidence from 34 studies including 36,599 cases and 91,272 controls confirmed that this polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased overall cancer risk.37 The TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism is the most extensively investigated variant among the known TP53 gene susceptibility loci, which was first reported by Matlashewski et al.38 Intriguingly, the two alleles of this nonsynonymous polymorphism differ in the capacity of inducing target gene transcription, consequentially modifying cancer susceptibility differentially.13,39,40 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As so far, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the association between this polymorphism and cancer susceptibility.16–20 Klug et al16 carried out a meta-analysis by including a total of 49 studies with 7,946 cases and 7,888 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>They found that the TP53 gene Arg72-Pro polymorphism was not associated with cervical cancer risk when the analyses were restricted to methodologically sound studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Dahabreh et al17 did not find any significant association between TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and colorectal cancer with evidence from 23 studies including 6,514 cases and 9,334 controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Xu et al18 combined 15 publications and found that the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism was associated with a significantly increased bladder cancer risk among Asians but not among Caucasians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Dahabreh et al19 carried out a meta-analysis involving breast cancer (68 studies), lung cancer (42), colorectal cancer (26), ovarian cancer (16), and endometrial cancer (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>They found that the association with the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism only existed among studies using tumor tissue as the source of genotyping material for cases (22 studies) but not among studies using other sources of genotyping material (eg, blood). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>However, it should be noted that the use of tumor tissue as the source of genotyping material for cases can lead to bias in the association studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In the study by Tian et al20 with 14 investigations, including 2,506 cases and 4,386 controls, no association was observed between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and leukemia risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>However, there is lack of evidence of the association between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor risk to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Only one case–control study has been performed to examine the association of this polymorphism with Wilms’ tumor risk22 using controls from other studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In the study with 46 cases and 300 controls, Andrade et al22 found that carriers of the rs1042522 C allele may associate with an increased Wilms’ tumor risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>In our present study, we failed to find any significant association between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor risk, which was similar to most previous investigations in other types of cancer.16,17,20 Failure to find any significant association between the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor risk may be ascribed to the weak effect of low-penetrant SNPs, ethnicity difference, as well as the limited sample size in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>We found that the TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism may contribute to a weak effect for Wilms’ tumor risk in Chinese children aged 18 months and younger, which may be ascribed to the fact that young children may be more genetic susceptible to Wilms’ tumor risk; besides, it may be a chance finding for the sample size, which is relatively small. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Although this is the first investigation to assess the association between TP53 gene Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor risk in Chinese children, our results should be interpreted with cautious for several limitations should be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>First, due to the low occurrence rate of Wilms’ tumor, only 145 cases were included in this study, which may have limited statistical power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Second, because of the nature of retrospective study design, we were only able to collect age, gender, ethnicity, and geographical factors for cases and controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as dietary intake and parental environment exposures, were not available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Third, we just performed a case–control designed study to investigate the association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and Wilms’ tumor risk and we did not explore the potential mechanisms in cell lines for this polymorphism, which need to be investigated in future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Finally, we included only the most frequently investigated Arg72Pro polymorphism, and other TP53 gene polymorphisms (such as rs78378222 A.C) were not examined in this study. </plain></SENT>
