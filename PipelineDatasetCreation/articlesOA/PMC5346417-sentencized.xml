<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The regulation of blood pressure (BP) is multifactorial reflecting genetic susceptibility, in utero environment and external factors such as obesity and salt intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In keeping with Arthur Guyton’s hypothesis, the kidney plays a key role in blood pressure control [2] and data from clinical studies; physiology and genetics have shown that hypertension is driven by a failure of the kidney to excrete excess salt at normal levels of blood pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There is a number of rare Mendelian blood pressure syndromes (Fig. 1), which have shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in dysregulated ion transport in the distal kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One in particular is Familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt), a monogenic form of hypertension characterised by high blood pressure, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and hypercalciuria [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical signs of FHHt are treated by low doses of thiazide diuretics [4], and it mirrors to an extent Gitelman syndrome [5] which features the inverse phenotype of hypotension, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, it is worth emphasising that FHHt patients are typically normomagnesemic and Gitelman patients are usually normotensive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Gitelman syndrome is caused by loss of function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive Na/Cl cotransporter (NCC), but FHHt patients do not have mutations in the SCL12A3 locus encoding NCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Instead, mutations have been identified in genes that have revealed a key signalling pathway that regulates NCC and several other key transporters and ion channels in the kidney that are critical for BP regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This is the WNK kinase signalling pathway that is the subject of this review.Fig. 1Diagram of the human nephron showing the locations where the main Mendelian syndromes affecting BP operate and the molecular mechanisms involved. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The WNK kinases are a family of four evolutionarily conserved serine–threonine kinases (WNK1, WNK2, WNK3 and WNK4) that share &gt;85% homology over their kinase domains and form a distinct branch of the phylogenetic tree of the human kinome (Fig. 2) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, unlike other kinases they use a catalytic Lys residue downstream from the usual site deep in the kinase core (kinase subdomain I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Hence, the term WNK (With No Lys (K)) referring to the absence of the usual N-terminal canonical kinase Lys residue for docking ATP and phosphoryl transfer (e.g. Lys72 in Protein Kinase A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This shift to a more superficial and distal glycine-rich loop for their canonical Lys has allowed WNKs to adapt their function and roles by acquiring an important sensitivity to chloride [7] (see “Intracellular Cl− modulates activity of WNK kinases”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Overlap of the ‘chloride sensor’ in WNKs with the proximal canonical Lys residue explains the use of a distal Lys residue in the WNKs for their kinase activity (e.g. Lys233 in WNK1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This unique feature has lead to changes to WNK tertiary structure recently exploited in the development of a highly WNK-selective inhibitor (see “WNK/SPAK/OSR as a druggable signalling pathway”).Fig. 2Zoomed section of the human kinome to show the close evolutionary proximity of WNKs and OSR1/SAPKFrom reference [6] with permission </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Another key property of the WNK kinases directly related to their ‘chloride sensor’ behaviour is inactive and active forms; with phosphorylation stabilising the active state [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Chloride anions inhibit this autophosphorylation, which explains how WNK kinase activity can respond to changes in intracellular chloride concentration [Cl−] and tonicity [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This low Cl− activation occurs rapidly (in &lt;0.5 min) and involves phosphorylation of Ser382 in the T-loop of WNK1, which is conserved across all the WNKs [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The discovery of the ‘chloride sensor’ is recent, but follows long-standing speculation about the existence of a chloride-sensing regulatory kinase to explain the behaviour of Na+ and K+ cation cotransporters (NKCCs) in determining [Cl−] [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The need for this level of control reflects the importance of intracellular chloride in regulating cell volume itself, neuronal function and cell growth [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Recent crystallographic data has identified an LGL motif dubbed the ‘chloride sensor’ in WNK1 that confers chloride sensitivity by blocking the autophosphorylation of the T-loop [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This discovery of the chloride-sensing capacity of the WNKs has confirmed them as the ‘missing-link’ kinase in chloride regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It seems likely that WNK1 played a pivotal evolutionary role in controlling cell volume in single cells, although the only unicellular organism with a WNK1 orthologue identified so far is the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei (GenBank: KFX50394.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The development of closed cardiovascular systems in larger complex metazoan organisms may have necessitated the refinement of its volume regulatory function with gene duplication deriving later WNKs (WNK2–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>What is clear is that the WNKs now have a very diverse biology and a central role in the control of blood pressure. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Four different genes have been implicated in FHHt (Table 1; Fig. 1) and two of them encode for WNK kinases: WNK1 and WNK4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The WNK1 sequence was first identified in 2000 from a rat brain cDNA library [13], but its function was unclear until intronic mutations were identified in the WNK1 gene in human pedigrees segregating the FHHt phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These mutations were associated with elevated levels of WNK1 messenger RNA in peripheral monocytes from the affected patients and further missense mutations were identified in the orthologous WNK4 gene of other unrelated pedigrees [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The other two FHHt genes, CUL3 (Cullin3) and KLHL3 (Kelch-like 3), which were discovered through a whole exome sequencing strategy, regulate WNK kinase levels in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Together Cullin3 and KLHL3 form a Cullin-RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets WNK kinases for ubiquitination to promote their proteasomal degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Cullin3 is a scaffold protein that coordinates the enzymatic and substrate binding activities of the ubiquitin E3 ligase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>KLHL3 is the substrate receptor protein that recruits WNKs to the E3 ligase complex to present them for ubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Once ubiquitinated, WNKs are degraded by the 26S proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Mutations in CUL3 cause a dominantly inherited severe form of FHHt [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that these mutations may increase ubiquitination and degradation of KLHL3, preventing WNK recruitment to the ligase complex, and thus indirectly abolishing WNK4 degradation [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, other work has suggested that the mutations affect the molecular flexibility of Cullin3 and lead to its auto-degradation by auto-ubiquitination, without affecting KLHL3 levels [16] (“CUL3-KLHL3 as upstream regulators of WNK kinases”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In contrast to CUL3 mutations, mutations in KLHL3 can result in either a dominant or recessive form of FHHt [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>KLHL3 interacts directly with the CUL3 substrate (WNK in this case) and some recessive KLHL3 mutations directly inhibit this interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This prevents WNK ubiquitination and degradation further supporting the notion that elevated WNK levels lead to hypertension [17].Table 1FHHt mutations and their effects on the affected genesGeneEffectResultEffect on the encoded proteinReferences WNK1 Deletion of intron I↑ WNK1 expression↑ L-WNK1 expression[14, 25] WNK4 Missense mutation in the acidic motif↑ WNK4 expression due to disruption in the KLHL3 recognition site↑ WNK4[14, 15, 17, 81] WNK4 R1185C mutation in the C-terminal domainDisrupts a regulatory mechanism involving calmodulin binding and SGK1 phosphorylation sitesUnknown[26, 27] KLHL3 Missense mutations in the BTB or BACK domainDisruption of the CUL3–KLHL3 interaction↑ WNK1↑ WNK4↑ WNK3[15, 17, 18, 81, 82]Missense mutations in the Kelch propeller bladesDisruption of the substrate (WNK) binding↑ WNK1↑ WNK4↑ WNK3 CUL3 Exon 9 deletionIncreased KLHL3 ubiquitination and degradation↓KLHL3↑ WNK1↑ WNK4↑ WNK3[15, 17, 86]Altered CUL3 flexibility leading to CUL3 auto-degradation and prevention of WNK ubiquitination[16]↑ indicates increase, ↓ indicates decrease </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The association of mutations in the WNK kinases with FHHt suggested that an entirely novel pathway existed, connecting WNK kinases with renal electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The last 15 years has been spent unravelling the molecular basis and complexity of this pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>A crucial feature is the ability of WNK signalling to coordinate two competitive aldosterone-controlled processes: NaCl reabsorption (from the urine to the blood) and K+ secretion (from the blood to the urine) in the distal nephron to regulate blood pressure and maintain electrolyte homeostasis [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Work from groups in Yale and Oregon showed that this was achieved by WNKs regulating the phosphorylation and activities of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), including NCC (in the DCT, distal convoluted tubule), KCC4 and NKCC2 (in the TAL, thick ascending limb) [20–22] and the ROMK channel [23], and the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC in the distal tubule and collecting duct [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The FHHt mutations reported in WNK1 [14, 25] are large deletions of the first intron that result in an increased expression of WNK1 message, whereas those in WNK4 are missense mutations that are clustered in the highly conserved acidic motif [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To date, only one of the WNK4 mutations has been reported outside of the acid motif in the C-terminal domain [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of WNK proteins alters the quantitative effects that they have on distal ion transport in the kidney, and is the common molecular driver for the FHHt phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of the WNK kinases, a number of groups have focused on the regulation of NCC and other transporters by WNK proteins including WNK1 and WNK4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular signalling pathways used by WNKs, which regulate ion transport in the distal nephron of the kidney. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Renal ion transporters such as NCC and NKCC2 are driven by the favourable Na+ gradient established by primary active transport through the Na+,K+- ATPase (Na+- and K+-dependent adenosine triphosphatase). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>NCC, NKCC1 and NKCC2 are the Na+ driven Cl− importing transporters that contrast with a more recently discovered family of K+ driven Cl− exporting transporters (KCC1–4) [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>All these transporters are regulated by WNK kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>In most cell types, the intracellular Cl− concentration ([Cl−]i) is tightly regulated by influx of Cl− through NCCs and an efflux of Cl− via the KCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The [Cl−]i is crucial for core physiological processes, such as transepithelial solute and water transport, volume regulation and neuronal excitability in neurons [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Cell shrinkage or a decrease in intracellular ([Cl−]i), or both, triggers the phosphorylation of NCC, NKCCs and KCCs, which leads to the activation of NCC and NKCCs and inactivation of KCCs, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The converse is true when the [Cl−]i is high or when the cell swells, leading to a dephosphorylation of these two sets of transporters and inactivating NCCs, and activating KCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Thus, the same signals achieve a tight coordination of Cl− influx and efflux via the inverse regulation of Na+ and K+ driven Cl− transport by a common Cl−-sensitive kinase in the form of the WNKs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The fact that this efficient phospho-regulatory mechanism is highly conserved from worms to humans shows how important it is for cell function and survival [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of WNK activation, and their downstream targets </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>A combination of molecular genetics [14, 31, 32], physiology [19, 20, 33, 34] and biochemistry [35] has shown that the components of the signalling complex downstream of WNK kinases are serine–threonine protein kinases that share high sequence homology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The targets are SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related proline–alanine-rich protein kinase) and OSR1 (or OXSR1, oxidative stress responsive 1) that are closely related members of the STE-20 branch of the kinome (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The kinase domains of SPAK and OSR1 show around 89% homology, whereas at the whole protein level, the degree of homology is approximately 67%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>A major difference between SPAK and OSR1 is the presence of a proline- and alanine-rich region (PAPA box) in the N-terminal domain of SPAK which is upstream of the catalytic domain [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>There are three different isoforms of SPAK with the full-length isoform (FL-SPAK) being expressed ubiquitously with higher expression in the brain, heart, and testis [37, 38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>SPAK2, the second isoform, lacks the N-terminal PAPA box and a part of the kinase domain, and is also expressed ubiquitously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Kidney-specific SPAK (KS-SPAK) is the third isoform which is expressed mainly in the kidney, as the name suggests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies showed that the FL-SPAK co-localized with NCC at the DCT, whereas SPAK2 and KS-SPAK are more abundant in the TAL, the site of NKCC2 expression [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>WNKs phosphorylate and activate SPAK and OSR1, which in turn bring about the coordinated phosphorylation of NCC and NKCC2 in the DCT and TAL of the nephron, respectively (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SPAK/OSR1 kinases continue the phosphorylation cascade that connects the WNKs and the CCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Activation of SPAK and OSR1 takes place in an analogous manner to WNK autophosphorylation with WNKs phosphorylating a conserved Thr residue (SPAK Thr233, OSR1 Thr185; Fig. 3) within the SPAK/OSR1 catalytic T-loop motif [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The Ser383 is also phosphorylated in SPAK although its functional consequences are unclear [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in vitro assays have shown that mouse protein-25 (MO25), which functions as a scaffold, interacts with both SPAK and OSR1, and enhances their catalytic activities [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In addition to the catalytic domain, the SPAK/OSR1 have a conserved C-terminal domain (CCT) which is important for docking with the RFXV/I peptide motif in the N-terminus of CCCs such as NCC and NKCCs [9, 42] (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The CCT domain also binds to the RFXV/I peptide motif in WNK kinases bringing them into close proximity with SPAK and OSR1 to activate them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>This interaction between the CCT docking domain and WNK kinases plays a major role in blood pressure regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>OSR1 has been shown to have a highly conserved Leu residue that lies in the base of a deep hydrophobic pocket, and this forms the crucial hydrophobic contacts with the Phe residue of the RFXI motif [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this in a mouse model carrying a single point mutation (Leu502Ala), the interaction between the docking domain of SPAK and the RFXV motifs on its WNK activators or ion cotransporters is abolished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The mouse also showed reduced phosphorylation and levels of NCC/NKCC2, resulting in a ∼20 mmHg reduction in BP [44].Fig. 3The domain structure of SPAK and the phosphorylation target sites on NCC, NKCC1 and NKCC2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>OSR1 differs from SPAK in lacking the P/A rich (PAPA) domain </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The realization that both the kinase and the CCT domains are crucial for SPAK/OSR1 function suggested that they could serve as a potential drug targets to screen for novel antihypertensive compounds. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal tail of NCC has the minimum SPAK binding motif, RFXV/I which has a docking interaction with the C-terminal domains of SPAK/OSR1, which in turn phosphorylates NCC on three highly conserved residues, Thr46, Thr55, and Thr60 (human amino acid numbering; Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that human NCC can also be phosphorylated on its Ser91 residue during Cl− depletion by an as yet unidentified kinase [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of Ser71 (Ser73 in humans) is also altered in SPAK-deficient mice, suggesting that the kinase is essential for the phosphorylation of this site [46]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for the hypertension was studied in a transgenic mouse model [91], which showed increased RhoA and Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity in its aorta and an increased contractile state to its of vascular ex vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>RhoA protein (the ROCK GTPase regulator) is ubiquitinated and degraded in an analogous manner to WNKs except that the adaptor/substrate protein is not KLHL3 but the related adaptor protein RhoBTB1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Hence, the deletion mutation in Cullin3 would be predicted to alter the contractile state of blood vessels by reducing Cullin3-RING ligase activity causing secondary accumulation of RhoA (cf WNKs). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Araki et al. [92] attempted to produce knock-in mouse models expressing the exon 9 deleted protein by knocking in two CUL3 human mutations that affect splicing: G(−1)A/+ and 3T(−6)G/T(−6)G [92]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Neither of the models produced the expected CUL3Δ403–459 protein, presumably because of species differences in CUL3 splicing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Importantly, neither mouse showed an FHHt phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The authors reported that no truncated forms of CUL3 were detected in their mice, although close inspection of the published western blots (Fig. 4A; Ref [92]) suggests there were faint bands from a lower MW form. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>It is also likely that in FHHt patients with CUL3Δ403–459 there are very low tissue levels of the exon 9 deleted Cullin3 [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Structural modelling combined with biochemical verifications has also shown that the CUL3Δ403–459 mutation provides the Cullin3 protein with greater flexibility, which probably arises from the exon deletion splicing together two unstructured regions by removing three alpha helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>The greater flexibility impedes its scaffolding function, and prevents the CUL3Δ403–459-RING ubiquitin ligase complex from directing ubiquitin towards the bound substrates, and instead leads to increased ubiquitination of itself and Kelch3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In fact, in vivo studies indicate that the CUL3Δ403–459 auto-ubiquitinates itself first, as only relatively low amounts of CUL3Δ403–459 are detectable in tissue from the mouse model, while the levels of KLHL3 are unaffected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This auto-degradation of CUL3Δ403–459 could be a major cause for the associated phenotype in patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Data from in vitro studies [16] show detectable CUL3Δ403–459 in cells, but this protein is unable to ubiquitinate WNK kinases, suggesting that the exon 9 deletion in CUL3 is a loss of function mutation with respect to substrate ubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Yet the mutant CUL3Δ403–459 protein also failed to inhibit CUL3WT, so it may not exert a dominant-negative effect in vitro. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>The ENaC channels are normally cycled from the cell surface after ubiquitination by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Nedd4-2 and phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by SGK1 reduces its interaction with ENaC [105]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The WNKs are ancient proteins in evolutionary terms and were co-opted early on to control cell volume and intracellular chloride levels by forming signalling pathways with the related kinases, SPAK and OSR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>In transporting epithelium, including the kidney nephron itself these pathways are crucial to the regulation of ion fluxes by controlling the phosphorylation state of key membrane transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Hence, the WNK/SPAK/OSR1 signalling pathway directly influences blood pressure, as is clearly seen in rare monogenic blood pressure syndromes mutating single genes in the cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggests that WNK/SPAK/OSR1 signalling also operates outside of the kidney where it is able to regulate blood vessel tone directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Much is still to be learned about the physiology and pathophysiology of the WNKs and their signalling roles, but targeting the WNK/SPAK/NCC pathway holds considerable promise for the development of novel antihypertensive drugs and diuretics. </plain></SENT>
