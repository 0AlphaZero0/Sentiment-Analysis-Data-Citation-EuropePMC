Recent studies have demonstrated that LbpB plays a role in protecting the bacteria from cationic antimicrobial peptides due to large regions rich in anionic residues in the C-terminal lobe. Relative to its homolog, transferrin-binding protein B (TbpB), there currently is little evidence for its role in iron acquisition and relatively little structural and biophysical information on its interaction with Lf. In this study, a combination of crosslinking and deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry, information-driven computational docking, bio-layer interferometry, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to probe LbpB:hLf complexes. The formation of a 1:1 complex of iron-loaded Lf and LbpB involves an interaction between the Lf C-lobe and LbpB N-lobe, comparable to TbpB, consistent with a potential role in iron acquisition. The Lf N-lobe is also capable of binding to negatively charged regions of the LbpB C-lobe and possibly other sites such that a variety of higher order complexes are formed. Our results are consistent with LbpB serving dual roles focused primarily on iron acquisition when exposed to limited levels of iron-loaded Lf on the mucosal surface and effectively binding apo Lf when exposed to high levels at sites of inflammation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Bacteria responsible for important infections in humans and food production animals survive and proliferate within their host by &#x02018;hijacking&#x02019; iron from the host iron-binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin. The iron-hijacking process is mediated by a set of surface receptors that are specific for transferrin and lactoferrin from the host. In this study we focused on the receptors from important human pathogens responsible for meningitis and gonorrhea that are being targeted for development of vaccines, thus a detailed understanding of the structure and function of these proteins is needed to aid in vaccine design. Although there is detailed information available for the transferrin receptor proteins, currently information is lacking for the lactoferrin receptor proteins. This study focuses on a specific constituent of the lactoferrin receptor, lactoferrin binding protein B, that also serves to protect the bacteria against host defense mechanisms mediated by small peptides that kill microbes, including ones derived from host lactoferrin. We demonstrated that lactoferrin binding protein B has two different sites for binding lactoferrin, one associated with obtaining iron, the other related to protection against the antimicrobial peptides. This information enabled us to understand how this protein can effectively serve both roles and adapt to the local conditions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000032</institution-id><institution>Institute of Infection and Immunity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP138273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4029-3296</contrib-id><name><surname>Schryvers</surname><given-names>Anthony B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>298351-2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schriemer</surname><given-names>David C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 401975-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9883-6145</contrib-id><name><surname>Moraes</surname><given-names>Trevor F.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Grant MOP138273 from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html">http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/193.html</ext-link>) for ABS; a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC -<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.canada.ca/en/science-engineering-research.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/science-engineering-research.html</ext-link>) Discovery Grant 298351-2010 and the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.innovation.ca/">https://www.innovation.ca/</ext-link>) for DCS; a NSERC grant (RGPIN 401975-11) as well as with instrumentation and infrastructure support provided by Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Ontario Ministry of Education and Innovation for TFM.

This pathogen acquires iron&#x02013;an essential cofactor required for redox reactions in biological processes&#x02013;from the iron-loaded host glycoproteins, human transferrin (hTf) and human lactoferrin (hLf) using a set of specialized receptors with specific affinity for these host glycoproteins[<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The transferrin and lactoferrin receptors from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> are both comprised of an integral outer-membrane &#x02018;A&#x02019; protein (TbpA, LbpA) and a bi-lobed, lipidated &#x02018;B&#x02019; protein associated with the outer membrane (TbpB, LbpB). hTf is present in serum, within interstitial fluids and on mucosal surfaces, whereas hLf is localized to the mucosal surface, secretions, and sites of inflammation&#x02013;possibly providing different niches for the functionality of these receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which the transferrin receptor hijacks iron from hTf has been well studied from a structural and biophysical perspective.

Computational docking with the structure of the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> LbpB N-lobe predicted a binding interaction with the hLf N-lobe that contrasts the binding interface seen in the TbpB:hTf interaction. In contrast, Noinaj and Cornelisson et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] proposed a model in which LbpB binds to the C-lobe of hLf.

This function would not be compromised by the release of LbpB by NalP-mediated cleavage of the anchor peptide [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but NalP-mediated release would impact iron acquisition if LbpB played a similar role as TbpB in the process. These observations, coupled with the conflicting models and incomplete molecular picture of LbpB call for an in-depth characterization of this protein if we are to understand <italic>N</italic>. <italic>meningitidis</italic> pathogenicity. In this study, we employ the use of several biophysical and biochemical strategies in order to characterize the interaction between LbpB and lactoferrin.

Although the inter-lobe crosslink distance for LbpB is greater than the 30&#x000c5; limit, it is influenced by the positioning of the large negatively charged C-lobe loops, the least reliable portion of the model. Thus it is not unreasonable to propose that the loops extend upwards near the N-lobe &#x003b2;-handle to fit within the crosslink limits. The only other crosslink which deviated from the 30&#x000c5; limit was a crosslink between the LbpB-N barrel and anchor peptide.

In order to address the binding properties of the individual LbpB lobes, we generated several recombinant domains of LbpB to tease apart binding affinities between each domain of LbpB with hLf using biolayer interferometry (BLI).

The demonstration that positive selection in regions of Tf involved in binding to TbpA drove the evolution of transferrin responsible for the host specificity amongst these pathogens in primates [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], suggests that these same forces are responsible for the host specificity observed in pathogens from other vertebrate hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The ability to proliferate independently from other members of the upper respiratory or genitourinary microbial communities due to direct utilization of host Tf provides a selective advantage, to the extent that some bacteria have become dependent upon this mechanism for survival [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The ability to directly use host Tf also enables these bacteria to proliferate in serum and interstitial tissue fluids inside the body, one reason that these bacteria are also important pathogens in their respective hosts.</p><p>The bipartite Lf receptors were likely derived from ancestral Tf receptors after establishment of the mammalian lineage and have also been shown to be important for growth and survival on the mucosal surface [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the <italic>Neisseria</italic> LbpB has been shown to protect against cationic peptides derived from the Lf N-terminal region [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to be selectively released from the bacterial surface by NalP [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], raising questions about its role in the iron acquisition process. The fact that positive selection analysis of lactoferrin evolution in mammals primarily identified residues in the N-terminal lactoferricin and lactoferrampin regions [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], highlights the importance of the interaction of Lf with bacterial factors such as the Lf binding protein PspA [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and LbpB. Computational docking was used to develop two recent models for the LbpB:Lf interaction that proposed that the LbpB N-lobe bound to the Lf C-lobe [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or to the Lf N-lobe [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since both models were developed without any supporting experimental data, it was important to implement experimental studies to probe the LbpB-Lf interaction.</p><p>In this study the combined results from the biolayer interferometry binding studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006244.g003">Fig 3</xref>), crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HX-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006244.g005">Fig 5</xref>) clearly indicate that the LbpB N-lobe binds to the hLf C-lobe analogous to what has been demonstrated for the Tf-TbpB interaction [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], thus supporting its potential role in iron acquisition. Furthermore, our crosslinking studies support the orthogonal orientation of the N-lobe and C-lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006244.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006244.s007">S1 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006244.s008">S2 Table</xref>) and preferential association of the anchor peptide with the C-lobe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006244.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006244.s007">S1 Table</xref>), features that have been proposed to be important for the transfer of iron-loaded Tf to TbpA [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although hLf is secreted from mucosal glandular cells in the apo form, due to its ability to sequester iron, there may be a substantial proportion of holo (iron-loaded) hLf at the relatively low levels present under normal conditions on the mucosal surface [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, during invasive infection within the bloodstream hLf may predominantly be in the iron-loaded form. The ability to discriminate between the holo and apo forms of hLf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006244.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggests that LbpB could serve an analogous function as TbpB by preferentially capturing holo-hLf under these conditions. Since the prevalence of the NalP gene is estimated to only be 88% in carriage and invasive isolates and the gene is subjected to phase variation by the presence of poly C tracts [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], there would be opportunities to select for isolates with efficient acquisition from hLf under these conditions.</p><fig id="ppat.1006244.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006244.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Proposed functions of LbpB.</title><p>(LEFT) LbpB may be involved in the iron-acquisition pathway.

The results of our binding studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006244.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and crosslinking studies confirm that the N-lobe of hLf is bound by the negatively charged regions in the C-lobe of LbpB. We only observed a single redundant crosslink between the LbpB-C lobe and hLf-N lobe, though this low level of coverage was to be expected considering the chemical nature of the crosslinker (reacts with primary amines) and the anionic nature of the LbpB-C lobe loops. Further studies may utilize additional crosslinker chemistries (i.e. carboxyl-to-amine crosslinkers) to address this issue. Since activated neutrophils secrete large concentrations of apo-Lf, this mode of binding may be particularly important at sites of inflammation, potentially inhibiting the release of cationic antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic cleavage of apo Lf or directly complexing the released cationic peptides. The release of LbpB by NalP would not necessarily compromise this process, and could potentially facilitate the formation of large Lf-LbpB complexes that might delay the release of cationic peptides. Since NalP has been shown to mediate the release of LbpB and the cleavage of human complement C3 [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], its expression upon crossing the mucosal barrier or at sites of inflammation would be advantageous.</p><p>This study has demonstrated the duality and complexity of the LbpB:Lf interaction that reflects the dual roles that LbpB plays in iron acquisition and protection from cationic peptides. A schematic for the proposed pathways can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006244.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Considering the potential impact that LbpB release from the cell surface by selective NalP cleavage has on these two functions, there could be strong selective forces on NalP-on or NalP-off phase variants in different environments within the host. It would also be interesting to determine whether there may be other factors affecting the expression of NalP at sites of inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Expression and purification of recombinant proteins</title><p>Regions of the <italic>tbpB</italic> and <italic>lbpB</italic> genes from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> strain MC58 or B16B6 were PCR amplified and cloned into a custom expression vector encoding a N-terminal polyhistidine tagged maltose binding protein followed by a TEV cleavage site [<xref rid="ppat.1006244.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
