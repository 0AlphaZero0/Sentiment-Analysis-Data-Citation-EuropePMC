Using <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> ticks and age-matched mice purchased from two independent commercial vendors with two different immune backgrounds as a model, we show that ticks fed on immunodeficient animals demonstrate decreased fibrinogenolytic activity in comparison to ticks fed on immunocompetent animals. Reduced levels of D-dimer (fibrin degradation product) were evident in ticks fed on immunodeficient animals in comparison to ticks fed on immunocompetent animals. Increased engorgement weights were noted for ticks fed on immunodeficient animals in comparison to ticks fed on immunocompetent animals. Furthermore, the LC-MS/MS and quantitative real-time-PCR analysis followed by inhibitor and antibody-blocking assays revealed that the arthropod HSP70-like molecule contributes to differential fibrinogenolysis during tick feeding. Collectively, these results not only indicate that ticks elicit variable fibrinogenolysis upon feeding on hosts with different immune backgrounds but also provide insights for the novel role of arthropod HSP70-like molecule in fibrinogenolysis during blood feeding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that can transmit several pathogens to humans and animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.

However, the influence of different genetic or immune backgrounds of the vertebrate hosts on tick gene expression and blood feeding has not yet been fully evaluated. As <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks express a variety of molecules to counter host immune defense responses, including those noted previously, we used these ticks as a model to address this important question. Studies have reported significant variations in many basic hematological and coagulation parameters among many mouse strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. In addition, a recent study has shown that T-cells participate in coupling coagulation with inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. These studies provide strong rationale for the current study to test whether variable genetic or immune backgrounds of murine host influences tick feeding and gene expression. The findings presented in this study report that the host&#x02019;s genetic background and/or immune status does influence specific tick gene expression that subsequently impact variable fibrinogenolysis during feeding.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tick engorgement weights are increased upon feeding on immunodeficient mice</title><p>We first analyzed whether the immune status of the animals influence tick feeding. Uninfected unfed larvae were fed on age and background matched immunocompetent (C57BL/6&#x02009;J and BALB/c) or immunodeficient (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and SCID) mice ordered from two different commercial vendors with independent housing conditions (Jackson Laboratoreis-C57BL/6&#x02009;J, RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or Charles River Laboratories-BALB/c, SCID). Upon repletion, engorgement weights of fed larvae were measured using an analytical balance. We found that the engorgement weights of ticks fed on immunodeficient mice (0.499&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06&#x02009;mg for RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>; 0.517&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05&#x02009;mg for SCID) were significantly (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) higher in comparison to the ticks fed on immunocompetent (0.479&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06&#x02009;mg for C57BL/6&#x02009;J; 0.467&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.06&#x02009;mg for BALB/c) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A,B</xref>).

Therefore, we tested the levels of D-dimer, a prominent product of fibrin degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, in total lysates of whole ticks fed on immunodeficient or immunocompetent animals. Stain-free gel images showed no significant visual differences in the total protein profile between ticks fed on either group of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>). However, immunoblotting results showed dramatically low levels of D-dimer in the total lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunodeficient animals (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, SCID) in comparison to the respective control group of ticks fed on immunocompetent (C57BL/6&#x02009;J, BALB/c) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>, respectively). Densitometry analysis of the immunoblots further supported that these observations are statistically (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E,F</xref>). An independent experiment further confirmed this observation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Immunoblotting assays performed with commercially available D-dimer native protein (purified from human plasma, Lee Biosolutions) along with total lysates generated from ticks fed on immunocompetent (C57BL/6&#x02009;J, BALB/c) animals further supported that the observed band at the size of ~200&#x02009;kDa in these samples is indeed D-dimer which was absent in total lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunodeficient (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, SCID) animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2A,B</xref>).

Uninfected unfed nymphs were fed on immunocompetent (C57BL/6&#x02009;J, BALB/c) or immunodeficient (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, SCID) mice and upon repletion they were processed for salivary gland isolation as described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Incubation of fibrinogen (purified protein from Sigma) with salivary gland lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunodeficient animals showed reduced degradation of A&#x003b1; chain of fibrinogen in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (when incubated for 2 or 4&#x02009;h) in comparison to the lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunocompetent animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). Densitometry analysis further supported this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C,D</xref>). The salivary gland lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunocompetent (C57BL/6&#x02009;J) mice showed increased degradation of A&#x003b1; chain of fibrinogen in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> even at shorter incubation times (15, 30&#x02009;min) in comparison to the lysates prepared from ticks fed on immunodeficient (RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The degradation of fibrinogen A&#x003b1; chain (in all cases) was sensitive to EDTA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3E&#x02013;H</xref>) in comparison to the CaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A&#x02013;D</xref>). Increased fibrinogenolytic activity was observed with the salivary gland lysates prepared from ticks fed on BALB/c mice even upon treatment with EDTA in comparison to the lysates prepared from ticks fed on SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F,H</xref>). Incubation of fibrinogen with CaCl<sub>2</sub> or EDTA alone did not show any fibrinogen degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The amount of salivary gland lysates (5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) used in the fibrinogenolysis assay did not show any prominent band with the same intensity or size of the fibrinogen, ruling out the possibility of any tick molecules being detected at the degradation product size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). These results indicate that variable fibrinogenolytic activities elicited by ticks are calcium dependent and sensitive to chelating agents such as EDTA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The gene expression for four metalloproteases analyzed in this study is unaltered in ticks fed on immunocompetent or immunodeficient animals</title><p>A tick metalloprotease belonging to reprolysin family containing pre- and pro-enzyme domains, zinc-binding motif and cysteine-rich region from salivary glands of <italic>I. scapularis</italic> has been suggested to participate in fibrinogenolytic activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.

Our finding that ticks fed on immunodeficient animals express low level of HSP70-like protein is consistent with the reduced fibrinogen degradation around the tick bite site on these animals in comparison to the immunocompetent animals. The low levels of murine D-dimer in ticks fed on immunodeficient mice in comparison to ticks fed on immunocompetent mice strongly support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Low levels of fibrin/fibrinogen clots could account for less clotting that may subsequently affect increased blood in-take by ticks fed on the immunodeficient animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and possibly increased transmission of pathogens. The later argument is in agreement with a study that has reported an increased rate of transmission of pathogen from ticks to immunodeficient animals in comparison to transmission of pathogens from ticks to the immunocompetent animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>.</p><p>HSP70 was initially thought to be an intracellular protein. However, work from Tytell and Hightower laboratories provide evidence that HSP70 could transit through the extracellular spaces<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. HSP70 is also found in the human serum in substantial quantities suggesting its role as an extracellular or secreted protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition, a proteasome component Sec61p and HSP70 are reported to be involved in the degradation of fibrinogen in the mammalian cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our data provides the evidence that suggests contribution of arthropod HSP70-like molecule in fibrinogenolysis during tick blood feeding. The observation of higher mRNA levels for only one of the HSP70-like molecule out of six molecules analyzed in this study does not rule out the possibility for the participation of other five HSP70-like molecules at different stages of tick blood feeding. In addition, role for other HSP70-like molecules in fibrinogenolysis cannot be ruled out in ticks during feeding on diverse vertebrate hosts such as deer or other animals. Future comparative studies on all tick HSP70-like molecules would reveal whether they have similar or redundant function during arthropod blood feeding. We hypothesize that HSP70-like molecules are secreted in tick saliva and may aid in proper folding of proteins that are involved in the degradation of fibrinogen at the arthropod bite site to facilitate blood feeding. However, the contribution of arthropod HSP70 molecules to fibrinogenolysis either directly or indirectly would not rule out other salivary activities by these molecules important during feeding.</p><p>HSP70s are molecular chaperones that consist of three domains: N-terminal ATPase domain, substrate binding domain and C-terminal domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. The N-terminal ATPase domain hydrolyses ATP to ADP. The HSP70-substrate interactions are determined by the nucleotide status of the N-terminal domain. In the ATP-bound state, HSP70s have a high association and dissociation rates for substrate exchange. In contrast, in the ADP-bound state, HSP70s have low substrate exchange rates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. VER155008, an ATP-competitive inhibitor, arrests the N-terminal domain of HSP70 that subsequently affect substrate binding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. The observation of reduced fibrinogenolysis upon treatment of salivary glands lysates generated from ticks fed on immunocompetent animals with VER155008 suggests that N-terminal domain of arthropod HSP70 is critical for the recognition of substrate proteins that could be involved in fibrinogen degradation. Future studies on these aspects will reveal interesting findings on the role for arthropod HSP70-like molecules in fibrinogenolysis.</p><p>RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice do not produce any mature T or B-lymphocytes and this is described as a &#x0201c;non-leaky&#x0201d; immune deficiency animal model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Whereas, some SCID mice appear to develop few clones of T and B cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. The differences in the <italic>in vitro</italic> fibrinogenolysis observed between salivary gland lysates prepared from ticks fed on SCID in comparison to ticks fed on RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be due to the two different genetic backgrounds (BALB/c versus C57BL/6&#x02009;J, respectively) or due to the leakiness in the generation of some clones of T and B cells in the SCID mice. T and B-cells play important roles in the host immune responses against tick bites<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The lack of T and B cells or other metabolites in the host blood could also account for increased blood in ticks fed on immunodeficient animals independent of the host blood clotting factors. Several studies have now characterized various tick salivary proteins involved in T and B cell inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. It remains interesting to analyze whether tick HSP70-like proteins affect activation of host T and B cells and thereby facilitate arthropod blood feeding. The finding of a decreased level of fibrinogenolysis from lysates prepared from ticks fed on T and B-cell deficient background host provides important future avenues in understanding the role of these cells and their relevant signaling pathways in the formation of fibrin/fibrinogen clots around the feeding cavity formed by the arthropod bites.</p><p>In summary, using <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks as a model we provide evidence that ticks elicit variable fibrinogenolysis upon feeding on hosts with different genetic background and/or immune status. This study is not only important in understanding the molecular basis of the interactions at the tick-host interface but may also potentially lead for the development of anti-tick vaccines to interfere with the life cycle of this and perhaps other medically important vectors.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ticks and mice</title><p>Laboratory-reared specimens of <italic>I. scapularis</italic> ticks were used throughout the study.
