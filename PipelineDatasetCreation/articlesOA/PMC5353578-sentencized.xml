<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that HSP70-like molecules are secreted in tick saliva and may aid in proper folding of proteins that are involved in the degradation of fibrinogen at the arthropod bite site to facilitate blood feeding. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal ATPase domain hydrolyses ATP to ADP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The HSP70-substrate interactions are determined by the nucleotide status of the N-terminal domain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The observation of reduced fibrinogenolysis upon treatment of salivary glands lysates generated from ticks fed on immunocompetent animals with VER155008 suggests that N-terminal domain of arthropod HSP70 is critical for the recognition of substrate proteins that could be involved in fibrinogen degradation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The differences in the in vitro fibrinogenolysis observed between salivary gland lysates prepared from ticks fed on SCID in comparison to ticks fed on RAG−/− mice could be due to the two different genetic backgrounds (BALB/c versus C57BL/6 J, respectively) or due to the leakiness in the generation of some clones of T and B cells in the SCID mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>T and B-cells play important roles in the host immune responses against tick bites4567. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The lack of T and B cells or other metabolites in the host blood could also account for increased blood in ticks fed on immunodeficient animals independent of the host blood clotting factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Several studies have now characterized various tick salivary proteins involved in T and B cell inhibition484950. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>It remains interesting to analyze whether tick HSP70-like proteins affect activation of host T and B cells and thereby facilitate arthropod blood feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The finding of a decreased level of fibrinogenolysis from lysates prepared from ticks fed on T and B-cell deficient background host provides important future avenues in understanding the role of these cells and their relevant signaling pathways in the formation of fibrin/fibrinogen clots around the feeding cavity formed by the arthropod bites. </plain></SENT>
