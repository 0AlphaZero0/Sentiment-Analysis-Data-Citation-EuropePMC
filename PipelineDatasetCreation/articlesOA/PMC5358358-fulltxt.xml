Many investigations have described indirect effects of calcium signaling on CFTR or other calcium-activated chloride channels; here, we investigate the direct response of CFTR to calmodulin-mediated calcium signaling. We characterize an interaction between the regulatory region of CFTR and calmodulin, the major calcium signaling molecule, and report protein kinase A (PKA)-independent CFTR activation by calmodulin. We describe the competition between calmodulin binding and PKA phosphorylation and the differential effects of this competition for wild-type CFTR and the major F508del mutant, hinting at potential therapeutic strategies. Evidence of CFTR binding to isolated calmodulin domains/lobes suggests a mechanism for the role of CFTR as a molecular hub.

This chloride flux is maintained by cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and calcium ion-activated chloride channels (CaCCs); the separation between activation pathways of these channels was recently questioned, however (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, lack of normal fluid transport results in a dehydrated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that leads to mucus accumulation and frequent lung infections. Calcium signaling is the major regulatory pathway of airway physiology because increased intracellular calcium is the primary signal for fluid secretion (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Despite early investigations finding no evidence for calcium signaling directly activating CFTR (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), recent studies have focused on the interplay between the cAMP and calcium pathways in CFTR activation and function (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), including the role of protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation on CFTR activation and PKA activation by calcium-activated adenylate cyclases (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>CFTR activation by the cAMP pathway is well established in the literature (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Together with ATP binding by the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), phosphorylation of NBD1 and the 200-residue regulatory (R) region facilitates CFTR trafficking and channel opening (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). R region is an intrinsically disordered segment of the CFTR that samples multiple conformations under physiological conditions. It is responsible for most of CFTR&#x02019;s regulatory intramolecular and intermolecular protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Diverse binding elements of R region for various partners are conserved and controlled by phosphorylation. Nonphosphorylated R region interacts with NBD1 via helical elements, whereas PKA-phosphorylated R region loses helical propensity and binds to 14-3-3 via shorter extended segments. Because these binding segments are accessible and largely independent from each other, R region can interact with more than one partner at a time. Consequently, it can integrate different regulatory inputs via transient, dynamic interactions (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>CFTR is located on the apical surface of epithelial cells and is a key component of a macromolecular signaling complex that involves sodium and potassium channels, anion exchangers, transporters, and other regulator proteins and molecules (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Store operated calcium channel Orai1 was also found in the same microdomain (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>); because mutations in CFTR affect Orai1 channel function (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), Orai1 is likely to be part of the same complex. Interaction between endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 form a membrane contact site, a critical junction between the ER and plasma membrane. This STIM1:Orai1 interaction activates the store operated calcium entry (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and localizes ER and plasma membrane calcium channels in close proximity to CFTR, resulting in local elevation of calcium levels. Calcium-regulated interaction between CFTR and other membrane proteins is thus very likely. One recent example demonstrates that the potassium channel KCa3.1 interacts with CFTR in a calcium-dependent manner (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Calcium signaling is tightly coupled to calmodulin, a multifunctional intermediate messenger that translates calcium signals to regulatory calcium-dependent protein&#x02013;protein interactions with various targets (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It consists of two lobes, each with two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, and a connecting linker region (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Calmodulin recognizes very diverse substrate sequences categorized (e.g., IQ, 1&#x02013;10, 1&#x02013;14, and 1&#x02013;16 motif classes) based on key residues of the interaction (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, it can interact with its partners in two different binding conformations (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In the canonical binding mode, calmodulin wraps around the substrate with high (nanomolar) affinity (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), whereas in the alternative binding conformation the two lobes can bind to two separate sequences independently and bridge over larger distances, usually with weaker (micromolar) affinity (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Most calmodulin substrates use the canonical interaction mode, but, interestingly, membrane channels such as the calcium channel Orai1 (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and the potassium channel Kv7.1 (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) use the alternative calmodulin-binding mode.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the direct effect of calcium signaling on CFTR, focusing on the consequences of calmodulin binding for CFTR activation and function. We demonstrate that calmodulin interacts directly with the R region of CFTR in a calcium- and phosphorylation-dependent manner with &#x0223c;25 &#x000b5;M affinity. Calcium-loaded calmodulin binding and PKA phosphorylation at three phosphorylation sites are mutually exclusive processes. Imaging on both primary tissue and cells overexpressing CFTR and calmodulin shows that the two proteins colocalize at the apical membrane. Patch-clamp experiments provide evidence that calcium-loaded calmodulin triggers an open probability similar to that observed for PKA phosphorylation, suggesting that calmodulin binds directly to full-length CFTR. We found that both wild-type and F508del CFTR can be activated by increased intracellular calcium level in a cellular context in the absence of PKA stimulation. Interestingly, following PKA stimulation, intracellular calcium release decreases the activity of wild-type CFTR, whereas F508del CFTR function can be further activated by elevated level of calcium, a difference that we attribute to the likely different phosphorylation states of the two proteins. Calmodulin-binding&#x02013;deficient R-region mutant CFTR displayed a decreased response to calmodulin. Results of single-lobe calmodulin experiments and measured binding affinities are consistent with calmodulin acting as a binding bridge to other components of calcium signaling pathways. Thus, CFTR activity may also be regulated by large calmodulin-containing macromolecular complexes involved in cellular ion homeostasis. Together, these results open avenues for treatment of CF, synergize the cAMP and calcium signaling regulatory pathways for CFTR, and deepen our understanding of how CFTR activation is tuned by different internal and external stimuli.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>The R Region of CFTR Binds to Calmodulin.</title><p>Given the roles of CFTR in regulation of multiple channels and the known importance of the R region as a protein interaction hub, we used a variety of computational approaches to predict protein-binding sites within the R region and to identify partners for experimental studies. Prediction of calmodulin-binding sites using CaMBTPredictor (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) identified a minor and a major binding segment centered at residues 705 and 780, respectively, and recognition motif search using Calmodulin Target Database (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) found an IQ-like motif (with a conservative I/L substitution in the IQ motif: IQXXXR) between residues 763 and 774, which contains the S768 phosphorylation site (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). To experimentally characterize the R-region&#x02013;calmodulin interaction, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) proton&#x02013;nitrogen&#x02013;carbonyl triple resonance (HNCO) experiments on isolated human R region (amino acids 654&#x02013;838; F833L, a polymorphism with enhanced solubility, <sup>13</sup>C<sup>15</sup>N-labeled) in the presence and absence of unlabeled human calmodulin (amino acids 1&#x02013;149; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig01">Fig. S1</xref>). Many known IQ motifs are calcium-independent binding motifs (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, we compared spectra with and without 40 &#x003bc;M free calcium ions (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s12"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). Because the predictions included phosphorylation sites, we also investigated the phosphorylation dependence of the interaction. Comparison of R-region HNCO spectra shows that calmodulin addition leads to significant changes of NMR resonance intensities and chemical shifts, providing evidence for R-region&#x02013;calmodulin interactions. Furthermore, the interaction strength is modulated by both calcium and R-region phosphorylation. Three segments of the nonphosphorylated R region (amino acids 659&#x02013;671, 700&#x02013;715, and 760&#x02013;780) display significant decrease in signal intensity in the presence of calcium-loaded calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). In the absence of added calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>F</italic> and <italic>H</italic></xref>) or when R region is PKA-phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>C</italic> and <italic>E</italic></xref>), primarily one of these sites (amino acids 760&#x02013;780) has reduced signal upon calmodulin addition. Furthermore, the signal loss is decreased, indicative of significantly weaker interaction. Based on chemical shift changes, the binding affinity of the amino acids 760&#x02013;780 site is the strongest among the three segments. These chemical shifts decrease by over an order of magnitude in the absence of calcium or with PKA phosphorylation. No signal loss is observed upon addition of calmodulin to PKA-phosphorylated R region in the absence of calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1 <italic>G</italic> and <italic>I</italic></xref>). The intrinsically disordered R region samples various conformations, but published NMR chemical shift data indicate that the three calmodulin-binding segments have a significant amount of helical character, even without a partner (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Binding of calcium-loaded calmodulin to nonphosphorylated R region causes the chemical shifts of these segments to move closer to values consistent with &#x003b1;-helical structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig02">Fig. S2</xref>), indicating a coil-to-helix transition. This evidence that the segments assume a helical conformation when bound to calmodulin is in good agreement with previous structural studies showing that calmodulin recognizes most of its partners in a helical conformation.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Predicted and experimental calmodulin interaction profile of human R region of CFTR.

Together, the results are consistent with the segments being direct binding motifs and with the two lobes being able to substitute for each other.

We used short HSQC experiments and followed phosphorylation by monitoring peaks corresponding to the phosphorylated S660, S670, S700, S712, S737, S753, S768, S795, and S813 amide groups. Comparison of the kinetic curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) for isolated R region revealed that the phosphorylation rate at each site depends only on the correspondence between the primary sequence and the PKA consensus recognition motif. This confirms that the R region is intrinsically disordered without significant stably formed structural elements that might sterically impede PKA phosphorylation. S768 is phosphorylated most quickly, with the best match for the PKA recognition sequence. The phosphorylation rate decreased according to the following order: S768, S660, S737, S795, S712, S700, and S813 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). No phosphorylation was detected on the two monobasic sites (S670 and S753) during the measurement time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). Addition of calmodulin and calcium drastically reduces the phosphorylation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>) at sites that interact with calmodulin. Consequently, S768 phosphorylation was completely, S660 phosphorylation was largely (8.9-fold), and S712 was significantly (1.2-fold) inhibited by calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). The PKA phosphorylation rates at other sites were unchanged or slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>), probably due to the lower number of accessible substrates for the kinase in this closed system. Interestingly, the similar phosphorylation rate of S700 in the apo and complex form argues that the interaction is dynamic and the second site has the smallest contribution to the complex formation that was compensated by the higher PKA activity. Because PKA phosphorylation of R region directly activates the channel (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), these data imply that calmodulin binding should also have a direct effect on CFTR activity, either inhibiting it or mimicking the effect of phosphorylation and enhancing it.</p><fig id="fig04" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Calmodulin effect on PKA phosphorylation of R region.

Specificity was ensured by testing CFTR inhibitor-172 response. Intracellular calcium concentration and tightly related calmodulin activity were modulated by addition of thapsigargin (a SERCA pump antagonist that causes calcium release from the ER) or 1,2-bis(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N&#x02032;</italic>,<italic>N&#x02032;</italic>-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) (a calcium chelator). PKA phosphorylation was initiated using the cAMP agonist, forskolin. This assay was proven to accurately measure CFTR function in previous studies using HEK-293 cells (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and in our control experiments.</p><p>Our in vitro results show that calcium-loaded calmodulin binding and PKA phosphorylation at S660, S712, and S768 are mutually exclusive processes, suggesting that the order of calcium and cAMP signaling may determine which process defines CFTR activity in cells. Thus, in cells, we first tested the effect of sequential addition of thapsigargin followed by forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>A</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>E</italic>, and <italic>F</italic></xref>). Elevation in cytosolic calcium significantly stimulated channel activity in both wild-type and F508del mutant CFTR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>E</italic> and <italic>F</italic></xref>). Addition of the DMSO control or BAPTA-AM had no effect on CFTR function. Following calcium pathway activation by thapsigargin, subsequent forskolin addition further increased CFTR activity. Maximal CFTR activity for both wild-type and F508del CFTR was the same whether or not thapsigargin was applied first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). More significantly, fully PKA-stimulated or partially PKA- and calcium-stimulated CFTR has the same magnitude of channel activity. Based on our in vitro results and the expectation that calcium release leads to calmodulin binding to the R region, our interpretation of these exciting data is that calmodulin binding mimics R-region phosphorylation in this context and that both have a direct stimulatory effect on CFTR activity with the two processes being roughly additive.

Interestingly, elevated intracellular calcium levels modestly reduced wild-type but increased F508del CFTR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>B</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Assuming that the activation of channel function by calcium is mediated by calmodulin binding of R region, these data suggest that crucial phosphorylation sites are not fully phosphorylated in F508del CFTR. In contrast, we speculate that, in wild-type CFTR, full phosphorylation at the three critical phosphorylation sites totally abolishes calmodulin-related CFTR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). The modest reduction observed for wild-type CFTR could be explained by internalization of the calcium-activated CFTR. Recent studies have found that calcium-loaded calmodulin initiates endocytosis (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and cigarette smoke-induced elevation in intracellular calcium levels triggers membrane turnover and therefore decreased CFTR activity (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We also confirmed the findings using a lower forskolin concentration, to show that the absence of a calcium response is not because the assay has reached saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, F508del mutant CFTR is known to have defective forskolin-mediated phosphorylation on S660 (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and possibly on other PKA sites; thus, it is still able to bind calmodulin at elevated calcium levels, resulting in stimulation of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Fig. 5 <italic>D</italic> and <italic>G</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>R-region Mutant CFTR Shows Altered Calmodulin Activation.</title><p>We interpreted the results of our FLIPR membrane potential assays in terms of direct binding of calcium-loaded calmodulin to CFTR R-region activating nonphosphorylated full-length wild-type and F508del CFTR. Because knocking down or silencing calmodulin perturbs many important biological processes with serious viability issues, to provide evidence for this hypothesized direct interaction between CFTR and calmodulin in cells and validate our in vitro results and the computational prediction, we introduced mutations in R region designed to modify calmodulin binding around the most prominent binding site, S768. We exchanged S768 to alanine (S768A) or deleted 21 residues between 760 and 780 (&#x00394;760&#x02013;780) in both wild type and F508del full-length CFTR backgrounds. Our NMR data show that the region 760&#x02013;780 is most affected by calmodulin binding; thus, we predicted the deletion of this region would inhibit calmodulin binding. CFTR trafficking is phosphorylation dependent (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>); therefore, to avoid reduced trafficking caused by these mutations and to test the effect of increased surface presence of CFTR, cells transfected with these constructs were treated with VX-809, a CFTR corrector (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), or DMSO control.

Based on its central role in calmodulin binding, it is not surprising that the deletion caused a significant effect on the thapsigargin response, and these results provide in-cell validation of the direct binding of calmodulin to CFTR. The reduction of forskolin response is probably due to a combination of the missing phosphorylation site, the loss of activation properties of this segment in proper CFTR function, and the altered intramolecular and intermolecular interaction network.</p><p>All of these in-cell experiments support the importance of the functional interaction between calmodulin and CFTR. Comparison of differences between wild-type and F508del behavior in response to sequential activation of the cAMP pathway and calcium signaling using the same R-region mutants in the F508del background would also have been valuable. Unfortunately, in combination with F508del, these R-region mutants had severe trafficking defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig08">Fig. S8</xref>); the measured signal was below the sensitivity of the assay.

We performed NMR experiments on purified proteins and observed chemical shift changes indicative of a phosphorylation- and calcium-regulated interaction between R region and calmodulin. Inhibition of PKA phosphorylation in the presence of calmodulin, at the sites we identified as calmodulin binding, demonstrates that the interaction not only is direct but can interfere with other protein interaction and enzymatic activity. The micromolar affinity measured using BLI is consistent with an alternative binding mode for calmodulin, and the affinity and fast <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> rates are in line with expectations for interactions of the disordered CFTR R region that are transient and dynamic, as we previously demonstrated for a number of other R-region targets (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The biological significance of this dynamic interaction was supported by imaging experiments in both primary tissue and cotransfected cells that clearly show colocalization between the two proteins at the apical membrane. We demonstrated the contribution of this interaction to regulated CFTR channel activity at the single-channel level by patch-clamp (ex vivo) studies using CFTR-containing cell membranes, with activation of channel function upon addition of purified calcium-loaded calmodulin. PKA addition slightly activates further the chloride flux, indicating that calmodulin activates a PKA-sensitive chloride channel, such as CFTR. The anion selectivity and unitary conductance of &#x0223c;6 pS clearly identify the channel to be CFTR (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our FLIPR fluorescence-based membrane potential assay results using wild-type CFTR showed that activating the calcium pathway leads to chloride-ion flux that depends on the presence of CFTR and the phosphorylation state of the channel. Activating the cAMP&#x02013;PKA&#x02013;CFTR phosphorylation pathway alone or after a preceding calcium pathway stimulation displayed the same total change in membrane potential that was used as a measure of the chloride-ion flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figs. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">8</xref>), suggesting that the two pathways are converging on the same function.</p><fig id="fig08" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 8.</label><caption><p>Synergistic effect of calcium and cAMP signaling on CFTR.

Although the difference in phosphorylation between wild-type and F508del CFTR was reported previously (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), the functional consequences have not been fully explored. Our FLIPR membrane potential assay data suggest that F508del CFTR does not reach full phosphorylation upon cAMP signaling probably because R-region accessibility is reduced. The reduction is most likely due to altered intramolecular interactions that result in higher R-region binding affinity to other CFTR domains. In other words, F508del mutant CFTR is locked in a phosphorylation-deficient conformation. The unexpected observation of calmodulin activation not being strongly influenced by reduced accessibility of R region requires further exploration.</p><p>Because knocking down or silencing calmodulin perturbs many important biological processes with serious viability issues, the specificity of calmodulin regulation of CFTR was confirmed using CFTR mutants in the calmodulin-binding site. CFTR constructs with calmodulin-binding site mutations display significantly reduced response to calcium signaling, strongly indicative of a direct interaction. These findings suggest that, upon a calcium signal, calmodulin can activate CFTR immediately, but the long-term stimulation can be further supported by phosphorylation activated by calcium-dependent adenylate cyclases (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or other processes (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). As a consequence, depending on the duration of the calcium signal, wild-type CFTR can be either just briefly activated by calmodulin or activated for a longer period by initial calmodulin binding followed by PKA phosphorylation beyond the time of the calcium signal. Addition of purified calmodulin to CFTR-containing membranes and activating calmodulin in cells both result in CFTR activation, with the total CFTR activity being the same in samples exposed to just PKA or calmodulin followed by PKA, indicative of calmodulin directly interacting with CFTR in cells. Together, these data reveal the molecular basis underlying a calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism for the normal and major CF-causing mutant.</p><p>The site-specific NMR phosphorylation kinetics experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) revealed an important aspect of the cross-talk between cAMP and calcium signals on CFTR. Namely, the two most rapidly phosphorylated PKA sites (S768 and S660) are also found within calmodulin-binding sites, indicating that the two signaling pathways are segregated at a very early stage of the signaling process. In other words, mild PKA phosphorylation that does not necessary activate the channel disconnects CFTR from the calcium pathway. This layer of regulation by PKA may be why CFTR is basally phosphorylated in many cases (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and, depending on local conditions, why different basal phosphorylation patterns of CFTR exist (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Since the early work of Wilkinson et al. (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), there has been debate regarding the role of different phosphorylation sites in CFTR channel function. Residues S737 and S768 were reported to be inhibitory sites because changing them to alanine lowers the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) requirement for channel activation (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>); however, later work questioned these findings (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In our FLIPR membrane potential assay setup, the forskolin concentration (10 &#x003bc;M) used to achieve full activation and the lag time between drug addition and the next time point read did not allow us to comment on the kinetics of activation, but we observed a significantly decreased total membrane potential change after forskolin stimulation for both S768A and &#x00394;760&#x02013;780 mutants lacking the possibility of phosphorylation at residue 768, strongly indicative of a direct interaction. Interestingly, the rank order of reported IBMX dose-dependent data on serine-to-alanine mutants (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) matches within error to our R-region phosphorylation kinetic results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>), with the exception of phosphorylation at 660 that was reported to have a small effect but for which we see rapid phosphorylation. This difference may be due to NBD1 in full-length CFTR restricting access to the 660 site for PKA. The interpretation of the negative correlation between the rate of phosphorylation of a given residue (S768 &#x0003e; S660 &#x0003e; S737 &#x0003e; S700, S712, S795 &#x0003e; S813) and the importance in IBMX dose-dependent activation of the same residue (S768 &#x0003c; S737 &#x0003c; S700 &#x0003c; S660, S795 &#x0003c; S813) (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) is not obvious based on the current knowledge that exists on the role of R region in CFTR channel regulation (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and requires further investigation.</p><p>Considering the importance of calcium signaling in the regulation of airway fluid secretion (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) and the fact that CF patients with impaired CFTR function have altered calcium concentration regulation (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), it is not surprising that calcium signal-activated CFTR and CFTR-regulated calcium signaling were recently the targets of many studies (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). No publication, however, has reported this direct calmodulin&#x02013;CFTR interaction previously. Inactive, but basally phosphorylated, CFTR that is incompatible with calmodulin binding may dominate in other cellular systems, preventing observation of a direct effect of calcium signaling on CFTR activation. However, in BHK cells, CFTR was shown to be activated by carbachol, an agonist of M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor causing elevated calcium levels, even after the removal of 15 PKA and 9 PKC sites (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although the data presented in that study support tyrosine phosphorylation as a major player in CFTR activation, wild-type CFTR displayed only a 30% decrease in activity upon exposure of PP2A and Src inhibitors. Interestingly, the 15SA-CFTR mutant lacking the ability to be PKA-phosphorylated demonstrated no residual activity under the same conditions (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In the present study, we showed that serine-to-alanine mutation at residue 768 results in decreased calmodulin binding, suggesting that the absence of 15SA-CFTR activity could be also explained by reduced calmodulin binding.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Calmodulin Regulates Microdomain Assembly.</title><p>A fascinating aspect of the interaction between calmodulin and its substrates is the different consequences of its two distinct binding modes. A number of membrane channels and transporters in close proximity to CFTR have been reported to interact with calmodulin using the alternative binding mode in which calmodulin reversibly cross-links two protein ligands (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). These include Orai1 (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and the potassium channel Kv7.1 (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This cross-linking is expected to play a significant role in functional regulation and in macromolecular complex assembly (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The finding that individual lobes give rise to identical NMR signal perturbation as full-length calmodulin indicates that a single lobe of calmodulin is sufficient to regulate CFTR and provides evidence for CFTR using the alternative calmodulin-binding mode. Moreover, the measured binding affinity for this interaction is in good agreement with other alternative binding mode substrates, but not with canonical ligands (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). As a consequence, calcium signaling is predicted to have a significant role in the regulation of CFTR microdomain assembly by physically cross-linking channels and transporters to CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). In a recent study, KCa3.1 has been shown to interact with CFTR in a calcium-dependent manner involving calmodulin, supporting this model (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These interactions are likely part of a network among the membrane proteins within the microdomain, either involving direct calmodulin interactions or increased contacts due to the close and fixed proximity. A central component of this network is the intrinsically disordered R region of CFTR responsible for almost all of the regulatory intermolecular protein interactions of CFTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). Regulatory signals from various sources converge on R region (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and calmodulin interaction may be one of the ways this information is distributed within the macromolecular complex to control and synchronize ion channel and transport functions. Although activation of nonphosphorylated F508del mutant CFTR by calmodulin was similar to wild type, phosphorylated channels displayed completely opposite responses in our VX-809&#x02013;treated HEK-293 overexpressing cell system. These results indicate altered phosphorylation and accessibility and therefore different interactions of R region in the mutant protein. PKA phosphorylation completely decouples calcium signaling from wild-type CFTR, but not the F508del mutant, potentially enabling stimulation of other membrane protein channels. For instance, this additional stimulus can increase activity of the apical calcium channels, leading to an elevated local calcium concentration (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) that is associated with the constant inflammation seen in CF patients (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the results we described on the cross-talk between calcium and cAMP signaling in CFTR channel function and regulation provide a detailed view of this interaction. Although no evidence of the direct interaction between calmodulin and CFTR has been described previously, differences in basal phosphorylation patterns at the three interaction segments in various cell types and under various conditions may provide an explanation. Importantly, differences in phosphorylation patterns between wild type and F508del may enable targeting of this interaction with small molecules that prevent mutant CFTR from calmodulin binding. Based on the ability of calmodulin to couple CFTR to other membrane channels and transporters, including those in the ER accessible even to CFTR that does not reach the plasma membrane, this could modulate calcium signaling to reduce inflammation and provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s12"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p content-type="flushleft">A summary of the methods is provided here.

The reaction was started by adding 2,500 units of PKA catalytic subunit into the sample and followed at 10 &#x000b0;C by measuring 10-min proton&#x02013;nitrogen correlation spectra (HSQC) with four transients and 64 indirect points on a 500-MHz Varian spectrometer. In total, 1 spectrum without the PKA and 125 spectra with the kinase were recorded for both the apo and complex cases.</p></sec><sec id="si8"><title>FLIPR Membrane Potential Assay.</title><p>CFTR functional studies were executed on a 96-well plate according to Molinski et al. (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) using the following compound concentrations: FLIPR membrane potential dye (0.5 mg/mL; Molecular Devices), VX-809 (3 &#x003bc;M; Selleck Chemicals), forskolin (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 &#x003bc;M; Sigma), thapsigargin (2 &#x003bc;M; Sigma), CFTR inh-172 (10 &#x003bc;M; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics), and BAPTA-AM (50 &#x003bc;M; Sigma). The extracellular calcium concentration (1.3 mM) was set using calcium gluconate (Sigma). In all cases, DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Python scripts were used for data analysis, and statistical tests were performed using Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software).</p></sec><sec id="si9"><title>Western Blotting.</title><p>Following transfection and chemical correction, cells were lysed using a buffer containing 50 mM Tris&#x000b7;HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, containing 0.1% (vol/vol) SDS, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, and 1% (vol/vol) protease inhibitor mixture (Amresco), and then incubated at 4 &#x000b0;C for 15 min. Following incubation, lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected from each cell sample and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (at a 1:5 dilution) and run on an SDS/PAGE gel. Protein was then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% (wt/vol) skim milk. Following blocking, the membrane was probed with either an antibody against human CFTR 596 (1:10,000; CFFT and UNC-CH) or human calnexin (1:10,000; Sigma), and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, which was raised in goat, against rabbit or mouse (added in a 1:5,000 dilution). The membrane was then washed, and chemiluminescence was used to detect signals from the respective antigens. The images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.42 Q software (National Institutes of Health).</p></sec><sec id="si10"><title>Multilayer Confocal Imaging.</title><p>Primary bronchial epithelial cells as air&#x02013;liquid interface (ALI) cultures were obtained from the Iowa CF culture facility (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR antibody, clones 13-1 and 24-1, are both from R&#x00026;D Systems. Rabbit polyclonal anti-calmodulin antibody was provided by Abcam. Human bronchial epithelial cultures grown on ALI membrane were fixed in a mixture of 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde, in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 h. Cell patches were neutralized in 150 mM glycine, 80 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 10 min, washed three times with 150 mM glycine in phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 5 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, in 150 mM glycine, 0.5% BSA, and 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 20 min, with solution changing every 4 min. To block nonspecific staining, the samples were incubated in 4% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS for 30 min. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies was done in the same blocking solution. DAPI was used as a nuclear stain. Multilayer confocal scan imaging (0.1 &#x003bc;m per layer) was performed in the Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C9100-13 back-thinned EM-CCD camera and Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal scan head. Data were processed with Volocity software suite (PerkinElmer). CFTR and calmodulin colocalization was quantified as Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), using Costes method (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) for automatic thresholds setting. Regions of interest (ROIs) were hand-drawn at both apical and basal areas of randomly picked single cells. PCC values for apical and basal ROIs from 10 cells of each donor samples were compared and plotted. Samples from three different donors were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="si11"><title>Live-Cell Imaging.</title><p>CFTR knockout human bronchial epithelial cells, 16HBE14o&#x02212; (from Dieter Gruenert, UCSF School of Medicine and Medical Center, University of California, San Francisco) (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), were grown in Eagle&#x02019;s minimal essential medium, 10% (vol/vol) FBS, and penicillin and streptomycin (1%) at 37 &#x000b0;C and 5% (vol/vol) CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were transfected with plasmids encoding eGFP-human calmodulin (from Emanuel E.

For optimal expression level of the proteins, images were obtained after 24 and 48 h after transfection of eGFP-human calmodulin and mCherry-CFTR plasmids, respectively. All images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioVert 200M spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C9100-13 EM-CCD and a 63&#x000d7; objective (oil) with a numerical aperture of 1.4. eGFP-human calmodulin and mCherry-CFTR fluorophores were excited with 491 nm (50 mW) and 561 nm (50 mW) lasers, respectively. Temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2</sub> level were maintained with a live-cell chamber (Live Cell Instrument) during image acquisition.

All electrophysiological recordings were made at room temperature using Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440A digitizer (Molecular Devices). The data were collected at 5-kHz sampling rate with the amplifier low-path Bessel filter (80 dB/DECADE) set at 1 kHz. To achieve reliable excised inside-out patch configurations, tight sealed patches (&#x0003e;50 G&#x003a9;) were excised by prompt pipette lifting and short exposure to air (&#x0223c;1 s) to ensure that no closed membrane bubbles were formed at the pipette tip. Basic bath solution (intracellular) and pipette solution (extracellular) were identical and contain 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mM NMDG&#x000b7;Cl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, as well as about 1 &#x003bc;M free calcium (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The basic bath solution was sequentially supplemented with 0.4 mM MgATP, 10 &#x003bc;M calmodulin (with 41 &#x003bc;M total calcium buffered by the calmodulin), and 5,000 U/mL PKA. Two- to 3-M&#x003a9; pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with filament (BF150-110-10) using a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument). The pipettes were coated with Sylgard to reduce noise and polished to 3.5- to 5.5-MW resistance, when measured in pipette solution. Recordings were made at &#x02212;50-mV voltage potential using a no-gap voltage-clamp protocol. Data were analyzed using the Clampfit 10.3 program (Molecular Devices) and further filtered with a low-path Bessel (eight-pole) filter using a cutoff at 100 Hz. Idealization was done at Qub suit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qub.buffalo.edu/" xlink:show="new">www.qub.buffalo.edu</ext-link>) using a model with a single closed state sequentially connected to open states. The number of channels was identified as most channels open during the entire experiment (&#x0003e;25 min of uninterrupted recording). To ensure that the number of channels is not underestimated, only recordings with six or fewer channels, which exhibit all-channel&#x02013;open events three or more times during experiment, were used.
