<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This chloride flux is maintained by cAMP-activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (1) and calcium ion-activated chloride channels (CaCCs); the separation between activation pathways of these channels was recently questioned, however (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, lack of normal fluid transport results in a dehydrated airway surface liquid (ASL) layer that leads to mucus accumulation and frequent lung infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Calcium signaling is the major regulatory pathway of airway physiology because increased intracellular calcium is the primary signal for fluid secretion (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Despite early investigations finding no evidence for calcium signaling directly activating CFTR (5), recent studies have focused on the interplay between the cAMP and calcium pathways in CFTR activation and function (6, 7), including the role of protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation on CFTR activation and PKA activation by calcium-activated adenylate cyclases (8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CFTR activation by the cAMP pathway is well established in the literature (9–11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Together with ATP binding by the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), phosphorylation of NBD1 and the 200-residue regulatory (R) region facilitates CFTR trafficking and channel opening (1, 2, 12, 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>R region is an intrinsically disordered segment of the CFTR that samples multiple conformations under physiological conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is responsible for most of CFTR’s regulatory intramolecular and intermolecular protein–protein interactions (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Diverse binding elements of R region for various partners are conserved and controlled by phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Nonphosphorylated R region interacts with NBD1 via helical elements, whereas PKA-phosphorylated R region loses helical propensity and binds to 14-3-3 via shorter extended segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because these binding segments are accessible and largely independent from each other, R region can interact with more than one partner at a time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it can integrate different regulatory inputs via transient, dynamic interactions (14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>CFTR is located on the apical surface of epithelial cells and is a key component of a macromolecular signaling complex that involves sodium and potassium channels, anion exchangers, transporters, and other regulator proteins and molecules (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Store operated calcium channel Orai1 was also found in the same microdomain (15); because mutations in CFTR affect Orai1 channel function (15), Orai1 is likely to be part of the same complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Interaction between endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1 form a membrane contact site, a critical junction between the ER and plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This STIM1:Orai1 interaction activates the store operated calcium entry (16) and localizes ER and plasma membrane calcium channels in close proximity to CFTR, resulting in local elevation of calcium levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Calcium-regulated interaction between CFTR and other membrane proteins is thus very likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>One recent example demonstrates that the potassium channel KCa3.1 interacts with CFTR in a calcium-dependent manner (17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Calcium signaling is tightly coupled to calmodulin, a multifunctional intermediate messenger that translates calcium signals to regulatory calcium-dependent protein–protein interactions with various targets (18, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It consists of two lobes, each with two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs, and a connecting linker region (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Calmodulin recognizes very diverse substrate sequences categorized (e.g., IQ, 1–10, 1–14, and 1–16 motif classes) based on key residues of the interaction (21, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it can interact with its partners in two different binding conformations (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In the canonical binding mode, calmodulin wraps around the substrate with high (nanomolar) affinity (24), whereas in the alternative binding conformation the two lobes can bind to two separate sequences independently and bridge over larger distances, usually with weaker (micromolar) affinity (25–27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Most calmodulin substrates use the canonical interaction mode, but, interestingly, membrane channels such as the calcium channel Orai1 (25), the sodium channel NaV1.5 (26), and the potassium channel Kv7.1 (27) use the alternative calmodulin-binding mode. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the direct effect of calcium signaling on CFTR, focusing on the consequences of calmodulin binding for CFTR activation and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that calmodulin interacts directly with the R region of CFTR in a calcium- and phosphorylation-dependent manner with ∼25 µM affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Calcium-loaded calmodulin binding and PKA phosphorylation at three phosphorylation sites are mutually exclusive processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Imaging on both primary tissue and cells overexpressing CFTR and calmodulin shows that the two proteins colocalize at the apical membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Patch-clamp experiments provide evidence that calcium-loaded calmodulin triggers an open probability similar to that observed for PKA phosphorylation, suggesting that calmodulin binds directly to full-length CFTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We found that both wild-type and F508del CFTR can be activated by increased intracellular calcium level in a cellular context in the absence of PKA stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, following PKA stimulation, intracellular calcium release decreases the activity of wild-type CFTR, whereas F508del CFTR function can be further activated by elevated level of calcium, a difference that we attribute to the likely different phosphorylation states of the two proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Calmodulin-binding–deficient R-region mutant CFTR displayed a decreased response to calmodulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Results of single-lobe calmodulin experiments and measured binding affinities are consistent with calmodulin acting as a binding bridge to other components of calcium signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Thus, CFTR activity may also be regulated by large calmodulin-containing macromolecular complexes involved in cellular ion homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Together, these results open avenues for treatment of CF, synergize the cAMP and calcium signaling regulatory pathways for CFTR, and deepen our understanding of how CFTR activation is tuned by different internal and external stimuli. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Given the roles of CFTR in regulation of multiple channels and the known importance of the R region as a protein interaction hub, we used a variety of computational approaches to predict protein-binding sites within the R region and to identify partners for experimental studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Prediction of calmodulin-binding sites using CaMBTPredictor (28) identified a minor and a major binding segment centered at residues 705 and 780, respectively, and recognition motif search using Calmodulin Target Database (22) found an IQ-like motif (with a conservative I/L substitution in the IQ motif: IQXXXR) between residues 763 and 774, which contains the S768 phosphorylation site (29, 30) (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To experimentally characterize the R-region–calmodulin interaction, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) proton–nitrogen–carbonyl triple resonance (HNCO) experiments on isolated human R region (amino acids 654–838; F833L, a polymorphism with enhanced solubility, 13C15N-labeled) in the presence and absence of unlabeled human calmodulin (amino acids 1–149; Fig. 1 and Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Many known IQ motifs are calcium-independent binding motifs (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Thus, we compared spectra with and without 40 μM free calcium ions (Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Because the predictions included phosphorylation sites, we also investigated the phosphorylation dependence of the interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Comparison of R-region HNCO spectra shows that calmodulin addition leads to significant changes of NMR resonance intensities and chemical shifts, providing evidence for R-region–calmodulin interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the interaction strength is modulated by both calcium and R-region phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Three segments of the nonphosphorylated R region (amino acids 659–671, 700–715, and 760–780) display significant decrease in signal intensity in the presence of calcium-loaded calmodulin (Fig. 1 B and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In the absence of added calcium (Fig. 1 F and H) or when R region is PKA-phosphorylated (Fig. 1 C and E), primarily one of these sites (amino acids 760–780) has reduced signal upon calmodulin addition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the signal loss is decreased, indicative of significantly weaker interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Based on chemical shift changes, the binding affinity of the amino acids 760–780 site is the strongest among the three segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>These chemical shifts decrease by over an order of magnitude in the absence of calcium or with PKA phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>No signal loss is observed upon addition of calmodulin to PKA-phosphorylated R region in the absence of calcium (Fig. 1 G and I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The intrinsically disordered R region samples various conformations, but published NMR chemical shift data indicate that the three calmodulin-binding segments have a significant amount of helical character, even without a partner (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Binding of calcium-loaded calmodulin to nonphosphorylated R region causes the chemical shifts of these segments to move closer to values consistent with α-helical structure (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>S2), indicating a coil-to-helix transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This evidence that the segments assume a helical conformation when bound to calmodulin is in good agreement with previous structural studies showing that calmodulin recognizes most of its partners in a helical conformation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>In other words, mild PKA phosphorylation that does not necessary activate the channel disconnects CFTR from the calcium pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This layer of regulation by PKA may be why CFTR is basally phosphorylated in many cases (29, 38) and, depending on local conditions, why different basal phosphorylation patterns of CFTR exist (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Since the early work of Wilkinson et al. (29), there has been debate regarding the role of different phosphorylation sites in CFTR channel function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Residues S737 and S768 were reported to be inhibitory sites because changing them to alanine lowers the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) requirement for channel activation (29); however, later work questioned these findings (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In our FLIPR membrane potential assay setup, the forskolin concentration (10 μM) used to achieve full activation and the lag time between drug addition and the next time point read did not allow us to comment on the kinetics of activation, but we observed a significantly decreased total membrane potential change after forskolin stimulation for both S768A and Δ760–780 mutants lacking the possibility of phosphorylation at residue 768, strongly indicative of a direct interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the rank order of reported IBMX dose-dependent data on serine-to-alanine mutants (29) matches within error to our R-region phosphorylation kinetic results (Fig. 4), with the exception of phosphorylation at 660 that was reported to have a small effect but for which we see rapid phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>This difference may be due to NBD1 in full-length CFTR restricting access to the 660 site for PKA. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Considering the importance of calcium signaling in the regulation of airway fluid secretion (4) and the fact that CF patients with impaired CFTR function have altered calcium concentration regulation (40), it is not surprising that calcium signal-activated CFTR and CFTR-regulated calcium signaling were recently the targets of many studies (6, 8, 41). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>A number of membrane channels and transporters in close proximity to CFTR have been reported to interact with calmodulin using the alternative binding mode in which calmodulin reversibly cross-links two protein ligands (18, 23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>These include Orai1 (25), the sodium channel NaV1.5 (26), and the potassium channel Kv7.1 (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>This cross-linking is expected to play a significant role in functional regulation and in macromolecular complex assembly (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The finding that individual lobes give rise to identical NMR signal perturbation as full-length calmodulin indicates that a single lobe of calmodulin is sufficient to regulate CFTR and provides evidence for CFTR using the alternative calmodulin-binding mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the measured binding affinity for this interaction is in good agreement with other alternative binding mode substrates, but not with canonical ligands (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, calcium signaling is predicted to have a significant role in the regulation of CFTR microdomain assembly by physically cross-linking channels and transporters to CFTR (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>In a recent study, KCa3.1 has been shown to interact with CFTR in a calcium-dependent manner involving calmodulin, supporting this model (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>These interactions are likely part of a network among the membrane proteins within the microdomain, either involving direct calmodulin interactions or increased contacts due to the close and fixed proximity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>A central component of this network is the intrinsically disordered R region of CFTR responsible for almost all of the regulatory intermolecular protein interactions of CFTR (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Regulatory signals from various sources converge on R region (1) and calmodulin interaction may be one of the ways this information is distributed within the macromolecular complex to control and synchronize ion channel and transport functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Although activation of nonphosphorylated F508del mutant CFTR by calmodulin was similar to wild type, phosphorylated channels displayed completely opposite responses in our VX-809–treated HEK-293 overexpressing cell system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>These results indicate altered phosphorylation and accessibility and therefore different interactions of R region in the mutant protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>PKA phosphorylation completely decouples calcium signaling from wild-type CFTR, but not the F508del mutant, potentially enabling stimulation of other membrane protein channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>For instance, this additional stimulus can increase activity of the apical calcium channels, leading to an elevated local calcium concentration (23) that is associated with the constant inflammation seen in CF patients (42, 43). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results we described on the cross-talk between calcium and cAMP signaling in CFTR channel function and regulation provide a detailed view of this interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Although no evidence of the direct interaction between calmodulin and CFTR has been described previously, differences in basal phosphorylation patterns at the three interaction segments in various cell types and under various conditions may provide an explanation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Importantly, differences in phosphorylation patterns between wild type and F508del may enable targeting of this interaction with small molecules that prevent mutant CFTR from calmodulin binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Based on the ability of calmodulin to couple CFTR to other membrane channels and transporters, including those in the ER accessible even to CFTR that does not reach the plasma membrane, this could modulate calcium signaling to reduce inflammation and provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients. </plain></SENT>
