METHODS AND MATERIALS: To develop a preclinical model that predicts clinical activity of novel agents in 19 RCC patients, we established patient-derived cell (PDC) and xenograft (PDX) models derived from malignant effusions or surgical specimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful PDCs, defined as cells that maintained growth following two passages, were established in 5 of 15 malignant effusions and 1 of 4 surgical specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One PDC, clinically refractory to TKIs, was implanted and engrafted in mice, resulting in a comparable histology to the primary tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PDC-PDX model also showed similar genomic features when tested using targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When we examined the drug effects of the PDX model, the tumor cells showed resistance to TKIs and everolimus in vitro. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the PDC-PDX preclinical model we developed using malignant effusions can be a useful preclinical model to interrogate sensitivity to targeted agents based on genomic alterations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents a unique clinical setting for the application of antiangiogenic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Targeting angiogenesis via the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways has produced robust clinical effects and revolutionized the treatment of metastatic RCC (mRCC) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against VEGFR such as sunitinib [2], sorafenib [3], and pazopanib [4] have demonstrated improved progression-free survival and/or overall survival compared with interferon and/or supportive care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, some patients with clear cell mRCC who received these TKIs do not achieve response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also, in most responders, resistance to therapy will eventually develop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While the mechanisms of resistance to VEGFR TKIs are not yet well understood, there is a need to develop new therapeutic options overcoming TKI resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The goal should be met through preclinical models that reliably predict clinical activity of novel antiangiogenic compounds in patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It becomes increasingly clear that novel preclinical models that more closely simulate the heterogeneity of human cancers are needed for more efficient oncology drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Until recently, drug screening of cancer has emphasized xenograft models derived from the established, conventional cell lines and [5], in some cases, from patient samples [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As the limitations of current xenograft models derived from previously established cell lines have been well described [7], patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models may provide more accurate depiction of the human cancers they are derived from than cell line–derived xenografts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As patient-derived models might reflect a clinical response better [8] and the ability to obtain metastatic tumor samples is not always possible, we already have established disease-specific panels of patient-derived cell (PDC) models directly from malignant effusions [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Both PDC lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) made from malignant effusions are alternative models that may overcome sample challenges. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>So far, numerous tumor-specific PDX models have been established, and importantly, they are biologically mostly stable when passaged in mice in terms of gene expression patterns, mutational status, metastatic potential, and drug responsiveness [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the practical relevance of PDX models for application in clinical oncology is limited owing to the time required for PDX establishment (~4 months) since mRCC patients with refractory disease live less than 1 year [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Despite an obvious advantage of PDX over xenografts from cell lines [12], their application has been criticized by the fact that many PDXs are established from the primary tumors or, in some cases, from metastatic sites of previously untreated patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thereby, they fail to reproduce the refractory patient population in whom most novel therapeutics will undergo their initial trials [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, tumor take rates may be higher for metastases with more aggressive phenotypes than primary tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In an effort to develop a novel PDX model with PDCs, we established a large collection of RCC PDC models directly derived from malignant effusions or ascites collected after TKI failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This model could be used to develop new therapeutic targets, to better understand the basis of sensitivity of tumors from individual patients, and potentially to help the stratification of patients according to molecular characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>TKI-resistant PDCs were selected and tested further using PDX cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>All patients had clear cell carcinoma in either alveolar or tubular configurations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>These tumors were aggressive in clinical behavior; 12 patients experienced intrinsic resistance to first-line sunitinib or pazopanib, whereas 7 patients had secondary resistant tumors (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Cells from all patients were stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Papanicolaou, and micrographs were prospectively stored in our internal database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Successful PDCs, defined as cells that maintained growth following 2 passages, were established in 5 of 15 effusions and 1 of 4 surgical specimens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>After successful PDC establishment from malignant effusions, we implanted one PDC (no. 395) in NSG mice to evaluate whether PDCs could successfully be converted to a PDX model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The PDX was serially passaged for five times before it was used for experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The PDC-PDX model exhibited histological features and immunohistochemistry findings similar to those of the primary tumor (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In the primary tumor, clear cells are arranged in an alveolar pattern, while granular cells are in a solid pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>PDX tumor showed similar findings where the cytoplasm was eosinophilic and the nuclei had prominent nucleoli and coarse chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The patient (no. 395, 39-year-old male) presented with a diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma of the right kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Fifteen months after his surgical resection, the patient developed multiple lung and lymph node metastases (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>He had been treated with sunitinib at 50 mg per day for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Six weeks after starting the sunitinib therapy, metastatic lesions showed progression, and large amount of bilateral pleural effusions developed (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>After thoracentesis for a therapeutic purpose, at which a PDC was established, everolimus had been administered but failed to achieve any clinical benefit. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>To confirm the similarity of genomic features between the primary tumor and PDX, we compared variant allele frequency results of the primary tumor and single cell suspensions from the PDX tumor at passage 5 (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>With targeted sequencing for 381 cancer-related genes, these 2 samples showed surprisingly similar genomic alterations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of primary tumor and PDX revealed mutual deletions in TP53, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) and von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), both of which are thought to be related with RCC carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We then examined the drug effects on cell viability as described in the Methods section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Antitumor activity of 18 drugs (pazopanib, sunitinib, everolimus, lapatinib, BEZ235, BGJ-398, and others) was tested against no. 395 PDCs (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In accordance to his clinical resistance to VEGFR TKIs and everolimus, we confirmed that cells were resistant to most VEGFR TKIs tested, with an IC50 of more than 10 μM for everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The drugs with IC50 values below 4.0 μM included neratinib, BEZ235, and BGJ-398. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>To define the role of these drugs in TKI-resistant clear cell RCC, cells were treated again to assess cell viability using CellTiter-Glo reagents (Supplement file 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>As expected, BEZ235 and BGJ-398 inhibited cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.015 μM and 0.79 μM, respectively (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>A subsequent immunofluorescence assay showed mTOR protein expression in the cytoplasm and FGFR2 in the nuclei (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Western blot confirmed the expression of mTOR/PI3K and FGFR2 proteins in the cells (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Treatment strategies targeting angiogenesis via the VEGFR TKIs or mTOR inhibitors have dramatically improved the treatment outcomes for patients with clear cell mRCC [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>While most patients would develop adaptive or secondary resistance to these targeted agents after months or even after years of clinical benefit, a substantial number of patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to VEGFR TKIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Once this has happened, limited treatment options remain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this subset of patients with intrinsic resistance rarely responds to subsequent therapy such as mTOR inhibitors or other VEGFR TKIs [15], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This raises a need for the development of novel therapeutics to overcome VEGFR TKI resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Historically, in cancer research, the development of new agents is predominantly based on preclinical studies of drug activity, typically tested with in vitro cell lines and in vivo murine model systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>While conventional cell lines are convenient and easily accessible, their predictive power has been poor [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The ability to establish preclinical models that closely resemble actual tumor in vivo in terms of molecular profiles and clinical behaviors holds enormous promise in oncology drug development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed PDC and PDX models using cancer cells derived from malignant effusions that exhibited morphologic features and genomic profiles similar to those of tumor tissue samples in patients with clear cell mRCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>PDC from malignant effusions has more than a few advantages over conventional cell lines [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>First, PDC models faithfully recapitulated primary patient tumors, with the molecular and gross phenotypic characteristics of the primary tumor retained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Second, the median time from specimen collection to PDC passage 1 takes only 3 weeks, which is more feasible for clinical application than xenograft models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Third, we found that the success rate is as high as &gt;70% of attempted cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Fourth, although only tested in a limited setting so far, PDC could be successfully engrafted into immunocompromised mice; thus, PDCs can be used both in vitro and as a cell source for further in vivo analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Although tested for exploratory purposes, we assessed the sensitivity of tumor to a number of targeted drugs including sunitinib and pazopanib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>As a result, the tumor cells were resistant to VEGFR TKIs as well as to everolimus, concordant with the actual clinical responses to sunitinib and everolimus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>As stated above, the limitations of current preclinical models have been well described [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In contrast, PDX may represent more meaningful models for the development of novel therapeutic agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>As they normally display similar heterogeneity to the tumors they are originally derived from, they can predict the subsequent clinical outcomes more accurately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>This allows for mechanistic studies of clinical agents that cannot be done in the patient themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Establishing PDX models from surgical specimens faces certain limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>There is a need for a sufficient amount of fresh tumor tissue, and unless the patient is scheduled for surgery, available tumor material might not be sufficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Moreover, depending on the originating histology, the failure rate in PDX establishment can be substantial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In addition, the use of “personalized” PDX models (Avatar trials) is most likely limited due to the need for sufficient time to generate in vivo study results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Very often, oncologists need to decide much quicker which second-line or third-line therapy the patient has to be switched to. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The time required for generating a PDX model, as well as the success rate, directly correlates with tumor aggressiveness, invasiveness, and the quality and quantity of malignant tissue received [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Malignant effusions in mRCC are known to be seen only in patients with multiple metastatic disease [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Therefore, PDCs from malignant effusions can be preferred to surgical specimens in PDX establishment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>One may argue that passages and the establishment of a PDX may allow additional DNA alterations to occur within the tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In addition, malignant body fluids such as effusions or ascites could only be collected from patients with far-advanced disease, and most of them already acquired clinical resistant to targeted agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>While the mechanisms of resistance to TKIs are not fully understood, it is generally acknowledged that secondary genetic alterations after repeated exposure to targeted agents may be responsible for the development of resistance [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the results from the PDC drug test with BEZ235 and BGJ-398 were not reproduced in subsequent PDX model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are needed if it may be due to a different tumor microenvironment or secondary mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>However, we observed the similarity of genomic features between the primary tumor and single cell suspensions from the PDX tumor at passage 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Still, it also is advantageous having not only PDX models of primary tumors at hand but also models generated from tumors after therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>It is of increasing interest to pharmaceutical companies getting their hands on models that have arisen from tumor material that has received initial chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>This way, second-line and third-line therapeutic agents can be developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our study demonstrated that the preclinical model we developed can be a useful preclinical model to interrogate sensitivity to targeted agents based on genomic alterations [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Although the results are based on an observation of a single case, the PDC model from malignant effusions of patients was successfully converted to a PDX model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>While larger studies are required to further evaluate and confirm the usefulness of the PDC-PDX model, this pilot study suggests that our novel patient-derived preclinical model from malignant effusions represents an important and feasible platform for future cancer research. </plain></SENT>
