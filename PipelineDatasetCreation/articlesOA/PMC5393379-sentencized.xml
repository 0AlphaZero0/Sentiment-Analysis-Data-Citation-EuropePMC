</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rise of Ediacara-type organisms, as well as the Cambrian explosion, is traditionally connected with the increasing oxygen levels of late-Proterozoic oceans (see, f.i., Anbar and Knoll 2002; Narbonne 2005; Canfield et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>2015; Tostevin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2016; and reference therein). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, knowledge is growing about eukaryotes inhabiting hypoxic, anoxic, or even euxinic environments: such organisms are scattered across many different branches of the tree of eukaryote life (Levin 2003; Engel 2007; Danovaro et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>2010; Borgonie et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>2011; Danovaro et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the existence of several unrelated eukaryotes that are able to live at low oxygen concentration, or even with no oxygen at all (Danovaro et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>2010, 2016; but see Bernhard et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2015), suggests this to be a plesiomorphy of all eukaryotes, whose common ancestor ought to have been a facultative anaerobe (Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>2012; Mentel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In any case, the palaeobiochemistry of early eukaryotes and early metazoans is intimately interwoven with the evolutionary history of mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>No doubt can be currently cast on the endosymbiontic origin of mitochondria from α-proteobacterial-like ancestors (Gray et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>1999; Sicheritz-Ponten and Andersson 2001; Fitzpatrick et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>2006; Atteia et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>2011; Gray 2012; Degli Esposti et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>2014; Gray 2015), but the detailed steps of this process are largely unknown and several hypotheses have been proposed (Gray 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Organelles of Mitochondrial Origin (OMOs) have been identified in all eukaryotes (Hjort et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>2010; Shiflett and Johnson 2010; Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>2012) and notably, some of them work in anaerobic conditions too (Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>2012; Mentel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is conceivable that the common ancestor of all mitochondria was at least able to survive under hypoxia (Wang and Wu 2014), if not full anoxia (Mentel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, all eukaryotes have inherited OMOs (including typical mitochondria) that are in some way effective in anoxic episodes too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant hypoxic/anoxic events are reported in geological strata (f.i., Li et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>It is therefore conceivable, recall this scenario that eukaryotic life evolved on pre-existent protomitochondrial features, under aerobic, anaerobic, and all intermediate conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Given the gene content of extant genome-owning OMOs, a large proportion of the endosymbiont genome have been lost or transferred to the nucleus, a process termed Genome Reductive Evolution (GRE; Andersson and Kurland 1998; Khachane et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>2007; Ghiselli et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>2013; Kannan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Only few protein coding genes (PCGs) are still retained in the organelle genome: typically they are 13 in metazoans’ mitochondria (see, e.g. Boore 1999; Breton et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>2014), but down to three in apicomplexans (Feagin 1994; Rehkopf et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>A possible reason for their retention in the mitochondrial genome is that these genes must be directly regulated by mitochondrial environment, being co-location mandatory for an effective redox regulation (CoRR hypothesis; Race et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>1999; Allen 2003a, 2003b; Lane 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Bivalves and gastropods are the two largest classes of molluscs, with ∼3,550 and ∼7,900 genera, respectively (Millard 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Both classes originated in the Lower Cambrian and were initially composed by epibenthic species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>However, at the beginning of the Ordovician, their evolutionary pathways diverged, because bivalves experienced a huge change in their living habits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The few Cambrian forms of bivalves slowly disappered and modern bivalves arose (Cope 1996; Fang 2006; Sánchez 2008; Fang and Sánchez 2012; Cope and Kříž 2013; Polechová 2015; Mondal and Harries 2016a, 2016b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This transition was remarkably driven by the invasion of the infaunal (or endobenthic) zone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>During the so-called Cambrian Substrate Revolution (Bottjer et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>2000; Dornbos et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>2004), Neoproterozoic coherent matgrounds shifted to bioturbated mixgrounds, and the ancestral, surface-crawling bivalve forms, which fed by sediment grazing (Seilacher 1999; Bottjer et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>2000; Dornbos et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>2004; Fang 2006; Mondal and Harries 2016a), evolved into filter-feeding sediment burrowers (Fang and Sánchez 2012; Polechová 2015; Mondal and Harries 2016a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, was coupled with several major changes in body shape: pedal palps, palp proboscides, gills, as well as foot, were all affected by the infaunalization process and, consequently, heavily reduced or highly modified (Cope 1996; Fang and Sánchez 2012; Cope and Kříž 2013; Mondal and Harries 2016a, 2016b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the infaunalization of bivalves had another, not minor, outcome, as the infaunal zone is also typically hypoxic, and even anoxic in some cases (Anbar and Knoll 2002; Fang and Sánchez 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It is not unconceivable that more efficient and enlarged ctenidia, suitable for gas exchange in deeper and possibly anoxic sediments, was itself the trigger that eventually led to the evolution of the distinctive bivalve feeding gills (Morton 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, the adaptation to less oxygenated environments ought to have triggered more profound biochemical changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>If, in some way, the mitochondrial machinery adapted to hypoxic conditions, directional selective pressures on key genes are expected, as well as the ability to exploit different, hypoxia-optimized respiratory substrates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Specifically, different quinone (Q) types are known from different organisms and they show variable efficiency with respect to oxygen levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Menaquinone is the dominant membrane Q in some prokaryotes, like gram-positive bacteria (Degli Esposti 2015); plastoquinone is the typical membrane Q of cyanobacteria (Battchikova et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>According to Aussel and colleagues (2014), the rise of atmospheric oxygen eventually led to ubiquinone, by allowing the required hydroxylation reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Ubiquinone is basically ubiquitous across the tree of life: respiratory Complex I is the common name of the largest, multi-subunit complex of the respiratory chain, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Wirth et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Rhodoquinone (RQ) is a rare ubiquinone analog and performs poorly as a substrate for respiratory complexes I and II (Lenaz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>1968). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>However, it is known to be correlated with anaerobiosis in many protists and metazoans (Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>2012; Degli Esposti 2015); notably, bivalves are among those hypoxia-exposed animals that were found to contain RQ (Van Hellemond et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a handful of genetic signatures on some Complex I subunits, as well as on the cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III), were linked to the presence of RQ in the respiratory chain (Degli Esposti 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>One of the Complex I subunits that show RQ-related mutations is the mitochondrially-encoded NuoH (NAD1; Degli Esposti 2015); the cytchrome b gene (cytb) also maps onto mitochondrial genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>All this considered, it is conceivable that the use of RQ had a pivotal role in the infaunalization of bivalves and that the examination of nad1 and cytb may show clues of this biochemical fine-tuning, with special reference to the Q reacting chamber. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Indeed, mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) of extant bivalves and gastropods are the outcomes of more than 480 Myr of post-Ordovician evolution and they do enclose several genetic signatures of their legacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In fact, molluscan mtDNAs often show peculiar features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>For example, gastropod mtDNAs show high levels of gene-gene overlapping boundaries (White et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>2011), and are extremely divergent from other mtDNAs (Thomaz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>1996; Chiba 1999; Parmakelis and Mylonas 2004; Pinceel et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>2005; Parmakelis et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Bivalve mtDNAs may be very large molecules, up to the 46,985 bp of Scapharca broughtonii (Liu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>2013; Plazzi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>2016); often contain many regions that are apparently untranslated (Ghiselli et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>2013); may present the phenomenon called Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI), where two separate, sex-linked mitochondrial lineages are passed from parents to offspring (Breton et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>2007; Passamonti and Ghiselli 2009; Zouros 2013; Breton et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>2014); appear to encode supernumerary open reading frames (Breton et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>2009; Milani et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>2013); have a terrific degree of gene rearrangement (Vallès and Boore 2006; Simison and Boore 2008; Plazzi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>2013); may follow a very unbalanced strand usage (Plazzi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Even if mitochondria, as aforementioned, most probably retained some sort of ability to live and work in hypoxia, their efficiency with lower concentrations in oxygen was probably improved with infaunalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the adaptation to hypoxia in terms of natural selection trends and quinone pool-related signatures on bivalve mitochondrial genomes; moreover, we compared them to gastropods, which did not underwent a massive infaunalization, with respect to the common ancestor of conchiferans (Brusca et al. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Probably the key of the stunning evolutionary success of molluscs is mainly due to the versatility of their original Bauplan, with special reference to foot muscle, shell (at least for conchiferans), mantle cavity, and bipectinate gills (ctenidia). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Bivalves and gastropods are strictly related conchiferans, therefore they share a long array of features, but a key difference, which probably was the trigger of most of the other bivalve autapomorphies (e.g. the bivalve shell, the loss of a head, lamellibranchiate gills; see Morton 1996), is the shift to the infaunal zone itself. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>It is known that bivalve mitochondria can turn off Complexes II, III, IV in anaerobic conditions, the proton gradient being established thanks to Complex I alone (Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the peculiar dN/dS pattern of bivalves (fig. 2 and see supplementary Additional file S9, Supplementary Material online): during the early infaunalization phase, Complex I probably underwent massive selective pressures to improve its efficiency to adapt to the new environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Conversely, gastropods did not enter the infaunal zone and coherently do not show the Ordovician Complex I signature of bivalves (see supplementary Additional file S10, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Again, nothing similar was detected for gastropods (see supplementary Additional file S10, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>2015), therefore we cannot reject the hypothesis that the peculiar pattern of bivalve atp6 is connected to some feature of this single gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Directional selective pressure on Complex I seems to become milder in correspondence with the increasing atmospheric levels of oxygen (see supplementary Additional file S9, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the overall higher oxygen partial pressure led to an overall increase in dissolved oxygen, which ended up in a higher oxygen availability within sediments, where bivalves then stably lived and speciated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, selective pressure may have been relaxed for bivalve mtDNAs; once more, nothing similar happened to epibenthic gastropods (see supplementary Additional file S10, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Given that no clear link with environmental redox conditions is known for Lower Devonian gastropods, this may find a taxonomic explanation in the radiation of Gastropoda, instead of a palaeochemical/palaeoecological one as in bivalves: indeed, we found most signal of gastropod—especially heterobranch— radiation exactly in the Devonian period (fig. 1 and see supplementary Additional file S7, Supplementary Material online), which is in broad agreement with current knowledge on gastropod evolution (see, f.i., Dinapoli and Klussmann-Kolb 2010; and references therein). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The amine group increases the number of potential H bonds that RQ can form with interacting enzymes: the substitution of T204 with Lys in cytochrome b sequence is a change that also increases the number of potential H bonds and was found to be typical of RQ-containing species, including bivalves like Mytilus edulis and Ostrea edulis (Degli Esposti 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Although T204 is highly conserved in metazoans, it is much more variable in bivalves, and 15 bivalve mtDNAs showed a Lys instead, confirming those findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Notably, this tendence is even stronger in the gastropod dataset, where as many as 50 species showed a Lys: thus, we suggest that a low conservation of T204 was an earlier synapomorphy of Conchifera, and may well have been exapted by bivalves to exploit the potential of RQ in low-oxygen conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a conserved G52 in the nad1 gene was found to be the rule for all metazoans (including gastropods); however, it is substituted in about half the bivalve sequences; often (37 times) it is replaced with a H-bond forming amino acid, Ser, again confirming previous findings on M. edulis and Crassostrea angulata (Degli Esposti 2015). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Most interestingly, some of these trends appear to be shared at least with gastropods (K204 in the cytb gene; nonconservativity of M42 in the nad1 gene), while other appear to be bivalve-specific (S52 and nonconservativity of Q43 in the nad1 gene). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Beside gathering direct evidence of the respiratory substrates exploited by bivalves, we note that it may be very interesting in the future to investigate the same sites in other molluscan classes (like cephalopods, or polyplacophorans), to identify plesiomorphies of molluscs/conchiferans and spot out bivalve autapomorphies related to the adaptation to hypoxia, which were gained through the intense selective pressure that was described above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Concluding, the major driving force in bivalve history (Ordovician infaunalization) seems to be deeply connected with a period of intense directional selection on mitochondrial Complex I, which, on the other side, looks totally absent from gastropod data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>There are other metazoans group that share with bivalves the infaunal life and the ability to turn off Complexes II, III, and IV during anoxic events, like some flatworms, annelids, and peanut worms (Müller et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>It would be very stimulating to confirm or disprove the same pattern of selection on mtDNA by applying the present pipeline to these diverse metazoan taxa, as well as to analyze whether the same pattern of selection is mirrored or not in the genes for the other subunits of the respiratory chain complexes, which are coded by the nucleus and poorly studied for bivalves. </plain></SENT>
