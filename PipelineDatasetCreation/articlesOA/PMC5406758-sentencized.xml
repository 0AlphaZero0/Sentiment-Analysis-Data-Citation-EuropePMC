<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Approximately 84% of anal carcinoma is associated with high-risk types of human papilloma virus (HPV), primarily HPV-16 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The standard of care for localized disease is chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin in combination with radiotherapy, which results in a 5-year disease-free survival rate of ∼60% [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Based on limited data, the standard of care after progression or development of distant metastatic disease is 5-FU and cisplatin, and the 5-year survival rate for these patients is ∼15%; however, if cisplatin-based chemotherapy fails, no other regimens have been shown to be effective [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Many cancers evade immune surveillance and destruction through upregulation of the immune cell checkpoint molecule programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interaction between the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, expressed on tumor-infiltrating T cells, and its ligand PD-L1 leads to the functional inactivation of T cells, a mechanism known as adaptive immune resistance [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 and PD-L1, including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab, have demonstrated antitumor activity in a diverse set of tumor types [9–11]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Because PD-L1 expression is associated with higher antitumor activity of PD-1 blockade in other tumor types [12–14], PD-L1 positivity was used as a selection criterion in this study to potentially enrich for patients most likely to respond to pembrolizumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In this population of mostly pretreated patients with PD-L1-positive advanced anal carcinoma, pembrolizumab demonstrated manageable safety and encouraging antitumor activity, with an ORR of 17% in those patients with SCC histology (4 of 24 patients). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study represents the first published manuscript describing immune checkpoint blockade in patients with previously treated advanced anal carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>PD-L1 positivity, which had not been previously defined in anal cancer, was found to be high (74% of screened patients) in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The high rate of PD-L1 expression in anal cancer may not be surprising given the immune responses against the HPV E7 oncoprotein identified previously in this tumor type [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>High frequencies of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and inflammatory responses have been identified in virally driven cancers and have been linked with upregulation of PD-L1 in HPV-associated head and neck cancer [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>This upregulation of PD-L1 is mediated by interferon-γ secreted by T cells and has been termed ‘adaptive immune resistance’ [8, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>HPV status was not collected in this study and was only available for three of the enrolled patients (two responders and one non-responder), all of whom were HPV positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The number of patients in this study with known HPV status was too small to determine an association with pembrolizumab activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Similar to the results of other immune checkpoint inhibitors in various tumor types [11–13], only a subset of patients with PD-L1-positive tumors in this study experienced clinical benefit, suggesting that other biomarkers should be explored for the ability to predict antitumor activity of pembrolizumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Immune gene signatures were shown to correlate with response to PD-1 blockade in several other solid tumor types [21–23], and an association between tumor infiltration of CD8+ and CD3+ T cells with response to PD-1 inhibition was reported with another anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with SCC anal carcinoma [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Mutational load has been reported to correlate with response to immune checkpoint blockade in other cancers including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, and may be relevant in advanced anal carcinoma as well [25–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Although the mutational rate of anal cancer has not been assessed comprehensively, it has been reported to be in the intermediate range, along with other HPV-associated cancers such as head and neck and cervical cancer [29–31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, pembrolizumab demonstrated manageable safety and encouraging antitumor activity in patients with PD-L1-positive advanced SCC anal carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of PD-1 blockade, alone or in combination with a partnering agent, in this patient population and of potential biomarkers is warranted. </plain></SENT>
