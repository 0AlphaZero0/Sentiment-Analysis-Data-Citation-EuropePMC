</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is well known that glutamate (Glu) is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and that excitotoxicity is induced by the sustained stimulation of glutamatergic receptors, which include: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and kainic acid (KA) receptors [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Glu excitotoxicity causes neuronal cell death through the disruption of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis, which is followed by mitochondrial uncoupling and activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by triggering caspases activation [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This condition is one of the main characteristics of many neurodegenerative disorders, including, ischemic injury, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer´s and Parkinson´s [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It has been established that prolactin (PRL), a peptidic hormone mainly synthesized by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland [5,6], exerts both behavioral and molecular effects in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Examples of the former are the induction of maternal behavior [7] and reduction of anxiety [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Among the latter effects are the stimulation of neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb [9], glia activation [10], remyelination of oligodendrocytes [11], and proliferation of precursor cells in the adult mouse hippocampus [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Both in vivo and in vitro studies by our group, have the increased evidence supporting that PRL affords neuroprotection against excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid and Glu [13–16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that PRL-mediated neuroprotection in hippocampal cells occurs via the activation of its receptor [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, the neuroprotective mechanism of PRL against excitotoxicity has not been completely explored, although several actions have been suggested, including changes in neurotransmission, anti-apoptotic effects, and the regulation of neurotrophic factors [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The classical mechanism of PRL action, involves its transcriptional activity via JAK2/STAT and MAPKs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These pathways are involved in survival, metabolism and cell proliferation [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the activation of other pathways such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by PRL have been described in other tissues [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>NF-κB is an ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by a variety of cytokines including the tumor necrosis factor (TNF). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>NF-κB activation depends on the IκB proteins phosphorylation and degradation, which allow the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to exert its transcriptional activity upon anti-apoptotic genes in different cells types including neurons, thereby blocking apoptosis [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Similar to the neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions of PRL in the central nervous system, it has been demonstrated that the trophic factor TGF-β1 exerts neuroprotection against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this effect is mediated by an increase in Bcl-2 expression through NF-κB activation [20,21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms mediating PRL neuroprotection against excitotoxic neuronal death requires further clarification, therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of PRL on different process involved in excitotoxicity, such as the loss of the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, the disruption of mitochondrial activity, caspase activation and expression of apoptotic proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We observed that cells exposed to Glu in the presence of PRL, preserved the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial activity, inhibited caspase-3 activation and reduced the apoptotic ratio (Bax/Bcl-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PRL induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, suggesting that its anti-apoptotic effects might be mediated by the activity of this transcription factor on downstream apoptotic genes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Excitotoxicity has been recognized as a central process in neuronal damage, such as that occurring during brain ischemia, hypoxia and neurodegenerative diseases [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported, that PRL provides neuroprotection against excitotoxicity in vivo [13,14,16], and that it mediates (via its receptor) neuroprotection against Glu-induced excitotoxicity in rat primary cultures of hippocampal neurons [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In addition, other reports have also demonstrated that PRL may protect against cell damage by causing changes in neurotransmission [34,35], as well as in the regulation of neurotrophic factors and astrocyte proliferation [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism by which PRL affords neuroprotection in both in vitro and in vivo models remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The most important findings of the present study are that PRL exerts a neuroprotective action against Glu excitotoxicity through the attenuation of [Ca2+]i overload and the induction of NF-κB nuclear translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This result in a subsequent increase in Bcl-2 expression and thereby a decrease in the pro-apoptotic ratio (Bax/Bcl-2), accompanied by the preservation of mitochondrial activity and the reduction in caspase-3 activation on an in vitro model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective action of PRL observed in the Syto-13/PI-staining and in the LDH assay presented in this study are in accordance with previous reports by our group, in which we demonstrate that PRL stimulates hippocampal neuronal survival, both in lactating rats [13,14] and in ovariectomized PRL-treated animals [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the LDH assay showed a small participation of necrotic cell death during Glu excitotoxicity as compared with the PRL effect reducing the apoptotic component of the cell death induced by Glu. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was observed by recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), which prevents mitochondrial damage induced by methadone, a specific agonist of NMDA receptors [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Considering, that PRL maintains cell viability and mitochondrial activity, we analyzed its neuroprotective effects on intracellular [Ca2+] overload, which is the main factor implicated in cell death caused by excitotoxicity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In accordance, a recent study, showed that rhGH, a member of the growth hormone-like superfamily, which includes PRL, acted as a neuroprotector against methadone-induced toxicity in primary cultures of cortical neurons, through the alteration of the expression of NMDA receptors subunits [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Our group is currently exploring the possible effect of PRL on the modulation of glutamate receptors in the present neurotoxicity model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it is well known that a Glu-induced [Ca2+]i overload leads to the activation of apoptotic cell death [41], since we demonstrated that PRL decrease both the apoptotic cell death and [Ca2+]i overload. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated the effect of PRL on the apoptotic caspase pathway, which depends on the cleavage of procaspase-3 into its active fragments and on changes in Bax/Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>We observed that PRL significantly reduced procaspase-3 cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This observation is in agreement with previous studies, reporting that PRL down-regulates caspase-3 mRNA levels and enzyme activity in rat decidua [42], and that it induces a decrease in the spontaneous DNA strand breaks and the concomitant suppression of caspase activation in human spermatozoa [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been shown that PRL stimulates survival in Nb2 cells exposed to dexamethasone by blocking caspase activation and inducing Bcl-2 overexpression [44,45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The induction of apoptosis depends on the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins more than their individual levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The present results demonstrate that cells exposed to Glu alone showed a notable increase in the pro-apoptotic ratio (Bax/Bcl-2) due to a decrease in Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Despite increased Bax levels observed in the presence of PRL, the pro-apoptotic value, for neurons exposed only to PRL or with PRL/Glu, was similar to that found in the control group, due to the increment of Bcl-2 protein expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Thus, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of PRL may also be mediated by an increase of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This observation that PRL improves cell viability through the overexpression of Bcl-2, has been reported in chondrocytes treated with PRL and deprived of serum or exposed to INF-γ to induce apoptosis [46,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional changes in anti-apoptotic genes have been previously observed in pancreatic β-islets exposed to PRL [48,49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In a previous study using a similar model of excitotoxic damage, the authors reported that protection by TGF-β1 against NMDA toxicity was associated with an increase in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic proteins [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there are some reports on both in vivo and in vitro models, in which it has been reported that leptin (a member of adipocytokines like PRL) exerts neuroprotective effects through the inhibition of apoptosis via JAK/STAT pathway activation [51,52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these changes have been associated with NF-κB activation in hippocampal neurons treated with TGF-β1 [21,53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>These observations were similar to our present results, which showed that PRL treatment stimulated NF-κB activation, while untreated neurons lost the NF-κB signal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In contrast, It has been reported that Bax induction in hippocampal and cortical neurons might be induced by an independent NF-kB pathway [54], and thus, further research about parallel Bcl-2 and Bax induction by PRL during neuronal excitotoxic damage requires to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Hence, these observations support the critical role of Bcl-2 expression in the neuroprotective effect of PRL against Glu-induced excitotoxicity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Overall, the current results suggest that PRL afforded neuroprotection effect against Glu-induced excitotoxicity in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, due in part to the preservation of [Ca2+]i homeostasis, and cell survival through the up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression, probably via NF-κB pathway. </plain></SENT>
