</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in Western countries and a major cause of cancer-related mortality [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PCa is a heterogeneous disease with several molecular and clinicopathological subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The TMPRSS2:ERG (T/E) gene fusion, resulting from a chromosomal rearrangement of ERG (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 homolog (avian)) to the androgen responsive gene TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2), is the most frequent somatic alteration in PCa [3], and detectable in 50% of the tumors [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In those cases, ERG overexpression is driven by the androgen-responsive promoter of TMPRSS2, resulting in upregulation of ERG protein and activation of downstream target genes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of PCas overexpressing ERG harbor T/E fusions [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, no consensus on the prognostic significance of T/E fusion-positive tumors has been reached so far [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This may be due to differences in tumor characteristics and multiple T/E isoforms [6, 8, 9], which have been associated with clinicopathological parameters [10] and progression [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The most common fusion mRNA variant III (T/E III), containing exon 1 of TMPRSS2 (1-17bp) and exons 4-11 of ERG (T1/E4), is present in 86% of fusion-positive tumors [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Since exon 1 of TMPRSS2 is noncoding, this mRNA is translated from an internal ATG site, resulting in a truncated ERG protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The expression of T/E VI, resulting from fusion of exons 1-2 of TMPRSS2 to exons 4-11 of ERG (T2/E4), has been associated with aggressive disease [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This mRNA is translated from a start codon within TMPRSS2 exon 2 that is in frame with the ERG ORF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The resulting protein includes the first five amino acids of TMPRSS2 and lacks the first 12 amino acids of the full-length ERG protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Previously, we found T/E specific transcriptional upregulation of genes associated with activated TGF-β/BMP and WNT signaling in fusion-positive PCa compared to fusion-negative PCa [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>TGF-β and WNT signaling regulate a diverse range of cellular processes related to cancer progression [14, 15] and are major inducers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Here, our aim was to characterize the molecular mechanisms and functional implications of T/E variant overexpression and their consequences on cellular and molecular phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We focused on the analysis of T/E III and T/E VI gene fusion variants based on their frequencies of occurrence and their association with clinical and pathological variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We established LNCaP cells, featuring androgen-independency with high levels of androgen receptor (AR), stably overexpressing the T/E III and VI variants in an inducible promoter system (LNCaP-T/E) and examined the effects of overexpression on cellular properties and signal transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To validate the observed transcriptional modulation upon ERG overexpression in LNCaP, the T/E-positive prostate cancer cell line NCI-H660 [17] was employed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This cell line harbors both T/E III and T/E VI fusions [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Complementary to the LNCaP-T/E model, ERG was silenced in NCI-H660 using an ERG-specific siRNA and mRNA levels of the targets previously measured in LNCaP-T/E clones were assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Overall, we found a large degree of commonality but also distinct transcriptional effects between T/E III and VI variants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>QPCR analysis after Dox-induction showed ∼50-fold and ∼150-fold upregulation of ERG in T/E III and T/E VI cells, respectively (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of ERG protein in Dox-induced LNCaP-T/E cells only (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In line with previous reports that ERG expression leads to downregulation of AR transcripts [18], both LNCaP-T/E III and VI cell lines showed markedly decreased AR protein after ERG overexpression (Figure 1C), indicating that the cell lines faithfully reflect the in vivo situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Concurrent with reports that lower AR expression is associated with reduced differentiation of PCa cells [19], we noticed morphological changes, including cellular rounding, spindle-like branching, and detachment from adjacent cells (Figure 1D), which resembled a fibroblast-like morphology. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed genes (&gt; 1.5 fold change cut-off; p &lt; 0.05) compared to empty vector control (n = 4,429; Supplementary Table 1) were selected for further analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Of the 2,205 genes, which were altered in both T/E III and VI variants (T/E intersection; Supplementary Table 1), 94% showed concordant expression changes, indicating a high degree of accordance between the variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The number of distinct genes found after T/E III or VI overexpression (T/E III only and T/E VI only) was 418 and 1,806, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, transcriptional changes in T/E overexpressing cells were consistent with the expected transcriptional response to ERG overexpression based on previous findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>For example, AR and the androgen-responsive genes TMPRSS2 [5, 18], SLC45A3 [5, 18, 19], ACPP [19], and MSMB [5, 19] were downregulated, whereas genes known to be activated by ERG, e.g. PLAT [18], PLA1A [5], and MMP1 [20] were upregulated. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>GO analysis in IPA using the T/E intersection (n = 2,205) showed that genes associated with cell proliferation and interphase were downregulated (Supplementary Table 2), which was in agreement with the reduced proliferative ability of LNCaP-T/E cells (Figure 1E). ‘Estrogen-mediated S-phase Entry’ was identified among the top significantly enriched canonical pathways (Supplementary Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>This corresponded to the accumulation of the T/E overexpressing cells in G1 phase (Figure 1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the increased number of migrated and invaded cells found in the transwell assays (Figure 1G and 1H), genes belonging to the category ‘Cell invasion’ were primarily upregulated (Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To study potential mechanisms regulating transcriptional changes associated with increased migration and invasion in LNCaP-T/E cells, an upstream regulator analysis was performed with the T/E intersection dataset (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) as an upstream regulator of 284 genes that were directly associated with TGFB1 regulation (Supplementary Table 4), and indicated that TGF-β signaling plays a crucial role in T/E overexpressing cells as previously suggested by us [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Evidence for activated TGF-β signaling in the differentially expressed gene set (n = 4,429) was provided by upregulation of several TGF-β pathway-specific genes, e.g. bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1), or downregulation of negative regulators of TGF-β signaling, such as the pseudoreceptor BAMBI (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Activation of noncanonical TGF-β signaling was evident by upregulation of SMAD-independent molecules involved in the ERK, JNK/p38 and PI3K/AKT pathways (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We also found upregulation of EMT-inducing transcription factors (SNAI2, ZEB1), mesenchymal markers (FN1, VIM, VTN) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP10), and downregulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) (Figure 2A), again supporting our finding that T/E expressing cells lose epithelial characteristics and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Of note, the upregulated genes included the type I TGF-β receptor Activin A Receptor Like Type 1 (ACVRL1, also known as ALK1) (Figure 2A), as well as the WNT receptor Frizzled 4 (FZD4) and its co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 (Figure 2A), suggesting that these receptors might be mediators of transcriptional changes leading to EMT in T/E overexpressing cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that transcriptional changes in T/E positive tumors are associated with deregulated TGF-β/BMP and WNT signaling pathways [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Here, by deploying inducible T/E overexpression in LNCaP cell models, we show that overexpression of two distinct T/E variants induce common as well as unique signaling programs that are able to lead the cells into EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Upon T/E overexpression, the cells acquire mesenchymal, fibroblast-like morphologies [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>On the molecular level, this is accompanied by downregulation of AR, suggesting that ERG disrupts a lineage-specific differentiation program of prostate cells [18, 19], and upregulation of EMT effector genes, like MMP1 and VIM, which are correlated with poor PCa tissue differentiation [31] and metastasis formation [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, upregulated EMT-associated genes included the transcription factors ZEB1 [30] and TCF/LEF-1 [33], as well as TGFB1 and -2 [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>We also show that T/E overexpression significantly enhances the invasion capability of LNCaP cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreement with the role of T/E overexpression in promoting cell invasion via induction of matrix metalloproteinase and plasminogen activator genes [3, 5, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Global gene expression analysis of T/E overexpressing cells led to significantly overrepresented GO categories (proliferation and invasion), which correlated with the observed cellular phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We further found many components of known signaling pathways, including JNK/p38 MAPKs, AKT and SMAD1/5, to be deregulated (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Importantly, TGFB1 was identified as a regulator gene of T/E-induced transcriptional changes, which again supports our previous ex vivo data [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Increased TGF-β expression has been shown to induce a tumor-promoting phenotype [35] facilitating metastatic dissemination [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>TGF-β/BMP signaling is well known for its role in bone remodeling and metastasis formation in breast cancer [35] and could therefore play a role in promoting PCa metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Bone metastasis is a common site of PCa dissemination [37], and expression of TGF-β in PCa is correlated to metastasis and survival [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, serum TGF-β concentrations are elevated in PCa patients with bone metastases [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TGF-β protein and RNA expression was higher in bone metastases compared to visceral metastases in rapid autopsy specimens of patients who died of metastatic PCa [40] and was associated with a fibroblast-like phenotype [40]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The first route is characterized by strong upregulation of the TGF-β receptor ALK1, which can be activated by various BMPs, in addition to TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 [41, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of ALK1 in our model led to reduced phosphorylation of p38, downregulation of the EMT-markers VIM, MMP1, CDH2, and SNAI2, as well as reduced expression of ID1 and ID2, for which induction by ALK1 signaling is known [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>ALK1-induced expression of ID1 promotes tumor cell metastasis [44]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pharmacological inhibition of ALK1 was able to prevent metastatic dissemination and lung colonization in mouse models of endocrine pancreatic and mammary carcinomas [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The high upregulation of ALK1 in T/E expressing cells in our study was accompanied by augmented levels of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 mRNA and protein, suggesting that autocrine TGF-β signaling mediates ALK1 pathway activation and phenotypic cellular changes in T/E cells [47, 48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The second route of T/E-induced signaling pointed towards FZD4 receptor-mediated WNT/β-catenin signaling as an important element [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Evidence for the role of WNT signaling was seen in the upregulation of transcription factors of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer family (TCF7L2, LEF1), increased β-catenin reporter activity and downregulation of the negative regulator CDH1 [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>These effects were more profound in T/E VI, compared to T/E III, expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Importantly, FZD4 was upregulated upon T/E overexpression, and inhibition of FZD4 led to reduced phosphorylation of p38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>These results confirmed reports that loss of cell adhesion and EMT were associated with FZD4-induced activation of WNT signaling [49]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Our results further suggest that variant-specific transcriptional modulation is responsible for the differences in activation of EMT regulating pathway genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, we observed upregulation of miR-503 exclusively in T/E VI overexpressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of miR-503 was able to repress expression of SMAD7, a known negative regulator of TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin signaling [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Thus, the miR-503-mediated downregulation of SMAD7 in T/E VI, but not in T/E III cells, explains T/E VI variant-specific transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Recently, Li et al. could show that miR-503 downregulates SMAD7 expression and thereby enhances TGF-β signaling and the metastatic capability of breast cancer cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>SMAD7-mediated stabilization of β-catenin binding to E-cadherin turned out to increase cell-cell adhesion and formation of adherens junctions [53], thereby potentially blocking metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of SMAD7 might account for the stronger increase of TGF-β signaling and β-catenin reporter activity observed in T/E VI cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Zhu et al. showed that stimulation of fibroblasts with recombinant TGF-β results in a decreased expression of SMAD7 [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous reports in MCF-10A breast cancer cells [55], TGFB1 knockdown also decreased miR-503 expression. MiR-503-mediated repression of SMAD7 therefore appears to be a way to escape the inhibitory effect of SMAD7 on TGF-β and WNT/β-catenin signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Although miR-503 expression was shown to be lower in metastatic compared to non-metastatic PCa xenografts [56], and several studies reported tumor suppressor properties of miR-503 [57, 58], in the context of T/E-induced TGF-β signaling miR-503 overexpression has tumor-promoting effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our study identifies the TGF-β/BMP and WNT/β-catenin signaling pathways as molecular determinants underlying T/E-mediated EMT in PCa cells (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>We confirm that WNT/β-catenin signaling in T/E cells is mediated by FZD4 and propose that miR-503 plays a crucial role in augmenting this process. </plain></SENT>
