</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cadmium (Cd) is a representative non-essential element and known as an environmental hazard to human health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This heavy metal can contaminate the food chain and cause cumulative toxic effects in the liver, kidney, bone and the reproductive systems of humans1–3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cd has also been classified as a potent human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Chelation therapies, the most commonly used treatments for heavy metal toxicity, have a number of safety and efficacy concerns and as yet none of them have been approved for clinical use against Cd poisoning in humans5, 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The development of dietary supplements against Cd toxicity represents a potential alternative strategy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are members of commensal inhabitants of the human intestinal microbiota that can confer health benefits on the host7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among these LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) strains have been widely used in the food industry as probiotics and functional food supplements8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies have demonstrated that L. plantarum CCFM8610 can sequester Cd in the intestines of the host, which in turn promotes fecal Cd excretion and reduction in Cd accumulation in tissues, indicating that this strain can be considered a dietary supplement for the prevention and alleviation of Cd toxicity9–11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was further noted that CCFM8610 offers significantly better protection than some other L. plantarum strains in vivo 11, and the protective effects were dependent on bacterial cell viability9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cd exposure, even at low levels, can disrupt cell wall synthesis, respiratory chain function and metal ion homeostasis in microorganisms, which in turn causes oxidative stress, DNA damage and energy metabolism dysfunctions, inducing extreme cellular toxic effects12–14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As L. plantarum cells contact with Cd directly in the intestines of the host, the protective effects of the strains against Cd toxicity largely depend on their abilities to thrive after Cd exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therefore, understanding the mechanism of Cd tolerance of L. plantarum strains is essential for the development of probiotic based strategy against Cd toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our previous work showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of L. plantarum CCFM8610 (tested on Cd-containing agar plates) is more than 1000 mg/L, while some other L. plantarum strains have MIC values 10 to 20 times lower15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A bacterium is considered tolerant to Cd if its MIC value exceeds 100 mg/L16 or 112.4 mg/L of Cd17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on this definition, L. plantarum CCFM8610 can be considered a highly Cd-resistant strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This may partly explain the protection of the host against Cd toxicity in vivo offered by this strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is of interest to understand the resistance mechanism of L. plantarum strains against Cd exposure, and to explore why CCFM8610 is highly tolerant to Cd. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The physiological bases of heavy metal tolerance have been well investigated in environmental and industrial microorganisms such as Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisia 12, 13, 18–20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The related metabolomic pathways and key proteins identified include sulfur assimilation/glutathione synthesis pathway, metallothionein, oxidoreductase and ion transport proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, comprehensive heavy metal tolerance mechanisms have not yet been well defined in LAB strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the Cd resistance modes have only been studied in Streptococcus thermophiles and Lactococcus lactis, with a focus on two Cd resistance-associated genes, CadA and CadC21–24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Numbers of reports also indicated the presence of these genes in some strains of L. plantarum species25, 26, but the Cd stress response network in these strains is yet to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Proteomics has been reported to be efficient to provide global physiological profiles of bacteria in protein level27–29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used approaches for proteomic analysis are gel-based methods, such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, these methods were reported to have limitations in sensibility, reproducibility, and proteome coverage30, 31. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is a labelling approach that allows reliable quantitative description of differentially regulated proteins in complex systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The main advantage is to have the possibility to analyze several samples together, with biological and technical replicates (4 or 8 plex). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The subsequent use of high resolution mass spectrometry analyses provides accurate relative ratio between protein concentrations, present in the different samples31. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this approach was selected in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In this study, the Cd-tolerance related key proteins and pathways within the L. plantarum species were investigated by using iTRAQ based proteomic approach. L. plantarum strains CCFM8610 (strongly resistant to Cd) and CCFM191 (sensitive to Cd) were selected for comparative proteomic analysis based on their differing Cd tolerant phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The comparative proteomic profiles between non-stimulating and Cd-exposed conditions were compared in the two strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The proteomic results were further confirmed by RT-qPCR and by the measurement of several biological properties of the bacterial cells in response to Cd exposure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>While increasing Cd concentration caused a continuous decrease in the growth rate of all strains, significant Cd tolerance diversity could be observed, and the 20 strains could be categorized into four general groups, MIC &gt; 50 mg/L, MIC = 50 mg/L, MIC = 20 mg/L and MIC = 10 mg/L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>All tested strains showed no obvious growth since the Cd concentration reaching over 100 ppm (data not shown).

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Based on the category of Cd tolerance of bacteria reported in a previous report32, CCFM191, one of the three strains with lowest MIC value (10 ppm), was selected as a Cd-sensitive strain for the comparative proteomic analysis with CCFM8610. </plain></SENT>
