<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using molecular cloning, RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunolocalization and in vitro functional assays, we establish that the “neuron-specific” K+Cl− co-transporter 2 (KCC2, Slc12a5) is expressed in several endocrine cells of the pancreatic islet, including glucagon secreting α-cells, but particularly in insulin-secreting β-cells, where we provide evidence for its role in the insulin secretory response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three KCC2 splice variants were identified: the formerly described KCC2a and KCC2b along with a novel one lacking exon 25 (KCC2a-S25). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pancreatic islet is remarkably sensitive to acute changes in plasma glucose levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Glucose elevation of any magnitude triggers insulin secretion from β-cells to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial or first phase of insulin secretion depends on cationic and anionic mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The KATP-channel pathway underlies most of the cationic mechanisms and is the most thoroughly characterized so far1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The anionic mechanisms, independent of KATP-channels, are linked to a much less characterized glucose-induced electrogenic Cl− efflux2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such efflux of Cl− is possible because [Cl−]i in β-cells is kept above that predicted by Nernstian equilibrium i.e., ~35 mM vs. ~10 mM3–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In immature neurons7, neurons of the dorsal root ganglion8, 9 or adult chromaffin cells10, [Cl−]i is also kept above thermodynamic equilibrium due to the predominant functional presence of the secondary active Cl− loader Slc12a2 (NKCC1), a bumetanide- (BTD)-sensitive Na+K+2Cl− co-transporter, over the K+Cl− co-transporters (KCCs), including KCC2 (Slc12a5), a constitutively active Cl− extruder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In rat sensory neurons9 or bovine chromaffin cells11, the expression of NKCC1 is more abundant than that of KCC2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the observation that these cells actively accumulate Cl− and exhibit [Cl−]i above equilibrium (~35–40 mM)10, 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In mature hippocampal13 or neocortical neurons14, for instance, the NKCC1/KCC2 mRNA ratio is ~1:2 due to developmental up-regulation of KCC2 expression7, 14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This is considered to be responsible for the generation and maintenance of [Cl−]i below thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g., ~4 mM) in these mature neurons, thereby determining the well-defined inhibitory action of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor type A (GABAA), a Cl− channel gated by GABA, barbiturates or benzodiazepines7, 14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, GABAA activation in most mature neurons results in plasma membrane hyperpolarization due to Cl− influx whereas in nociceptors it results in the electrogenic efflux of Cl− and plasma membrane depolarization8, 15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This widely accepted model and established paradigm14 may be applied to any electrically excitable cell type expressing GABAA and exhibiting [Cl−]i above Nernstian equilibrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Remarkably similar, mammalian insulin-secreting β-cells accumulate Cl− in a BTD-sensitive manner16, 17, are depolarized by GABA6, 18 and upon opening of various Cl− channels19, 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These include the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR21, 22 and Ca2+-dependent4, 21, 23 or volume-regulated Cl− channels24, 25. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The predominant functional presence of NKCC1 relative to other Cl− loaders expressed in rodent β-cells such as Slc12a1 17, 26, 27, some Slc4a/26a Cl−/HCO3 – exchangers28, 29 or any other potential Cl− extruder of the Slc12a family30, partially explains the depolarizing driving force of Cl− linked to insulin secretion3, 19, 20, 31, 32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Rat pancreatic islets express several Cl− extruders including Slc12a4 (KCC1), Slc12a6 (KCC3) and Slc12a7 (KCC4), however, these transporters appear to be enriched in glucagon-secreting α-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the role of KCCs in cell volume regulation could not be demonstrated in dissociated rat β-cells subjected to hypotonic shock30, which is a classic maneuver to demonstrate KCC activity in many cell types33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The facts that KCC2 is a constitutively active Cl− extruder refractory to hypotonic shock34, 35, and K+Cl− co-transport activity is measurable in mouse pancreatic β-cells under basal conditions36, 37 raise the possibility that KCC2 is functionally present in β-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that NKCC1 and KCC2 transcripts are co-expressed in human islets38, an observation strikingly similar to that of immature or sensory neurons9 or chromaffin cells11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In fact, human β-cells6, immature neurons7, nociceptors39 and adrenal medullary cells11, 40 all depolarize in response to GABAA agonists, which matches with the demonstrated [Cl−]i above thermodynamic equilibrium in these cells5, 7, 10, 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, acute inhibition of NKCC1 with the clinically relevant diuretics BTD or furosemide, inhibits GABAA-mediated plasma membrane depolarization of immature neurons41, nociceptors39, chromaffin cells11 and insulin secretion5, 16, 17, 27, 31, 42, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Notably, these diuretics impair glucose tolerance in mice27, 43–45 and provoke intermittent hyperglycemia in patients treated with these compounds46. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The objective of the present work was to determine and characterize the expression patterns of Slc12a5 gene products in the rodent/mammalian pancreatic islet and to determine if KCC2 plays a modulatory role in insulin secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that β-cells co-express three variants of KCC2 i.e., KCC2a, KCC2b and KCC2a-S25 (a novel KCC2a variant lacking exon 25), and pharmacological inhibition or stimulation of KCC2 in β-cells reciprocally modulate insulin secretion in response to glucose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, inhibition of KCC2 increases insulin secretion by mechanisms involving a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in a KATP-channel independent-manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results provide the first indication that KCC2 is expressed in the pancreatic β-cell and plays a role as a modulator of insulin secretion. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>This concept may have functional significance in β-cells, particularly when considering that KCC2a and KCC2a-S25 make up ~90–95% of the total KCC2 pool in β-cells (Fig. 1G and Supplementary Figure 1B), whereas KCC2b accounts for ~90–95% of the total KCC2 pool in the adult mouse brain56. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Clearly, KCC2a-S25 cloned from β-cells direct the translation of KCC2 proteins when transfected into cell lines (Supplementary Figures 4F,G) suggesting that KCC2a-S25 mRNAs are translationally active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Further, it is unlikely that KCC2a-S25 is the result of cloning artifacts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Indeed, by taking advantage of a unique MspI site in the junction of exons 24–25, we demonstrated that KCC2 transcripts lacking exon 25 are endogenously expressed in β-cells (Fig. 2A and F) and in adrenal medullary cells (Fig. 2B–E and Supplementary Figures 4A–D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Further, no evidence of KCC2-S25 mRNA expression in the adult brain or spinal cord could be found (Fig. 2C and F). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising; ~90–95% of the total NKCC immunoreactivity localise in intracellular compartments, when using cell lines62 and a minute amount could be demonstrated in the plasma membrane when using mouse islets cells (Supplementary Figures 2A,D and G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a small fraction of total immunoreactive KCC2 localises towards the MIN6 cells edge (Fig. 1J–K), the plasma membrane of endocrine/islet mouse cells (Supplementary Figures 2B,E and H) and αTC6 cells (Supplementary Figure 5J). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Further favoring the proposal that complex N-glycosylated KCC2 is the one enriched at the plasma membrane48, KCC2 was detected as a single band of ~150 kDa in purified plasma membrane fractions of MIN6 β-cells, but not in those of COS7 cells (Fig. 1I). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Although the functional properties of KCC2a-S25 remain to be determined, the fact that mKCC4 cloned from several sources (GenBank accessions: AK166215, AK149750, BC059242, AK143535, AK131129, BC141107, AF087436) lacks exon 27 (homologous to exon 25 in Slc12a5), adds an extra layer of complexity to our current understanding of the molecular physiology of KCC2, particularly when considering that KCC2a-S25 accounts for ~55–60% of total KCC2 transcripts in β-cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>KCC2a-S25 lacks five C-terminal residues located immediately after the so-called “ISO-domain”, which is responsible for the high basal activity of the transporter35 whereas KCC4, which lack ISO domains, is an inactive cotransporter under normal isotonic conditions35, 63, 64. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, unlike KCC2, KCC4 is robustly activated by hypotonicity64. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Although small decreases in [Cl−]i are known to alter the oscillatory Ca2+ signaling in murine β-cells5, 23, our experiments cannot exclude the possibility that changes in [Cl−]i may also affect insulin secretion by slightly changing the intragranular pH65 or granule exocytosis, as previously suggested20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>When coupled to active V-type H+-ATPase-dependent H+ uptake, vesicular Cl−/H+ transporters are expected to electrically neutralize and acidify the organelle’s lumen66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only high glucose (15 mM) caused an acute and sustained Ca2+-independent drop in vesicular pH67 and CLP257 decreases insulin secretion in response to ≥15 mM glucose (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that β-cell KCC2 partially co-localized with SYN (Fig. 3A–C), a marker of endosomes synaptic-like macrovesicles (SLMVs) where the 2Cl−/H+ exchanger Clc-3 was found68. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>However, while SLMVs do not store insulin, they appear to concentrate at least GABA and glycine69 raising the possibility that KCC2 may modulate secretion indirectly by participating in SLMV maturation/release of these Cl− channel activators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Clearly, further experiments are needed to determine the potential impact of KCC2 in β-cell granule biology as well as in the physiology and interplay of endocrine cells of the islet were KCC2 is also expressed (see Supplementary Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Notably, ML077-induced insulin secretion in response to 5.5 mM and 12.5 mM glucose also occurred in the presence of GBC, but was inhibited by nifedipine (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Figure 7B) as expected, suggesting that KCC2 modulates the secretory response independently of KATP-channels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Together, these data support the recent findings demonstrating that the electrogenic exit of Cl− from β-cells is required to broaden Ca2+-dependent membrane potential oscillations and to increase the density of action potentials needed to sustain insulin secretion in response to glucose5, 23, phenomena that occur when KATP-channels are fully closed23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Indeed, according to the current paradigms and the laws of thermodynamics, the electrogenic driving force of Cl− is expected to increase when [Cl−]i increases in β-cells in response to KCC2 inhibition. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Further, the Cl− driving force and the electrogenic Cl− conductance positively correlate with the magnitude of Ca2+ entry in neurons71. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these data, single-cell Ca2+ measurement experiments exhibited that ML077 increases GBC-induced Ca2+ elevations in MIN6 β-cells (Fig. 5B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Ca2+ elevations observed in response to GBC are believed to represent an amplified opening of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels in response to plasma membrane depolarisation1 brought about by KATP-channel inhibition, and in effect mimic the situation during glucose-induced KATP-channel closure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Although the detailed mechanisms underlying the stimulation of Ca2+ uptake (and insulin secretion) either directly or indirectly through potential changes in [Cl−]i remain to be dissected, our results thus far are compatible with several non-exclusive interpretations: i) increased recruitment of active Ca2+ channels in response to ML077 (Fig. 5B), ii) shifting of the plateau membrane potential to more depolarized levels (expected if [Cl−]i increases in response to KCC2 inhibition, as demonstrated in other cells52) and the consequent opening of additional Ca2+ channels further increasing Ca2+ influx72, iii) increasing Cl−-channel mediated efflux and action potential rate/density, as recently demonstrated23 and/or iv) Cl−, independently of its conductance, directly shifting the gating of L-type Ca2+ currents to the left, as demonstrated for other anions73. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Notably, in β-cells that did not initially respond to GBC with a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ ML077 evoked a significant Ca2+ increase (Fig. 5C) indicating that ML077 per se is able to promote Ca2+ entry and suggesting that in low/basal glucose conditions (e.g., 5.5 mM glucose) KATP-channels counteract most of the depolarizing Cl− conductance in β-cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Whilst treatment of MIN6 cells with ML077, considered a highly selective and specific inhibitor of KCC252, correlated with increased basal insulin secretion (Fig. 4), drug-mediated inhibition/stimulation of unknown targets does remain possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is also plausible that the modulation of insulin secretion by ML077 reflects KCC2-dependent changes in [Cl−]i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>For instance, in immature neurons with measured [Cl−]i of ~35mM74 and equilibrium potential for Cl− (ECl) of ~−37 mV, a 5 mM decrease in [Cl−]i profoundly impacted the ability of GABA to promote Ca2+ fluxes in these cells75–77. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Similarly, [Cl−]i in mouse β-cells is ~34 mM5 and have a predicted ECl of ~−37 mV (if cultured with external [Cl−]o of 142.6 mM, as given by the KRBH buffer in our experiments). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Therefore, taking into consideration the electrophysiological similitudes between immature neurons and β-cells in terms of [Cl−]i and ECl it is reasonable to expect that small changes in [Cl−]i in β-cells will produce similar electrophysiological results as those described in immature neurons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>When taken together, these findings are consistent with a small albeit significantly stimulated insulin secretion in response to non-insulinotropic glucose in the presence of ML077 (and other KCC2 inhibitors, see Supplementary Figure 7A) and with the fact that inhibition of KCC2 increases the maximal insulin response to glucose (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the observed increase in insulin secretion in response to ML077 is supported by increased Ca2+ influx under conditions where [Cl−]i is increased, as expected when the constitutively active KCC2 is inhibited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In addition, ML077 neither increased cytosolic Ca2+ nor insulin secretion in the presence of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels (Supplementary Figures 7B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>These results are indeed expected when considering the proposal that Ca2+-independent pathways contribute minimally to GSIS78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, they also suggest that the modulatory effect that KCC2 inhibition has on insulin secretion does not involve potential secretory mechanisms, which are not dependent on Ca2+ entry such as hypotonicity-induced cell swelling79 or increased cAMP80. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Although it has been reported that β-cell membrane potential does not change in response to 1.1 mM, 3.3 mM or 5.5 mM glucose81, a detailed analysis as that performed recently23 will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby KCC2 inhibition promotes Ca2+ entry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data provide evidence supporting the conclusion that the constitutively active Cl− extruder KCC2 is expressed in β-cells and participates in the modulation of the secretory response. </plain></SENT>
