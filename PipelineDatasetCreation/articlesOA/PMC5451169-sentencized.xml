</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent age-associated brain degeneration disorder, affecting ∼1% of the population &gt;65 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The PD-specific progressive movement deficit is mostly attributable to the severe affliction and cell death of midbrain nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (Braak et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Surviving neurons in vulnerable regions exhibit aggregates predominantly consisting of the protein α-synuclein (SNCA), which are visualized as Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies, both in sporadic late-onset PD and in most familial early-onset PD variants (Goedert et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Autosomal dominant PD with early clinical manifestation was observed in rare families, leading to the identification of SNCA protein missense mutations (PARK1 variant), such as A53T, and of SNCA gene duplication/triplication events (PARK4 variant) as the strongest causes of this pathology (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Singleton et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Further recruitment of PD families led to the identification of several disease genes responsible for monogenic PD (Corti et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of very large collectives of late-manifesting sporadic PD cases identified two regions on chromosome 4 (SNCA locus and CPLX1/GAK/TMEM175/DGKQ locus) that contain genetic variants predisposing to multifactorial PD (Lill et al., 2012; Nalls et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Variations in the SNCA gene 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and its promoter were strongly correlated with PD risk (Rhinn et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>SNCA is physiologically concentrated in axon terminals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is associated with the lipid membranes of synaptic vesicles and interacts with synaptobrevin, a component of the SNARE complex, modulating vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmission (Diao et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Its toxic gain of function leads over time to impaired synaptic vesicle release and synaptic failure (Garcia-Reitbock et al., 2010; Nemani et al., 2010; Platt et al., 2012; Janezic et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Current investigations aim to elucidate SNCA-triggered pathology, concentrating on disease stages before the occurrence of irreversible cell loss, when neuroprotective therapies might still be efficacious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In the prodromal stage of PD, non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, constipation, depression or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) were documented, of which RBD is now recognized as the most specific and predictive prodromal phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Individuals suffering from RBD carry a risk of &gt;85% to manifest PD after 15-20 years, and the associated neurodegenerative process is a synucleinopathy in 95% of cases (Stiasny-Kolster et al., 2005; Albers et al., 2012; Boeve et al., 2013; Iranzo et al., 2013, 2014; Mahowald and Schenck, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>SNCA is abundantly expressed in blood (Shin et al., 2000; Barbour et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of SNCA in short-lived blood cells was found to result in diverse subtle phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Enhanced apoptotic vulnerability of human PARK1 lymphocytes and SNCA-transfected myeloma and leukemia cell lines to oxidative stress (Kim et al., 2004; Battisti et al., 2008), impaired innate immune functions of mouse leukocytes with SNCA overexpression (Gardai et al., 2013) and dose-dependent inhibition of α-granule release in human platelets exposed to exogenous SNCA (Park et al., 2002) provide evidence that biomarkers of elevated SNCA abundance and of the risk of synucleinopathy can be identified in peripheral tissues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Our identification of a new large pedigree of autosomal dominant PD attributable to SNCA gene duplication with 12 presymptomatic PARK4 heterozygotes has provided a unique opportunity to explore blood biomarkers and permitted the definition of a molecular signature at the RNA level that predicts PARK4 PD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For validation, the results were assessed in individuals with a risk of developing PD because of manifestation of RBD as a highly specific prodromal sign. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Our data on blood biomarkers as a diagnostic tool might contribute to the assessment of the risk of multifactorial PD in individuals without a positive family history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The most relevant biomarker is the SNARE component complexin 1, which acts as risk factor for PD by itself. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>An exceptionally large pedigree with autosomal dominant PD (Fig. 1A) was identified in Turkey. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Blood DNA genotyping demonstrated a genomic tandem duplication at the SNCA locus as a known cause of PD (Singleton et al., 2003; Fig. 1B) and detected presymptomatic PARK4 heterozygotes, 12 of whom were available and included in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The two clinically affected family members plus the 12 presymptomatic heterozygotes (mean age 45.5 years, range 29-56 years, six males) and the 12 age-matched control relatives (mean age 44.6 years, range 31-57 years, six males) underwent overnight fasting and had whole peripheral blood protein and RNA samples collected and processed in parallel to assess the SNCA-dependent expression profiles of blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the tandem duplication, the blood mRNA levels of the neighbouring genes GPRIN3, SNCA and MMRN1 were increased to ∼1.5-fold in blood of PARK4 individuals versus control relatives (11 versus 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Given that the MMRN1 gene dosage has also been implicated in cognitive decline (Nishioka et al., 2006; Fuchs et al., 2007; Mutez et al., 2011), it will be interesting to perform a neuropsychological characterization of the PARK4 heterozygotes in this family in the future, but currently the cognitive score in one patient is still unaffected (mini-mental state examination score, MMSE=30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In an initial candidate gene study, we studied the blood expression of all PARK genes, of the previously reported PD blood biomarker ST13 and of promising transcripts that encode putative SNCA-interactor proteins (Fig. 2A,B) and showed altered levels in our previous global transcriptome profiling of midbrain tissue in a carefully characterized synucleinopathy mouse model with dopaminergic deficits, impaired synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Kurz et al., 2010; Platt et al., 2012; Tozzi et al., 2012; Gispert et al., 2015a,b; Subramaniam et al., 2014; Brehm et al., 2015b). SNCA gene duplication in the Turkish pedigree showed no correlation with the expression of other genes with known association with PD risk or of the previously reported PD blood biomarker ST13 (Scherzer et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A nominally significant inverse correlation was observed for CPLX1 and a trend towards inverse correlation for YWHAE (Fig. 2B), two phenomena that we had previously identified as synucleinopathy markers in mouse mutant midbrain (Gispert et al., 2015b; Brehm et al., 2015a). CPLX1 levels were reduced to 0.67-fold, so the effect size was moderate; despite the nominal significance (P=0.04), a demonstration of real significance after Bonferroni or Benjamini–Hochberg correction would be possible only in much larger sample collections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Quantitative immunoblots of protein extracts from corresponding whole blood PARK4 samples showed a ∼1.5-fold accumulation of SNCA monomer, but no SNCA aggregates were detectable, even after delipidation for epitope unmasking, probably because of the short lifespan of blood cells (Sharon et al., 2003; Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The protein levels of complexin 1 could not be detected reliably in blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Together with previous mouse findings (Chandra et al., 2004; Gispert et al., 2015b), these data suggest that CPLX1 mRNA levels in blood mirror the gain of physiological function of SNCA rather than aggregation pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This provides proof of principle that blood RNA profiling can aid the development of risk prediction biomarkers for synucleinopathies.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report a new, exceptionally large PARK4 pedigree, provide proof of principle that the risk for a future manifestation of PD is reflected in the global transcriptome of blood, identify diverse pathways and, in particular, the levels of SPP1, GZMH, PLTP and CPLX1 as biomarkers of pathogenesis, show subtle CPLX1 downregulations to distinguish prodromal PD cohorts (presymptomatic PARK4 heterozygotes and RBD individuals) from controls, and suggest that complexin 1 loss of function acts as a PD risk factor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five years ago, the characterization of the large Italian Contursi PARK1 kindred triggered research into PD genetics (Golbe et al., 1990; Polymeropoulos et al., 1996, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Now, the cooperativity of the Turkish PARK4 pedigree is a unique opportunity for further studies into human synucleinopathy, such as brain imaging, and the existence of 12 presymptomatic heterozygotes of the SNCA gene duplication in this family might be crucial for the identification of a molecular signature of disease risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Our deposition of PARK4 blood RNA-seq data at the ENA database aims to drive this effort, ensuring that PD risk, which is triggered by the genetically defined synucleinopathy of PARK4 in the Turkish pedigree and mirrored by specific pathways and molecular biomarkers, can now be compared with diverse ongoing data collections in individuals with manifest PD, usually without a family history and with multifactorial pathogenesis (Scherzer et al., 2007; Marek et al., 2011; Santiago and Potashkin, 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that diagnostics of PD risk can be based on a single technique or a single molecular biomarker, so we evaluated the global transcriptome and the pathway dysregulations by GSEA bioinformatics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>These approaches recently permitted us to identify three gene expression changes in dependence of SNCA function in brain tissue, concerning the chemotaxis factor Lect1 (Cnmd) in one digenic and two monogenic PD mouse models (Gispert et al., 2015a) and the midbrain-selective transcription factor Foxp1 and the SNARE complex component Cplx1 in a synucleinopathy model and SNCA-deficient mouse mutants (Gispert et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Although we were unable to detect substantial FOXP1 and LECT1 expression in human fresh whole blood PAXgene samples, despite strong signals having been reported in microarray studies of purified peripheral mononuclear blood cells, we found mRNA complexin 1 levels to be downregulated in whole blood in the Turkish PARK4 pedigree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The observation that increased abundance of SNCA, a known modulator of the SNARE complex and of vesicle dynamics, modifies the expression of another SNARE interactor, CPLX1, led us to hypothesize that altered physiological functions of SNCA at the earliest stages of the accumulation and aggregation process will trigger immediate molecular and cellular responses in a subtle but cumulative manner, which might be exploited as biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This notion was supported by GSEA pathway dysregulations for the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins and for endocytosis in response to the PARK4 mutation in the lipid-binding endocytosis modulator SNCA (Diao et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this concept was also substantiated by dysregulated hemostasis and platelet activation pathways, with corresponding preliminary documentation of impaired platelet degranulation in PARK4 blood, in the absence of detectable protein aggregates, in excellent agreement with previous publications in vitro and in mice on a role of SNCA in platelet activation (Park et al., 2002; Reheman et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our efforts to identify additional molecular biomarkers with stronger effect sizes focused on GZMH levels as representative of the lysosome pathway upregulation, on SPP1 levels as representative of the immunity pathway upregulation, and on PLTP levels as representative of the lipid metabolism pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The data clearly confirmed their role as biomarkers of PARK4, at least in this Turkish pedigree, so it might now be interesting to test whether progressive stages of synucleinopathy can be correlated with expression levels of these factors or of other pathway components, whether these factors represent molecular targets of neuroprotective therapies or are risk factors themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a moderate mRNA upregulation for the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GBA; log2 fold change=0.31) was notable in the PARK4 blood RNA-seq GSEA; GBA is known to contribute to SNCA degradation, and its mutations act as modifiers of PD risk (Yap et al., 2011; Sidransky and Lopez, 2012; Fishbein et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>But there are many triggers of lysosomal induction and immunity responses beyond SNCA accumulation and PD, and this probably explains why GZMH and SPP1 upregulations are not specific for indivduals with RBD but are also detectable among some control individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Despite the small effect size of CPLX1 mRNA downregulation, this observation reproducibly distinguished cohorts of presymptomatic PARK4 heterozygotes in blood, of individuals with RBD in blood, and neuroblastoma cells after SNCA transfection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The corresponding protein levels are difficult to quantify in blood because of the abundance of hemoglobin, albumin and fibrinogen, and because small fold changes are difficult to detect with antibody-dependent techniques and non-linear enzyme kinetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>CPLX1 protein accumulated in neuroblastoma cells (proteins extracted with RIPA buffer) in our experiments and is known to accumulate together with SNCA in midbrain tissue (proteins extracted with 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea and 4% CHAPS), whereas it is decreased in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with sporadic PD (proteins extracted with 8 M urea; Basso et al., 2004; Dumitriu et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the accumulation of insoluble SNCA through protein interaction sequesters CPLX1 protein, leading to its accumulation in solubility, later in insolubility, whereas a homeostatic negative autoregulation reduces the CPLX1 mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The decrease of CPLX1 mRNA has clear advantages as risk biomarker in peripheral tissue, whereas complexin 1 protein redistribution might become a biomarker of disease progression in nervous tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The formation of Lewy bodies has been shown to deplete SNARE complex components from neurons, although it is technically difficult to demonstrate their presence within the protein inclusion bodies (Garcia-Reitbock et al., 2010; Mukaetova-Ladinska et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The unequivocal co-localization of SNCA and CPLX1 in aggregates is challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Co-immunoprecipitation studies failed to detect a direct association, but the high detergent conditions needed to enrich SNCA oligomers and fibrils would not leave protein associations intact. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Thus, instead of pursuing the physical interaction between SNCA and CPLX1 proteins, we decided to assess their genetic interaction further. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Two lines of evidence, (1) the identification of the CPLX1 gene variant rs10794536 that is associated with PD risk in a relatively small case-control study, and (2) the demonstration that genetic ablation of Cplx1 in mouse brain leads to an elevation of SNCA levels that is comparable to PARK4, both argue that complexin 1 also has a role as risk factor in PD, not only a role as biomarker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The role of complexin 1 appears to extend beyond monogenic synucleinopathy cases into sporadic PD, in view of (1) its accumulation in mass-spectrometry proteomics of PD midbrain autopsies, (2) the GWAS meta-analyses of risk loci for sporadic PD, and (3) our findings of CPLX1 blood level downregulation in RBD cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy in this context that a recent report showed a knock-in mutation in another SNARE protein, unphosphorylatable S187A-substituted SNAP25, to trigger increased abundance and mislocalization of SNCA, together with SNARE assembly problems and presynaptic dilatation, but without neurodegeneration until the mice were 1 year old. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>These authors concluded that dysfunctions at the SNARE complex in presynapses might induce elevated SNCA abundance and thus lead to an insidious neurodegenerative process (Nakata et al., 2012; Yasuda et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This scenario is in good agreement with the recently identified genetic risk factors for idiopathic PD in individuals without monogenic traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The reproducible GWAS loci of PD risk (Lill et al., 2012; Nalls et al., 2014) are surprisingly enriched in genes relevant for vesicle dynamics, such as the SYT11 (encoding synaptotagmin 11) and RAB25 genes at the chromosome 1q21.1-22 PD risk locus, the RAB29 gene at the chromosome 1q32 PARK16 locus, the NSF gene (encoding N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) within the risk haplotype at the chromosome 17q21 PD risk locus named after MAPT, and the SYT4 gene (encoding synaptotagmin 4) at the chromosome 18q12.3 PD risk locus named after RIT2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>A remaining major GWAS PD risk locus contains the LRRK2 gene, which is responsible for autosomal dominant PARK8 and encodes a protein that modulates synaptic vesicle cycling and that interacts with syntaxin 1B/NSF/clathrin/AP2 (Piccoli et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Thus, the SNCA and CPLX1 3′-UTR variants might be representative for various SNARE/RAB vesicle cycle alterations that modulate PD risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Overall, our initial characterization of an exceptionally large PARK4 pedigree from Turkey provided insights into the prodromal stage of monogenic synucleinopathy, defining a molecular signature in the blood transcriptome that might be relevant for predictive diagnostics in groups of at-risk individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Although several differences in expression between groups with presymptomatic PD versus controls were identified with statistical significance, individual differences at present would be insufficient for predictive diagnostics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the data identify CPLX1 as a biomarker and modifier gene of PD risk. </plain></SENT>
