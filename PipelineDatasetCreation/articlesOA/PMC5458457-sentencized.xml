<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, amino acid transporters can also function as nutrient sensors, and because of their transport and sensing functions they can control the protein synthesis, by either increase or decrease synthesis, depending on nutrient availability 3, 4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The Solute carrier (SLC) superfamily is the largest group of transporters in the human genome, and up to date, 395 SLCs are identified and divided into 52 families, with different biochemical properties 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The members in each SLC family have at least 20% amino acid sequence identity to another member in the family 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>SLC transporters are membrane‐bound, located to the plasma membrane 6, vesicles 7, lysosomes 8, peroxisomes 9, and mitochondria 10, and function as ATP‐independent uniporters, symporters, or antiporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SLCs have a wide substrate profile and mediate flux of for example amino acids, ions, drugs, nucleotides, fatty acids, and vitamins 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The SLC38 family, the system A and system N sodium‐coupled neutral amino acid transporter family, has 11 members, encoded by the genes, SLC38A1–SLC38A11 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The characterized members are termed SNAT# (SLC38A#), Sodium coupled Neutral Amino acid Transporter# 12, and up to date, eight members are functionally characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The transporters in the family are divided into system A or system N, depending on transport characteristics 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>System A transporters have a wider substrate profile and transport small neutral amino acids, in particular glutamine, alanine, and serine 13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The system N transporters have a more restricted substrate profile, and translocate mainly glutamine, asparagine, and histidine 14. </plain></SENT>

SLC38A9 is not classified into any system yet, but was recently characterized as a component of the amino acid‐sensing Ragulator–Rag complex on lysosomes, controlling the activation of the mechanistic target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to amino acids 8, 25, 26 and shown to transport glutamine, arginine, and asparagine 8. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>More specifically, in the hippocampus, staining of SLC38A10 was located in cells in the granular layer of dentate gyrus 52 and pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus, areas that support selective expression by excitatory neurons 53. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity was detected in the Purkinje cell layer in cerebellum, known to be GABAergic 54. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In the brain, the previously studied SLC38 members are either expressed in neurons (SLC38A6 33, SLC38A7 24, SLC38A8 22, and SLC38A9 34) or astrocytes (SLC38A3 31 and SLC38A5 32), or in both neurons and glia (SLC38A1 27, 28 and SLC38A2 30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Here, we detected SLC38A10 immunoreactivity in neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 5), which resembles cell type localization for SLC38A1 and SLC38A2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>We found this remarkable as SLC38A10 shared highest sequence identity with, SLC38A1 (23.1%) and SLC38A2 (24.7%), when looking at the TMH sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The SLC38A10 immunoreactivity was ubiquitous in astrocytes, while the neuronal staining was more cytoplasmic and more limited to the plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, intracellular immunoreactivity was detected for the plasma membrane‐bound transporters, SLC38A1 55 and SLC38A2 56, in the trans‐Golgi Network, where the proteins later are recruited from to the plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Trafficking of transporters within the cell regulates transport activity and one stimulus, for example, the amino acid levels, can induce movement of transporters to the plasma membrane and increase transport activity, while another can decrease activity and withdraw the transporter from the plasma membrane 11, 58. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the specific subcellular localization of SLC38A10, or the recruitment of SLC38A10 to the plasma membrane must be further studied. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The results from the transport data suggest SLC38A10 to be a bidirectional transporter for l‐alanine, l‐glutamate, l‐glutamine, and d‐aspartate, while efflux was measured for l‐serine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>When measuring the transport of glutamine using different incubation times (5–60 min), both significantly higher and lower uptake was measured in SLC38A10 oocytes, in a time‐dependent manner (Fig. 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that SLC38A10 can mediate both uptake and efflux of glutamine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Bidirectional glutamine transport are reported for the system N transporters SLC38A3 17 and SLC38A5 59. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In our uptake studies we used amino acid concentrations at 1.2 μm, which are high compared to the endogenous levels in oocytes, which are in the range of 0.07–3.6 nm 60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the uptake and the putative efflux phases of glutamine are a result of altered gradients for ions and substrates over time, and that SLC38A10 has the capacity to control the balance between intracellular and extracellular concentrations, resulting in periods of uptake and efflux. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Our transport experiments do not measure the SLC38A10 K m values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>However, the K m values have been measured for other family members, for example the K m value for glutamine is 0.3 mm for SLC38A1 27 and 1 mm for SLC38A5 59. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Moreover, both lower and higher uptake of l‐glutamate was measured at 50 min for SLC38A10 oocytes compared with controls (Fig. 6B and D) using oocytes from different frogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was observed several times, and the batch of oocytes affected the transport direction at a given time, although the pattern with increased and decreased uptake was consistent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>This made it difficult to determine the substrate profile, by only rely on uptake assays, and therefore efflux assays were performed to substantiate the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Efflux of l‐alanine, l‐glutamine, l‐glutamate, and d‐aspartate was measured, as well as for l‐serine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>SLC38A10 can most likely facilitate uptake of l‐serine as well, even though our uptake studies failed to show this, probably because we did not time the uptake phase correctly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that this transporter do transport l‐aspartate, since both uptake and efflux of d‐aspartate was observed in competition with l‐aspartate (Fig. 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>The excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), from the SLC1 family, are nonselective toward l‐ and d‐aspartate, while selective for l‐glutamate 61. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The system A hallmark substrate MeAIB was transported, however, SLC38A10 also shares the efflux features with system N and it can as well translocate charged amino acids, which complicated the system classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Moreover, alanine and glutamine are the two most common substrates transported by the SLC38 family members 11, but this is the second member that translocates the charged amino acids glutamate and aspartate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>SLC38A8 also transports MeAIB and was classified to system A, although it transported charged amino acids 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Taken together, SLC38A10 transport the paradigm substrates for system A, glutamine, alanine, and serine, as well as MeAIB, and hence, we suggest it to be classified to system A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>In the GGGC, the SLC38 proteins are suggested to mediate uptake of glutamine in neurons and efflux of glutamine from astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>SLC38A3 39 and SLC38A5 40 are suggested to facilitate the glutamine flux from astrocytes, which are qualities possibly also shared by SLC38A10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>In addition, SLC1A5 is also suggested to mediate glutamine flux from astrocytes 62. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>SLC38A1 16, 27, 38, SLC38A2 38, SLC38A7 24, and SLC38A8 22 are suggested to enable glutamine uptake in the axon of neurons, close to the synaptic cleft. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>More specifically, SLC38A2 most likely facilitate uptake of glutamine in excitatory neurons 30, while this is mainly mediated by SLC38A1 in inhibitory neurons 55. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Glutamine uptake can be facilitated by SLC38A7 24 and SLC38A8 22 in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>In addition to immunoreactivity on axons, SLC38A7 24 and SLC38A8 22 are also intense on the soma, also suggesting a role in supplying neurons with glutamine for general biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>SLC38A10 has the capacity to facilitate glutamine uptake in neurons, and in addition mediate glutamine flux from astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>It is also very remarkable that SLC38A10 transport the two most important excitatory amino acids in the brain, glutamate and aspartate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Therefore, SLC38A10 also have the capacity for glutamate uptake in neurons and astrocytes, following glutamate release from excitatory neurons, which are functions mediated by the EAATs 61. d‐serine function as a coagonist on the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor and the activation of the receptor requires binding of glutamate in combination with a coagonist. d‐serine is taken up by astrocytes and converted to l‐serine by the enzyme serine racemase (SR) 63. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Although, l‐serine is also produced from glucose in glia cells 64. l‐serine is exported from astrocytes, a pathway suggested to be conducted by SLC1A4 65 and SLC1A5 66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 are also transporters for d‐serine in rat hippocampal astrocytes 67. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Effluxes of l‐serine were measured for SLC38A10 and it is possible that SLC38A10 transport l‐serine from astrocytes, to serve neurons with l‐serine for d‐serine synthesis 64. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Glycine is also a coagonist on the NMDA receptor and SLC38A5 is suggested to mediate the glycine flux from astrocytes 40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the subcellular localization where SLC38A10 exert its function need to be further studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>SLC38A10 have the highest TMH sequence identity with SLC38A2, although the sequence identity was in equal proportions (21.9–24.7%) with SLC38A1, SLC38A3, SLC38A5, SLC38A7, and SLC38A8, and could thus have properties similar to them all, which supports our findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the present study we show that SLC38A10 immunostaining is abundant in the mouse brain and the staining colocalized with markers for both neurons and astrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>We also show that the transporter is bidirectional and can mediate both uptake and efflux of l‐glutamine, l‐alanine, l‐glutamate, and d‐aspartate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>In addition, efflux of l‐serine was measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>The results from the transport assays propose SLC38A10 to be classified into system A.
