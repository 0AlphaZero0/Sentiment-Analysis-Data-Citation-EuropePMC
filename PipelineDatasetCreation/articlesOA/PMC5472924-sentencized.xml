</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.) is an allotetraploid (2n = 4× = 36, AABB) annual cereal millet crop that includes two distinct subspecies: subsp. coracana (cultivated finger millet or ragi) and subsp. africana (wild finger millet) [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Based on morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular evidences, it is believed that modern finger millet (E. coracana subsp. coracana) is domesticated from wild finger millet (E. coracaca subsp. africana) populations [2–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The E. coracana subsp. coracana was domesticated around 5000 years ago in western Uganda and the Ethiopian highlands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, finger millet was introduced into Western Ghats of India around 3000 BC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus India became the secondary centre of diversity for finger millet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is the fourth most important millet after sorghum, pearl millet and foxtail millet [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It occupies 12% of global millet’s area and is cultivated in more than 25 countries in African and Asian continents [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Finger millet is potentially a climate-resilient and nutritious crop with high nutraceutical and antioxidant properties [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Very importantly, finger millet grain is gluten-free, rich in calcium, fiber and iron, has excellent malting qualities, with low glycemic index (GI) and because of these properties, finger millet is a choice food for diabetics [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, millets are the survival food crops for resource-poor people. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It produces reasonable grain and fodder yields under low input crop production systems and even survives on soils of low fertility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Finger millet grain is used to prepare diverse food cuisines and is highly nutritious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Apart from having rich nutritional value, it has an efficient carbon concentrating mechanism through C4 pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in C4 mechanism could be one of the reasons for its hardy nature under low moisture and hot environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is worth comparing genes involved in C4 carbon assimilation network with already characterized genes from other cereal crops [12–14] and understand the variation at genomic level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In spite of its immense importance in human diet, development of genomic resources and high throughput breeding efforts have been limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Considering these, we developed the whole genome sequence data for the short duration (110–115 days), high yielding (5.0–5.5 tonnes per hectare), drought tolerant finger millet variety ML-365, which was bred and released in 2008 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the first de novo genome assembly of orphan nutri-cereal finger millet using combination of Illumina and SOLiD sequencing technologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The whole genome assembly, SSRs, C4 pathway genes, resistance genes, drought responsive genes and calcium transport and regulation genes will be invaluable genomic resources for the future finger millet studies. </plain></SENT>
