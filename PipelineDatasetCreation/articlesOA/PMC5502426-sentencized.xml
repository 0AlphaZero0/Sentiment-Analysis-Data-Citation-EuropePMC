</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suppression and collapse of normal blood cell replenishment underlies the severe morbidity and high mortality accompanying many hematologic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML; Löwenberg et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this suppression of normal hematopoiesis remain to be established and are of critical importance toward development of improved and targeted therapies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies of the surface expression and function of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) have provided fundamental insights into its role in normal hematopoiesis (Luc et al., 2007; Boyer et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Within the hematopoietic progenitor compartment, expression of Flt3 is present in multipotent progenitors (MPPs), including lymphoid-primed MPPs (LMPPs; Adolfsson et al., 2001, 2005; Boyer et al., 2011; Buza-Vidas et al., 2011) and early lymphoid (Luc et al., 2012) and myeloid (Böiers et al., 2010) progenitor populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genetic knockout approaches established an important role for Flt3 in the maintenance of these early progenitor cell populations (Sitnicka et al., 2002; Böiers et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, up-regulation of surface expression of Flt3 marks loss of self-renewal of mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; Adolfsson et al., 2001; Christensen and Weissman, 2001), and importantly, genetic knockout studies of Flt3, or its ligand, have demonstrated no significant impact of loss of Flt3 on the normal HSC compartment (Buza-Vidas et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that although Flt3 transcriptional expression first occurs in a minor population of cells within the phenotypic HSC compartment, these cells in fact lack self-renewal capability and therefore represent progenitors rather than bona fide HSCs (Boyer et al., 2011, 2012; Buza-Vidas et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Those results highlight the well-recognized heterogeneity of the phenotypic HSC compartment, which in addition to genuine HSCs contains non-HSC progenitors, marked in part by expression of Flt3 transcript (Purton and Scadden, 2007; Boyer et al., 2011; Buza-Vidas et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Constitutively activating internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of FLT3 are one of the most common, recurrent somatic mutations found in patients with AML (Meshinchi and Appelbaum, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although FLT3 ITDs often occur as a secondary mutation (Gale et al., 2008), there are also cases in which they clearly originate in the founding leukemic clone (Ding et al., 2012), and it is clear that FLT3 ITDs act as a potent driver mutation (Smith et al., 2012) and confer a poor outcome because of high relapse risk (Gale et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is of considerable importance to understand which cells propagate FLT3-ITD–associated myeloid disease and how these cells contribute to clonal dominance over normal hematopoietic cells to result in the hematopoietic suppression typically observed in patients (Löwenberg et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although FLT3-ITD mutations are present in the primitive human CD34+CD38− stem/progenitor cell compartment, including LMPP-like cells (Levis et al., 2005; Goardon et al., 2011; Mead et al., 2013), FLT3 ITDs appear to be absent in the majority of “preleukemic” HSCs in patients with FLT3-ITD AML (Jan et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, in a recent study of Flt3-ITD knock-in mice in which phenotypic HSCs were reduced, Flt3 mRNA was found to be expressed in the phenotypically defined HSC compartment when analyzed at the cell population level (Chu et al., 2012), and based on this and other findings, it was concluded that a HSC-intrinsic mechanism is responsible for the observed HSC suppression in Flt3-ITD mice (Chu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this implicates a previously unrecognized HSC-intrinsic role for Flt3 and Flt3-ITD in governing the dynamics of the HSC compartment and potentially radically revises our understanding of the role of Flt3 in normal hematopoiesis and the impact of FLT3-ITDs on HSCs in hematologic malignancies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Because a definitive description of the heterogeneous expression pattern of Flt3 is important for understanding the physiological role of the receptor and the potential intrinsic impact of Flt3-ITD in HSC homeostasis, we herein explored Flt3 expression at the transcriptional and protein levels in the phenotypically defined HSC compartment at the single-cell level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We then explored whether the observed HSC suppression in Flt3-ITD mice might rather involve an HSC-extrinsic mechanism, including an impact on components of the HSC niche. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s03"><title><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Flt3 mRNA is expressed only in a small and distinct subset of phenotypically defined mouse HSCs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We first sought to investigate heterogeneity of Flt3 expression in phenotypically defined HSCs, by determining the relationship between Flt3 mRNA and cell-surface Flt3 protein expression at the single-cell level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Index FACS of 90 WT (Flt3+/+) Lin−Sca1+Kit+ (LSK) cells (Fig. 1 A), encompassing all HSCs as well as distinct subpopulations of MPPs, showed a significant correlation between surface Flt3 protein and Flt3 mRNA expression in the same single cells (Fig. 1 B; P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>All 28 LSK cells within the stringent phenotypic HSC compartment (LSKCD150+48−) clearly showed much lower expression of both Flt3 protein and Flt3 mRNA than other LSK cells (Fig. 1 C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis of 120 single LSKCD150+48− cells and 126 single LSK cells not residing in the LSKCD150+48− HSC compartment showed that as many as 72% of LSKCD150+48− cells did not express any detectable Flt3 at the single-cell level as opposed to only 13% of other (MPP) LSK cells (Fig. 1 C; P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the minority of phenotypic HSCs expressing Flt3 mRNA did so at a much lower level than did other (MPP) LSK cells (Fig. 1 C; P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Single-cell gene expression analysis of HSCs stratified according to presence (n = 33) or absence (n = 87) of Flt3 expression revealed reduced frequencies and/or levels of expression of key stem cell–associated genes (Vwf, Slamf1, and Gata3; Fig. 1 D) in Flt3 mRNA–positive cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Indeed, only 7 of 55 (13%) Vwf-expressing LSKCD150+48− HSCs, which reside at the apex of the hematopoietic hierarchy (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013), showed detectable Flt3 mRNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Further, Flt3 mRNA–negative HSCs showed reduced Cd34 mRNA expression, characteristic of adult mouse HSCs (Osawa et al., 1996; P = 0.05; Fig. 1 E), with strong correlation between Flt3 and Cd34 mRNA expression in LSK cells (P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1 F). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated a progressive and gene dosage–dependent severe suppression of phenotypically and functionally defined HSCs in Flt3-ITD knock-in mice, in keeping with previous work (Chu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Several previous studies, including Flt3-Cre fate mapping, concluded that Flt3 protein as well as mRNA expression in normal mouse hematopoiesis initiates in MPPs rather than bona fide HSCs (Adolfsson et al., 2001; Christensen and Weissman, 2001; Buza-Vidas et al., 2009, 2011; Boyer et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that the mechanism through which Flt3-ITDs affect the HSC reservoir is unlikely to be intrinsic to HSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, a recent study implied a previously unrecognized intrinsic impact of Flt3 in HSC homeostasis by concluding that the FLT3-ITD–induced HSC suppression is not extrinsically, but rather HSC-intrinsically, mediated in Flt3-ITD knock-in mice (Chu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The distinction between a cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic effect of Flt3-ITD on the HSC compartment is of considerable importance for understanding the role of Flt3 in normal hematopoiesis and the impact of Flt3-ITDs on HSCs in hematologic malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the possibility of HSC-intrinsic and -extrinsic impacts of Flt3-ITD through a combination of single-cell interrogation of Flt3 expression in the phenotypically defined HSC compartment, functional assays, and examination of key components of the HSC niche. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>If an HSC-intrinsic impact of Flt3-ITDs on HSCs were to explain the severe reduction in HSC numbers in Flt3-ITD mice, then the expectation would be that the Flt3 receptor is expressed in the large majority of HSCs, because the mutation cannot exert an intrinsic impact on HSCs when it is not expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Herein, using a highly sensitive nanofluidic approach to interrogate Flt3 expression at the single-cell level, we found that only a small fraction of LSKCD150+48− cells expressed Flt3 mRNA, and at very low levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this infrequent Flt3 expression was inversely correlated with expression of several HSC-associated genes, including Vwf, a highly specific marker of platelet-biased HSCs (Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, single-cell gene expression analysis of Flt3-ITD mice suggested that the phenotypic HSC compartment is composed primarily of progenitor cells, with a selective depletion of Flt3 mRNA–negative bona fide HSCs, which represent only a small minority of cells within the LSKCD150+48− population in Flt3-ITD mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been widely recognized that LSKCD150+48− cells (and any other phenotypically defined HSC population) also contain a substantial fraction of non-HSCs, and that the proportion of such contaminating non-HSCs within the phenotypically defined HSC compartment might be increased in genetically modified mice (Purton and Scadden, 2007), in particular if the fraction of bona fide HSCs is selectively depleted, such as described here in Flt3-ITD mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This selective loss of Flt3 mRNA–negative and Vwf-positive LSKCD150+48− cells in Flt3-ITD mice suggests that the LSKCD150+48− compartment in Flt3-ITD mice contains a much lower proportion of bona fide HSCs than in WT mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This was further supported by the dramatic loss of long-term reconstituting activity of BM cells from Flt3-ITD mice as established through competitive transplantation experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>These findings highlight the clear advantage of single-cell analysis to reveal cellular heterogeneity in phenotypically defined cell types that is not apparent at the cell population level (Wills and Mead, 2015), a finding that has potentially important implications for the analysis of other disease models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>It is not possible to exclude the possibility that some Flt3 mRNA might be expressed below the limit of detection of the assays; however, our single-cell gene expression analysis did not provide any support for a HSC-intrinsic suppression of bona fide HSCs in Flt3-ITD mice, and we therefore explored the possibility of a cell-extrinsic mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Although a competitive reconstitution assay (Purton and Scadden, 2007) is the only manner in which one can conclusively establish whether an observed reduction in HSC numbers is intrinsically or extrinsically mediated, reliable interpretation of the results depends entirely on a comparable number of genuine HSCs being transplanted from the genetically modified and control WT mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The extent of contaminating non-HSCs might be altered extensively in genetically modified mice, in particular if such non-HSCs are expanded compared with the WT setting or if the true HSCs are selectively depleted, as specifically demonstrated to be the case in Flt3-ITD mice through single-cell gene expression analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Thus, when HSC numbers as well as the HSC functional readout are already severely affected by a mutation such as Flt3-ITD, transplantation of equal numbers of functional HSCs is difficult if not impossible to achieve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Failure to take this heterogeneity into account can lead to false assumptions in the experimental design and incorrect interpretation of data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Consequently, transplantation of equal numbers of phenotypic HSCs will in reality result in transplantation of markedly lower numbers of functional HSCs from Flt3-ITD versus WT mice (Chu et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>In light of this, such a competitive assay must therefore be performed before a significant HSC phenotype has been acquired, through establishing BM chimeric mice either before the mutation is induced (requiring, unlike here and in the studies of Chu et al. [2012], a mouse model with an inducible mutation) or before the HSC phenotype has been acquired. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In our case, this was possible by establishing BM chimeras with E15 FL cells, at which time the number of LSKCD150+48− cells was unperturbed, likely because this is before the development of overt myeloproliferative disease in Flt3-ITD mice (Mead et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FL HSCs are extremely robust at engraftment (Bowie et al., 2007), and it is a frequently observed phenomenon in the literature that FL HSCs can sustain high-level engraftment in mouse models associated with a postnatal HSC defect (Jones et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Through this approach, we were able to provide definitive evidence of a marked cell-extrinsic effect of Flt3-ITDs on the HSC compartment, as WT competitor LSKCD150+48− cells were dramatically reduced in the presence of competing Flt3-ITD–expressing cells, in fact more extensively than LSKCD150+48− cells in the Flt3-ITD donor cells in the same mice, a finding in further support of LSKCD150+48− cells in Flt3-ITD mice being relatively depleted of genuine HSCs and most compatible with the observed HSC suppression in Flt3-ITD mice being mediated fully cell-extrinsically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Importantly, if in fact HSCs were already somewhat reduced in the FL of Flt3-ITD mice, we would if anything have underestimated the level of cell-extrinsic suppression of HSCs in the competitive transplantation experiments performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Distinguishing between a cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic impact of Flt3-ITD on HSCs is crucial, as it has extensive implications for the understanding of Flt3 as a key regulator of normal hematopoiesis and the impact and therapeutic targeting of FLT3-ITD mutations in hematologic malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Our findings are in line with results from other models of hematologic malignancies (Schepers et al., 2013) and human disease (Colmone et al., 2008), supporting an extrinsic impact of some hematopoietic tumors on HSCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We also explored the possible mechanistic basis of the HSC-extrinsic suppression of HSCs in Flt3-ITD mice through analysis of key cellular components and molecular determinants of the HSC niche. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>We found a two- to fivefold reduction in the numbers of MSCs and ECs in the BM of Flt3-ITD mice, both niche cell populations suggested to be critical for the regulation of HSCs (Morrison and Scadden, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ECs and MSCs in Flt3-ITD mice demonstrated aberrant gene expression, consistent with increased apoptosis and impaired EC homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Analysis of total BM MNCs also revealed dysregulation of genes implicated in angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In addition, mediators of inflammation known to be associated with suppression of HSCs, such as TNF-α (King and Goodell, 2011; Pronk et al., 2011), were overexpressed by ECs in Flt3-ITD mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, several inflammatory mediators are known to increase TNF expression in endothelial cells (Ranta et al., 1999; Imaizumi et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Inflammation and TNF signaling have also been directly implicated in the disruption of BM microenvironment and hematopoiesis in patients with a range of myeloid malignancies (Chen et al., 2016; Koschmieder et al., 2016), including elevated TNF levels in patients with AML (Sanchez-Correa et al., 2013), correlating with high leukocyte count and resistant disease (Tsimberidou et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>We therefore treated Flt3-ITD mice with a clinically approved anti-TNF therapy (etanercept), which resulted in a partial rescue of the HSC phenotype in Flt3-ITD mice, as confirmed in functional, competitive HSC repopulation assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Because etanercept treatment only partially rescued the HSC defect in Flt3-ITD mice, it is likely that other mechanisms of HSC repression, including other inflammatory mediators, might also play a role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Collectively, we observed both quantitative (reduction in numbers of ECs and MSCs) and qualitative (inflammation and TNF signaling) disruption of the BM microenvironment in Flt3-ITD mice, which likely underlie the observed extrinsic suppression of HSCs, in agreement with other studies implying that hematologic malignancies dysregulate HSC niches (Schepers et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Although genetically engineered mouse lines are imperfect model systems for human malignancies, our findings do raise several potentially highly relevant issues for the understanding of human AML biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Because only HSCs are capable of long-term propagation of the Flt3-ITD clone (Chu et al., 2012), this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of a tumor model that is dependent on propagation by a stem cell compartment which carries the relevant DNA mutation but nevertheless does not express the mutant protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Consequently, acquisition of the mutation by a HSC will have no intrinsic impact on the cell, exerting neither positive nor negative selection pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Although at a cell population level FLT3-ITD mutations are not easily detectable in preleukemic HSCs (Jan et al., 2012), it remains fully possible that rare HSCs might still carry the mutation, which upon subsequent differentiation and FLT3-ITD protein expression would confer a clonal advantage in a progenitor population, as here demonstrated for Flt3-expressing MPPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Indeed, there is ample support for such FLT3-expressing progenitor populations being transformed to become leukemic stem cell populations in patients with AML (Goardon et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The clinical use of small-molecule inhibitors of FLT3 signaling has in general been disappointing in AML (Kayser and Levis, 2014), with frequent acquisition of resistance causing mutations in patients demonstrating an initial response (Smith et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This suggests that inhibitor-insensitive FLT3-ITD mutated cells, potentially because they do not express the mutant protein, remain in responding patients, acting as a reservoir for the acquisition of additional mutations (Smith et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Given the lack of expression of the mutant protein, such mutant HSCs would not have a competitive advantage at the HSC level, but would nevertheless be very relevant for the initiation of AML and propagation of relapse, because they would not be targeted by FLT3 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Studies of leukemic stem cell populations would be insufficiently sensitive to detect such extremely rare cells, and further studies on larger patient cohorts to explore this possibility with single-cell resolution are therefore warranted. </plain></SENT>
