<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins attack cancer cells specifically while healthy tissue is spared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After internalization, immunotoxins traverse various intracellular compartments to reach the cytosol, where they ADP-ribosylate the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 resulting in an arrest of protein synthesis and the death of target cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Killing cancer cells by arresting protein synthesis is a unique mechanism among chemotherapeutic drugs which commonly interfere with nucleotide synthesis or microtubule dynamics [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, CD22-targeted immunotoxins are cytotoxic in the low pico-molar range against B-cell malignancies including hairy cell leukemia (HCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, immunotoxins are active in animal models of various B-cell malignancies [1, 2] and the CD22-targeted immunotoxin Moxetumomab pasudotox has been shown to achieve complete remission in half of the patients with therapy-refractory HCL [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite their substantial activity in vitro, CD22-targeted immunotoxins result in fewer than expected responses in patients with ALL [4] and fail to produce responses in CD22-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for the low response rate in these patients is the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins, which are derived from a bacterial toxin, are immunogenic in mammals and ADAs form quickly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with hematologic malignancies however, the immune system is compromised by the underlying disease and the development of ADAs takes up to several months [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients who are ADA positive frequently continue to respond [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ADAs therefore may not sufficiently explain the lower than expected response rate of CD22-targeted immunotoxins in ALL and lymphoma patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immunotoxins are small proteins which are rapidly cleared from the blood resulting in a short serum half-life of approximately 30 minutes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Because immunotoxins are currently administered as bolus doses, the blood concentration falls quickly below active levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As recently described, the time that cells have to be exposed to immunotoxin for them to die varies substantially from only a few minutes to more than four days [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cells that respond only if exposed to immunotoxin for more than 5 serum half-times cannot respond in vivo because blood levels fall too quickly and the exposure time is too short [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>By replacing bolus doses with the continuous administration, responses after only one treatment cycle improved greatly from a stable disease after bolus doses to a more than 10-fold reduction of the tumor mass in both, systemic ALL [4] and MCL [5] xenograft models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that patients may respond substantially better if treated with continuously administered immunotoxin rather than the currently used bolus doses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>While the maximally tolerated dose of immunotoxin given intravenously results in a high peak serum concentration, the steady state serum concentration of a similar amount given continuously is much lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The area under the curve (AUC) however is similar possibly explaining the similar off-target toxicity in mice which do not express human CD22 [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In patients, the blood counts of healthy B-cells remain unchanged after bolus doses of CD22-targeted immunotoxin [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because the continuous administration increases the on-target activity against malignant B-cells, it is reasonable to also expect an increase of on-target activity against healthy B-cells expressing CD22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Depletion of healthy B-cells results in reduced serum antibody titers [2], which might slow the development of ADAs possibly further increasing the clinical efficacy of CD22-targeted immunotoxins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>When the development of ADAs against mesothelin-targeted immunotoxins was suppressed by a co-administration of chemotherapy, the anti-tumor activity was increased and patients showed strong clinical evidence for the induction of an anti-cancer immune reaction [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Improved CD22-targeted immunotoxins may similarly induce an anti-lymphoma immune response which should be monitored in future clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As a separate approach to improve clinical responses, several groups searched for drugs that synergistically enhance immunotoxins [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Paclitaxel was identified as a potent enhancer of bolus doses of mesothelin-targeted immunotoxin in vivo resulting in a new clinical trial testing the combination against solid tumors (NCT02810418) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In line with these results, the combination of paclitaxel and CD22-targeted immunotoxin achieved a long-lasting durable remission in 60% of the mice bearing a systemic ALL xenograft and the efficacy of continuously administered immunotoxin was enhanced substantially by 100-fold in a systemic MCL mouse model [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These striking effects of the combination of continuously administered immunotoxin and paclitaxel strongly support future clinical trials in patients with B-cell malignancies [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Even though numerous novel therapies against B-cell malignancies are rapidly translated into clinical use including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), or small molecules targeting B-cell receptor signaling [2], our recent advances suggest that the well-tolerated CD22-targeted immunotoxins with their unique mode of action may become a future therapeutic option for more than HCL patients. </plain></SENT>
