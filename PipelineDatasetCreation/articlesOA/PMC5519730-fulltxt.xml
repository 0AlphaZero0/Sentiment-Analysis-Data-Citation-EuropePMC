Streptococci do so during a transient period of competence, triggered by pheromones that they produce, secrete and sense under conditions influenced by the environment. In <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic>, and species of the bovis, salivarius and pyogenic groups of streptococci, the pheromone XIP is sensed by the intra-cellular regulator ComR, that in turn activates the transcription of <italic>comS</italic>, encoding the XIP precursor, and of <italic>sigX</italic>, encoding the only known alternative sigma factor in streptococci. Although induction of <italic>comR</italic> during competence has been known for more than fifteen years, the mechanism regulating its expression remains unidentified. By a combination of directional RNA-sequencing, optimal competence conditions, stepwise deletions and marker-less genome editing, we found that SigX is the missing link in overproduction of ComR. In the absence of <italic>comR</italic> induction, both <italic>sigX</italic> expression and transformation were significantly reduced. Placing <italic>comR</italic> and <italic>comS</italic> transcripts under the control of different regulators so as to form two interlocked positive feedback circuits may enable <italic>S. mutans</italic> to fine-tune the kinetics and magnitude of the competence response according to their need.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Natural competence for genetic transformation is a survival strategy that enables streptococci to attack their siblings, take up the released DNA or other naked DNA in their surroundings, and incorporate it into their genomes. Most of the effector genes are conserved in streptococci, and are under the control of the alternative sigma factor SigX, the master regulator of competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. They comprise a set of 27 to 30 genes grouped into the core SigX regulon, showing a predominance of transformation functions, and accessory genes that depend on SigX for expression in species-specific patterns. Expression of SigX in a streptococcal population is triggered by communication signals that are peptide pheromones, produced as precursor molecules. The peptides are later processed and exported, and then sensed either by surface receptors of two-component regulatory systems or by intra-cellular regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Surface receptors involved in streptococcal competence that belong to the ComCDE class are found in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and other members of the mitis and anginosus groups of streptococci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this class, the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) pheromone encoded by <italic>comC</italic> binds to the membrane histidine kinase ComD, resulting in auto-phosphorylation and activation of the cognate response regulator ComE. The modified ComE then activates the promoters of both <italic>sigX</italic> and <italic>comCDE</italic>, inducing their transcription. In this way, the pheromone not only triggers the expression of the master regulator, but creates a positive feedback loop that strongly amplifies the signal.</p><p id="Par4">The second type of competence pheromone system belongs&#x0feff; to the ComRS class, found in <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic>, and in the salivarius, bovis, and pyogenic groups of streptococci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The pheromone in this class, a peptide encoded by <italic>comS</italic> known as XIP (SigX-inducing peptide), is imported by oligopeptide permeases. Once inside the cells the pheromone binds to and activates the intracellular regulator ComR. The ComRS complex, in analogy to the activated ComE regulator described above, activates the promoters of <italic>sigX</italic> and of the pheromone structural gene, <italic>comS</italic>. However, in contrast to the ComCDE class, which amplifies the signal by inducing the simultaneous expression of the pheromone and its regulator, in most of the ComRS class only the pheromone expression is induced. Yet, overexpression &#x0feff;&#x0feff;of <italic>com&#x0feff;R</italic> in <italic>S. mutans</italic> has a strong positive effect on transformation efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, while in the salivarius group, low levels of <italic>comR</italic> expression are associated with low transformation efficiency in a range of wild-type strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

This indicates that if this protein is produced at all, it has no effect on competence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conservation of the SMU.60 intragenic SigX-box in <italic>S. mutans</italic></title><p id="Par13">Analysis of all sequenced genomes of <italic>S. mutans</italic> using BLAST at COGE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genomevolution.org/coge">https://genomevolution.org/coge</ext-link>) revealed that the SMU.60 intragenic SigX-box and the position of the <italic>comR</italic> gene is similar in all of them, indicating that the regulation of <italic>comR</italic> by SigX is widely conserved in <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Other members of the mutans group of streptococci are <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus criceti</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus downei</italic>, and <italic>Streptococcus macacae</italic>, but <italic>comRS</italic> genes among these members were found only in <italic>S. macacae</italic>. The arrangement of the locus in <italic>S. macacae</italic> differs, however, from that in <italic>S. mutans</italic>, as there is an additional gene positioned between SMU.60 and <italic>comR</italic>, and that there is no apparent SigX-box in the SMU.60 intra-genic region. Among the 4 other streptococcal groups that use ComRS for competence regulation, including salivarius, bovis, <italic>S. suis</italic>, and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, only species in the bovis and pyogenic groups had a gene arrangement that resembled that in <italic>S. mutans</italic>, showing a <italic>purB</italic> gene upstream of <italic>comR</italic>.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par14">In bacteria that develop competence transiently, the coordinated up-regulation of dozens of genes is supported by one or more positive feedback loops. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, for instance, the exported CSP pheromone stimulates its own production via the ComDE two-component signal transduction system. Another example is the ComK transcription activator of the DNA-uptake and recombination machinery in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, which binds to its promoter to activate its own expression. In <italic>S. mutans</italic>, one positive feedback loop connects SigX to ComE and bacteriocin expression and a second connects XIP to <italic>comS</italic> expression. Both feedback loops are involved in the generation of population heterogeneity sometimes observed during competence in <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Yet, the bi-stability behavior cannot be explained by the two loops alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The involvement of an additional positive loop involving ComR has been put forward as a possible explanation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, no mechanism for the regulation of the central competence regulator ComR is yet known, and although increased expression of <italic>comR</italic> during <italic>S. mutans</italic> competence has been reported, the described changes are small<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">The proximity of the intragenic SMU.60 SigX box to <italic>comR</italic> and <italic>comS</italic> suggested that this region could play a previously unknown role in competence, perhaps in the regulation of <italic>comR</italic>. Using optimized protocols to achieve high levels of competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the induction of <italic>comR</italic> became more prominent. Nine-fold induction of <italic>comR</italic> was detected in CDM, in contrast to previous reports with results ranging from no induction to 1.4 and 4-fold induction&#x0feff;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Evaluation of transformation and <italic>sigX</italic> expression in mutants representing stepwise deletions within this segment revealed the regulatory mechanism involved. Marker-less single base substitutions to inactivate the SigX box resulted in a mutant that reproduced the partial competence inhibition found in the SigX box deletion mutant, whereas a base substitution that introduced a stop codon in the putative c105 orf encoding a peptide transcribed from the SigX-box had no effect on competence. Finally, the RNA-seq and RT-PCR results indicating that the transcript initiated at the SigX-box is co-transcribed with <italic>comR</italic>, led to the conclusion that SigX regulates <italic>comR</italic> expression. The discovered mechanism for <italic>comR</italic> regulation is apparently the missing explanation for previous reports on <italic>comR</italic> induction during competence. It may also explain why complementation of a <italic>comR</italic> deletion mutant with a plasmid that incorporates only the proximal promoter of <italic>comR</italic>, and not the SigX-box, does not completely rescue the transformation phenotype observed in the wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, while expressing the same plasmid in the wild type results in a ten-fold increase in transformation efficiency.</p><p id="Par16">Distal to <italic>comS</italic>, there is an additional set of genes consistently reported as up-regulated during competence that extends from SMU.64 to SMU.66, and occasionally to SMU.68<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Between <italic>comS</italic> and this set of genes is SMU.63c, which codes for a recently identified amyloid protein induced by both XIP and CSP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The reported induction in gene expression contrasts with a recent microarray study using directly labeled RNA, showing that induction of SMU.63c was restricted to the non-coding strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The present directional RNA-seq results confirmed this observation, and showed that in the sense-direction, the expression of SMU.63c was actually reduced by more than 35-fold. While the most reasonable explanation for the increase in SMU.63c expression reported in previous studies is the use of methodologies that are not strand specific, it does not account for a recent transcriptome study using a directional approach that showed an increase of SMU.63c in the sense direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In the absence of a candidate regulator for SMU.63.c, it is reasonable to infer that SMU.63c transcription is induced from the non-coding strand as part of a single transcript that extends all the way to SMU.66 or beyond, depending on the magnitude of competence induction.</p><p id="Par17">Streptococci have a core of 27 to 30 genes that are under the control of the alternative sigma factor SigX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. All of them were induced by XIP in the present study, confirming the conservation of the regulon. Two other studies have also investigated the effect of XIP on <italic>S. mutans</italic> competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

In the other, only <italic>dut</italic> and <italic>radA</italic> were not found to be up-regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The <italic>dut</italic> and <italic>radA</italic> genes are transcribed as a single operon that is among the least induced transcripts of the SigX regulon, which may explain why their induction was not detected in the two studies. The fold changes for all genes in this study, as well as in the previous comprehensive study defining the core set of panstreptococcal genes of the SigX regulon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and the recently reported XIP transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> are presented in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. All the accessory genes of the SigX regulon, as well as the genes of the ComRS and ComE regulons identified in the comprehensive study mentioned above were also up-regulated in our study. The surpluses of genes induced in the present study were, except for a transcript initiated at SMU.1340, extension of transcripts belonging to one of the three regulons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">A notable feature of the regulons induced during competence in streptococci is that core genes lie close to the promoters recognized by the main regulators of competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The majority has a function directly linked to natural transformation. The link to stress responses, on the other hand, is not well understood, and in most cases is related to accessory genes located downstream of the core genes. Among these is the <italic>relQ</italic> ppGpp synthase (SMU.1046c) and <italic>levDEFG</italic> (SMU1957 to SMU.1961), both associated with nutritional stress, and induced by XIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The present results confirmed their up-regulation and further revealed that they belong to the class of accessory genes which transcription initiates from upstream core genes of the competence system (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It remains to be determined whether <italic>S. mutans</italic> may have co-opted this arrangement of SigX regulons close to genes that may slow down their growth as part of a stress response, or whether what we observe is an indirect effect caused by variation in terminator presence and efficacy, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">Combining the present results with previous literature, leads to a model in which <italic>comR</italic> is expressed at a basal level under non-competence conditions, using a P1 neighbor promoter near a distal palindromic sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). During development of competence, XIP or intracellular ComS binds to ComR, initiating the competence response. This leads to elevated transcription of <italic>sigX</italic> and <italic>comS</italic>, and to increased levels of SigX and XIP. SigX in turn drives increased transcription of <italic>comR</italic> from a secondary promoter (Px), to assure that sufficient amounts of the ComR regulator are produced to mount an appropriate response. Placing <italic>comR</italic> and <italic>comS</italic> transcripts under the control of different regulators so as to form two interlocked positive feedback circuits may help <italic>S. mutans</italic> to better adjust the kinetics and magnitude of the competence response. This tight control is particularly important given the fitness cost of competence, which should be high judging by the significant autolysis observed in part of the competent <italic>S. mutans</italic> population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and the dramatic changes in the array of proteins synthesized during competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Model of <italic>comR</italic> regulation.

Overlapping primers were designed with three single base substitutions in the SigX box of SMU.60 present upstream of <italic>comR</italic>. The introduction of three base substitutions inactivated the SigX box with creation of silent mutation in gene SMU.60. The resulting amplicon containing the desired substitutions were transformed in <italic>S. mutans</italic> UA159. Colonies were selected and screened by PCR to identify a clone containing the mutated SigX box, which was designated as SM218. The amplicon was also transformed into SM091 to place the mutation in a <italic>comS</italic> defective background (SM221).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Transformation</title><p id="Par24">Competence for natural transformation in <italic>S. mutans</italic> can be achieved either indirectly by use of CSP or directly with XIP; hence, two different protocols previously described were used for transformation in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A traditional method uses CSP in complex media such as THY and does not require chemically-defined media, while a recently described method using XIP in CDM results in higher efficiency of transformation. The traditional method was used for transformation of mutations carrying antibiotic markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, since maximal transformation levels were not required. Briefly, pre-culture stocks at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.5 were diluted 1:10, and CSP was added to a final concentration of 50&#x02009;nM. Purified PCR products were used as donor DNA. Cultures were then incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in air for 3&#x02009;h. The more recent strategy using XIP in CDM was employed for construction of marker-less mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Luciferase reporter assays</title><p id="Par25">For luciferase assays, frozen pre-cultures of reporter strains were prepared by growth in CDM to an optical density at 600&#x02009;nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.5, supplementation to 15% glycerol, and storage at &#x02212;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. For the experiments, pre-cultures were thawed, diluted 10-fold in CDM in the presence or absence of 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M XIP, and distributed as 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;L aliquots in wells of 96-well microtiter plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blank wells contained only CDM and luciferin. A volume of 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of a 1&#x02009;mM aqueous D-luciferin solution (Synchem, Felsberg-Altenberg, Germany) was added to each well, followed by sealing of the plates with Top Seal (PerkinElmer), and incubation at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Relative luminescence units (RLU) and OD600 were measured at various time intervals during growth by reading the plates in a multi-detection microplate reader (Synergy HT and Cytation 3; BioTek).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Real time PCR</title><p id="Par26">For RNA extraction, the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche) was used, following the protocol provided by the producer, except that we added one step to improve cell lysis: cells were incubated at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02009;min in 200&#x02009;&#x003bc;L of lysis buffer containing 10&#x02009;mM Tris (pH 8), 20&#x02009;mg per mL of lysozyme, and 100 U of mutanolysin per mL. DNase I was used during and after RNA extraction to ensure complete removal of DNA. Templates of cDNA templates were prepared from RNA with the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In all assays, controls without reverse transcriptase were included. Assays were carried out with quantitative PCR master mix SYBR green/ROX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer&#x02032;s protocol. For data comparisons, ROX was used as a reference, and the constitutive gene <italic>gyrA</italic> as a normalizer. Real-time PCR was performed (Agilent Technologies Stratagene Mx3005&#x02009;P), and data were collected and analyzed with the software and graphics program MxPro (Stratagene).

Gel electrophoresis was performed by preparing 1% Gel (SeaKem LE Agarose; Lonza) in TAE Buffer with SYBR safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 1:10000. Sample and loading dye were mixed 5:1 and loaded into the wells of agarose gel. Gels were protected from light during 25&#x02013;50&#x02009;min at 65&#x02009;V. Gene ruler 1&#x02009;kb ladder was used as a size standard, and images were captured in G:Box (Syngene) with GeneSnap software v.7.12 (Syngene).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>RNA-sequencing analysis</title><p id="Par28">An overnight culture of SM065 was diluted 1:10 in CDM to a final volume of 180&#x02009;mL, corresponding to an optical density at 600&#x02009;nm of 0.2. Total volume of diluted culture was equally divided into two tubes and grown in the presence or absence of 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M XIP for 2&#x02009;hours at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0,4); cells were then harvested for RNA extraction. Initial RNA extraction was performed with the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies), followed by DNase treatment with TURBO DNase (Life Technologies) and a second RNA extraction. RNA quality was verified by running the samples on Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100 Expert) prior to enrichment with MICROBExpress (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, purified RNA was incubated with the Capture Oligonucleotide Mix in Binding Buffer for 15&#x02009;minutes. Magnetic beads, derivatized with an oligonucleotide that hybridizes to the capture oligonucleotide, were then added to the mixture and allowed to hybridize for 15&#x02009;minutes. The magnetic beads, with 16&#x02009;S and 23&#x02009;S rRNAs attached, were pulled to the side of the tube with a magnet. The enriched RNA in the supernatant was transferred to a new microtube. Magnetic beads were briefly washed, and finally the RNA was precipitated with ethanol. More than 90% removal of 16&#x02009;S and 23&#x02009;S rRNA was verified using Bioanalyzer. The RNA samples were then treated with NEXTFlex Directional RNA-seq Kit (dUTP based) for preparation of the DNA library for sequencing using Illumina&#x000ae; HiSeq, following the intructions provided by the producer. A FASTQ file was generated for each sample. Bioinformatic analyses were performed as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Briefly, using the software Bowtie, nucleotide reads were mapped to the annotated genome of strain UA159 (GenBank accession: NC_004350.2). SAMtools software was used to divide the reads in each according strand. For visualization, JBrowse viewer was employed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Differential expression analyses of samples with and without XIP were determined based on the mapped read profiles using a Perl script. The read counts were subjected to &#x0201c;DESeq&#x0201d; to evaluate the differential levels when comparing samples. The results are derived as means from three independently conducted biological experiments. The average and standard deviation for the total number of paired-end sequenced fragments was 7 456 931 (SD 27 663) for the control, and 7 271 703 (SD 365 331) for the XIP-treated samples.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
