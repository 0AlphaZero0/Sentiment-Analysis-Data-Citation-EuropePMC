</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Natural competence for genetic transformation is a survival strategy that enables streptococci to attack their siblings, take up the released DNA or other naked DNA in their surroundings, and incorporate it into their genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most of the effector genes are conserved in streptococci, and are under the control of the alternative sigma factor SigX, the master regulator of competence1–4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They comprise a set of 27 to 30 genes grouped into the core SigX regulon, showing a predominance of transformation functions, and accessory genes that depend on SigX for expression in species-specific patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Expression of SigX in a streptococcal population is triggered by communication signals that are peptide pheromones, produced as precursor molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The peptides are later processed and exported, and then sensed either by surface receptors of two-component regulatory systems or by intra-cellular regulators5–9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surface receptors involved in streptococcal competence that belong to the ComCDE class are found in S. pneumoniae and other members of the mitis and anginosus groups of streptococci5, 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In this class, the competence stimulating peptide (CSP) pheromone encoded by comC binds to the membrane histidine kinase ComD, resulting in auto-phosphorylation and activation of the cognate response regulator ComE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The modified ComE then activates the promoters of both sigX and comCDE, inducing their transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In this way, the pheromone not only triggers the expression of the master regulator, but creates a positive feedback loop that strongly amplifies the signal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The second type of competence pheromone system belongs﻿ to the ComRS class, found in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus suis, and in the salivarius, bovis, and pyogenic groups of streptococci1, 6, 7, 11–14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The pheromone in this class, a peptide encoded by comS known as XIP (SigX-inducing peptide), is imported by oligopeptide permeases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Once inside the cells the pheromone binds to and activates the intracellular regulator ComR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The ComRS complex, in analogy to the activated ComE regulator described above, activates the promoters of sigX and of the pheromone structural gene, comS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to the ComCDE class, which amplifies the signal by inducing the simultaneous expression of the pheromone and its regulator, in most of the ComRS class only the pheromone expression is induced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Yet, overexpression ﻿﻿of com﻿R in S. mutans has a strong positive effect on transformation efficiency7, while in the salivarius group, low levels of comR expression are associated with low transformation efficiency in a range of wild-type strains15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, although mechanisms for comR regulation remain unknown, accumulated evidence indicates that control of comR expression would provide an additional way for streptococci to fine tune the competence response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Variable levels of comR induction are actually observed among the genes up-regulated during S. mutans competence16–20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the 3′ portion of the gene immediately upstream of comR was recently found to be up-regulated upon stimulation of competence, possibly by SigX2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that this region may have a role in competence, mediated by either a putative peptide annotated as smut_c_1_105 at the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.homd.org">http://www.homd.org</ext-link>), or by acting as an intragenic start site for transcription of comR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Using a combination of directional RNA-sequencing, optimal competence conditions, stepwise deletions and direct genome editing of the putative peptide gene and of the SigX-box upstream of comR, the present study shows that SigX, the master regulator of competence, is the missing link in overproduction of ComR during development of competence in S. mutans. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In bacteria that develop competence transiently, the coordinated up-regulation of dozens of genes is supported by one or more positive feedback loops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In S. pneumoniae, for instance, the exported CSP pheromone stimulates its own production via the ComDE two-component signal transduction system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Another example is the ComK transcription activator of the DNA-uptake and recombination machinery in Bacillus subtilis, which binds to its promoter to activate its own expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In S. mutans, one positive feedback loop connects SigX to ComE and bacteriocin expression and a second connects XIP to comS expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Both feedback loops are involved in the generation of population heterogeneity sometimes observed during competence in S. mutans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Yet, the bi-stability behavior cannot be explained by the two loops alone23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The involvement of an additional positive loop involving ComR has been put forward as a possible explanation24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>However, no mechanism for the regulation of the central competence regulator ComR is yet known, and although increased expression of comR during S. mutans competence has been reported, the described changes are small16–20. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The proximity of the intragenic SMU.60 SigX box to comR and comS suggested that this region could play a previously unknown role in competence, perhaps in the regulation of comR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Using optimized protocols to achieve high levels of competence21, 25, the induction of comR became more prominent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Nine-fold induction of comR was detected in CDM, in contrast to previous reports with results ranging from no induction to 1.4 and 4-fold induction﻿2, 16–20, 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of transformation and sigX expression in mutants representing stepwise deletions within this segment revealed the regulatory mechanism involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Marker-less single base substitutions to inactivate the SigX box resulted in a mutant that reproduced the partial competence inhibition found in the SigX box deletion mutant, whereas a base substitution that introduced a stop codon in the putative c105 orf encoding a peptide transcribed from the SigX-box had no effect on competence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Finally, the RNA-seq and RT-PCR results indicating that the transcript initiated at the SigX-box is co-transcribed with comR, led to the conclusion that SigX regulates comR expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The discovered mechanism for comR regulation is apparently the missing explanation for previous reports on comR induction during competence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>It may also explain why complementation of a comR deletion mutant with a plasmid that incorporates only the proximal promoter of comR, and not the SigX-box, does not completely rescue the transformation phenotype observed in the wild type7, while expressing the same plasmid in the wild type results in a ten-fold increase in transformation efficiency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Distal to comS, there is an additional set of genes consistently reported as up-regulated during competence that extends from SMU.64 to SMU.66, and occasionally to SMU.6816–20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Between comS and this set of genes is SMU.63c, which codes for a recently identified amyloid protein induced by both XIP and CSP27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The reported induction in gene expression contrasts with a recent microarray study using directly labeled RNA, showing that induction of SMU.63c was restricted to the non-coding strand2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The present directional RNA-seq results confirmed this observation, and showed that in the sense-direction, the expression of SMU.63c was actually reduced by more than 35-fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>While the most reasonable explanation for the increase in SMU.63c expression reported in previous studies is the use of methodologies that are not strand specific, it does not account for a recent transcriptome study using a directional approach that showed an increase of SMU.63c in the sense direction26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a candidate regulator for SMU.63.c, it is reasonable to infer that SMU.63c transcription is induced from the non-coding strand as part of a single transcript that extends all the way to SMU.66 or beyond, depending on the magnitude of competence induction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Streptococci have a core of 27 to 30 genes that are under the control of the alternative sigma factor SigX2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>All of them were induced by XIP in the present study, confirming the conservation of the regulon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Two other studies have also investigated the effect of XIP on S. mutans competence20, 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In the first, five of the SigX core genes were not induced during competence (dut, radA, dpnA, pilC, and radC)20, but in this study exposure to XIP was for a short period, and under conditions that do not prevent endogenous XIP production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In the other, only dut and radA were not found to be up-regulated26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The dut and radA genes are transcribed as a single operon that is among the least induced transcripts of the SigX regulon, which may explain why their induction was not detected in the two studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The fold changes for all genes in this study, as well as in the previous comprehensive study defining the core set of panstreptococcal genes of the SigX regulon2, and the recently reported XIP transcriptome26 are presented in Supplementary Table S1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>All the accessory genes of the SigX regulon, as well as the genes of the ComRS and ComE regulons identified in the comprehensive study mentioned above were also up-regulated in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The surpluses of genes induced in the present study were, except for a transcript initiated at SMU.1340, extension of transcripts belonging to one of the three regulons (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>A notable feature of the regulons induced during competence in streptococci is that core genes lie close to the promoters recognized by the main regulators of competence2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The majority has a function directly linked to natural transformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The link to stress responses, on the other hand, is not well understood, and in most cases is related to accessory genes located downstream of the core genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Among these is the relQ ppGpp synthase (SMU.1046c) and levDEFG (SMU1957 to SMU.1961), both associated with nutritional stress, and induced by XIP26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The present results confirmed their up-regulation and further revealed that they belong to the class of accessory genes which transcription initiates from upstream core genes of the competence system (Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>It remains to be determined whether S. mutans may have co-opted this arrangement of SigX regulons close to genes that may slow down their growth as part of a stress response, or whether what we observe is an indirect effect caused by variation in terminator presence and efficacy, as previously suggested2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Combining the present results with previous literature, leads to a model in which comR is expressed at a basal level under non-competence conditions, using a P1 neighbor promoter near a distal palindromic sequence (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>During development of competence, XIP or intracellular ComS binds to ComR, initiating the competence response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This leads to elevated transcription of sigX and comS, and to increased levels of SigX and XIP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>SigX in turn drives increased transcription of comR from a secondary promoter (Px), to assure that sufficient amounts of the ComR regulator are produced to mount an appropriate response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Placing comR and comS transcripts under the control of different regulators so as to form two interlocked positive feedback circuits may help S. mutans to better adjust the kinetics and magnitude of the competence response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This tight control is particularly important given the fitness cost of competence, which should be high judging by the significant autolysis observed in part of the competent S. mutans population28, and the dramatic changes in the array of proteins synthesized during competence29.Figure 8Model of comR regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>(1) Basal levels of ComR and the XIP precursor ComS are kept by transcription of comRS from the promoter P1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Imported XIP binds to ComR, forming the ComRS complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>(2) ComRS induces the expression of sigX and comS, by binding to the PR promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This positive feedback loop generates increased amounts of XIP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>(3) A second positive feedback loop is mediated by SigX, which, upon recognizing an intragenic SigX-box in the comR neighbor gene SMU.60, up-regulates the expression of comR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Thus, the system couples expression of comS, comR, and sigX to maximize amounts of the ComR regulator and the XIP cognate pheromone during competence. </plain></SENT>
