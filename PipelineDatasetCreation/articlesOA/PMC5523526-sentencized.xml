</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Protein protease inhibitors (PPIs) are proteins that diminish the proteolytic activity of proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>They form a stable complex with target proteinase by either altering, blocking, or preventing access to the active site of enzyme and hence play important role in regulation of proteolysis.[1] PPIs are omnipresent and versatile and hence are used in a wide range of field including their role as therapeutic agents in diseases, specifically cellular transformation, osteoporosis, blood clotting disorders, retroviral disease, cancer, etc., Currently, PPIs are keenly investigated for their role as anticancer agents, i.e., inhibition of transformed cell growth.[2345] Metastasis of cancer cells requires action of the matrix metalloproteinases and serine proteases that constitute a complex interacting protease cascade system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Hence, inhibition of such processes and proteins is most likely to be the molecular targets for cancer prevention.[6] Furthermore, studies are being performed to investigate protease inhibitors (PIs) as novel drugs in highly active antiretroviral combination therapy, which aim to increase life expectancy of an HIV-positive patient.[78] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In field of agriculture, to counterbalance the loss caused by chemical pesticides, plant PPIs have gained remarkable attention as natural defense agents in plants.[9] Along with the role of growth inhibition of insects and pests, PPIs also show inhibitory activity of pathogenic nematodes such as Globodera tabaccum[10] and pathogenic fungi such as Trichoderma reesei[11] and Alternaria alternata.[12] With the wide range of applications in the field of medicine and agriculture, researchers have gained a keen interest in searching novel PPIs and their therapeutic importance.[13] Therefore, a number of PPIs have been isolated and characterized from various plant sources.[14151617181920] </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This system includes use of defense proteins such as PIs, lectins, amylase inhibitors, and few pathogenesis-related proteins.[21222324] To be specific, pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) seeds contain PIs of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and amylases,[2526] as well as secondary metabolites and phytolectins,[2728] as the defense machinery against pest and microbial infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Pichare and Kachole have reported seven isoforms of trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitors and two isoforms of trypsin inhibitors (TIs) from C. cajan seeds.[29] In addition, Godbole et al. and Haq and Khan depicted C. cajan PI (CCPI) as Kunitz-type PI having inhibitory activity against trypsin and chymotrypsin.[1730] Our study aimed to purify CCPI from the seeds of C. cajan and its role in cellular cytotoxicity in normal and cancer cell line was assessed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>We have purified ~10 mg CCPI from 100 g seeds of C. cajan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that CCPI showed low cytotoxic effects of in HEK, i.e., 27% as compared in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells with 51% cytotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The CCPI protein was crystallized in 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 15% (w/v) PEG 6000 conditions in the interval of 2–3 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The crystals developed were rod-shaped but could not be diffracted due to some reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The CCPI sequence (Uniprot: Q5U9N0) was analyzed and showed that it had 176 amino acid sequences;first 1–19 were signal peptides and rest were chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The 3D structure created elucidated the presence of 3 beta-sheets, 3 beta-hairpins, 2 β-bulges, 6 strands, 3 helices, 1 helix–helix interaction, 41 β-turns, and 27 γ-turns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>To conclude, CCPI crystal can further be refined so that it can be used as a lead molecule in the drug discovery pipeline against tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>With this lead in hand, we intend to exploit it further to study the exact mode of action and elaborated studies in the near future. </plain></SENT>
