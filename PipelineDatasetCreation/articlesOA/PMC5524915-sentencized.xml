</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the health domain is progressively expanding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recently, increasing attention is devoted to the field of neurodegenerative disorders (ND), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where ICT is employed both to support and improve the assessment of different functional and cognitive abilities (Aalbers et al., 2013; Robert et al., 2013; König et al., 2015), and to provide alternative solutions for patients’ treatments, stimulation, and rehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A field which is rapidly growing is that of Serious Games (SG), which are mental and/or physical contests played with a computer in accordance with specific rules, which use entertainment to promote training, education, health, public policy, and strategic communication objectives (Zyda, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Contrary to other ICT-based tools, such as computerized testing or cognitive training, SG embed the playful and entertaining aspects typical of video-games into the ‘serious’ activity, by applying a pedagogic scenario to the game scenario (Alvarez, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The features typical of SG, such as the presence of a game challenge and of long-term goals, have been proposed to make SG more adapted than classical computer-based training to sustain generalization of learnt activities to real life situations (Whyte et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For this reason, recommendations for the design of SG targeting ND are starting to emerge (e.g., Bouchard et al., 2012; Fua et al., 2013; Mader, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, recommendations on the use of SG in these populations are still rare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In 2014, we proposed some initial recommendations for the use of SG in people with ND, gathered by experts in the field during a consensus group (Robert et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we systematically analyzed the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) of employing SG with these patients, and reported practical guidelines on when, where, and with whom SG should be employed, and to specify which categories of patients and which abilities should be targeted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since then, a few empirical studies were published on the use of SG in these populations, describing the feasibility of employing SG targeting improvements in social/emotional wellbeing (Beneviste et al., 2012), SG training cognitive abilities such as executive functions (Manera et al., 2015), and Serious Exergames including a combination of cognitive training and physical training (Ben-Sadoun et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A few more SG were designed for these patients to train cognitive abilities such as memory (Kim et al., 2015) and several aspects of visual attention (Mader et al., 2012), but they have not been tested so far on people with ND. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Based on these new works and on the experience gained by different research centers involved in the use of SG in people with ND in the last years (e.g., the CoBTeK research laboratory of the Université Côte d’Azur, France; the Hopital Broca in Paris, France; the Radboud Alzheimer Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Neuroscape in San Francisco, CA, United States) the aim of the present work is to update the recommendations published in 2014, thanks to a Delphi expert panel. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Neurodegenerative Disorders (ND) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>ND progress through several stages in several years, and ultimately lead to dementia, a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Dementia can result from different causes, the most common being AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It is often preceded by a pre-dementia stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), characterized by a cognitive decline greater than expected for an individual’s age, which, however, does not interfere notably with activities of daily living (Petersen et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Depending on the etiology and the disease’s stage, dementia can be characterized by cognitive, behavioral, motor, and/or functional symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The biological processes involved in ND are very heterogeneous, and include neuroinflammation, gliosis, synaptic loss, neurodegeneration, cerebral atrophy, and alterations of the blood–brain barrier permeability (Raz et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These molecular alterations are due, among others, to alterations in the bioenergy metabolism, to hypoperfusion/hypoxia, and to dysfunctions of the cerebrovascular hemodynamic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>From a therapeutic point of view, much research aims to modify the course of the disease or to reduce the impact of the clinical symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Social interaction, physical and cognitive activities, and motivation can have a major impact on the disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Hence, non-pharmacological approaches targeting people’s lifestyle are of particular interest. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Serious Games for People with Neurodegenerative Disorders </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Boosted by the publication of a Nature letter showing that video game training can enhance cognitive control in older adults (Anguera et al., 2013), there is now a growing interest in developing SG specifically adapted to people with ND. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Evidence is accumulating showing that video-games and VR-applications can successfully be employed for early detection and monitoring of physical and cognitive impairment (e.g., Tarnanas et al., 2013; Aalbers et al., 2016; Negut et al., 2016; Zygouris et al., 2017), but also to train physical and cognitive abilities in people with AD, MCI, and related disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the field of training, most of the research work so far has been conducted employing commercial video-games and cognitive games (such as Wii Fit and Wii Sport, Lumosity) designed for an entertaining purpose, and with a ‘typical’ healthy user in mind. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In their review on the use of video-games in people with dementia-related disorders, McCallum and Boletsis (2013) showed that: (a) Exergames, i.e., games that promote physical condition and/or aerobic fitness can positively affect several areas of mobility in participants with mild AD and MCI, such as balance and gait (Padala et al., 2012), and voluntary motor control (Legouverneur et al., 2011); (b) cognitive games can improve cognitive functions, such as attention and memory (Stavros et al., 2010; Weybright et al., 2010) and visuo-spatial abilities (Yamaguchi et al., 2011); (c) physical and cognitive games can have a positive impact on social and emotional functions, for instance they can improve the mood and increase positive affect and sociability (Weybright et al., 2010; Boulay et al., 2011) and reduce depression (Férnandez-Calvo et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As the field is young, less evidence is available on the efficacy of SG specifically designed for the training of people with ND. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, evidence collected in three studies suggests that SG and Serious Exergames are acceptable and motivating even for people with dementia. Beneviste et al. (2012) designed a SG based on musico-therapy targeting patients with AD and mild to moderate dementia aiming at improving patients’ self-image and to reduce their behavioral symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Players use Wiimotes with WiiPistol to improvise or play predefined songs on a virtual keyboard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Results of a 2-month usability study conducted on seven AD patients confirmed that the SG was usable by AD patients despite their motor and cognitive impairments, and that patients were overall very satisfied with the game and expressed a desire to repeat the experience. Manera et al. (2015) found similar results with ‘Kitchen and cooking,’ a SG designed to train executive functions and praxis in people with MCI and early AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The results of a 4-week feasibility study conducted on 21 participants (with MCI or early to moderate AD) confirmed that the game was acceptable and usable both at home and in a nursing home setting, and that patients were able to improve their game performance over the training, as confirmed by the fact that they became faster in the game activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Finally, Ben-Sadoun et al. (2016) showed that X-Torp, a Serious Exergame designed to train physical, cognitive and social functions, was well accepted by people with dementia and MCI (N = 10) and healthy elderly controls (N = 8), and that during a 1-month trial participants experienced mainly positive emotions, improved their cardio-respiratory fitness, and were able to progress in the cognitive games scenarios. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>A number of methodological changes were performed compared to the 2014 consensus panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>First of all, the 2014 recommendations were collected in a single round, without following the classical Delphi methodology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Indeed in the standard Delphi method (Linstone and Turoff, 1975) experts are asked to answer questions in two (or more) rounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>After each round, a facilitator provides a summary of the experts’ responses, and encourages the experts to analyze, comment and (eventually) revise their earlier answers in light of the commentaries of other members of the panel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The recommendations reported in the present paper followed the classical Delphi method (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Second, in 2014 we asked participants to rate each question on a 4-point scale (‘not adapted at all,’ ‘not very adapted,’ ‘adapted’ and ‘very adapted’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Here, we selected instead a 5-point scale (‘not adapted at all,’ ‘not very adapted,’ ‘adapted,’ ‘very adapted’ and ‘completely adapted’) to improve the symmetry of this Likert-type scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Third, in the 2014 study several questions collapsed persons with MCI and more advanced stages of AD (‘people with AD and related disorders’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>As recommendations for these two groups may be quite different, in the present study we kept them as separated categories for all the questions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Forth, we collapsed in a single questions the ‘Where’ and ‘With whom’ questions (see below), in order to better explore the exact contributions of (and interactions between) these two factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Finally, we added a number of response alternatives to several questions, in order to obtain more precise information (e.g., in the ‘When’ question, we employed 6 response alternatives instead of 3). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Since the publication of our previous recommendations on the use of SG (Robert et al., 2014), a number of SG were developed and tested with older people with MCI and dementia to train physical and cognitive abilities and to improve emotional wellbeing (Beneviste et al., 2012; Manera et al., 2015; Ben-Sadoun et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>These studies showed promising results, but also a number of usability challenges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Reported difficulties included, for instance, a higher fatigability of people with MCI and dementia in physically stimulating SG compared to healthy older adults (Ben-Sadoun et al., 2016), and, for several participants with cognitive impairment, low motivation to play SG when not accompanied by a family or professional caregiver (Manera et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>These difficulties were reported despite these SG were specifically designed for people in these populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the feasibility of employing SG with people with ND does not depend only on the game design features: an important component is the training format and structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>This confirms the importance of providing recommendations not only for the design, but also on the use of SG, that should be tested in clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Starting from the recommendations published in 2014 (Robert et al., 2014), the aim of the present paper was to draft guidelines for the use of SG in people with ND, thanks to a review of recently published studies employing SG in these populations, and gathering the opinion of experts in the field in a Delphi expert panel. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Serious Games were rated as more adapted to people with MCI compared to people with dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The results are converging with those reported in our previous recommendations (SG were considered between ‘adapted’ and ‘very adapted’ to people with MCI, and between ‘not very adapted’ and ‘adapted’ to people with AD and related disorders; Robert et al., 2014), and suggest that SG may be more useful for people with initial cognitive decline than to people which are already loosing autonomy in activities of daily living. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This can be explained, on one hand, by the recognition that the cognitive decline associated to dementia (working memory, attention, etc.) makes it more challenging to design and employ SG in this population; and on the other hand, by the recognition that early interventions targeting initial cognitive decline are supposed to be more effective compared to late interventions (Barnett et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Anyway, SG are considered as adaptable also to people with dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by recent studies showing that SG are usable in people with dementia both when played alone (e.g., Manera et al., 2015) and with a clinician (Ben-Sadoun et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Ongoing studies are also exploring the efficacy of ICT-based devices (e.g., avatars, contextual helps) in supporting older adults with SG use, showing initial promising results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="223" pm="?"><plain>What Should Be the Target? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Assessment, training and promoting wellbeing were all rated as good targets for SG in people with MCI and dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in the 2014 recommendations, assessment, stimulation and rehabilitation were all rated as good targets for people with AD and related disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Favoring social exchanges was not considered as the best target because most of the existing SG for older adults are not social (i.e., they are designed for a single player). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>However, emerging SG are also targeting the social domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Some of these SG are showing promising results (Ben-Sadoun et al., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Training targeting the cognitive domain and teaching contents may be more suitable to people with MCI compared to people with dementia, as they require some intact learning abilities to be optimized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>However, beyond the selection of a clinical target for each patient’s category, an important aspect to take into account is that the selection of a SG should be personalized, and based on extensive clinical assessments aiming at identifying primary and secondary targets in the cognitive, motivational and emotional domains for each patient (Mishra et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The assessment can also help to define the main follow up parameters, and the kind of feedback needed by each patient based on his/her challenges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>For all conditions, SG should ultimately aim at targeting improvements in daily activities (autonomy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In other words, improvements in game activities should generalize to untrained abilities (Anguera et al., 2013), and demonstrate an impact on real life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>SG design principles, such as inclusion of long-term goals embedded in a cohesive narrative instruction, and of specific generalization activities (e.g., instructional supports), may be important for encouraging transfer of knowledge from the computer to in-person settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, even improving autonomy in the SG activity alone could have a positive impact on motivation and quality of life: indeed the need of autonomy is one of the main drivers of the intrinsic motivation to play videogames in younger people (Deci and Ryan, 2000; Przybylski et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>This does not necessarily extend to people with ND. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="?"><plain>Is the need of autonomy the main motivational driver also for older adults with cognitive impairment, or are there other needs (e.g., social satisfaction/recognition)? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>To advance the work in this area, more research should be devoted to the design of SG in these target populations (De Schutter and Vanden Abeele, 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="239" pm="?"><plain>Where Should SG Be Used, and with Whom? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The experts suggested that most of the SG are more effective when the patient is accompanied by a trained caregiver (similarly, in the 2014 paper, SG were rated as more adapted for use with a family/professional caregiver, or a healthcare professional). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the general recommendations on SG usability drafted by Alvarez et al. (2012) who suggested the importance of assisting the player to improve his/her game understanding (how to play?) and motivation (why to play?). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The presence of a caregiver is considered as more important for people with dementia compared to people with MCI, due to their lower degree of autonomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The presence of a trained person is important for different reasons, including: to motivate people to use the game; to help progressing in the game scenario (in case people get stuck), reminding them about game rules and commands; to make sure the SG are played safely, especially for physical SG; and to embed the SG in a positive social and emotional context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The fact that the presence of a caregiver represents a key element in SG adoption raises potential ecological and economical barriers to the use of SG outside the research and clinical context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Possible solutions include involving a family caregiver, organizing SG group sessions, or providing remote assistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Avatars and other game assistance solutions may also be useful to promote independent SG use in people with cognitive impairment (Phan Tran et al., unpublished results). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Concerning the Where question, most of the SG are considered as useful to be delivered both at home and in clinical facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Clinical facilities have the advantage to allow a complete standardization of the training, and to provide a secure, controlled environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The main problem, however, is represented by the travel time and costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In order to improve study adherence, Ben-Sadoun et al. (2016) used a taxi to transport patients to the clinical facility, resulting in a 100% adherence to the training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>This strategy was also used by Maillot et al. (2012) for some of elderly subjects which came to the clinical facility during their Exergame training study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Although this is feasible in the context of a clinical study, it would be important, in the long term, to bring SG in the patient’s home for the classical care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>At present home-based training is still challenging due to technical issues (e.g., hardware setup, availability of an internet connection for data transfer), and to difficulties to monitor the training remotely, raising possible security problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>As technologies improve every day, well-designed feasibility studies in home-based setting are urgently needed to verify if home-based stimulation is safe and feasible, and for which patient populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This is particularly relevant because new generations of older adults will be more and more used to employ ICT at home, thus potentially reducing usability problems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="256" pm="?"><plain>How Often Should SG Be Used? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Training frequencies between two and four times a week were rated as the most adapted for people with MCI and dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Evidence collected in recent studies on both cognitive and cognitive-physical training converges with this recommendation (e.g., Anguera et al., 2013; Ben-Sadoun et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>However, these frequencies should be interpreted with caution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The frequency of use for specific SG should vary depending on a number of variables, including the presence of physical activity (and its intensity), the duration of each game session, the time that patient (and eventually the caregiver) can devote to the activity, and the motivation to play. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>To maximize the training efficacy, it is important to establish the session frequency and duration (as well as the total training duration) based on the goals that the training is willing to achieve, and on the person’s features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>For instance, if the target for a patient is to improve the general physical fitness, a short intense Exergame training is probably less adapted compared to a long training with regular sessions, in which physical activity is progressively increased based on performance improvements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>But the session duration and goals need to be adapted to the person’s baseline physical fitness level, taking into account eventual physical constraints and concurrent pathologies (for instance, the training designed for an ex-marathon runner should be radically different from the training for a smoker whose previous level of active physical activity was limited). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Another crucial aspect to take into account when designing training is the motivation aspect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>In general, the longer and more intense the training, the better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>However, ‘forcing’ employing the SG too often may result in lowered motivation, or even in addiction, as there is a fine line between motivational and addictive aspects (Smith et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the features of the training should be adapted in order to increase the patient’s motivation to play, thus optimizing the training results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Strategies to improve motivation include, for instance, the presence of a clinician motivating the person, helping to set the training pace, and modifying its frequency in a timely manner based on the patient’s changes; the design of an adaptive game challenge, that keeps the player in the ‘flow zone’ (the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment) and improve the feeling of self-efficacy; for instance, the game becomes more difficult as the player progresses, but steps back to an easier level when the player is tired or show a decline in performance; or the presence of a well-designed game reward system. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The present recommendations were gathered from a relatively small group of experts working in the domain of SG for health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In further work, it would be interesting to verify if these results hold for a wider expert population (e.g., through web-survey). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it would be interesting to collect the opinion of healthcare professionals who do not work with SG and ICT in their practice, to verify the barriers for SG adoption in the healthcare domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>For instance, if clinicians non-expert in ICT consider SG as not adapted and not useful for people with ND, they will hardly suggest their use for training purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This means that more effort should be made to share the promising results of SG in these populations among the clinical community. </plain></SENT>
