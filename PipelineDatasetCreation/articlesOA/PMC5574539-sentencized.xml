</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is mounting evidence that humans [1,2] and other animals [3,4] are capable of tasting glucose oligomers and polymers, namely, maltooligosaccharides (MOS) and maltopoly-saccharides (MPS), and that this detection is largely independent of the known sweet receptor, T1R2/T1R3 [2,5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nearly all of these prior studies, however, have used MOS/MPS stimuli with disperse saccharide profiles, and/or appreciable amounts of simple sugars (e.g., Polycose; see [1] for detailed composition). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the use of such disperse stimuli has prohibited further interpretation as to which saccharides in stimuli mixtures were consciously tasted, or the mechanisms by which the perceptible stimuli elicited the taste response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two studies so far have made an effort to understand the target MOS/MPS that are being perceived by using stimuli with considerably less disperse degree-of-polymerization (DP) profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Note that MOS and MPS are defined herein to have a DP of 3–10 and DP &gt; 10, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Behavioral work by Sclafani and colleagues [8] reported that rats preferred a MOS stimulus composed of roughly equal amounts DP 4 to 8 over maltotriose (DP 3), maltose (DP 2), and glucose (DP 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>When comparing this MOS stimulus to a MPS mixture (average DP 43), rats significantly preferred the MOS over the MPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Lapis et al. [2] reported similar trends when exploring taste perception of two mixed MOS/low-DP MPS stimuli (average DP 7 and 14) and a MPS stimulus (average DP 44) in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Specifically, subjects were able to detect the stimuli with the average DP 7 and 14, but not the average DP 44 stimulus at equimolar concentration, while oral digestion by salivary α-amylase was inhibited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These works together suggest that MOS and potentially low-DP MPS are the most probable stimuli eliciting taste perception. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Based on a number of genetic [5,7], behavioral [9,10], and human psychophysical studies [1,2], it is clear that the known sweet receptor, T1R2/T1R3, cannot fully explain the taste perception of MOS/MPS mixtures (see [2,11]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a recent study [6] suggested that maltotriose (DP 3) is detected through T1R2/T1R3 in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This result is intriguing because it has generally been assumed that mono- and disaccharides (i.e., simple sugars) are the only class of carbohydrate detected by this receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Pilot studies conducted in our laboratory suggested the same trend occurred in humans; this led us to raise the question of whether additional MOS, especially lower DP MOS, would also be detected, at least to some degree, by T1R2/T1R3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In order to explore the possibility of a T1R2/T1R3-independent mechanism underlying MOS taste perception, at least three issues should be addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>First, it is critical to further narrow down the DP ranges of target stimuli that are being tasted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Second, it is of interest to determine whether the specific DP ranges of target stimuli are detected to similar degrees and how these degrees of detection compare to that of simple sugars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Third, it is important to assess the potential role of T1R2/T1R3 in the detection of any target stimuli tested, especially low-DP MOS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These three issues are addressed in this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Due to a lack of commercially available MOS with specific, narrow DP profiles suitable for human testing, a series of food-grade MOS, having DP ranges of 3 to 7, were prepared and characterized herein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that humans can taste pairs of glucose oligomers having a DP of 3 to 7, and that their stimulatory impact is similar to that of simple sugars on an equimolar basis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the results suggest that glucose oligomers greater than 3 units stimulate a taste perception pathway independent of T1R2/T1R3. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>By applying the described food-safe fractionation protocol to MD preparations, we obtained isolated DP 3 and neighboring pairs of low-DP MOS (i.e., DP 3–4, 5–6, and 6–7). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The findings of the current study, which employs the narrowest MOS stimuli tested in humans to date, provide further psychophysical evidence that humans can taste glucose oligomers of DP 3 to 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with the previous report that tested less refined MOS preparations in humans [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Note that any potential olfactory and textural cues were carefully controlled, and hence these sensory cues were not responsible for the stimuli detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In normal tasting circumstances, introduction of glucose oligomers and polymers into the oral cavity results in hydrolysis of the α-1,4 linkages between glucose residues, principally through the action of α-amylase in saliva [22,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>To keep the saccharide profiles of the MOS preparations intact, all stimuli were prepared with acarbose, an α-amylase inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We were thus able to infer that taste detection was due to the target stimuli proposed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>When the degrees of detectability between glucose oligomers and simple sugars were compared, the d’ values were statistically insignificant from one another (see Table 2, lactisole absent condition). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with Lapis et al. [2], where a MOS preparation (average DP 7) gave a nearly equivalent dose-response function to that of glucose when the two stimuli were compared on an equimolar basis from 45 mM to 225 mM. d’ values between the three paired MOS stimuli (DP 3–4, 5–6, and 6–7) were also found to be statistically insignificant (Table 2), suggesting that each of the MOS stimuli tested had a similar stimulatory impact on the mode of perception when considered on an equimolar basis (75 mM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown as to whether isomers of linear MOS DP 3–7 (i.e., non-linear saccharides containing α-1,6 branch points) would give similar results; the taste perception of branched saccharides was not addressed herein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the subjects still could detect the paired glucose oligomer stimuli (i.e., DP 3–4, 5–6, and 6–7) in the presence of lactisole; in fact, the detectability of the paired glucose oligomer stimuli between the two lactisole conditions were statistically indifferent (p &gt; 0.05), although the presence of lactisole somewhat lowered their detection rates (see Table 2; 75~81% to 63%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This slight reduction in detectability of the paired stimuli has at least two potential explanations: 1) hT1R2/T1R3 may contribute to (but neither be necessary nor sufficient for) the detection of MOS &gt; DP 4, or 2) lactisole may interfere with the MOS detection mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, significant discrimination of DP 3 (maltotriose) was no longer observed when hT1R2/T1R3 was blocked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we conclude that the taste detection of maltotriose, but not the higher-DP glucose oligomers tested, is mediated by hT1R2/T1R3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This result supports studies using T1R2/T1R3 KO mice, where responses to maltotriose were severely impaired in the absence of either component of the receptor [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This observation is worth noticing, given that maltose and maltotriose are the final products of α-amylase hydrolysis [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Another interesting observation is that the discriminability of DP 3–4 remained similar to that of the other, higher DP MOS tested despite taste discrimination of DP 3 alone was not significant in the presence of lactisole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This outcome is surprising, given that the DP 3–4 stimulus consists of roughly 50% DP 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>There are two possibilities to explain this observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>First, it is possible that the stimulating effect of DP 4 is greater than that of the other MOS tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Second, the concentration used in this study was sufficiently high that relatively small differences in discriminability between the higher DP MOS were not achievable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Potential taste mechanisms of glucose oligomers greater than DP 3 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms separate from the T1R2/T1R3 sweet receptor have been suggested to explain taste detection of glucose oligomers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The first suggestion is based on glucose oligomer catabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Some glucosensors, namely, glucose transporters (GLUTs), the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), and the ATP-gated K+ (KATP) channel are expressed in T1R3 taste cells [26,27] of mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Importantly, α-glucosidases expressed in taste cells (e.g. maltase-glucoamylase) along with salivary α-amylase serve to break down the α-glucosidic bonds of glucose oligomers/polymers to liberate glucose for these pathways when carbohydrate-containing foods are consumed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it is reasonable to consider that this mechanism may be involved in the taste perception of glucose oligomers [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>If this were the case, we would expect to see similar responses to glucose as we would with glucose oligomers when they are discriminated against water when T1R2/T1R3 is blocked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis, however, does not appear to be fully supported by human psychophysical studies conducted here or in previous work [2]; rather, the ability to discriminate glucose-containing solutions from water is greatly diminished in the absence of normal T1R2/T1R3 function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Supporting this idea, Glendinning and colleagues reported that KATP channels are necessary for taste-mediated cephalic phase insulin release, but not for taste-mediated behavioral attraction of mice to sugars [28,29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>A second possibility to explain the conscious perception of glucose oligomers is the presence of a novel taste transduction mechanism, originally hypothesized by Nissenbaum and Sclafani [10] to exist in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>When consumed, starch is rapidly hydrolyzed to glucose oligomers/polymers of various DP and maltose [30, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>A taste perception mechanism for MOS seems plausible, given the importance of starch in mammalian diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>A mechanism that evolved to detect these types of hydrolysis products would presumably be highly beneficial to rapidly identify food sources rich in digestible carbohydrates in nature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Taste quality data were not collected for the individual MOS stimuli tested in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>However, in our previous study [2], subjects described mixtures of MOS as “starchy,” that is different from the sweet taste of natural and artificial sugars and sweeteners. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The extent to which and the mechanism by which MOS perception contributes to the overall flavor of foods and beverages remain unanswered questions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Overall, the current results support the proposed novel taste perception mechanism in humans stimulated by glucose oligomers greater than three units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The sensory mechanisms underlying all gustatory detection, including the perception of sugars and starch hydrolysis products, are not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Current data support the premise that multiple gustatory pathways are involved in carbohydrates sensing. </plain></SENT>
