</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Natural variation in nitrogen (15N/14N) and carbon (13C/12C) stable isotope ratios has provided important insights into food web structure and biogeochemical processing of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) within ecosystems [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is because the manner in which the stable isotopic composition of N (δ15N) and C (δ13C) of a consumer reflects its diet is fairly predictable [2,5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These predictable differences in the δ15N and δ13C values between a consumer and its food resources have been called ‘trophic enrichment’ or ‘discrimination factor’ and their average values are useful to infer the trophic position of an animal and sources of energy [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Several meta-analyses and reviews [2,5,7,8], however, have reported a large variation in trophic enrichment across consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This isotope variation can impose difficulties when using average enrichment values to estimate trophic position, and hence there is still an increasing need to fully understand the underlying mechanisms affecting consumer isotope enrichment [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Many feeding experiments have been conducted to estimate the sources of variation in the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers and their prey [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These studies have shown that several important physiological, life-history and environmental factors can affect the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers and their trophic enrichment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For example, several studies have shown that the isotopic composition of a consumer changes during metamorphosis because of an increase in the excretion of 15N depleted meconium and frass [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further, consumer nutritional status, such as N-poor resources or starvation, can cause an increase in δ15N and δ13C values of consumers [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Starvation is a state when animals do not eat, and therefore animal physiology and behaviour change [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>During starvation, N and C uptake is near zero, but N and C loss by excretion and respiration remains, even if at a low rate [13–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further, starvation can induce shifts in protein and carbohydrate metabolism [12], increasing the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers (see the papers in electronic supplementary material, table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These increases in δ15N values with starvation are likely due to an increased reliance on internal N resources with a large use and excretion of 14N [10,13,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similarly, increases in animal δ13C values are caused by a strong reliance on internal lipid reserves during fasting; as lipids are depleted in 13C, the bulk δ13C values of consumers become heavily enriched [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Despite recent progress on the effects of starvation on consumer isotope composition, there is still little consensus about the general trends because studies have shown increases, decreases or lack of changes in both δ15N and δ13C values during fasting [9,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Reasons for these differences are unclear, but they may be dependent on the starvation-discrimination effects of the taxonomic group or the length of starvation period considered in these studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the generality of starvation effects on δ15N and δ13C values of consumers is currently unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the results of a meta-analysis testing the generality of starvation effects on the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers across aquatic and terrestrial systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the effect of starvation on the isotope composition of consumers would be predictable based on the following underlying mechanisms: (1) Fasting time (experimental length used on the starvation experiment) influences the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Assuming that splanchnic organs represent up to 10% of all body protein [20], a 4% increase in whole organismal δ15N values will lead to an increase of only 0.4‰ in all body protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Longer fasting time increases the use of body protein to obtain energy, with a preferential use of 14N, and thus the δ15N values of the remaining body protein increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Based on this information, Martinez del Rio &amp; Wolf [21] proposed a hypothesis that predicts that the δ15N values of consumers should increase with fasting time duration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis has been supported by several empirical experiments [10,22]; however, to our knowledge, its generality has never been tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, animal body lipids depress bulk δ13C values because fatty acids have lower δ13C values than bulk δ13C values [23,24], and therefore, starvation may decrease the lipid reserves in the body of animals increasing 13C in consumers [25].(2) Turnover rates of N and C are influenced by the metabolism of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) has provided the mechanistic basis to understand the fundamental role of metabolism in the ecology of organisms to ecosystems [26–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>MTE can help predict the whole metabolic rate of an organism from its body mass and temperature [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Since metabolic rate relates to all biological processes [26], changes in metabolic rate would affect the isotope values of consumers, including isotopic incorporation and turnover rates potentially through the changes in the rates of excretion and use of body energy reserves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Increases in metabolic rate should be translated into decreases in δ15N and δ13C values of consumers.(3) Other biological/ecological traits of organisms would affect the δ15N and δ13C values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>For example, nitrogen excretion (e.g. type of nitrogenous waste or N waste), ontogenetic stage and thermoregulation could all affect isotope trophic enrichment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Types of nitrogenous waste include three chemical compounds: ammonia, urea and uric acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The nature of N wastes as part of N metabolism affects the δ15N values of excretion [7], thus differences in types of nitrogenous waste of animals would affect bulk δ15N values during starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Ontogenetic stage can affect the δ15N and δ13C values of animals; juveniles allocate energy and materials to their growth beside maintenance and storage, and this has shown to increase δ15N values and decrease δ13C values of consumers [11,29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence have shown that tissue turnover rates in mammals, birds and fishes correlate with field metabolic rates, consequently affecting the δ15N and δ13C values of animals [30,31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Thermoregulation affects metabolic processes [26], and can play a large role in the turnover of N and C in the tissue of endotherms and ectotherms, thus such differences in metabolism due to thermoregulation may influence the δ15N and δ13C values of animals during starvation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Similarly, none of our predictor variables accounted for the large variation in the δ13C values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s4a"><label>4.1.</label><title><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms underlying variation in δ15N and δ13C values of consumers </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>We found that fasting time affected the δ15N values by increasing δ15N values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>During starvation, there is a strong dependency on an internal recycling of N, and the N reserves in the body (i.e. protein) are used to get energy [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>During this process, 14N is primarily used and excreted [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Thus, the bulk δ15N values in the body of consumers become enriched in 15N [10,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Also, fasting animals conserve protein when they fast, especially if they have adequate reserves [34–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Such differences in conversion rate of protein to energy may induce the variation in the δ15N values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Martinez del Rio &amp; Wolf [21], who theoretically predicted that the δ15N values of consumers should increase with the length of fasting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The lack of significant effects of metabolism and magnitude of body mass loss on the δ15N values of consumers may indicate that the turnover rate of the N isotopes is not an important factor during starvation (but see MacAvoy et al. [30]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>This is probably because the effect of turnover rates on N isotopic discrimination was relatively smaller than that of the starvation length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that although the relationship between metabolic rate and isotope discrimination is mediated through protein metabolism, a decoupling between these processes is possible because protein catabolism is not the only source of energy during fasting [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Nitrogen excretion and thermoregulation were important factors affecting the δ15N values of consumers during starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The role of N excretion on isotopic discrimination may be due to the differences in N metabolism [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Different N waste products go through a series of steps from ammonia to urea or uric acid; these steps likely fractionate 14N and 15N at different rates [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>According to Vanderklift &amp; Ponsard [7], animals excreting urea and uric acid would show larger consumer-diet 15N enrichment than those excreting ammonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that ammonia-excreting animals have enriched 15N (compared with urea and uric acid) under starvation conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The additional series of steps after ammonia formation for the conversion and excretion of nitrogenous wastes as urea and uric acid likely explain this pattern. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>We also found that thermoregulation type was a major factor affecting δ15N values of consumers during starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Food limitation typically slows down metabolic rates and affects the costs of thermoregulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>During starvation, the thermoregulation costs, which are higher in endotherms than ectotherms, could deplete energy stores and may affect δ15N values due to changes in protein metabolism affecting isotope incorporation [27,39,40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>None of the hypothesized factors, including experiment length (5–243 days), significantly affected δ13C values of consumers; however, lipid extraction had the strongest effect on the δ13C values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Lipids in animals have lower δ13C values than bulk δ13C values and individual fatty acids have different δ13C values [23,24,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Multiple studies have shown that starvation results in an enrichment in 13C due to an increase in the amount of carbon from 13C-depleted lipids metabolized to meet energetic demands [42,43], others have shown no effects of fasting on δ13C [44,45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Our study revealed that the average bulk δ13C values treated with lipid extraction decreased after starvation rather than increasing, and thus, it may not simply result from removal of the lipids with relatively low δ13C values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with the later studies; however, most of the studies showing no effect of starvation over isotopic composition evaluated bulk responses in δ13C values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>For example, McCue et al. [46] showed that cockroach did not change significantly in response to starvation lasting up to 168 days, although the isotopic values of the excreta became significantly depleted in 13C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Gaye-Siessegger et al. [17] found enriched δ13C values in the lipid-free material of fishes after starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Different δ13C values of consumers in response to starvation due to lipid extraction treatments may be driven by differences in species compositions between extracted and non-extracted treatments, suggesting species-specific variations in lipid content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are needed to test the hypothesis of the different δ13C values of consumers treated for lipid extraction and no lipid extraction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In this meta-analysis, we tested several factors including environmental conditions and biological traits that could explain variation in stable isotope composition of consumers under starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, some other factors not tested in this study, such as water and nutrient stresses, could also contribute to the variation of the starvation effects over stable isotopes [44,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>During starvation experiments testing for isotope changes, the animals may have been exposed to water, nutrient and other stresses imposed by the experimental conditions [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of such experimental conditions on the δ15N and δ13C values of animals were not tested in these experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>We propose that further experiments need to account for the effect of these stressors on the isotope values of consumers during the starvation experiments. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Although our study showed variations in δ15N and δ13C values of consumers, which resulted from several of our predictors, including experiment length and consumer traits, we did not find straightforward mechanisms explaining the large variations in the δ13C values of consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>This lack of conclusive results may be due to the complex mechanisms underlying the starvation effects on the isotope values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In addition, the sample sizes in our meta-analysis were also limited, especially for invertebrates (nine taxa), which could have precluded us from finding conclusive trends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Thus, we encourage more studies to test the starvation-effect hypothesis, especially for invertebrate species. </plain></SENT>
