</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infections may cause various human cancers in particular of the female anogenital tract but also of the oropharynx and other epithelial sites [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HPV-associated cancer cells are addicted to the consistent expression of two HPV-encoded oncogenes referred to as E6 and E7 [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Their gene products interfere with a variety of host proteins resulting in the deregulation of the cell cycle and chromosomal instability upon expression in replicating cells [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Key oncogenic functions of these proteins are the E6-mediated degradation of the p53 protein driving the abrogation of proapoptotic pathways and the E7-mediated degradation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) causing an excess release of E2F transcription factors and activation of cell cycle progression [6–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of the viral oncogenes induces a substantial overexpression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, which has therefore been extensively used as a biological marker for “transforming HPV-infections” [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite intense research activities on the biochemistry and molecular biology of the viral oncogene products and their functions in HPV-transformed cells no targeted therapies interfering with the activity of E6 and E7 yet reached the level of broader clinical testing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence now suggests that epigenetic factors may play an important role in the activation of the HPV oncogenes [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The transcription regulating functions of the E2 protein, the key regulator of HPV early gene expression, appears to be strongly affected by the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides within the E2 binding sites (E2BSs) located in the viral upstream regulatory region (URR) [13–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, activation of the viral oncogenes and subsequent transformation of the host cells is accompanied by a substantial shift in the methylation pattern of distinct CpG dinucleotides in the viral as well as in the host cell genome [19–23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Another recently described mechanism that potentially contributes to the activation of E6 and E7 is the downregulation of miR-375 [24–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The expression of this microRNA (miRNA) was shown to be repressed by methylation of CpGs located in its promoter region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Enhanced methylation of this region could be observed in transforming HPV-infections including preneoplastic lesions as well as invasive carcinomas [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Consequently, expression of miR-375 decreases during HPV-mediated cervical transformation [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, miR-375 was shown to suppress the expression of multiple host cellular and viral oncogenic factors including the transcription factor SP1, the E6-associated protein (E6AP) and the HPV 16 and 18 oncogenes E6 and E7 [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thereby, miR-375 may contribute to the intracellular surveillance to prevent the oncogenic activity and is therefore suggested to play a tumor suppressive role especially in HPV-associated cancers [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Overall, these findings suggest that increasing CpG methylation plays an important role during HPV-mediated transformation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that treatment of HPV-transformed cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) may restore various regulatory mechanisms abrogated by hypermethylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The cytidine analog DAC is incorporated into the DNA during replication and irreversibly binds to DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) [29–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>DAC (decitabine) has been approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the U.S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, however, it also shows promising effects in the treatment of some solid cancers [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the effects of DAC treatment on the expression of the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7, as well as their target proteins including p53 and p21 in a panel of six HPV-transformed cell lines including HPV 16 and 18 positive cervical cancer cells as well as HPV 16 positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we monitored the neoplastic growth properties of the cells during DAC treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Finally, demethylation of E2BS 3 and 4 and reexpression of miR-375 were analyzed to evaluate their roles in regulating E6 and E7 expression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Alterations in DNA methylation patterns play an important role in the development and progression of HPV-mediated cancers [21, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Methylation of the viral genome was observed to progressively increase from symptom free HPV carriers to primary carcinomas [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Especially methylation of the URR was shown to be altered in high grade precancers and invasive cancers, potentially being involved in the deregulated expression of the HPV oncogenes [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Previous studies highlighted the role of the E2 protein in regulating E6 and E7 transcription and showed that elevated methylation, particularly of the proximal E2BS 3 and 4 may abrogate this regulatory mechanism by preventing E2 binding [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, during HPV-induced carcinogenesis changes in the DNA methylation pattern do not only occur in the viral, but also in the host cell genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Hypermethylation of host cell tumor suppressor genes including E-cadherin (CDH1), Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (CADM1) and Death-Associated Protein Kinase 1 (DAPK1) was reported in recent studies [39–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that the expression of host cell miRNAs can be affected by altered methylation levels in the respective miRNA promoter region, as well as by the expression of the HPV oncogenes [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Both oncoproteins also affect the DNA methylation machinery, as HPV 16 E6 upregulates DNMT1 expression by suppressing p53 and HPV 16 E7 directly binds and activates DNMT1 [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overexpression of E6 and E7 seems to contribute to the increase in viral and host genome methylation levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations application of demethylating agents would represent an attractive strategy to reverse the effects of hypermethylation potentially repressing HPV oncogene expression and inhibiting neoplastic growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The idea of using cytidine analogs like DAC as cytotoxic agents against hematopoietic malignancies was developed about 50 years ago [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>However, their demethylating potential by incorporation into the DNA and by irreversibly binding to DNMT1 was only discovered almost 15 years later [29–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In 2006, the FDA approved DAC (decitabine) for the treatment of MDS, a class of hematopoietic stem cell disorders that is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral blood cytopenia [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Despite the strong focus of research studies and clinical trials on hematological malignancies, there are also some trials investigating the effects of DAC in the treatment of solid tumors [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In these studies the response of patients to systemically administered DAC varied substantially between different types of cancers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we systematically analyzed the effects of DAC treatment on HPV oncogene expression, the levels of the cell cycle inhibitors p53 and p21 as well as on the neoplastic growth in a panel of HPV-transformed cervical and HNSCC cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>DAC treatment reduced proliferation and repressed colony formation in all tested cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Similar to previous studies, the decrease in proliferation after DAC treatment for 72 hours was only moderate in SiHa cells, however, the effect was much more significant after extending the treatment to 120 hours [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms seem to be involved in blocking the proliferation under DAC treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>First, the covalent binding of DNMT1 to DAC-substituted DNA was reported to be cytotoxic independent of DNA demethylation [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Second, global DNA demethylation was shown to affect gene expression in the cells, which seems to upregulate tumor suppressor genes and to induce differentiation [30, 52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Third, DAC treatment resulted in reduced E6 and E7 expression and increased p53 and p21 levels affecting proliferation, as HPV-transformed cells are addicted to the continuous expression of both oncogenes and as p53 and p21 inhibit cell cycle progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Decreased HPV 16 oncogene expression in CaSki and UM-SCC-47 cells after DAC treatment was also reported in previous studies [38, 50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observed reduced HPV oncogene expression in SiHa, UM-SCC-104, C4-1 and SW756 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In SiHa cells the effect of DAC treatment on the HPV 16 oncogene expression was moderate, however, decreasing E7 protein levels could be observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to previous studies that did not observe obvious changes in E6 and E7 expression in SiHa cells after DAC treatment [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In addition, we investigated potential mechanisms explaining the downregulation of E6 and E7 in response to DNA demethylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Decreased methylation of E2BSs restoring the regulatory role of the viral E2 protein might explain oncogene silencing in lesions containing viral copies with intact E2 open reading frame. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In line with this hypothesis and with the report published by Fernandez et al., we observed decreased E6 and E7 levels after DAC treatment in CaSki cells that contain tandemly integrated HPV 16 genomes with intact E2 open reading frame and highly methylated HPV 16 URR [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>However, HPV oncogene expression, proliferation and colony formation were similarly reduced in other HPV-transformed cell lines, which either show low E2BS methylation levels or disrupted E2 open reading frames [53, 54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>These observations point to additional mechanisms that may be involved in the repression of HPV oncogene expression under DAC treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Li et al. recently reported that suppression of the viral oncogenes E6 and E7 by themselves interferes with the expression and function of DNA methyltransferases, suggesting that the oncogenic function of the viral oncogenes might in part also be mediated by epigenetic regulation of important tumor suppressor genes [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Treatment of HPV-transformed cells with DAC may hence also reverse these direct epigenetic activities of the viral oncogenes independent of the effects that DAC is mediating on their expression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the reactivated expression of miR-375 under DAC treatment might be involved in targeting and subsequently degrading E6 and E7 transcripts in HPV-transformed cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Expression of miR-375 was shown to be silenced by promoter hypermethylation which is frequently observed in HPV-transformed malignancies [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The tumor suppressive role of miR-375 seems to be not only mediated by its ability to interact with E6 and E7 transcripts, but also by the targeting of host cell mRNAs preventing the expression e.g. of the transcription factor SP1 that was reported to contribute to cancer development and progression [25, 56, 57], of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E6AP which is involved in the E6-mediated degradation of p53 [24], as well as of the protein CIP2A which was shown to prevent the proteolytic degradation of MYC, a transcriptional repressor of p21 [58, 59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, miR-375 also causes the transcriptional repression and prevents the nuclear translocation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>By downregulating these factors, miR-375 might also affect proliferation and colony formation independent of degrading the HPV E6 and E7 transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, the reduction of E6 and E7 levels and the decrease in proliferation could not be directly correlated with the reactivation of miR-375 expression under DAC treatment suggesting that a combination of different mechanisms activated by DAC seem to be involved in mediating these effects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data presented here suggest that treatment of HPV-transformed cells with DAC seems to be a potent approach to repress proliferation and colony formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>To transfer this approach to the patients a systematic evaluation in clinical trials as well as the further study of affected pathways is needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>This might include the analysis of immunological pathways, as DAC treatment was reported to affect endogenous tumor antigen expression and presentation [60–62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the application of demethylating agents might represent a promising approach to treat and possibly even prevent neoplastic diseases triggered by persistent HPV infections. </plain></SENT>
