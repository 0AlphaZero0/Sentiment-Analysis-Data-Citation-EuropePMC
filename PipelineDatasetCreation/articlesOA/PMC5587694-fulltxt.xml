HSGC patients have poor prognoses due to a combination of factors including late stage at diagnosis and a high predilection for developing drug resistance. It is now accepted that the majority of HGSCs arise from the secretory cells of the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). The discovery of <italic>in situ</italic> lesions in the fallopian tube fimbriae, namely serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), supports the concept of the FTE origin of serous &#x0201c;ovarian&#x0201d; carcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The discovery of an extra-ovarian origin of ovarian cancer is a fundamental advance toward improving early detection, prevention and treatment of this lethal disease. However, the lack of relevant <italic>in vitro</italic> human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture and study early alterations has hindered the further understanding of FTE transformation as well as the initiation and progression of HGSC.</p><p id="Par3">Fallopian tube epithelium is composed of a polarized columnar epithelium including ciliated and secretory cells.

However, FTE cells in these models have a reduced proliferation rate and induced senescence because of the lack of convoluted luminal architecture and the ectopic microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Mouse models, including patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mice, have overcome some of these limitations and yielded significant insights into the basis of cancer development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the complexity of a human tumor is not reliably represented in mouse models.

Correct differentiation was monitored through the expression of cell-related markers such as <italic>PAX2, GATA3, OSR1, WT1</italic>, and <italic>OVGP1</italic> at each step. Further FTE lineage differentiation was obtained on a 3D growth platform, which enabled the FTE organoid to self-organize into a convoluted luminal structure.

</p><p id="Par7">In order to create a specific 3D iPSC-derived model of FTE and study the cell of origin effect on FTE differentiation, we used three different female human iPSC lines (87iCTR-n3, 01iMEC-n4, 14iCTR-n6) that were reprogrammed initially from B-cells (from blood), mammary epithelial cells (from mammary epithelium biopsy), and fibroblasts (from skin biopsy), respectively (<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref> Table). Each line demonstrated the molecular hallmarks of pluripotent cells, including morphology, normal karyotype, expression of alkaline phosphatase and pluripotency markers (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The ideal IM differentiation platform was first established by investigating three published protocols for directed differentiation of iPSCs into kidney progenitor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. To determine the efficiency of mesoderm induction, PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to assess expression of early mesoderm specific transcription factors <italic>MIXL1</italic> and <italic>BRACHYURY</italic>. Out of the three protocols tested, we found that 100&#x02009;ng/ml of activin A with 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of CHIR99021, a potent GSK-3b inhibitor and canonical WNT pathway agonist, rapidly and efficiently specified human iPSCs (line 87iCTR-n3) into mesoderm, which recapitulates Mae <italic>et al</italic>. (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. All three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern, though the differentiation potential varied slightly between lines (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The peak of <italic>BRACHYURY</italic> and <italic>MIXL1</italic> expression at day 2 followed by subsequent downregulation is consistent with the transient expression of these genes during gastrulation. In addition, BRACHYURY protein production showed a similar kinetic pattern during cell differentiation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">To optimize the efficiency of generating IM cells from mesoderm, we next examined the BMP signaling, which is known to regulate mesodermal cell type fate and further specification into IM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, BMP4 has been shown to regulate early ovarian follicle development and the creation of neonatal mouse uterine epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While the Mae <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> protocol uses 100&#x02009;ng/ml of BMP7 with 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of CHIR99021, results here showed that exposure to 100&#x02009;ng/ml of BMP4 with 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M of CHIR99021 provided a transient upregulation of <italic>BRACHYURY</italic> and <italic>MIXL1</italic> that is seen during gastrulation, which was not recapitulated with BMP7 treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). The combination of BMP4 and CHIR99021 also guided the optimal mesoderm differentiation into IM, which is shown by the expression levels of early IM markers <italic>PAX2</italic>, <italic>OSR1</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Once again, all three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern of differentiation based on <italic>PAX2</italic> expression, with slightly varying levels of differentiation between lines (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). Remarkably, BMP4-induced IM was more prone to differentiate towards FTE compared to BMP7, as suggested by the intermediate upregulation of markers primed for the female reproductive tract, namely <italic>WT1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). In parallel, the induction of mesoderm and IM genes was complemented by the loss of pluripotency, as reflected by a reduction of expression of pluripotency genes <italic>POU5F1, SOX2</italic> and <italic>TDGF1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Notably, a minimal amount of endoderm and ectoderm was also derived, demonstrated by low expression of <italic>SOX17</italic> (endoderm) and <italic>NCAM</italic> (ectoderm) during differentiation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3c</xref>). Collectively, these data show that this differentiation protocol with BMP4 appears to be mostly specific for mesodermal linages and yielded the highest level of mesoderm and IM differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Differentiation of Intermediate Mesoderm into Fallopian Tube Epithelia</title><p id="Par9">The canonical WNT signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the embryo during development and FTE formation. A subset of WNT gene family members including WNT3a and WNT4 are required for the initiation and elongation phases of M&#x000fc;llerian duct formation as well as for suppression of male differentiation pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To complete our FTE differentiation protocol, we defined the role of these WNT signaling in our <italic>in vitro</italic> model. Our result showed that cultures that were treated with 100&#x02009;ng/ml of WNT4 on day 4 followed by 20&#x02009;ng/ml of its downstream component Follistatin, which binds and bioneutralizes members of the TGF-beta superfamily, were more prone to differentiate into FTE (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). M&#x000fc;llerian duct differentiation was confirmed by both PCR and immunocytochemistry, which showed upregulated expression over time of the fallopian tube precursor markers <italic>WT1</italic> and <italic>OVGP1</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>). Importantly, this protocol was specific to M&#x000fc;llerian duct differentiation, demonstrated by the lack of expression of the early kidney markers <italic>SIX2</italic>, <italic>FOXD1</italic>, and <italic>PAX8</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>, black bars and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref> red channel), as well as lack of the intestinal and lung markers CDX2 and <italic>NKX2-1</italic>, respectively (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5a,b</xref>). Interestingly, WNT4 along with prolonged CHIR99021 exposure led to the expression of early mesonephric duct markers <italic>HOXB7</italic> and <italic>GATA3</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a,b</xref>). However, compared to WNT4 alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), FTE markers <italic>WT1</italic> and <italic>OVGP1</italic> did not show increased expression in WNT4/CHIR99021 treatment (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6c,d</xref>). Additionally, as with WNT4 alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), WNT4/CHIR99021 did not induce expression of kidney progenitor markers <italic>SIX2</italic> and <italic>FOXD1</italic> (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6e,f</xref>). This suggests that continued CHIR99021 during WNT4 treatment might induce other WNT signaling factors that disrupt further M&#x000fc;llerian development.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Differentiation of Intermediate Mesoderm into Fallopian Tube Epithelium Cells.

Once harvested, these buds formed spheroids, which were placed into Matrigel beads along with pro-M&#x000fc;llerian growth factors. Since optimal IM formed at day 4, spheroids were collected on days 3 to 6. Day 4 was ideal for collection of spheroids, as cells collected on day 3 were immature and grew with unstable structure in Matrigel and spheroids collected after day 6 did not persist in culture (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).

Results at 45 days showed that the FTE ciliated marker, TUBB4A, and secretory cell markers, OVGP1 and PAX8 and the epithelial cell marker, CDH1, were now expressed in the expected sub-compartments seen in mature FTE, with TUBB4A being highly expressed along the lumen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). The cellular phenotype and organization of the iPSC-derived FTE organoids were comparable to fresh human fallopian tube tissue (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).

Reprogramming to human iPSCs possesses the essential advantages of eliminating the requirement for embryonic material while allowing for the generation of pluripotent cells with known genetic factors in a patient-specific manner. Moreover, combined with 3D cell culture techniques, 3D iPSC-derived organoid models can be developed to reconstitute features of organs by mimicking more closely the complex cellular heterogeneity and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of traditional monolayer cell culture systems.</p><p id="Par17">Intermediate mesoderm generates several components of the urogenital system, including reproductive tracts and also the kidneys, the gonads, and their respective duct systems. Priming the IM into only the desired cell fate has been a challenge for the iPSC-derived organoid model. To our knowledge, all established iPSC-derived IM platforms have been developed to model the kidney formation using the combination of WNT, Nodal/Activin, and BMP signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In this study, different WNT signaling was modulated to successfully develop a novel differentiation protocol with key components to drive M&#x000fc;llerian duct and the female reproductive tract development rather than kidney. The most efficient differentiation platform to mimic embryonic fallopian tube development used CHIR99021 and activin A, along with BMP4 that was discovered to be critical for conversion of IM into female reproductive tract or M&#x000fc;llerian duct. To our knowledge, this study presents the first iPSC-derived FTE <italic>in vitro</italic> model. We have demonstrated direct differentiation of human iPSCs into fallopian tube-like precursor cells and, moreover, established iPSC-derived human fallopian tube organoids that recapitulate the complex 3D architecture of FTE tissue.</p><p id="Par18">During embryogenesis, WNT signaling pathways play a prominent role in regulating cell fate specification and in determining cell polarity and migration. WNT signaling is often correlated with cell proliferation and tissue repair after acute injury. However, recent human FTE organoid models with bi-potent FTE stem cells indicated the function of WNT3A in fallopian epithelial renewal and the regulation of stemness, suggesting the distinct role of WNT pathways in embryonic development and adult stem cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The current study found that exposure to WNT4, instead of WNT3A, and activation of the downstream effector Follistatin were vital to specify IM differentiation into M&#x000fc;llerian duct and an FTE cell fate <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, we also showed that subsequent activation of WNT3A rather than WNT4 promoted nephric duct formation, which reflects the different molecular ability of WNTs to regulate specific cell fates.</p><p id="Par19">Many fundamental cellular processes are differentially regulated between 2D and 3D cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Exposure of differentiated iPSCs to a 3D growth platform enabled them to self-organize into luminal structures that model fallopian tube structure with secretory and ciliated cell components. Critically, the exposure to primary fallopian tube epithelial conditioned media is required for maintenance of 3D FTE luminal structure and architecture, indicating that there are unknown factors responsible for the organization of cellular structure of the fallopian tube.</p><p id="Par20">In this study, we generated the basis of a platform for directed differentiation of iPSCs into fallopian tube epithelial cells, however, there is room for further improvement with regard to long-term culturing and functional maturity. Growth and successful cultivation may depend on different cell-matrix interactions and other growth factors that need to be further studied.</p><p id="Par21">iPSC-based <italic>in vitro</italic> models of cancer can help to understand pathological processes at the molecular and cellular level. In addition, they potentially provide a critical platform to study drug resistance and to develop novel therapies. Importantly for ovarian cancer, iPSC-derived fallopian tube organoids can provide a faithful human cellular model to investigate the fallopian tube origin of serous carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer and to explore early cancer pathogenesis and progression. This platform can also be used study germline mutations that affect ovarian cancer development and to identify the critical steps and the sequence of genetic alterations involved in high grade serous carcinogenesis. In summary, iPSC-derived fallopian tube epithelium provides a powerful <italic>in vitro</italic> model of ovarian cancer that can recapitulate early <italic>de novo</italic> genomic alterations, faithfully model disease progression and ultimately uncover novel treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="Par22">All human samples were obtained using the approved IRB in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations under IRB PRO00000901 (The Women&#x02019;s Cancer Program Tissue Bank) protocol number, and informed consent was acquired from all human subjects and/or their legal guardians.
