<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HSGC patients have poor prognoses due to a combination of factors including late stage at diagnosis and a high predilection for developing drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is now accepted that the majority of HGSCs arise from the secretory cells of the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The discovery of in situ lesions in the fallopian tube fimbriae, namely serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), supports the concept of the FTE origin of serous “ovarian” carcinoma2–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The discovery of an extra-ovarian origin of ovarian cancer is a fundamental advance toward improving early detection, prevention and treatment of this lethal disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of relevant in vitro human models that can recapitulate tissue-specific architecture and study early alterations has hindered the further understanding of FTE transformation as well as the initiation and progression of HGSC. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Current fallopian tube models, including ex vivo and three-dimensional (3D) spheroid models, demonstrate the importance of cell polarity in recreating secretory and ciliated cells7–9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, FTE cells in these models have a reduced proliferation rate and induced senescence because of the lack of convoluted luminal architecture and the ectopic microenvironment7–9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Mouse models, including patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mice, have overcome some of these limitations and yielded significant insights into the basis of cancer development10–14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the complexity of a human tumor is not reliably represented in mouse models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been challenging to engineer silent and expressed mutations with the correct expression timeframe as well as accurate targeting to specific tissue and cell types, such as the secretory cell of the fallopian tube. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and 3D-tissue engineering provide powerful tools to recapitulate physiologically relevant aspects of disease progression in vitro. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In order to create a specific 3D iPSC-derived model of FTE and study the cell of origin effect on FTE differentiation, we used three different female human iPSC lines (87iCTR-n3, 01iMEC-n4, 14iCTR-n6) that were reprogrammed initially from B-cells (from blood), mammary epithelial cells (from mammary epithelium biopsy), and fibroblasts (from skin biopsy), respectively (S1 Table). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Each line demonstrated the molecular hallmarks of pluripotent cells, including morphology, normal karyotype, expression of alkaline phosphatase and pluripotency markers (Supplementary Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The ideal IM differentiation platform was first established by investigating three published protocols for directed differentiation of iPSCs into kidney progenitor cells21–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To determine the efficiency of mesoderm induction, PCR and immunocytochemistry were used to assess expression of early mesoderm specific transcription factors MIXL1 and BRACHYURY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Out of the three protocols tested, we found that 100 ng/ml of activin A with 3 μM of CHIR99021, a potent GSK-3b inhibitor and canonical WNT pathway agonist, rapidly and efficiently specified human iPSCs (line 87iCTR-n3) into mesoderm, which recapitulates Mae et al. (Fig. 1c)21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>All three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern, though the differentiation potential varied slightly between lines (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The peak of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 expression at day 2 followed by subsequent downregulation is consistent with the transient expression of these genes during gastrulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition, BRACHYURY protein production showed a similar kinetic pattern during cell differentiation (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To optimize the efficiency of generating IM cells from mesoderm, we next examined the BMP signaling, which is known to regulate mesodermal cell type fate and further specification into IM24, 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Importantly, BMP4 has been shown to regulate early ovarian follicle development and the creation of neonatal mouse uterine epithelium26, 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>While the Mae et al.21 protocol uses 100 ng/ml of BMP7 with 3 μM of CHIR99021, results here showed that exposure to 100 ng/ml of BMP4 with 3 μM of CHIR99021 provided a transient upregulation of BRACHYURY and MIXL1 that is seen during gastrulation, which was not recapitulated with BMP7 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The combination of BMP4 and CHIR99021 also guided the optimal mesoderm differentiation into IM, which is shown by the expression levels of early IM markers PAX2, OSR1 and GATA3 (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Once again, all three human iPSC lines showed a similar pattern of differentiation based on PAX2 expression, with slightly varying levels of differentiation between lines (Supplementary Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, BMP4-induced IM was more prone to differentiate towards FTE compared to BMP7, as suggested by the intermediate upregulation of markers primed for the female reproductive tract, namely WT1 (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In parallel, the induction of mesoderm and IM genes was complemented by the loss of pluripotency, as reflected by a reduction of expression of pluripotency genes POU5F1, SOX2 and TDGF1 (Fig. 1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Notably, a minimal amount of endoderm and ectoderm was also derived, demonstrated by low expression of SOX17 (endoderm) and NCAM (ectoderm) during differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data show that this differentiation protocol with BMP4 appears to be mostly specific for mesodermal linages and yielded the highest level of mesoderm and IM differentiation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>A subset of WNT gene family members including WNT3a and WNT4 are required for the initiation and elongation phases of Müllerian duct formation as well as for suppression of male differentiation pathways28, 29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To complete our FTE differentiation protocol, we defined the role of these WNT signaling in our in vitro model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Our result showed that cultures that were treated with 100 ng/ml of WNT4 on day 4 followed by 20 ng/ml of its downstream component Follistatin, which binds and bioneutralizes members of the TGF-beta superfamily, were more prone to differentiate into FTE (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Müllerian duct differentiation was confirmed by both PCR and immunocytochemistry, which showed upregulated expression over time of the fallopian tube precursor markers WT1 and OVGP1 (Fig. 2b,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this protocol was specific to Müllerian duct differentiation, demonstrated by the lack of expression of the early kidney markers SIX2, FOXD1, and PAX8 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 4a, black bars and Supplementary Fig. 4b red channel), as well as lack of the intestinal and lung markers CDX2 and NKX2-1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, WNT4 along with prolonged CHIR99021 exposure led to the expression of early mesonephric duct markers HOXB7 and GATA3 (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, compared to WNT4 alone (Fig. 2b), FTE markers WT1 and OVGP1 did not show increased expression in WNT4/CHIR99021 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Additionally, as with WNT4 alone (Fig. 2d), WNT4/CHIR99021 did not induce expression of kidney progenitor markers SIX2 and FOXD1 (Supplementary Fig. 6e,f). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Since Müllerian duct development occurs in parallel to the nephric duct, we also characterized the kinetics of kidney progenitor formation using our differentiation protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>As in published protocols, treating cultures with WNT3A led to increased expression of the renal markers SIX2, FOXD1 and PAX8, promoting the formation of the nephric duct and ureteric bud (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 4a, gray bars and 4c red channel)21, 30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WNT3A treatment did not yield differentiated Müllerian duct, based on the nearly 10-fold decreased levels of WT1 and OVGP1 compared to WNT4 treatment in Fig. 2b (Fig. 2e). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Day 4 was ideal for collection of spheroids, as cells collected on day 3 were immature and grew with unstable structure in Matrigel and spheroids collected after day 6 did not persist in culture (Supplementary Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming to human iPSCs possesses the essential advantages of eliminating the requirement for embryonic material while allowing for the generation of pluripotent cells with known genetic factors in a patient-specific manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Moreover, combined with 3D cell culture techniques, 3D iPSC-derived organoid models can be developed to reconstitute features of organs by mimicking more closely the complex cellular heterogeneity and cell-cell/cell-matrix interactions, thereby overcoming many of the limitations of traditional monolayer cell culture systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Intermediate mesoderm generates several components of the urogenital system, including reproductive tracts and also the kidneys, the gonads, and their respective duct systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Priming the IM into only the desired cell fate has been a challenge for the iPSC-derived organoid model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, all established iPSC-derived IM platforms have been developed to model the kidney formation using the combination of WNT, Nodal/Activin, and BMP signaling21–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In this study, different WNT signaling was modulated to successfully develop a novel differentiation protocol with key components to drive Müllerian duct and the female reproductive tract development rather than kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The most efficient differentiation platform to mimic embryonic fallopian tube development used CHIR99021 and activin A, along with BMP4 that was discovered to be critical for conversion of IM into female reproductive tract or Müllerian duct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study presents the first iPSC-derived FTE in vitro model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated direct differentiation of human iPSCs into fallopian tube-like precursor cells and, moreover, established iPSC-derived human fallopian tube organoids that recapitulate the complex 3D architecture of FTE tissue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>During embryogenesis, WNT signaling pathways play a prominent role in regulating cell fate specification and in determining cell polarity and migration. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>However, recent human FTE organoid models with bi-potent FTE stem cells indicated the function of WNT3A in fallopian epithelial renewal and the regulation of stemness, suggesting the distinct role of WNT pathways in embryonic development and adult stem cell function33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The current study found that exposure to WNT4, instead of WNT3A, and activation of the downstream effector Follistatin were vital to specify IM differentiation into Müllerian duct and an FTE cell fate in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also showed that subsequent activation of WNT3A rather than WNT4 promoted nephric duct formation, which reflects the different molecular ability of WNTs to regulate specific cell fates. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Critically, the exposure to primary fallopian tube epithelial conditioned media is required for maintenance of 3D FTE luminal structure and architecture, indicating that there are unknown factors responsible for the organization of cellular structure of the fallopian tube. </plain></SENT>
