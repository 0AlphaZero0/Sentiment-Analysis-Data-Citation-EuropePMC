<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Arthropods are a particularly rich source of viruses, with multiple novel viruses having recently been identified through bulk RNA-sequencing approaches (so-called ‘meta-transcriptomics’)1, 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One group of arthropods that are especially relevant for human and veterinary health are ticks (Order: Ixodida). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three families of ticks are recognised – Argasidae (argasids, soft ticks), Ixodidae (ixodids, hard ticks), and Nuttalliellidae – that together comprise close to 900 species, of which approximately 700 recognised species are hard ticks4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although ixodid ticks are well known to be important vectors of human and animal bacterial and viral pathogens, such as Rickettsia spp. and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus5, 6, little is known about the viral diversity carried by ixodid ticks on a global scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Virome studies of ticks collected in Asia and North America have revealed a high diversity of RNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The novel viruses represent most recognised viral families and are likely to include previously uncategorised pathogenic human and veterinary viruses, as well as viruses that may be considered commensal1, 3, 7, 8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In Europe, Ixodid ticks, and Ixodes ricinus in particular, are known to be vectors of tick-borne encephalitis virus and Louping-ill virus9–11 that cause important diseases in mammalian populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, far less is known about the biodiversity of viruses present in ixodid ticks in the absence of an association with a specific vertebrate disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To address this question we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing on I. ricinus ticks collected predominantly in southern Norway (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>From these data were we able to recover complete meta-transcriptomes and determine the viral diversity present in these ticks.Figure 1Map of Norway showing the collection sites for all tick samples. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>We used a meta-transcriptomics approach to characterise the virome of I. ricinus ticks collected in Norway (a map of sampling sites is shown in Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, close to 1500M bp were generated for six I. ricinus RNA sequencing libraries, including 30 I. ricinus nymphs and 3 I. ricinus adults, pooled by geographical location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>After quality trimming these libraries produced after de novo assembly a total of 735,413 contigs, from which we identified 26 unique virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-sequences and, for a subset, associated structural genes (Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Fig. S1, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Overall, these data comprised nine novel and divergent tick-associated RNA viruses, taxonomically positioned within or close to members of the Bunyaviridae, Luteoviridae, Mononegavirales and Partitiviridae (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Each of the six libraries contained between 1–7 viruses (Table 1, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Table 1), with amino acid identity ranging from between 28–90% compared to the most similar viral sequences published previously (Table 1), indicating that these are indeed novel viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the majority of the viruses detected were abundant in all libraries, with relative frequencies of viral contigs (in percentage; the number of reads assembled to each virus contig in relation to the total number of reads per library) ranging from &lt;0.01–2.62%, and with mean sequencing depths (as calculated by the number of reads per nucleotide position in relation to the total length of the contig) ranging from ×7−x24,683 (Table 1, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In some cases all the genes of a specific virus could not be clearly identified, likely because high levels of sequence divergence can make it difficult to identify genes other than the relatively well conserved RdRp with a high degree of certainty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the virus genes in question were at low abundance in the libraries and/or only partial in structure which also compromised identification.Table 1Comparison of amino acid identity, contig length and mean coverage and relative frequency between the viruses identified in this study. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The most divergent new virus was found within the Bunyaviridae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Bunyaviruses are segmented negative-stranded viruses that include at least five different genera – Hantavirus, Nairovirus, Negevirus, Orthobunyavirus, and Phlebovirus – many of which include human pathogens12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recently, novel bunyaviruses have been discovered in a variety of organisms, including ticks, some of which are pathogenic13–15, such as the Heartland virus and the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was previously demonstrated that phlebo- and nairoviruses are present in I. ricinus ticks sampled in France17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We identified three novel viruses within the Bunyaviridae, denoted here as Bronnoya virus, Norway nairovirus 1 and Norway phlebovirus 1 (Fig. 2, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Bronnoya virus was the most divergent virus found in our study, exhibiting only 28% amino acid identity to the most similar published virus sequence – Hubei orthoptera virus 2 (APG79361.1) – and tentatively positioned between the Phleboviruses and Hantaviruses (Fig. 2, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Due to its high divergence compared to other bunyaviruses, we suspect that it likely represents a novel genus within Bunyaviridae, although whether it is truly tick-associated remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The other two viruses, Norway nairovirus 1 and Norway phlebovirus 1, fell within the genera Nairovirus18 and Phlebovirus19, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In particular, Norway nairovirus 1 was most closely related to South Bay virus while the closest relative of Norway phlebovirus 1 was Blacklegged tick phlebovirus 1, both of which were described in Ixodes scapularis ticks collected in North America7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>These two viruses were also the most common viruses found in the data set analysed here: Norway nairovirus 1 was present in five of the six libraries and Norway phlebovirus 1 was present in all six libraries, both of which were abundant within the tick libraries, with relative frequencies of viral contigs ranging between 0.02–0.47%, and with mean sequence depths ranging from to ×105−x8,492 (Table 1., Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Hence, the combination of these abundance data and phylogenetic history of tick associations suggests that these viruses are tick-associated and likely present in diverse geographic regions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Luteoviruses are a family of single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses commonly known to include many economically important plant pathogens20, 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>More recently, Luteo-like viruses, (i.e. related, but phylogenetically divergent compared to the currently recognised members of Luteoviridae), have been discovered in diverse invertebrates including clams, dragonflies, octopuses, ticks and spiders1, indicating that this group of viruses has a wider array of host-associations than plants alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In support of this notion we identified four novel luteo-like viruses, denoted Norway luteo-like virus 1–4, in our tick samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Of these, Norway luteo-like virus 2–3, cluster with Ixodes scapularis associated viruses, while Norway luteo-like virus 1 and 4, were most closely related to dragonfly- and clam-associated viruses from China, respectively (Fig. 2, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The abundance estimates for Norway luteo-like virus 1 (relative frequency: 2.62%; mean sequence depth: ×24,683) suggest that this is most likely a tick-associated virus (Table 1, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Norway luteo-virus 2–3 may also be tick-associated viruses as they group with I. scapularis-associated viruses in the phylogeny, with Norway luteo-virus 2 also being relatively abundant in one library (relative frequency: 0.07; mean sequence depth: ×878). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>For Norway luteo-virus 4, the association with ticks as hosts is less certain, in part because it was most closely related to clam-associated luteo-like viruses and because it was present at lower abundance (relative frequency: &lt;0.01%; mean sequence depth: ×10 and ×45 in library three and five, respectively; Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In two tick samples we identified a virus, denoted Norway mononegavirus 1, that fell in a clade comprising tick-associated viruses from China, positioned within the dimarhabdovirus supergroup22 of the family Rhabdoviridae (order Mononegavirales 23) (Fig. 2, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The rhabdoviruses are a diverse set of single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses, known to infect both animals and plants24, with frequent host-switching during their evolution history25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Although there is relatively high sequence divergence between the viruses in the clade containing Norway mononegavirus 1, implying that much of the diversity is yet unsampled, all the viruses sampled in this clade have been isolated from ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>However, compared to the nairo- and phleboviruses, the Norway mononegavirus 1 is less abundant within the libraries (Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Table 1), so that any possible association with ticks need to be interpreted carefully. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Partitiviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses mostly known to be associated with plants and fungi, some of which are pathogens26, 27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Recently, meta-transcriptomic studies have revealed more diversity in this group of viruses, greatly expanding their known host range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Notably, several lineages of the partitiviruses appear to be abundant in arthropods, and the genomes of these hosts also harbour related endogenous virus elements in host genomes; hence, both these observations suggest that partitiviruses are commonly associated with arthropods1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We identified a highly divergent partiti-like virus, Norway partiti-like virus 1, in four of our samples (Fig. 2, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Fig. 5, Suppl. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this virus formed a cluster with dragonfly- and crayfish-associated viruses, which shared a close relationship with the endogenous viral elements found in plant lice (Pachypsylla venusta). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Whether Norway partiti-like virus 1 is a truly tick-associated virus will need to be examined further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The recent development of high-throughput RNA sequencing and meta-transcriptomics provides the opportunity to capture and quantify the complete virome of an organism or environmental sample, revolutionizing studies of virus ecology and evolution1, 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of RNA sequencing is its ability to provide a unbiased snap-shot of all viruses, and other RNA transcripts, that are actively expressed in a sample28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Utilising this technique we have demonstrated the presence of highly divergent novel RNA viruses in I. ricinus ticks collected from Norway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Although none of the viruses identified here can currently be definitively associated with any host/vector-species, the fact that the library abundance and mean sequence read depth of in particular Norway nairovirus 1, Norway phlebovirus 1 and Norway luteo-like virus 1 was high, suggests that these are very likely tick-associated viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In addition, as Norway nairovirus 1 and Norway phlebovirus 1 were also present in most sequence libraries, with samples originating from relatively geographically distant localities in Norway, it is also possible that these viruses are relatively common in I. ricinus ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Clearly, however, future studies need to be undertaken to determine if these viruses are present and prevalent in other geographic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Also of note was that these viruses were found between latitude 57.98 to 63.06 north. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this study, particularly the locality of Kanestraum (at latitude 63.06), is the most northerly locality where phlebo-, nairo-, partiti-like-, and luteo-viruses have been detected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>It is evident that the currently known viral biodiversity has been systematically under-sampled and underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Clearly, meta-transcriptome sequencing enables more intricate studies aimed at understanding the fundamental patterns and processes of virus ecology and evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Although the sample size of ticks used in this study was relatively small, it was striking that so many novel viruses were identified from a geographically restricted sampling location, mainly southern Norway, matching the diversity of RNA viruses previously found in Asia and North America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Clearly, such a relative abundance of viruses suggests that we are still only scratching the surface of the biodiversity of those viruses present in ticks on a global scale, and that larger and more systematic studies of I. ricinus are needed to reveal viruses that may be pathogenic to vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
