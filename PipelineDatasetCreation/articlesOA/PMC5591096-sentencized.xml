</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Incretin hormones regulate glucose-modulated insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells.[1] The 2 incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), the peptidase enzyme soon after they secreted from intestinal cells.[2] Incretins act on G protein-coupled receptors on the pancreatic β cell membranes to stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation, protein kinase A activation, and insulin secretion.[1] The process of stimulated insulin release is rapid, and DPP-4 inhibitors prevent degradation of endogenous incretin hormones, to improve the duration of GLP-1 and GIP activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In fact, 6-month DPP-4 inhibitor treatment elevated insulin secretion and decreased postprandial glucagon-to-insulin ratio in a clinical study.[3] Additionally, DPP-4 inhibitors also involve a low risk of hypoglycemia.[4] Although safety concerns for acute pancreatitis and DPP-4 inhibitor use are controversial, a population-based case-control study showed that incretin-based therapy did not increase acute pancreatitis risk.[5] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have reported on associations between specific genetic variations and glycemic responses obtained with antidiabetic medications.[6–9] Genetic mutation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ2 was shown to affect responses to rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[6] However, DPP-4 inhibitors, to which responses by T2DM patients vary, the genetic factors are not fully understood.[10] A 52-week treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor as add-on therapy in Korean population showed that DPP-4 inhibitor responders had higher basal fasting plasma glucose, with no effect of age on their response rate.[10] This was in contrast to another study that was mainly based on Caucasian population of DPP-4 inhibitor responders characterized older age with mild fasting hyperglycemia.[11] GLP-1 receptors are involved in the DPP-4 inhibitor action mechanism, and GLP-1 responses may help predict the efficacy DPP-4 inhibitors.[12] A recent study reported that DPP-4 inhibitors could activate incretin receptors and influence the gut-to-pancreas neural axis.[2] The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors might be affected by GLP-1 receptor, in that the altered structure or affinity of GLP-1 receptor could determine the difference in responses to DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Previously, it was reported that the rs3765467 variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene (GLP1R) was associated with insulin secretory response to exogenous GLP-1 in nondiabetic subjects.[13] Therefore, we investigated whether this same variation in GLP1R could affect T2DM patients’ responses to DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we found that variation in GLP1R (rs3765426) is associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>A larger number of patients with an A allele showed a reduction in HbA1c, with DPP-4 inhibitor treatment than those without. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This genetic effect remained significant after adjustment for other confounding factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In addition, as previously reported, responders to DPP-4 inhibitors had shorter duration of diabetes, higher fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c at baseline.[10] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in this study, the proportion of DPP-4 inhibitor responders increased in relation to GLP1R genotype and higher baseline HbA1c. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>However, the association between DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy and baseline HbA1c remains controversial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>One cohort study reported that lower baseline HbA1c was linked to a good response in DPP-4 inhibitor treatment,[18] whereas others have shown that a higher baseline HbA1c could predict a greater DPP-4 inhibitor response.[10,19] In a meta-analysis that compared HbA1c changes according to baseline HbA1c value, the amount of reduction increased to 0.83%, with a baseline HbA1c of 8.5%.[19] In the current study, a greater reduction of HbA1c (1.3%) was observed in GA/AA genotype population with similar baseline HbA1c (8.2%), suggesting a role for GLP1R variation in the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Many investigators have found the concepts of genetic variation and antidiabetic medication efficacy to be quite attractive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.[6–8,20,21] Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.[22] Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported no significant association between genetic variations in DPP4 itself, and patient responses to DPP-4 inhibitors.[23] On the other hand, an association between interleukin-6 polymorphism and DPP-4 inhibitor response has been reported.[24] Recent preclinical studies have shown association between DPP-4 inhibitors and incretin receptors.[25,26] Since administration of DPP-4 inhibitor to incretin receptor knockout mice did not improve glycemic parameters, these findings suggest the importance of incretin receptor in glucoregulatory actions of DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Two possible functional mechanisms of genetic effects have been suggested:[27] (1) GLP-1 receptor enhances cAMP signaling, and (2) GLP-1 receptor alters pancreatic β cell apoptosis or proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Several papers reported that variation in GLP1R could regulate intracellular postreceptor signaling.[28–31] Moreover, GLP1R variant is reported to be able to alter receptor binding affinity.[31,32] Rs3765467 is a nonsynonymous mutation in which amino acid arginine is replaced by glutamine at Exon 5 position 131 (R131Q) of the GLP-1 receptor, and it was also reported to be linked with cAMP signaling in oxynotomodulin.[32] A recent human study showed that rs3765467 had a very profound insulinotropic effect in response to infused GLP-1 agonist.[13] Given this point, a GLP1R variation, especially rs3765467, could be a candidate for determining the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Patients with rs3765467 minor allele genotype showed a significant reduction in the plasma glucose level before adjustment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The small sample size might account for the statistical insignificance after adjustment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our study showed response rates for GA and GG/GA genotypes of 52.7% and 68.8%, which were comparable to our estimation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In addition, the statistical power reached 83%, which slightly exceeded the 80% we had predicted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, there are some limitations to our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our data suggest for the first time that GLP1R variation can affect patient response to DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Finally, since the current study was an exploratory and observation study, we could not confirm the actual or specific mechanism of GLP1R and DPP-4 inhibitor response. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study shows that DPP-4 inhibitor treatment reduces blood glucose levels during a 24-week period, and that a greater number of DPP-4 inhibitor responders carry either the GA/AA genotype or an A allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In multivariate regression analysis, both GA/AA genotype and an A allele for GLP1R were consistently associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This suggests that variation in GLP1R (rs3765467) can influence DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Further studies in a large population are warranted to determine the mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibitor response in GLP1R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it would be interesting to identify the genetic differences related to DPP-4 inhibitor response among other ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>This finding could be clinically relevant in that one could potentially anticipate DPP-4 inhibitor responses before administering thereof. </plain></SENT>
