The present research was aimed to study the effect of 2 important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs8330 and rs10929303) of UGT1A1 gene on glucuronidation status of acetaminophen in healthy volunteers (n = 109). Among enrolled volunteers, 54.13% were male (n = 59) and 45.87% were female (n = 50). The in vivo activity of UGT1A1 was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography-based analysis of glucuronidation status (ie, acetaminophen and acetaminophen glucuronide) in human volunteers after oral intake of a single dose (1000 mg) of acetaminophen. The <italic>TaqMan</italic> SNP genotyping assay was used for UGT1A1 genotyping. The wild-type genotype (C/C) was observed the most frequent one for both SNPs (rs8330 and rs10929303) and associated with fast glucuronidator phenotypes. The distribution of variant genotype (G/G) for SNP rs8330 was observed in 5% of male and 8% of the female population; however, for SNP rs10929303, the G/G genotype was found in 8% of both genders. A trimodal distribution (fast, intermediate, and slow) based on phenotypes was observed. Among the male participants, the glucuronidation phenotypes were observed as 7% slow, 37% intermediate, and 56% fast glucuronidators; however, these findings for the females were slightly different as 8%, 32%, and 60% respectively. The k-statistics revealed a compelling evidence for good concordance between phenotype and genotype with a k value of 1.00 for SNP rs8330 and 0.966 for SNP rs10929303 in our population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>acetaminophen glucuronide</kwd><kwd>APAP</kwd><kwd>bilirubin</kwd><kwd>HPLC</kwd><kwd>Pakistan</kwd><kwd>paracetamol</kwd><kwd>UGT</kwd><kwd>UGT1A1</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>July-September 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1559325817723731"><title>Introduction</title><p>The drug-metabolizing enzymes are responsible for biotransformation and final excretion of xenobiotics and drugs by increasing their hydrophilicity. Biotransformation of drugs involved the cytochrome P450-based phase I reactions (oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis) and phase II reactions. In phase II of drug metabolism, there are conjugation actions like glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), acetylation by <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (NAT), and glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferase in the liver, with numerous proteins accountable for transportation. The enzymes involved in both phases are highly polymorphic. Interindividual variability exists in the comparative extent of phase I and II enzyme activities that influence biological responses to drug and xenobiotic exposure.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>
</p><p>The UGT (EC 2.4.1.17) is a microsomal enzyme existing in almost all living beings such as bacteria, animals, plants, and humans. The UGT is responsible for the glucuronidation of several exogenous compounds and drugs from almost all therapeutic classes and endogenous bilirubin. Glucuronidation accounts for 40% to 70% of xenobiotic elimination approximately. Through glucuronidation, small lipophilic molecules got conjugated with UDP and more water-soluble molecules are formed.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The removal of a broad range of xenobiotics as a consequence of UGT-mediated conjugation explains the drug detoxifying and transformation potential of this enzyme.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>Acetaminophen (acetyl-para-aminophenol [APAP]/paracetamol) is an extensively used analgesic over-the-counter drug. The APAP biotransformation is based on its conjugation with glucuronic acid catalyzed by UGT. This conjugation reaction results in a more water-soluble APAP molecule by shifting the glucuronosyl moiety from UDP-glucuronic acid to acetaminophen. As the glucuronidation is a major metabolic pathway of APAP, the acetaminophen glucuronide is the primary drug metabolite that can be identified in the blood.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>The glucuronidation activity studied among different ethnic groups is well differentiated as a bimodal and a trimodal distribution. Based on the glucuronidation status, the individuals among a population may be categorized as fast and slow glucuronidators (bimodal model)<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or as fast, intermediate, and slow glucuronidators (trimodal model).<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> The slow glucuronidation phenotype is widespread in Yorubans (50%), Caucasians (23%), and Japanese (16%). The fraction of fast and slow glucuronidators varies among different ethnic divisions.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p><p>The superfamily UGT is divided into 4 subfamilies on account of amino acid sequence homology, named UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1, 2, 3, and 4. The isozymes of family UGT1A have the first exon that is spliced into 2 to 5 common exons and thus producing a C and N-terminal domain. The gene-specific promoter region is possessed by each member of UGT1A family.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In human, 13 isoenzymes from UGT1A gene, located on chromosome 2q37, are known to be originated as a consequence of a genetic alteration in exon 1 region; however, 6 isoforms of the UGTB2 subfamily are encoded by a rigid cluster of separate genes located on chromosome 4.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p>Both UGT1A and UGT2B genes are highly polymorphic. Polymorphisms of UGT1A1 gene are known to be associated with variation in glucuronidation status and consequently with the susceptibility of a number of diseases. Commonly, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in UGT1A1 results in a reduced expression and enzyme activity of UGT that predispose to a clinical condition known as jaundice observed in Crigler-Najjar syndrome, type 1 and type 2.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Interindividual variability in acetaminophen glucuronidation capacity is ascribed to the polymorphism of UGT1A1 gene. The polymorphism UGT1A1*28 is associated with reduced glucuronidation of bilirubin by hepatic UGTs, observed in Gilbert Syndrome and also results in altered acetaminophen metabolism.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p>Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of UGT1A1 among healthy population may endorse the emerging concept of &#x0201c;Precision Medicine&#x0201d; based on the valuable information regarding genetic polymorphism and associated individuals&#x02019; capacity of glucuronidation. In the present study, the effect of UGT1A polymorphism (rs8330 and rs10929303) was studied on glucuronidation status of acetaminophen among local healthy male and female volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section2-1559325817723731"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and written informed consent was taken from each volunteer.

The frequency histograms of APAP-Glu/APAP metabolic ratio of male and female volunteers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1559325817723731">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1559325817723731">4</xref>, respectively. The volunteers who had a metabolic ratio less than or equal to 0.3 were found to be slow glucuronidators whereas those with a metabolic ratio of &#x0003e;0.3 were intermediate glucuronidators. The fast or rapid glucuronidators phenotypes were assigned to the volunteers with a metabolic ratio of &#x02265;1.8. The cut-off points of metabolic ratios for discriminating the phenotypes were identified from probit plot as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1559325817723731">Figure 5</xref>. The probit plot provides the information regarding how closely the data points follow the fitted distribution line. The distribution of glucuronidation phenotype was found a good fit, as the points fall closely along the straight lines. For a normal distribution achieved with APAP-Glu/APAP ratio, around 8% population has been observed to have slow glucuronidation phenotype.</p><fig id="fig3-1559325817723731" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Frequency histogram of the metabolic ratio of <italic>APAP</italic>-Glu/<italic>APAP</italic> showing trimodal distribution (slow, intermediate, and fast) of healthy male volunteers (n = 59).

No authentic study has been accessed through standard databases and search engines with the focus of UGT1A1 genotypes being reported here (rs8330 and rs10929303) and their effect on the phenotypic distribution for Pakistani population.</p><p>The major aim of the research was to study the association or concordance between UGT1A1 genotype and glucuronidation phenotype. Our results showed a good association between UGT1A1 genotype for both SNPs (rs8330 and rs10929303) and capacity of acetaminophen glucuronidation in healthy volunteers.</p><p>The HPLC-based phenotypic studies for acetaminophen glucuronidation have been conducted in Hong Kong, Chinese, and Caucasian healthy population using acetaminophen as probe drug.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>
</p><p>Based on the individuals&#x02019; glucuronidation ability, accessed by plasma PAP-Glu/PAP ratio, the studied populations have presented a trimodal phenotypic distribution and the volunteers have been classified as fast, intermediate, and slow glucuronidators. The similar approach of phenotypic characterization of UGT1A1 through the ratio of morphine-glucuronide/morphine ratio, using morphine as probe drug, was reported by Holthe et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
</p><p>In the present study, a comparable distribution of slow glucuronidator phenotype was observed between healthy male (7%) and female (8%) volunteers. The phenotypic distribution of intermediate and fast glucuronidators slightly differ among male and female volunteers. The volunteers with intermediate glucuronidator phenotype were 37% among males and 32% among females. There is a slightly higher percentage of female fast glucuronidators, that is, 60% versus 56% of male volunteers. However, on the basis of urine and saliva samples from healthy volunteers, a higher glucuronidation status have been reported among male participants as compared to the females.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> These noncomparable results of glucuronidation might be associated with the relative bioavailability, excretion, and elimination of acetaminophen in blood, saliva, and urine respectively.</p><p>Moreover, the divergent research findings among populations may be attributed to the ethnic differences owing to the particular genetic make-up of different populations. Besides pharmacogenetics, the geographical basis, environmental aspects, and diet (ie, differences in protein intake) may also contribute to the ethnic diversity of acetaminophen biotransformation.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Distribution of UGT1A1 alleles (rs8330 and rs10929303) in our data shows resemblance with the Caucasian, Mexican, and Tuscan population.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1559325817723731" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>
</p><p>Conclusively, through our study, the UGT1A1 phenotypes encoded by wild-type alleles (C/C) for both SNPs (rs8330 and rs10929303) are categorized as fast glucuronidator based on their plasma acetaminophen glucuronidation status. Participants with mutant homozygous alleles for both SNPs (G/G, T/T, for rs8330 and rs10929303, respectively) were found to have slow glucuronidator phenotype.
