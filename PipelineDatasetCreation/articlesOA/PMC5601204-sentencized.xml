</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even as the new era of multiple myeloma (MM) treatment has gone beyond novel agents to include aggressive incorporation of stem cell transplant and monoclonal antibodies, early mortality (EM) remains a major clinical issue that physicians need to be able to recognize the risk for and to prevent among their patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EM in NDMM is often described within the literature as death that occurs 2 to 12 months after diagnosis.1, 2 Among patients with NDMM, EM can be influenced by patient age, comorbidities, PS, therapy, and disease biology.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors of EM in patients with MM have been investigated in several studies, including a study that used data from the IFM 2005–01 phase 3 trial to develop a prognostic index of EM.7 That study constructed a prognostic index of early MM progression‐related death within 2 years of treatment initiation based on 3 independent prognostic variables: lactate dehydrogenase levels higher than normal, International Staging System (ISS) stage III, and adverse cytogenetics (t[4;14] and/or del[17p]).7 However, that index did not allow for differential weighting of each of the 3 prognostic variables, and its applicability is limited to transplant‐eligible patients (who comprise approximately 40% of patients with NDMM) who would meet the strict eligibility criteria of clinical trials in MM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, prediction matrix models similar to those created for cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis8, 9 can be used to calculate the risk of specific outcomes, such as mortality, and allow for differential weighting for the various model‐specific risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Identifying patients with an increased risk of EM is critical for physicians to consider implementing different therapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prediction tools that analyze both biological and clinical features have also been successfully used in several hematologic malignancies to predict EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In acute myeloid leukemia, age, performance status (PS), and intensity of treatment have motivated the development of novel treatment paradigms.10 In diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma, molecular classification and positron emission tomography scans have introduced earlier decisions in the clinical treatment course to improve outcomes.11, 12 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Much of what is currently known about risk factors for EM in patients with NDMM is based on data from clinical trial populations, which often differ from unselected patient populations due to exclusion of patients who are older, have comorbidities, are in poorer health, or are often ineligible for stem cell transplant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An observational registry offers the unique opportunity to report a broad set of baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes while assessing associations between NDMM biology, patient characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment selection with outcomes and overall survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Connect MM Registry investigators sought to review the registry patient population to get a comprehensive look at the incidence and factors associated with EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The registry included patients independent of selection bias, age, therapy, PS, and comorbidities, which allowed for a cross‐sectional evaluation of patients with NDMM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Using data from a largely unselected patient population reflective of the heterogeneous patients seen in routine clinical practice, the registry investigators were able to develop a prognostic tool to assess the risk of EM that allows for differential weighting of risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the construction of an early mortality prediction matrix (EMPM) in a population that includes both elderly and non–transplant‐eligible patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Connect MM REGISTRY is a US‐based, multicenter, prospective, observational, cohort registry study designed to describe patterns of care in NDMM in clinical practice and to analyze patient outcomes in correlation with baseline characteristics and treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients were enrolled into the registry consecutively per protocol to minimize selection bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The study design and patient population have been previously described.13 Briefly, patients were eligible for enrollment within 2 months of a symptomatic MM diagnosis if aged ≥ 18 years, able to provide signed informed consent, and able to complete patient assessment questionnaires with no or minimal assistance from caregivers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Each participant enrolled in the Connect MM Registry signed an informed consent form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Study sites obtained central or local institutional review board approval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>No exclusion criteria were applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Treatment was at the discretion of each physician, and patient data were collected at baseline and quarterly thereafter using electronic case report forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Collected data were reviewed and queries issued for consistency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Patients were censored at the discontinuation date and the data cutoff date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The Connect MM Registry is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01081028). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate regression modeling was used to evaluate association of baseline characteristics with survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Variables were not preselected and represented an exhaustive set of baseline characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A series of univariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables significantly associated with mortality ≤ 180 days after enrollment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This cutoff to define EM was selected by the Connect MM Steering Committee based on survival patterns seen in previous noninterventional studies of MM and allowed for assessment of clinical care and treatment. 5, 6, 14, 15, 16 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Missing data are inherent to registries due to their noninterventional nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The Connect MM Registry allowed for diagnostic data to be collected at the discretion of the physician, which resulted in missing data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Patient referrals from one center to another may have also resulted in missing data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Variables with &lt; 60% missing data were included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Characteristics with P &lt; .15 in univariate analysis were entered in order of decreasing significance into a series of multivariate models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The best multivariate model was selected by considering whether the added variable was significant at the 0.1 level using the Wald χ2 test with 1 degree of freedom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Multiple imputations, based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method under the multivariate normal model,17 were generated for significant variables with 70% nonmissing data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The final model parameters were estimated for each imputed data set, and the results, across the imputed data sets, were combined using the Rubin method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Construction of prediction matrices was based on a logistic model for mortality ≤ 180 days after enrollment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Internal cross‐validation of the model was performed with bootstrap resampling (100 samples) from the empirical data, using the Harrell C‐index18 to determine the concordance probability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For the logistic model, the concordance probability is identical to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A prediction matrix is a summary of an estimated logistic regression that illustrates the predicted probability of the modeled outcome at constituent levels of each of the predictors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this way, the prediction matrix offers insight into the relative importance of each covariate and can be used to highlight the differential impact of predictors at different constituent levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>External validation of the logistic model was also performed using data from the phase 3 MM‐015 trial, which investigated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with melphalan, and prednisone in patients aged ≥ 65 years with NDMM.19 The EQ‐5D mobility score, which was not collected in the MM‐015 study, was estimated using Karnofsky PS (Karnofsky PS scores of ≤ 50 were mapped to the “confined to bed” mobility item, scores between 60 and 80 were mapped to “some problem walking about,” and scores of ≥ 90 were mapped to “no problem in walking about”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The resulting classification of patients from MM‐015 (0%, 55.9%, and 44.1%, respectively) was similar to that of patients with nonmissing data in the Connect MM Registry (1.0%, 56.4%, and 42.6%, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS was estimated using conversion criteria for Karnofsky PS scores recommended by the European Society for Medical Oncology.20, 21 A second external validation was conducted using data from the phase 3 FIRST (Frontline Investigation of Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone Versus Standard Thalidomide) trial (MM‐020), which investigated the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide plus low‐dose dexamethasone given until disease progression in transplant‐ineligible patients with NDMM.22 Finally, the model was validated utilizing data from a second cohort of patients with ≥ 10 months of follow‐up (n = 1492) enrolled in the Connect MM REGISTRY from December 2012 to April 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>All 7 variables identified as predictors of EM in the logistic model developed from the Connect MM Registry data were collected in the FIRST study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Both external validations used the same 7 variables identified from the Connect MM data set and were conducted using the rms package of the R statistical programming language using the methods of Harrell.18 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Before the era of novel agents, the incidence of EM was 10% to 14% in patients with NDMM.1, 5, 15, 23 Advances in myeloma treatment (i.e., therapeutic approaches and supportive care) have improved long‐term outcomes and survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>However, despite increasing awareness of its phenomenon, EM remains an area of unmet medical need and not all patients benefit from the long‐term impact of novel agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>EM was further brought to light by the impassioned management issues with newly diagnosed patients by Gonsalves et al.24 The authors defined the incidence of EM from phase 3 trials and outlined key management strategies for patients with NDMM to help mitigate EM, while also touching on the patients most at risk for EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>The EMPM described here offers clinicians the parameters to identify and treat patients with NDMM at risk for EM and the opportunity to address EM in clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of NDMM depends on staging, patient features, disease biology, and treatment outcomes.3 Current tools designed for risk stratification use the revised ISS (r‐ISS) for MM from the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG); the r‐ISS is important for long‐term prognosis but has not been used to identify patients at risk for EM.25 Because the r‐ISS is a point‐based system, it is less possible to assess the relative contribution of each element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>In addition, the r‐ISS is predominantly based on disease‐specific risk factors and does not account for patient‐specific risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="455" pm="."><plain>Similar to the r‐ISS, the frailty score is a point‐based system that combines age, functional status, and comorbidities to predict long‐term survival and feasibility of a treatment regimen in elderly patients with NDMM.26 Combining the frailty score with the r‐ISS stage improves the prognostic value of each score individually to predict long‐term survival, but neither score combined or alone has been used to identify patients at the highest risk for EM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>Prognostic studies have provided physicians with a better understanding of the relationship between aggressiveness of disease and survival in patients with NDMM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="457" pm="."><plain>However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the best methods of stratifying risk in these patients, incorporating patient‐ and disease‐specific risk factors and the relative contributions of individual risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="458" pm="."><plain>The existing point‐based systems make it difficult to accurately predict outcomes in patients who have a mixture of high‐ and standard‐risk characteristics.14, 25, 26, 27 Furthermore, the point‐based models are primarily based on data from interventional clinical trials and may not represent the general MM patient population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="459" pm="."><plain>Therefore, using data from a patient registry, we set out to create an EMPM model that allows differential weighting of the impact of individual patient‐ and disease‐specific risk factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="460" pm="."><plain>Patient comorbidities have been associated with higher mortality in various clinical trials of patients with MM.4, 16, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 For some patients with MM, comorbidities are a direct cause of death, but they also put patients at risk for early disease‐related mortality by compromising the ability to effectively give treatment.4, 28, 30, 31 Although the 6.8% incidence of EM observed in this study suggests the benefit of novel agents and improved supportive care, there are several issues to be noted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="461" pm="."><plain>Patients in our study with EM were older and in generally poorer health, with higher rates of comorbidities (including diabetes and hypertension), greater burden of disease, and high‐risk features such as ISS stage III and the presence of del(17p) cytogenetics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="462" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, the median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 25 days, indicating that this study did not likely select for a healthy population of patients with MM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="463" pm="."><plain>In our prediction matrix, lower mobility score, age &gt; 75 years, history of hypertension, lower platelet count, higher ECOG PS, high ISS disease stage, and renal insufficiency were associated with a higher likelihood of EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="464" pm="."><plain>Although identified as significant in the univariate analysis, albumin level, β2‐microglobulin level, degree of anemia, history of diabetes, hypercalcemia, IMWG risk, del(17p) mutation, and self‐care score from EQ‐5D were not found to be independently associated with EM in the multivariate analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients with EM required more radiation, which likely limited their ability to receive more aggressive therapy (≥ 2 novel therapies or triplet therapy) or potentially led to a delay in initiating systemic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="466" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that although a lower proportion of patients with EM were treated with ≥ 2 novel therapies, this was not a significant factor for EM in the multivariate analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the current analysis of patients with high‐risk disease was limited by too few patients with conventional cytogenetic and FISH data.13 However, as the data mature, a future analysis can be conducted to characterize patients with high‐risk disease who did not die within 180 days compared with patients with non–high‐risk disease who had a longer survival time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>The EMPM presented here was developed based on a test cohort of the first approximately 1500 patients enrolled in the Connect MM Registry and has been validated by bootstrap resampling for internal cross‐validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a high degree of concordance was observed when we applied 2 external validations of the model using data from patients enrolled in the phase 3 MM‐015 trial and the phase 3 FIRST trial, despite more restrictive sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria in those studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>Although external validation was one of the strengths of this study, a potential limitation was the use of well‐controlled phase 3 randomized trials and not a similar, general‐patient population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we also applied the model to a second cohort of patients who enrolled in the Connect MM Registry between December 2012 and April 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>Despite the difference in enrollment periods between the first cohort (2009–2011) and the second cohort, which enrolled during the era of novel agents and a rapidly changing treatment landscape in multiple myeloma, there was a high degree of concordance between predicted and actual probabilities of EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>Future analyses could also include additional data to distinguish between comorbidities related to frailty vs advanced disease, which could help inform management decisions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>Thus, with further validation and analyses, the myeloma EMPM has the potential to be a clinically useful tool not only for physicians to identify patients with NDMM who are at risk for EM but also for analyses of specific patient populations, selection of therapy, identification of new targets for treatment, and standardized comparisons between trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>There are several inherent limitations to using data from patient registries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>Because data collection is more passive than collection of interventional trial data, there is an increased likelihood of missing data.35 If a patient is new to a clinic, complete medical and clinical history may not be available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, data is as reported by the treating physician and it is often difficult to interpret missing data.36 To reduce data missingness and inaccuracies, we conducted comprehensive data review, including issuing queries to sites and conducting limited site monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>Registry patients are also treated in community practices where delivery and choice of care is at physician discretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Finally, although generalizability of registry data to a disease population as a whole is considered a strength, it is dependent on the source population from which the registry enrolls patients.37 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, high‐quality systematic research to identify patients at risk for EM have been limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>The EMPM is the first weight‐based model that accounts for both patient‐ and disease‐specific risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our study highlighted common causes of EM, including cardiac and infectious complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>This model can facilitate early recognition of patients with high‐risk disease and help physicians introduce personalized treatment, such as incorporation of early consultation with a cardiologist, avoidance of nephrotoxic agents, careful monitoring of steroid dosing in patients with diabetes, prompt and early initiation of doublet or triplet therapy with limited radiation fields, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>This model also supports additional studies in these subsets of patients to evaluate potential strategies to reduce the risk of EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>Other strengths of the EMPM are ease of use and the ability to rapidly implement into routine clinical practice and consider risk‐adapted approaches to disease management. </plain></SENT>
