</text></title><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thyroid carcinoma (TC), especially differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), is one of the most common malignancies in the head and neck region [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of DTC is excellent, with a 10-year survival rate greater than 91% [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This disease is more likely to occur in young women, who may be concerned about the aesthetic appearance of the scar resulting from the thyroidectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pursuit of more favorable aesthetic effects is a priority for thyroid surgeons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Since the introduction of endoscopic parathyroidectomy by Gagner in 1996 and endoscopic thyroidectomy by Hüscher CS et al. in 1997, new techniques, such as a robotic-assisted transaxillary approach, a video-assisted anterior chest approach and a transoral endoscopic approach, have been reported to improve the cosmetic results [4–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Compared with open procedures, these techniques undoubtedly have some advantages, such as faster recovery and scarless incision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, these innovative procedures present the disadvantages of increased operative time, additional endoscopic instrumentation, and new complications, including brachial plexus injury and external and internal jugular vein, carotid artery or tracheal lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these procedures cannot ensure the radical resection of thyroid carcinoma as with open access, which is the standard approach for thyroid carcinoma [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Even without the assistance of endoscopic instruments, thyroidectomy with an incision between 3 and 3.5 cm long can be performed by a professional endocrine surgeon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A recent cohort study found that incision length may not be critical in decision making for thyroid cancer surgery [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other head and neck procedures such as oral cavity surgery have shown no improvement in patient satisfaction with lip-splitting mandibulotomy approach versus trans-oral approach [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the surgical outcomes, aesthetic effects and incision length of different access procedures in patients with DTC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in surgery have focused on minimally invasive techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The concept of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was first proposed by Wickham, an English urologist [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The goal of MIS is not only to make smaller incisions but also to minimize wound complications, decrease postoperative pain and hospital stays, and attain better aesthetic outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The MIS principle has also been adopted by surgeons focusing on thyroid cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Regardless of which minimally invasive thyroidectomy approach is used, video-assisted techniques and the development of extracervical surgical approaches aim to reduce scarring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Miccoli et al. compared scar satisfaction from video-assisted thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy and conventional techniques using a non-validated verbal response scale to assess overall patient satisfaction 1 month after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Bellantone also asked patients to rate their overall satisfaction with their scar at 3 and 6 months after surgery and compared the results for video-assisted and conventional thyroidectomies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The results of these two studies showed that smaller neck incisions improved patient satisfaction with scar cosmesis [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>However, long-term assessment methods were used in other studies, and no significant differences in patient satisfaction were noted between incisions from minimally invasive techniques and those from conventional surgery [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The study by Toll EC et al. demonstrated no association between absolute scar length or relative scar length ratio and patient satisfaction at 2–24 months after the conventional approach thyroidectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>There was also no association found between absolute or relative scar length and satisfaction in female patients [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In our study, the follow-up time was more than one year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Although MIA was performed to improve postoperative scars, it led to the worst aesthetic effects as a result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The relationship between scar length and patient satisfaction does not appear to be as certain as previously thought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Wound healing studies have demonstrated that scars usually develop after 6–8 weeks following re-epithelization, and a period of 6–18 months is required for scar maturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Healing and remodeling are largely completed by 8–12 months; and scars might be delayed until 1 year for evaluation [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the observation time is critical to drawing an appropriate conclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>There are many factors potentially influencing patient satisfaction with scar cosmesis instead of the length of the incision, such as the degree of hypertrophy, keloid formation, pigmentation, and discomfort experienced by patients [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Mow et al. showed that the cosmesis of mini-incision total hip replacement scars was inferior to that of standard-incision scars because skin and soft tissue damage were produced by the high retractor pressures, which were needed for exposure using a limited skin incision [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>When a minimally invasive approach was used, the use of retractors for a longer time to increase exposure was inevitable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Thus, the edges of the wound might be traumatized from the stretching of the surgical wound to remove a gland or perform central lymph node dissection (CLND). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>These injuries could inevitably affect the aesthetic level of wound healing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In addition to improvement of incision appearance, decreasing postoperative complications was another principle of the MIS approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The first credible records of thyroid surgery appeared in the School of Salerno in the thirteenth century, although the techniques consisted simply of the use of cottons and hot irons for hemostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The technique of capsular dissection made the conventional access thyroidectomy practical and relatively safe [22–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In our study, CA was deemed a reliable method and showed very low postoperative complications, with only one case with bleeding, who required a second hemostasis and one case of temporary asymptomatic hypocalcemia, who was self-healed 5 days after the operation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>There was one case of permanent RLN palsy in the MIA group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>However, RLN did not occur in the CA group or the APA group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This adverse event might have been caused by the excessively short incision, which led to a poor surgical field and increased risk of damage to important structures, such as the parathyroid glands and RLN, at the cost of a longer operation time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, our current study had some limitations, such as small sample size, all patients from a single-center study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Thus, a large-scale, prospective, multicenter clinical study should be conducted to validate these findings. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Minimally invasive access thyroidectomy demonstrated the highest rate of postoperative complications and the worst aesthetic results, although it has the advantages of less intraoperative blood loss and a reduced scar length. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Head and neck surgeons should pay closer attention to aesthetic principles in thyroidectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Indeed, unnecessarily small incisions may cause unsatisfactory results; therefore, thyroid surgery need not be performed through excessively short incisions for the sake of patient satisfaction with the scar’s appearance. </plain></SENT>
