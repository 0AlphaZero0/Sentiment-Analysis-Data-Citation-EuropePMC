We investigated vosaroxin with decitabine in patients &#x02265;60 years of age with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n=58) or myelodysplastic syndrome (&#x02265;10% blasts) (n=7) in a phase II non-randomized trial. The initial 22 patients received vosaroxin 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 4 with decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1&#x02013;5 every 4&#x02013;6 weeks for up to seven cycles. Due to a high incidence of mucositis the subsequent 43 patients were given vosaroxin 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 and 4. These 65 patients, with a median age of 69 years (range, 60&#x02013;78), some of whom with secondary leukemia (22%), adverse karyotype (35%), or <italic>TP53</italic> mutation (20%), are evaluable. The overall response rate was 74% including complete remission in 31 (48%), complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery in 11 (17%), and complete remission with incomplete count recovery in six (9%). The median number of cycles to response was one (range, 1&#x02013;4). Grade 3/4 mucositis was noted in 17% of all patients. The 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> induction dose of vosaroxin was associated with similar rates of overall response (74% <italic>versus</italic> 73%) and complete remission (51% <italic>versus</italic> 41%, <italic>P</italic>=0.44), reduced incidence of mucositis (30% <italic>versus</italic> 59%, <italic>P</italic>=0.02), reduced 8-week mortality (9% <italic>versus</italic> 23%; <italic>P</italic>=0.14), and improved median overall survival (14.6 months <italic>versus</italic> 5.5 months, <italic>P</italic>=0.007). Minimal residual disease-negative status by multiparametric flow-cytometry at response (&#x000b1; 3 months) was achieved in 21 of 39 (54%) evaluable responders and was associated with better median overall survival (34.0 months <italic>versus</italic> 8.3 months, <italic>P</italic>=0.023). In conclusion, the combination of vosaroxin with decitabine is effective and well tolerated at a dose of 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and warrants randomized prospective evaluation. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01893320</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States of America (USA) and Europe are aged 65 years or older.<sup><xref rid="b1-1021709" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-1021709" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These older patients do not fare as well with intensive induction therapy, having complete remission (CR) rates &#x0003c;50%, a median survival of 4&#x02013;9 months, and increased induction mortality (15&#x02013;30%).<sup><xref rid="b4-1021709" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-1021709" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Hypomethylating agents (decitabine and azacytidine) are commonly used in the treatment of less fit, older patients with AML in the USA and Europe.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021709" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The pivotal DACO-016 study demonstrated a superior CR/CR without platelet recovery (CRp) rate with decitabine <italic>versus</italic> investigators&#x02019; choice of treatment (including low-dose cytarabine or best supportive care) in 485 older patients with AML (median age 73 years) who were ineligible for cytotoxic chemotherapy (17.8% <italic>versus</italic> 7.8%, <italic>P</italic>=0.001)<sup><xref rid="b7-1021709" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and improved survival with decitabine, leading to the approval of decitabine for the treatment of AML in the elderly in Europe.<sup><xref rid="b7-1021709" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021709" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Vosaroxin is a non-anthracycline anticancer quinolone-derivative that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, causing site-selective DNA breaks, G2 arrest, and apoptosis.<sup><xref rid="b9-1021709" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Vosaroxin is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and can induce apoptosis independently of <italic>P53</italic> function.<sup><xref rid="b9-1021709" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-1021709" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In a phase II dose regimen optimization study in patients with previously untreated, unfavorable prognosis AML &#x02265;60 years of age, single-agent vosaroxin resulted in a CR/CRp rate of 32%, a 30-day mortality of 12%, and a median survival of 7.0 months.<sup><xref rid="b12-1021709" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The 72 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 and 4 and 90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and 4 schedules of single-agent vosaroxin were well tolerated with the highest CR/CRp rates.

Patients treated with the 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> regimen had a median survival of 14.6 months and 51% were alive at 1 year.
