</text></title><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Predator-prey interactions are among the most fundamental processes in ecology and constitute the fabric of community structure and ecosystem function [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the role of those interactions in evolution, and their impacts on biodiversity, are less well understood in marine systems [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The most widely accepted hypothesis to explain the origin of biological diversity traces its origins to Mayr [5, 6], who proposed that the ranges of organisms are fragmented by the formation of physical barriers, resulting in isolation and divergence in allopatry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, in the marine realm, where barriers to genetic exchange are less obvious than in terrestrial or freshwater systems [7], non-allopatric divergence and speciation may play a fundamental role in the generation of biodiversity (e.g., [8, 9]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In this context, shifts between major prey types (e.g., different cnidarian classes) could constitute important factors explaining the biodiversity of marine taxa, particularly in groups with highly specialized diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The greatest obstacle to testing these ideas is the lack of well-supported phylogenies for groups of specialized consumers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generate RNA-Seq data to test the role of prey preference shifting in the evolution of Cladobranchia (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Hererobranchia: Nudibranchia), a group of marine invertebrates with at least 1000 species [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cladobranch sea slugs occupy various marine environments, from coastal reefs, where diversity is highest, to the deep sea, as well as highly specialized pelagic and neustonic niches [11–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Species of Cladobranchia are exclusively carnivorous, and exhibit diverse dietary specializations, preying on a variety of animal taxa, including bryozoans and crustaceans, eggs of fishes and molluscs, and cnidarians (Fig. 1) [15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the vast majority of cladobranchs prey on species of the two most diverse clades within Cnidaria, Anthozoa (e.g., anemones, stony corals, and octocorals) and Hydrozoa (hydroids, siphonophores, and hydromedusae) [15, 18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This preference for cnidarian prey is hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of the ability to sequester cnidarian nematocysts in Cladobranchia [21], which is believed to have evolved only once within this group [16].Fig. 1Select photographs of cladobranch taxa on their food source, including: (a) Dondice parguerensis on the scyphozoan jellyfish Cassiopea sp., (b) Doto chica on the hydroid Eudendrium sp.; (c) Tritonia hamnerorum on the octocoral Gorgonia ventalina; and (d) Favorinus tsuruganus on an opisthobranch egg mass (Photo credits: Ángel Valdés) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Based on recent classifications, two of the three main groups in Cladobranchia (Aeolidida and Dendronotida [22]; the third being Arminida, as defined in [23]) contain taxa that prey on animals distributed across the list given above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These classifications suggest that shifts in prey type preference are relatively common throughout Cladobranchia over evolutionary timescales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>There also exist many well-documented cases where cladobranch species are tightly associated with specific prey types or species (e.g., [24–29]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In many of these cases the prey species might even be considered a host as defined by Coyne &amp; Orr [93], due to similarities that many sea slugs share with herbivorous insects, including their small size relative to their hosts and the use of hosts for both food and shelter [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Two main hypotheses have emerged regarding the roles that dietary specialization and prey shifts have played in the evolution of heterobranch sea slugs (formerly called opisthobranchs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The first of these hypotheses suggests that increased speciation occurs due to species-specific prey switching in groups where specialization is prevalent [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This leads to clades consisting of many taxa that specialize on individual prey species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In many metazoan groups studied, mainly involving terrestrial symbiotic and parasitic systems [31–33], host shifting (shifting between prey species) has been implicated as a driver of diversification, with colonization of new hosts often leading to bursts of cladogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Speciation of taxa by host or prey shifting may also be important in a handful of specialized marine consumers such as some bivalves [34], amphipods [35], barnacles [36], gobies [37], and gastropods [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We do not assess this hypothesis here, as it requires broad taxon sampling across Cladobranchia and solid evidence of dietary specialization, both of which are lacking in many cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The second hypothesis relating to dietary specialization is that major radiations within heterobranch sea slugs may be related to the evolution of particular morphological structures necessary for feeding on different types of prey [16, 17, 38], such as the distinct radular morphology present in members of Aeolidida. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis suggests that shifting to new prey items leads to an increase in niche availability, similar to the effect of habitat preference shifts in some groups [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is broader than the first, in that it refers to switches between prey types at higher levels of organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The consequences of this type of switching relate to species that, following a switch, are able to prey on multiple taxa within a general prey type, rather than explicitly focusing on those that specialize on certain prey species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This pattern has been found in only a few taxa [34, 40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Diversification in this context relates more to the expansion of possible prey types rather than specialization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Given the variety of prey type preferences exhibited by its members, Cladobranchia constitutes an excellent system to explore the relationship between prey shifting and cladogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Until now, it has not been possible to test how prey choice has evolved through the history of this group, because existing cladobranch phylogenies are notoriously poorly resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Support for Cladobranchia as a monophyletic group is high [23, 42, 43], but the relationships among major lineages within Cladobranchia have long been problematic [22, 23, 42, 44–47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>However, a recent phylogenomic study provided evidence that these lineages could be resolved with RNA-Seq data [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In addition to the growing availability of RNA-Seq data for this group, the prey preferences of the majority of species within this group have been published (e.g., [15, 16, 18–20, 48]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To address the role of dietary specialization and host shifts in the evolution of this group and resolve outstanding systematics issues, we reconstruct the phylogeny of Cladobranchia using RNA-Seq data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In this study, we increase the taxon sampling compared to previous phylogenomic work on Cladobranchia [43] by incorporating additional diversity from both previously sampled clades (Aeolidida and Dendronotida) and the previously unsampled Arminida (as defined in [23], though we only include members of Arminidae). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>In addition, we seek to address patterns of prey type switching among and within the major lineages of cladobranchs by assessing prey type preference for each taxon included in the phylogenetic analyses, and using these data to reconstruct the most likely ancestral prey type preference for each node in the tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These analyses provide the means to examine the prevalence of prey type switching within Cladobranchia in order to provide a framework for studying how dietary preferences may have affected evolution within this group. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which the evolution of prey preference is constrained is unknown, but it could result from relative difficulty in evolving specific traits for protection against nematocysts (or other defenses) from various cnidarian prey groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Although it is possible for some species (e.g., Phidiana hiltoni) to prey upon different cnidarian species [74], there are few examples of cladobranchs preying on multiple, taxonomically distant cnidarians (only H. crassicornis in this study). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>These secretions appear to be specific to the prey species in one studied case [76], and may be why switching between types of prey is much more challenging and occurs much less frequently than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Species of Cladobranchia that do not prey on cnidarians, such as Favorinus, can easily switch between egg masses of distantly related gastropods, including aplysiids, sacoglossans, and other nudibranchs [48], lending support to this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Previous work has suggested that dietary specialization on particular prey types was crucial in the evolution of Euthyneura [16, 17, 77], and has been proposed as a “driving force” in heterobranch sea slug evolution [38, 78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Dietary specialization has also been considered a contributing factor in the species richness of Nudibranchia as a whole [17], and especially cladobranchs [16, 18] in conjunction with the evolution of nematocyst sequestration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is entirely plausible when looking at the numbers of species in prey groups and how those correlate with species diversity in the cladobranch predators. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>This drastic difference is primarily due to Aeolidida, which contains a large proportion of the taxa that prey on Hydrozoa, and which appears to have diversified primarily while preying on hydrozoans. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that the diversity of larger clades within Cladobranchia is related to the frequency of major prey type shifts is not supported by these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Instead, we suspect that if shifts in diversification associated with diet in Cladobranchia are going to be found, these may occur within groups that prefer a major prey type (e.g., at the family or genus level), where more species-specific prey shifting is likely to occur [16, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The literature indicates that in groups where taxa are specialized on particular prey species, shifting to a new prey (or host) species often leads to speciation and diversification [82–84]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This pattern is found in many metazoan taxa, including flies [85], amphipods [35, 86, 87], alpheid shrimp [88, 89], barnacles [36], whelks [90], gobies [37], and sacoglossan gastropods [91, 92], and has been extensively investigated in phytophagous insects (reviewed in [93]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Within Nudibranchia, a large subset of taxa exhibit specialization on a single species, with many others preferring only two or three prey species [94]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>We suspect that in the case of Cladobranchia, this specialization and prey shifting at the species level may be the primary impact that prey preference has on the diversification rate across lineages, rather than shifts to new prey types, as is true in many herbivorous insect lineages (reviewed in [93]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Tests of this hypothesis require a broader sampling of members of Cladobranchia for both the phylogenetic inference and species-specific prey preference data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Arminida, when first described, comprised the genera Janolus and Dirona, among other taxa, including Arminidae [96]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of Janolus and Dirona within Arminida renders this group paraphyletic in both morphological and molecular analyses [22, 97], and they, along with others (Charcotiidae and Pinufiidae), have since been removed from Arminida and are considered unassigned members of Cladobranchia [22]. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>There is strong support for Arminidae (one of two families within Arminida) as the sister group to Tritoniidae, which is a novel result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This result is in agreement with only one previous phylogenetic hypothesis, which was generated using 18S rDNA data [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In all other previous studies, taxa from Arminida had been either unplaced within the Cladobranchia phylogeny [46, 95, 98] or supported as sister to various other combinations of taxa from Dendronotida and Aeolidida [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The position of Tritoniidae in the previous phylogenomics study of Cladobranchia was uncertain [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>It appears that prey preference is particularly relevant for the evolution of Tritoniidae + Arminidae as species within this group prey exclusively on Octocorallia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Species within Octocorallia are known for their noxious chemical defenses in addition to the nematocysts present in their tissues [99, 100], and these defenses could help explain why a switch to octocorals has occurred rarely within Cladobranchia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Both of the taxa from Arminida included within the present analyses (Armina and Dermatobranchus) are members of the family Arminidae; thus, the monophyly of Arminida (containing Arminidae and Doridomorphidae) as a whole has not yet been rigorously tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>That said, the un-sampled family within Arminida, Doridomorphidae, is monotypic and its sole species lives on the blue coral Heliopora coerulea, an octocoral with a massive calcium carbonate skeleton [14, 101]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>However, until a member of the genus Facelina (the type genus for this family) is included in the analyses (ideally the type taxon Facelina auriculata), it is impossible to say which clade should receive the Facelinidae designation. </plain></SENT>
