</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as its reversal, a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), reflect two gradual, well-controlled processes during embryogenesis and wound healing in adults to promote tissue and organ formation and homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both processes induce a global reorganization of a cell’s constitution and allow switching back and forth between two different cell phenotypes to endow the necessity of tissue plasticity1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the context of malignant tumour progression, epithelial tumour cells can undergo an EMT upon diverse extracellular stimuli and consequently gain metastatic capabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among many growth factors and environmental cues, such as tissue hypoxia, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) strongly activates the dedifferentiation process in epithelial tumour cells and, thus, induces global changes in a cell’s transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks2–4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This allows tumour cells to disseminate from the primary tumour and to intravasate and survive in the blood circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At the distant organ, cells extravasate into the organ parenchyma and eventually grow out as lethal metastases, possibly promoted by a MET5–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>An EMT also provides cells with increased chemoresistance, thus impeding efficient therapy of malignant mesenchymal cancer cells9, 10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of ~22 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by either inducing target messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or preventing mRNA translation11–13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the context of an EMT, miRNA-200 family members (miR-200a/b/c, miR-141 and miR-429) take a central stage: they are required to maintain an epithelial cell morphology by degrading the transcripts of the EMT-inducing transcription factors (TFs) Zeb1 and Zeb214–17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Members of the miR-200 family bind to specific seed sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of Zeb1 and 2 mRNAs and destabilize them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>During an EMT, members of the miR-200 family are downregulated in their expression, which results in the increased expression of Zeb1 and 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Zeb1 and Zeb2 directly suppress the transcription of miR-200 family members14–17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Such a double-negative feedback loop is a major example for a reciprocal TF-miRNA regulation during an EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Similar other molecular switches also regulate EMT/MET plasticity and malignant tumour progression18–22. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the identification of miR-1199-5p, as a repressor of EMT, tumour cell invasion and metastasis, which comparable to miR-200 family members targets Zeb1 mRNA for degradation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Finally, we report that during an EMT, this exonic miRNA is mechanistically embedded in a reciprocal, direct negative feedback loop with the TF Zeb1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The double-negative feedback loop with Zeb1 during an EMT is reminiscent of the miR-200 family members14–16, 18, 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Indeed, consistent with previous reports, the miR-200 family members miR-200b-3p and miR-429-3p have been identified by our EMT screen as critical mediators of an epithelial cell phenotype14–17. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>While the gain of function approaches of miR-1199-5p and miRNA family members has clearly repressed an EMT, we have repeatedly failed to demonstrate an effect of loss function approaches on EMT by interfering with miR-1199-5p and also with miR-200 family member activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, transient transfection of a miR-1199-5p sponge construct or a miR-1199-5p inhibitor did not lead to a loss of miR-1199-5p function in epithelial NMuMG/E9 cells, as determined by 3′ UTR reporter assays, yet was not sufficient to increase Zeb1 expression or to induce an EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Of note, sponge constructs or miRNA inhibitors against miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p also did not alter Zeb1 expression or the induction of an EMT (Supplementary Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>From these data, we conclude that the regulation of Zeb1 expression on the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level is complex and we suppose that the loss of one Zeb1 regulator (miR-1199-5p or miR-200b/c-3p) is not sufficient to increase Zeb1 levels and to jumpstart an EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The overlapping double-negative feedback loops between miRNAs and TFs may act as a ‘buffered system’ to compensate for the loss of one regulator and thus ensure a system’s functionality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Our genome-wide analyses of the three miRNAs revealed a large number of regulated genes, which underscores their critical functions during an EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>However, only six genes were identified as common direct targets of the three miRNAs, including Zeb1, Col5a1, Zfp9, Sox12, Cdon and Ncs1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The latter five are so far ‘unknowns’ in the context of an EMT and malignant tumour progression, most of which might be of interest considering their potential function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>For instance, Sox12, together with Sox11 and Sox4, is a member of the SoxC TF family, of which Sox4 has an established role in EMT and breast cancer progression27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The cell surface receptor encoded by Cdon, similar to the EMT inducer neuronal cell adhesion molecule, consists of immunoglobin/fibronectin type III domains known to mediate cell signalling38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Finally, collagen type V alpha 1 (Col5a1) is mainly found in organ tissue together with collagen type I, a major ECM component of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report the identification and characterization of miR-1199-5p as a miRNA acting in a negative reciprocal regulation with Zeb1 during an EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Our findings add this negative feedback loop to other known reciprocal regulations between a miRNA and a key EMT TF18, 20–22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>These regulatory units may work as functional epithelial/mesenchymal switches supporting the reversibility, robustness and effectiveness of EMT/MET, endowing cells with a high degree of cell plasticity necessary for embryonic development as well as for malignant tumour progression. </plain></SENT>
