</text></title><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic resistance is a major challenge for the twenty-first century [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A large number of bacteria resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics has emerged worldwide, making treatment difficult [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Multidrug antibiotic resistance (MDR) is a highly attractive model to study the evolution of gene function since hypermutation, complex interrelationships between drug resistance and fitness, compensatory evolution, and epistasis affect how resistance evolves and spread [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Although different mechanisms influence the emergence of a MDR phenotype, high-level intrinsic MDR, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, stems from the combined action of efflux pumps and adaptive modifications of the cell envelope [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The structural components of MDR efflux pumps (MDR EP), usually chromosomally encoded, are evolutionarily conserved within species [reviewed in [3]]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Indeed, MDR EP are ancient elements in bacterial genomes, suggesting that their functions predate the resistance to antibiotics during the treatment of human infections [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Bacterial genomes often contain multiple copies of different MDR EP classes, which have arisen by gene duplications [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The importance of gene duplication in driving expansion and diversification of drug-resistance mechanisms and its role as an adaptive response to antibiotic treatment are well-known [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In general, extra gene copies after duplication events are redundant and free from selection pressure, as they do not add anything to the organism’s capacity to perform the original (duplicated) function [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The fate of paralogous copies is strongly debated and no single model can include all the possible alternative scenarios [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Duplicated genes rarely exhibit de novo functions (neofunctionalization); more commonly, the functions of the original gene(s) are split into multiple functions among the duplicate genes (subfunctionalization) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The split into subfunctions among the different paralogs may occur when the functions of the original gene(s), which were previously under unified genetic control, acquire their own independent regulation [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Among MDR efflux pumps, the Resistance-Nodulation-Cell Division (RND) superfamily is particularly intriguing [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Members of this superfamily of proton/drug antiporters located in the inner membrane have several roles including bacterial virulence, quorum sensing, plant–bacteria interactions, and detoxification of metabolic intermediates and toxic compounds, such as heavy metals, solvents, or antimicrobials [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The regulation of RNDs depends on global and/or local regulators, resulting in a multilayered control of gene expression in response to specific stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The high efficiency of RNDs in extruding substrates is due to their associations with outer membrane channel (OMP) and periplasmic membrane fusion (MFP) proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These tripartite complexes extrude molecules to the extracellular milieu preventing their accumulation in the periplasmic space [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The genes encoding the three protein components (RND, OMP, and MFP) are often organized in an operon and several different RND operons may be embedded in the same genome [3, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These efflux pumps have been mostly studied in Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Recently, attention has also been focused on RND systems of other pathogenic bacteria, such as Burkholderia species [18], and more specifically, the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Bcc bacteria have been extensively investigated concerning their genome organization and the presence of several copies of MDR systems, especially the RND superfamily [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although rampant gene duplication played a key role in shaping this gene family, the tempo and mode of this process remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The genome of the model strain B. cenocepacia J2315 harbors several genes encoding RND proteins of different families [18, 20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Two RND copies (RND 2 and 4) have been the focus of our attention since they provide a model to investigate the evolution of paralogs that are functionally distinct but with a high degree of sequence similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have shown that the RND 2 coding gene is present only in some Bcc species, and a phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of RND 2 and RND 4 proteins cluster together [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Despite this high degree of sequence similarity, only the RND 4 protein plays a key role in the antibiotic resistance of B. cenocepacia J2315, since a deletion of the entire RND 4 operon reduces the intrinsic MDR antibiotic resistance of the mutant strain [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Further, RND 4 appeared to be particularly important for antibiotic resistance of planktonic bacteria, but less relevant for resistance in biofilm bacteria [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>RND 4 also contributes to resistance to the biocide chlorhexidine [26] and the 2-thiopyridine anti-tubercular derivative, which is also effective against B. cenocepacia [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This pump is also associated with the modulation of some virulence factors (motility, biofilm formation, chemotaxis and quorum sensing) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>A proteomic analysis comparing the parental strain and the deletion mutant suggests a more general role for RND 4 in the physiology of B. cenocepacia cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the Burkholderia RND 2 protein is not expressed during growth on LB medium, and its role in antibiotic resistance can only be revealed when overexpressed in E. coli [29] . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In this study, we provide computational and experimental evidence supporting an evolutionary model on the functional diversification of these two RND superfamily members in Burkholderia spp., providing a framework to understand how these events could modulate antibiotic resistance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>It consists of three genes organized in the following order: BCAS0766 (QU43_RS72495, 1239 bp), BCAS0765 (QU43_RS72490, 3192 bp), and BCAS0764 (QU43_RS72485, 1503 bp), encoding the MFP, RND permease, and OMP proteins, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A LysR family transcriptional regulator (BCAS0767; QU43_RS72500, 881 bp) is located upstream of BCAS0766 and oriented in the same direction (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Another gene, encoding an AraC family transcriptional regulator (BCAS0768; QU43_RS72510, 983 bp) is present upstream of the LysR regulator coding gene, but oriented in the opposite direction (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The RND 4 operon is located on chromosome 1 and spans three genes: BCAL2822 (QU43_RS50725, 1275 bp), BCAL2821 (QU43_RS50720, 3201 bp), and BCAL2820 (QU43_RS50715, 1524 bp) encoding the MFP, RND permease, and OMP proteins, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Thus, the RND 2 and RND 4 operons share identical gene organization. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The degree of identity/similarity between the two operons is 92%, 87%, 95% of identity at the nucleotide level, with 90%, 85%, 96% identity and 93%, 91%, 96% similarity at the amino acid level when comparing the MFP, RND and OMP genes and proteins, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The degree of DNA and amino acid sequence identity/similarity between the genes/proteins of the two operons (Fig. 1a) and the identical gene order strongly suggests these operons arose from a recent operon duplication event. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>A comparative genome analysis was performed on 797 Burkholderia genomes to evaluate the presence, distribution and conservation of RND 2 and RND 4 operons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>RND 2 and 4 coding genes were found in 47 and 689 of the genomes analysed, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Then the presence of the other two genes (mfp and omp) forming the operons was evaluated: the intact RND 2 operon occurred in 33 genomes, while the intact RND 4 operon was present in 472 (Additional file 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The lack of the RND genes (or of the entire operons) in some strains could be due to the poor quality of the corresponding assemblies (draft genomes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In these genomes, operon fragments were found in contig boundaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Therefore, incomplete operons were excluded from the downstream analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>To assess the role of the two RND operons in antibiotic resistance and whether the RND 2 operon can functionally substitute RND 4, the B. cenocepacia J2315 RND 2 and RND 4 operons and their own promoter regions were cloned and inserted into pSCrhaB2 [30], giving rise to two recombinant plasmids (pEP_RND2_operon and pEP_RND4_operon, respectively) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>These plasmids were introduced in the parental J2315 strain and in a deletion mutant lacking the RND 4 operon (strain D4, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The antibiotic resistance profile of these strains was investigated by determining the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of 14 antibiotics belonging to different classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>As a control, the MICs for a RND 2 operon deletion mutant were determined, and the same results were obtained as for J2315 (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The D4 strain was more sensitive than the parental J2315 to fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, rifampicin and novobiocin (Table 2), as previously reported [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The other antibiotics tested are not substrates of RND 4 efflux pumps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>As expected, the MIC values of D4(pEP_RND4_operon), in which the RND 4 pumps is restored, were identical to those of J2315 (except for levofloxacin, where the complementation of the RND 4 deletion was only partial). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that the reduction in MIC values was due to the absence of the RND 4 operon. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Further, a gene encoding a TetR family transcriptional regulator located upstream of RND 4 is highly conserved, suggesting that regulatory elements controlling the RND 4 operon expression are also common to all Burkholderia species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the phylogenetic distribution of RND 2 operon allowed us to map the putative duplication event inside the Bcc group (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Confirming this scenario, qRT-PCR experiments revealed that RND 2 is expressed at very low level in LB medium even in the presence of a possible inducer, in both B. cenocepacia J2315 and the D4 mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The need for extra-copies of the RND 2 operon in the D4 mutant or of a mutation to increase the expression of the RND 2 operon suggests that antibiotics are not the stimulus that leads to the activation RND 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>According to these hypothesis, different expression “circuits” should control the two operons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>From an evolutionary viewpoint, this means that the duplication of the RND 4 operon also involved parallel or subsequent genetic rearrangements resulting in new regulatory elements (e.g. promoters) located upstream of the MFP gene of the RND 2 operon (subfunctionalization) (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This new regulatory control may have involved the appearance of two new genes, encoding AraC-like and LysR-type regulators, respectively (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>These two genes are present in all genomes harboring an RND 2 operon, except for B. diffusa (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the molecular rearrangements that led to the localization of these two genes close to the RND2 operon, might have occurred after the duplication event, since B. diffusa is phylogenetically located at the base of the cluster in which the duplication occurred (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In the presence of extra copies of RND 2, supplied by the recombinant plasmid pEP_RND2_operon, the expression of RND 2 in J2315 (pEP_RND2_operon) strain is higher than that in the parental strain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was supported by the results from the directed evolution experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In fact, increased RND 2 expression was parallel to a strong increase of the associated lysR gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Also, the gene encoding the AraC-type protein might play a role in the RND 2 expression, since the expression of this gene increases in both mutants D4/C18 and D4/C20. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results show that the Bcc RND 2 operon most likely arose from a duplication of the RND 4 operon, but although RND 2 retains almost the same functions in antibiotics extrusion as RND 4, its expression in Burkholderia cells is much lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a different local mechanism regulating the expression of the RND 2 operon suggests that changes in regulatory circuits (rather than functional mutations) may influence the role of different RND paralogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the fact that the RND 2 operon is encoded by B. cenocepacia J2315 chromosome 3 further supports the subfunctionalization hypothesis concerning the evolution of these two efflux systems. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This agrees with the notion that the RND 2 operon is not completely diversified from its homolog operon (i.e. RND 4), and consequently, it is not yet essential for B. cenocepacia cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that the RND 2 operon may be required only under certain conditions related to chronic infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Our directed evolution experiment demonstrated that under selective pressure, mutations may arise that rewire the local regulatory circuit of the RND 2 operon, allowing it to respond to the presence of antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
