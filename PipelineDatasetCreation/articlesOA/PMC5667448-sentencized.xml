<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Therefore, its bioconversion into liquid fuels represents a promising solution for energy generation [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In recent years, direct DNA extraction techniques from microbial communities coupled with next generation sequencing of metagenomes have given an unprecedented insight into microbial taxonomic groups and their interactions [4]. </plain></SENT>
