</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Despite recent advances in the treatment of infectious diseases, pathogenic microorganisms, including Salmonella, remain an important threat to human and animal health worldwide (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Non-typhoid Salmonella serovars are well-known pathogens but they also silently infect animals, particularly poultry, as transient members of the intestinal microbial population without causing disease (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Intestinal colonization of several Salmonella enterica serovars often have no effect on poultry zootechnical performance (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Kogut et al. (4) described that the infection in chickens caused by Salmonella Enteritidis leads to immune tolerance beginning around 3–4 days post-primary infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This decreases the host immune responsiveness resulting in the establishment of Salmonella and persistent colonization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This asymptomatic infection could increase the probability of transmission to humans via contaminated food (5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, reducing Salmonella colonization and fecal shedding in live chickens, and its subsequent chicken meat contamination, can reduce the burden of salmonellosis in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although many aspects related to their mechanisms of action are unknown, short-chain organic acids (SCOA) have been added to chicken feed, drinking water, and other matrices, as part of several strategies to prevent Salmonella colonization in animal tissues and transmission through the food chain with many positives results (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In that context, Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg is one of the most prevalent serovars and is commonly isolated from patients with salmonellosis in North America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>That region has the greatest prevalence comparing to other continents (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>More invasive human infections, such as myocarditis and bacteremia, are produced by SH compared to other non-typhoid Salmonella (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Since 1962, SH has been isolated and reported from poultry and their products worldwide (9) including Brazil (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Voss-Rech et al. (11) reported 20 different Salmonella serovars in samples from broilers and SH was prevalent in 7.31% of them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>SH UFPR1 strain was isolated from a chicken carcass in the South of Brazil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This strain showed susceptibility and resistance to antibiotics and organic acids, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In a previous trial, our group showed reduction in SH counts in the cecum and liver of broilers fed with a probiotic composed of three strains of Bacillus subtillis previously challenged orally with SH UFPR1 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>No studies comparing the genome of Brazilian UFPR1 to other SH strains have been reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Whole-genome sequencing is a tool that allows to investigate the genomic features of any organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Several genomes from Salmonella strains have been decoded using this technique, aiming at improving the understanding of some aspects of their evolutionary biology, distinguishing outbreak-related strains of sporadic infections (12) and comparing genomes of strains with different clinical history and resistance profile (1, 13, 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Whole-genome sequencing was recently used to study the differences among SH serotypes (15, 16) and resistance to different antibiotics (17, 18). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The objective of this work was to report possible clinical symptoms caused by SH UFPR1 strain in broilers, test the efficacy of SCOA to reduce SH UFPR1 strain proliferation in broilers, study the susceptibility of this strain to some antibiotics in vitro, and relate these phenotypic observations with its genome characteristics through comparative genomics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The Treg cell was not marked in this study, but the absence of clinical signs, the apparent lack of effect on zootechnical parameters, along with the increase of IL-10 mRNA found in the present work suggest that this mechanism could be similar in the UFPR1 strain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Associating phenotypic observations with genomic sequence information of an organism can contribute to understand some of its key biologic aspects, such as mechanisms for genetic information storage, genome organization, the effect of deletion, insertion, inversion, and translocation on the genome function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Although other genes linked to tetracycline tolerance were found in UFPR1 strain, such as tetA class B and tetA class C genes, the deletion of tetB gene could explain the intermediate tetracycline resistance observed in this report. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>The deletion of LysR gene in UFPR1 may be linked to its low pathogenicity since microorganisms lacking it have been found to be less virulent (34, 42). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>Gene deletion is used as an evolutionary process in bacteria in which small genomes have evolved from large genomes, with natural selection acting as a significant driver of gene loss and reductive genome evolution (43). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Genome stability is threatened by transposons, which are able to create repetitive sequence islands that can initiate ectopic recombination (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>The present results showed that UFPR1 has several deletions of genes of various transposases suggesting that DNA transposition could be decreased in this strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The UFPR1 genome presented five different fragments that are absent in SL476 but present in other Salmonella genomes evidencing the fact that they are not exclusively of UFPR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In those five fragments, important genes related to some of the phenotypic characteristics reported herein in UFPR1 were found, such as the Bgt and Bgr genes that are related to serotype transformation; and the rpoS gene, linked to sensitivity to lower temperatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>The proteins produced by the expression of Bgt and Bgr genes are related to the glucosylation of the O-antigen repeated units of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and are correlated to serotype conversion in Shigella flexneri and also in Salmonella (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The presence of this gene is also correlated to the increase of virulence and resistance to oxidative stress (47). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Activation of rpoS gene is involved in cold sensitivity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>The rpoS gene codifies for an alternative sigma factor that regulates many cellular responses to environmental conditions, such as heat, alkaline, and acid stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Mutations of this gene have been detected in pathogenic bacteria (49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Bacteria are subjected to acid stress situations such as to the extreme low pH of the stomach and to the organic acids that are produced in large quantities in the gut including acetic, propionic, and butyric acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>In both situations, bacteria activates mechanisms for acid tolerance response (ATR), for which rpoS is a key regulator, thus minimizing the lethal effects of the acid stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>However, Salmonella rpoS mutant fails to provide the same level of protection when compared to a wild-type strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Therefore, rpoS mutant is ineffective to sustain the ATR resulting in rapid cell death when exposed to pH 3.0 (50, 51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>The product of the rpoS gene regulates the virulence gene expression in Salmonella Typhimurium in response to conditions encountered in the host tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the rpoS gene yield that bacteria unable to develop a complete ATR significantly reducing its virulence potential (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The presence of rpoS gene in the UFPR1 strain could be involved to the resistance to SCOA found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>It has been observed that the alternative sigma factor clearly plays an important role in protecting Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium against weak acids (52). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>In a recent study, Dhanani et al. (15) demonstrated in an in vivo experiment that the resistant genes found in SL476 may explain its pathogenicity, colonization ability and persistence in chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The absence of several genes involved in tolerance to antibiotics and in the efflux of salt reported in this paper, could explain why UFPR1 was in general susceptible to antibiotics, but resistant to SCOA likely due to the presence of rpoS gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>The use of SCOA can be effective for the control of Salmonella in broilers being an important tool for the poultry industry (6, 21). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>In this report, we used comparative genomics to study some of the genotypic peculiarities of UFPR1 linking those findings to phenotypic observations such as its tolerance to SCOA and sensitivity to various antibiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>The comparison of several genome sequences could reveal important aspects of the evolution of the different Salmonella strains, and in a more accurate analysis, help identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in potentially unknown pathways that could be relevant to the study of the metabolism of Salmonella and its control. </plain></SENT>
