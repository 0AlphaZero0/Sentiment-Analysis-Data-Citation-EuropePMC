</text></title><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Undernutrition is directly or indirectly implicated in 45% of all deaths worldwide among children less than 5 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Linear growth stunting is a common manifestation of prenatal and chronic early childhood undernutrition, afflicting at least 156 million children worldwide below 5 years of age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Stunting serves as a clinical marker for lifelong impairments in physical, immunological, neurocognitive, and socioeconomic potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of stunting is decreasing globally, it remains a significant problem and interventions to ameliorate stunting will be needed if the global community is to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals related to childhood health and nutrition [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most of the irreversible stunting suffered by children in resource-limited settings occurs within the first 1000 days after conception, and is linked to pre-conception maternal nutritional status, nutrition and infections during pregnancy, postnatal nutrition, and gut health during this time [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Gut health, as defined here, is affected by nutrient intake and infectious assaults on the gut, and the inflammatory balance the gut must strike in optimizing the first while ameliorating the latter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interventions to optimize gut health during early childhood are urgently needed in order to decrease the risk of stunting and subsequent morbidity and mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For the study presented here, we take the approach of improving the nutritional composition of complementary foods by supplementation with two compounds, lactoferrin and lysozyme, found in breast milk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Environmental enteric dysfunction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a subclinical chronic inflammatory condition of the gut. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Known in the past as tropical sprue, tropical enteropathy, or environmental enteropathy, it is condition that primarily affects rural, poor, but seemingly healthy children, most prominently below 2–3 years of age [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>EED is histologically characterized by diffuse small bowel villous atrophy and T-cell infiltration of the intestinal mucosa that causes chronic immunostimulation [6], leading to increased intestinal permeability and impaired mucosal barrier function, which further leads to translocation of gut microbes and endotoxins, and nutrient malabsorption [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although EED itself is a subclinical condition, affected children are subjected to increased rates of infection, poorer response to oral vaccines, and growth stunting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Interventions aimed at combating EED have had mixed results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Trials involving antibiotics [8] and probiotics [9] to modulate the gut microbiota and decrease microbial-stimulated inflammatory responses have had limited success. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Supplementation with multiple vitamin A [10], alanyl-glutamine [11], long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids [12], albendazole [13], zinc [13], multiple micronutrient supplements [14], and mesalazine [15] have all been shown to at least transiently benefit small intestine function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, these benefits have not always been consistent—even in combination—among children in the periods of highest food insecurity [16], and any demonstrated improvements in linear growth and development remain lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Given that malnutrition to this day still accounts for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality in children less than 5 years of age, interventions aimed at reducing EED are integral to improving child survival worldwide [17]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Breastfeeding provides innumerable benefits to infants and children, both in the short and long term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Infants in low- and middle-income countries who have never breastfed are 14 times likely to die from all causes compared to exclusively breastfed infants in the first 5 months of life [18]; most of this benefit stems from a lower risk of acute infections. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Similar to children with minimal dietary diversity, breast milk has also been shown to be protective against increased intestinal permeability [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin and lysozyme are two proteins present in substantial concentrations within various human mucosal secretions, particularly breast milk [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin is an 80-kDa iron-binding glycoprotein which accounts for 25% of the protein in breast milk (1–3 g/mL) and functions to sequester iron, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth [19, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Lysozyme is a 15-kDa protein present in breast milk at 0.1–0.3 mg/mL that acts as an antimicrobial by lysing a specific connection within the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previous research has demonstrated that both lactoferrin and lysozyme supplementation are safe and efficacious in children as young as 5 months of age [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin has been shown to improve hematocrit levels and decrease the rate of lower respiratory tract infections in neonates without adverse effects [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Lysozyme levels in breast milk have been positively correlated with neonatal weight gain [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Lysozyme has also been shown to modulate inflammatory response and gut structure, as well as alter microbiota in animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>One study showed that pigs which were fed human lysozyme-enriched milk expressed significantly elevated blood levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and tended to have longer villi with thinner lamina propia, which are linked to increased intestinal surface area and increased nutritional absorptive capacity [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In this animal model, lysozyme also led to altered gut microbiota, relatively enriched in Bifidobacteriacea and Lactobacillacea, two populations associated with a healthy microbiome, and decreased Mycobacteriaceae and Campylobacterales populations, which are associated with disease [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Another study of supplementation with transgenic milk containing human lactoferrin in malnourished pigs showed benefits to jejunal architecture, reduced intestinal permeability, and promotion of weight gain [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In combination, lactoferrin and lysozyme have been shown to work synergistically as bactericidal agents against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin destabilizes the outer membrane likely through a mechanism involving iron sequestration and binding to membrane lipopolysaccharide, while lysozyme acts on the inner peptidoglycan membrane [22, 30, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Importantly, both are resistant to proteolytic degradation [32, 33], which is essential for any therapeutic use as an oral agent in humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In a study of Peruvian children between the ages of 5 and 33 months, supplementing oral rehydration solutions with lactoferrin and lysozyme in the setting of acute diarrhea with dehydration decreased the severity and duration of diarrheal episodes, without any adverse effects related to treatment [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>These therapeutic properties make lactoferrin and lysozyme attractive candidates for the prevention and treatment of EED, and more broadly may be useful supplements for infants who cannot breastfeed or who are weaning from breast milk but may still benefit from their therapeutic properties. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Electricity, running water, and other utilities are generally absent; most cooking is accomplished on open wood or charcoal fires and most cleaning is performed at streams or with water obtained from those streams. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Most household responsibilities and child-rearing are performed by women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>It is common for women to marry and assume household responsibilities relatively early in life, and thus most women are illiterate and have not completed primary school. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par44"><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Malnutrition and chronic enteric infections are closely intertwined global health problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Ever since the 1960s, it has been known that the two in concert cause long-term growth stunting and impaired cognitive development [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Since then, studies have quantified the effect of enteric infections and have found that diarrheal episodes in the first 2 years of life can account for 25% or more of stunting [64], and newer research suggests a link to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Central to the treatment of stunting will be interventions targeted against EED. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Past studies have tested pharmacologic interventions against EED, but effects have been minimal [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Breast milk provides a number of benefits for developing infants, including the provision of energy, gut maturation, and immunologic functions [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Though the use breastfeeding as an intervention to treat undernutrition has shown only modest reduction in stunting, it decreases mortality rates significantly [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Thus, use of breast milk components in supplements may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of EED. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Lactoferrin and lysozyme are of particular interest as they are both present in substantial concentrations within breast milk, and increase substantially in concentration during lactation [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Their antimicrobial properties have been demonstrated in vitro [22] and in vivo [34], along with potential benefits to intestinal health [34], and it is our hope that their use as interventions may help attenuate EED. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>One limitation of this study is the lack of complete blinding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The control and experimental interventions have physical differences that may be noticeable to discerning caregivers, who may subsequently exchange their interventions with others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>We believe that this will be an unlikely occurrence since past research in this area of Malawi did not demonstrate any evidence of sharing or trading for food [69] or pharmacological [70] interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Extensive community education of local officials, caregivers, and workers will stress the importance of complying with the assigned interventions, which should decrease the occurrence of sharing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Preliminary acceptability studies showed that children liked the interventions equally, which should also decrease the motivation for trading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>There is also potential for sharing of the interventions with other family members, but this is relatively unlikely as the amount administered is unlikely to be satisfying to hungry family members. </plain></SENT>
