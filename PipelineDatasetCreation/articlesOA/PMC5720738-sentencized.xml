</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Objective assessment of movement has moved the field of physical activity (PA) monitoring substantially forward by replacing self-report measures suffering from many well-known limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Still, there are many unresolved issues regarding data reduction and quality assessment of data derived from accelerometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This has resulted in great variation in procedures used and criteria applied to define what constitutes a valid measurement [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Behavior vary greatly over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, an important aspect of accelerometer measurements is how many days or periods of measurement are to be included to obtain reproducible estimates of habitual activity level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true when children live in an area with a significant change in weather during different seasons [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As most diseases that can be prevented by PA develop over longer periods, the “true” habitual PA level would be more closely related to health than a short–for example a 7-day–snapshot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Association analyses will inherently suffer from severe regression dilution bias, if relying on a monitoring period that is too short [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although the length of a period to be considered to constitute a person’s “habitual” or “regular” PA level is not easily defined, a 7-day period is arguably a short, and possible insufficient, period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most studies in children apply a criterion of a minimum 3 or 4 wear days to constitute a valid accelerometer-measurement period [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although findings vary between studies in both adults [6–10] and children [11–22], most evidence suggest that a reasonable reliability (i.e., intra-class correlation (ICC)) of ~ 0.70–0.80 are achieved with 3–7 days of monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies have estimated the reliability of single days and thereafter calculated the number of days needed to reach a reasonable reliability level (often considered to be ICC = 0.80), based on the Spearman Brown prophecy formula for measurements conducted over a single 7-day period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these study designs have received critique for being likely to underestimate the number of monitoring days needed, and their conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these results are in principle only generalizable to the included days, as inclusion of additional days, weeks or seasons will add variability to the measurement and thus lower the reliability estimates for a given number of days (i.e., the variance partitioning of a fixed number of days to the total variance will decrease if the total variance increase). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Some studies have determined the reliability for several periods of measurement over the course of two weeks up to a year, of which all have shown considerable intra-individual variation [26, 27, 25, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Reliability has been shown to be ~ 0.70–0.80 for one out of two and three consecutive weeks of measurement in preschool children and adults, respectively [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, poorer estimates are found in studies including several seasons [26, 27, 25], leaving reliability estimates of ~ 0.50 for one week monitoring in children [27, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest, Wickel and Welk [25] showed that even applying three measurement periods across different seasons, did not result in a reliability of 0.80 using an absolute agreement definition (i.e., not controlling for season). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This finding agrees with studies showing substantial seasonal variation in activity level in children and adolescents [2–4], which are obviously not captured when relying on a single measurement period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>While the lower reliability estimates from these latter studies involving several monitoring periods might be due to variation across seasons, there might also be differences between the analytic approaches applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has directly compared a day-by-day and a week-by-week approach for determining reliability for accelerometer outcomes, therefore we will address this important question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, few studies have determined the intra-individual week-by-week reproducibility of accelerometer outcomes using absolute measures of agreement (i.e., limits of agreement (LoA) and/or standard error of the measurement (SEM)) [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These previous studies should be extended to evaluation of agreement over different seasons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The present study had two aims: 1) to determine the reproducibility of accelerometer-determined PA and sedentary time (SED) for one out of two 7-day measurement periods obtained during two different seasons separated by 3–4 months in a large sample of children; and 2) to directly compare a day-by-day and a week-by-week approach for analyzing reproducibility of accelerometer data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized great variability across the monitoring periods for all accelerometer outcomes, resulting in reliability estimates lower than ICC = 0.80, and lower reliability using a week-by-week as compared to a day-by-day approach. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Wear time was included as a covariate for analyses of PA and SED. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>We estimated reliability using two approaches; 1) day-by-day analyses, and 2) week-by-week analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>In both approaches, reliability for single days (day-by-day approach) and weeks (week-by-week approach) of measurement (ICCs) was assessed using variance partitioning applying a one-way random effect model not controlling for season (i.e., determining reliability based on an absolute agreement definition) and a two-way mixed effect model controlling for season (i.e., determining reliability based on a consistency definition) [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>All models were adjusted for wear time by adding wear time as a covariate, as wear time has a strong association with PA and SED estimates and also impact reliability [29], and since most studies control for wear time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The number of days (day-by-day approach) and weeks (week-by-week approach) needed to obtain a reliability of 0.80 (N) was estimated using the Spearman Brown prophecy formula (ICC for average measurements [ICCk]) [6, 36]: N = ICCt/(1-ICCt)*[(1-ICCs)/ICCs], where N = the number of days or weeks needed, ICCt = the desired level of reliability, and ICCs = the reliability for single days or weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the ICCk (between-subject variance/[between-subject variance + residual variance/k]) for k = 6 (i.e., the mean number of monitoring days/week) was calculated to directly compare reliability estimates for one week of measurement from the day-by-day and the week-by-week approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In the week-by-week analyses, we additionally applied Bland Altman plots, showing the difference between two subsequent weeks as a function of the mean of the two weeks [37], to visualize the week-by-week measurement variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>We calculated 95% LoA and coefficient of variation (CV) from the residual variance (i.e., within-subjects) error term based on the variance partitioning models (LoA = √residual variance *√2*1.96; CV = √residual variance/mean values) [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether the variability varied as a function of the mean activity levels (i.e., whether data were homoscedastic or heteroscedastic) by correlating absolute differences against the mean values using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>For quantification of measurement error, an absolute measure of error (e.g., LoA) provide the correct estimate for homoscedastic data (where there are no association between variability and mean values), whereas a relative measure of error (e.g., CV) provide the correct estimate for heteroscedastic data (where variability increases with increased mean values) [39]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Of the 1129 children included in the ASK-study, 676 children provided accelerometer data at the mid-term and post measurement, of whom 615 children (50% boys) fulfilled the ≥ 480 minutes/day and ≥ 3 days/week wear criterion (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the included (n = 615) and excluded (n = 514) children in anthropometry (p ≥ .092) or PA level at the post measurement (p ≥ .218). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>For the included children, the number of wear days was similar between the winter and spring measurement, whereas the valid wear time was marginally higher during the spring measurement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Overall PA level (cpm) and intensity-specific PA was significantly higher (except for LPA in girls), and SED was significantly lower, in the spring than in the winter for both boys and girls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The greatest increase from the winter to the spring measurement was seen for VPA (50% in boys and 44% in girls), overall PA level (31% in boys and 26% in girls), and MVPA (28% in boys and 23% in girls). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="640" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to determine the reproducibility of accelerometer-determined PA and SED over two different seasons and to directly compare a day-by-day and a week-by-week approach for analyzing reproducibility of accelerometer data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="641" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that 1) the reliability for one out of two week-long measurements undertaken 3–4 months apart resulted in estimates clearly lower than most previous studies that have relied on a single monitoring period, and that 2) a day-by-day approach overestimated the reliability compared to a week-by-week approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="642" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the children’s PA level varied up to ± 1.3–1.7 SD units between the two measurements, indicating substantial measurement error for all variables. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="643" pm="."><plain>Most previous studies investigating reliability and the required number of accelerometer monitoring days have estimated reliability based on day-by-day analyses using a single 7-day monitoring period [11, 16, 17, 40, 18, 19, 22, 20, 21, 12–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="644" pm="."><plain>In general, these studies conclude that 3–7 monitoring days are sufficient in children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="645" pm="."><plain>This approach, however, restricts variation and underestimates the number of monitoring days and periods needed to obtain reliable estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="646" pm="."><plain>We applied two monitoring periods covering two different seasons, leading to findings very similar to previous studies that have applied multiple measurement periods over the course of several seasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="647" pm="."><plain>These studies have yielded substantially lower reliability estimates in adults [26] and children [27, 25], concluding that more than one monitoring period is needed to reach a reliability level of 0.80. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="648" pm="."><plain>Mattocks [27] determined overall PA, MVPA and SED over four 7-day periods over approximately one year using the Actigraph 7164 accelerometer in 11–12-year-old children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="649" pm="."><plain>The ICC for one period of measurement varied from 0.45 to 0.59 across outcome variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="650" pm="."><plain>Wickel &amp; Welk [25] found an ICC of 0.46 for one out of three 7-day periods to assess steps for the Digiwalker pedometer in 80 children aged ~ 10 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="651" pm="."><plain>The present findings along with these previous findings question the validity of one week of measurement to determine children’s “true” habitual activity level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="652" pm="."><plain>Whereas we found that 7–15 days of measurement was required to reach a reliability of 0.80 based on the day-by-day analyses, 2–10 weeks of measurement was required based on the week-by-week analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="653" pm="."><plain>These contrasting findings strengthen the argument that the estimation of number of days needed using the traditional approach, that is, applying the Spearman Brown prophecy formula to single days, might be used with caution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="654" pm="."><plain>We have no explanation for these contrasting findings, but our findings do support previous studies that have warned against a possible overestimation of reliability by the day-by-day approach [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="655" pm="."><plain>This is especially clear when the assessment is spread across different seasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="656" pm="."><plain>For example, two studies have revealed similar results for a day-to-day and a week-to-week approach [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="657" pm="."><plain>However, contrary to the present study, these studies were based on two consecutive weeks of measurement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="658" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both the present study and others that have introduced multiple seasons [27, 25], found increased variability in estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="659" pm="."><plain>Apparently, seasonality has a more profound effect on the week-by-week analysis than the day-by-day analysis, as illustrated by the differences in reliability estimates with and without controlling for season shown in Table 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="660" pm="."><plain>The difference in variance between the two monitoring periods (Table 1) could explain the findings, as the model assumes compound symmetry and the ICC are sensitive to asymmetry [36], however, this difference between measurements applies to both analytic approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="661" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is clear that applying the Spearman Brown prophecy formula/the ICCk calculated for average days [36], which imply dividing the residual variance over the desired number of days, seems overly optimistic when compared to week-by-week approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="662" pm="."><plain>Notably, this limitation also applies to the estimation of the number of weeks needed for the week-by-week approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="663" pm="."><plain>As noise in exposure (x) variables will lead to attenuation of regression coefficients (regression dilution bias), and noise in outcome (y) variables will increase standard errors [5], unreliable measures weaken researchers ability to make valid conclusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="664" pm="."><plain>In epidemiology, researchers are in general interested in the long-term “true” habitual PA level, rather than activity during the most recent days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="665" pm="."><plain>There are some health characteristics, as for example insulin resistance, lipid metabolism and blood pressure, that might change with acute increases or decreases in PA [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="666" pm="."><plain>Despite this, a child’s level of fatness, aerobic fitness or motor skill takes months or years to change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="667" pm="."><plain>For such stable traits, association analyses will inherently suffer from regression dilution bias if relying on a 7-day monitoring period that provide an insufficient snapshot of children’s habitual activity level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="668" pm="."><plain>Similarly, tracking coefficients for PA are generally low to moderate [42–44], probably due to measurement error as much as true change over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="669" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our reliability estimates over 3–4 months are quite similar to many tracking estimates reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="670" pm="."><plain>This finding challenge our understanding of behavioral change versus measurement error, as they are both different sides of the same coin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="671" pm="."><plain>Although an increased monitoring length might improve validity of study conclusions, the burden for participants should be kept minimal to maximize response rate and compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="672" pm="."><plain>We have previously performed 2 and 3-week monitoring protocols in preschool children and adults, respectively, without any major issues regarding compliance [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="673" pm="."><plain>More recently, we have also successfully performed a 2-week monitoring protocol in larger samples of children, adults and older people, demonstrating this protocol’s acceptance in various context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="674" pm="."><plain>Still, performing measurements over separate as opposed to consecutive periods might pose an increased burden for participants, as well as for researchers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="675" pm="."><plain>Notably, the required monitoring volume is a matter of the research question posed, as population-estimates on a group level requires a lower level of reproducibility than individual-level estimates used for association analyses [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec017"><title><text><SENT sid="676" pm="."><plain>Strengths and limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="677" pm="."><plain>The main strength of the present study is the inclusion of a large and representative sample of children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="678" pm="."><plain>As reliability estimates (i.e., ICCs) depend on the sample variation [37, 45, 38], the validity of the estimated ICCs presented herein should be generalizable to other contexts, including large-scale population studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="679" pm="."><plain>Another strength is inclusion of measurements conducted 3–4 months apart, during two different seasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="680" pm="."><plain>Thus, these data clearly serve the aim of the study; we introduced more variability than within a shorter time frame, but also restricting the duration to some few months, where “true” changes over time would be expected to be limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="681" pm="."><plain>A limitation, though, is the inclusion of only two weeks and two seasons, as inclusion of more observations probably would introduce more variability and lead to more conservative reproducibility estimates [27, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="682" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Norway has profound seasonal differences in weather conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="683" pm="."><plain>This characteristic might limit generalizability to areas with less pronounced seasonality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="684" pm="."><plain>Finally, the inclusion of the intervention group in the current analyses might have caused additional variation to the data, as the intervention group could be expected to change their PA level over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="685" pm="."><plain>Yet, the intervention was ongoing during both measurements, there was no effect of the intervention on PA levels [31], and reliability estimates differed marginally between the intervention and control groups. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="687" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a one-week accelerometer monitoring period conducted during two different seasons 3–4 months apart resulted in modest reproducibility between measurements in a large sample of children (ICC for one week = 0.32–0.67). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="688" pm="."><plain>The traditional approach for estimating the number of wear days needed for accelerometer measurements–applying the Spearman Brown prophecy formula to single days of measurement over a short monitoring period–resulted in more optimistic reliability estimates than a week-by-week approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="689" pm="."><plain>Thus, consistent with previous studies that have raised concern about the traditional approach to estimate reliability of accelerometer monitoring protocols, we suggest results from studies using a day-by-day approach to determine reliability be interpreted with caution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="690" pm="."><plain>Researchers should consider increasing the monitoring period beyond a single 7-day period in future studies. </plain></SENT>
