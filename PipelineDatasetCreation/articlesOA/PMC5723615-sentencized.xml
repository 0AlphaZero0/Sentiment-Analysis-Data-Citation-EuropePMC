<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this was not a result of absorbing macronutrients in relation to their relative abundance in the diet, as the carcass protein:lipid ratios differed from those of the diets, with ratios usually lower in the body than in the diet. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variation in diet is well known to be a critical determinant of fitness‐related traits such as growth, reproduction, and survival (Fontana &amp; Partridge, 2015; Partridge, Gems, &amp; Withers, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In particular, dietary restriction (DR), a reduction in the intake of calories or particular macronutrients, has been shown to extend lifespan and protect against age‐related diseases in the majority of species studied to date (see Speakman &amp; Mitchell, 2011; Nakagawa, Lagisz, Hector, &amp; Spencer, 2012; Selman, 2014 for recent reviews). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is widely accepted that this lifespan extension can be achieved through a reduction in calorie intake (McCay, Crowell, &amp; Maynard, 1935; reviewed Speakman &amp; Mitchell, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, recent research has rejuvenated the suggestion that variation in the ratio of specific macronutrients, and in particular a reduction in the protein content of the diet, is a key component of the relationship between diet and lifespan (Carey et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Maklakov et al., 2008; Fanson, Weldon, Pérez‐Staples, Simpson, &amp; Taylor, 2009; Solon‐Biet et al., 2014; Jensen, McClure, Priest, &amp; Hunt, 2015; but see Speakman, Mitchell, &amp; Mazidi, 2016; Simpson et al., 2017 for discussion). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite this interest, the traits that link dietary macronutrient intake and lifespan are not currently known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An obvious starting point is the relationship between dietary macronutrient ratio and body composition, especially given the importance of body composition and particularly fat deposition, in determining health and lifespan (Barzilai, Banerjee, Hawkins, Chen, &amp; Rossetti, 1998; Muzumdar et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, using a freshwater fish as our model, we investigate the relationship between macronutrient ratio of the diet and body composition, as well as how macronutrient ratio impacts on physical performance and activity, two indicators of health and lifespan. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Calorie restriction is well known to affect body weight (McCay et al., 1935) but is also suggested to affect body composition, particularly adiposity (Colman, Roecker, Ramsey, &amp; Kemnitz, 1998; Hempenstall, Picchio, Mitchell, Speakman, &amp; Selman, 2010; Mitchell et al., 2015; Muzumdar et al., 2008; Picard &amp; Guarente, 2005) and relative organ size (Mitchell et al., 2015; Selman et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In fact, it has been suggested that a reduction in adiposity is the primary mechanism through which calorie restriction acts to extend health and lifespan (Barzilai et al., 1998; Muzumdar et al., 2008; Picard &amp; Guarente, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In mice, for example, adipose loss due to calorie restriction occurs in a graded manner, mirroring that of lifespan extension (Mitchell et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, contradictory evidence suggests that fat loss under calorie restriction provided no benefit or was detrimental to lifespan (Chiba et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2011; Park et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, although body composition appears to play a role in mediating the effect of calorie restriction on lifespan, the exact nature of this relationship is currently unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Similar to calorie restriction, changes in dietary macronutrient composition result in changes to both body composition and lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For example, it has been shown that mice fed high protein:carbohydrate ratio diets have reduced body fat (Huang et al., 2013; Solon‐Biet et al., 2014; Sørensen, Mayntz, Raubenheimer, &amp; Simpson, 2008), but surprisingly not the longest lifespan (Solon‐Biet et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, a different study found little to no effect of changing dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio on body fat mass (Mitchell et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila melanogaster, body weight and lipid‐free bodyweight increased with increasing protein:carbohydrate ratio of the diet, with carcass lipid content highest on a dietary protein:carbohydrate ratio of 1:2 (Lee, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These flies had the second highest mean and maximum lifespans, with lifespan maximized on a 1:4 diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, additional studies in D. melanogaster found that with increasing protein intake, there was a decrease in body weight, due to a decline in body fat (Ponton et al., 2015; Skorupa, Dervisefendic, Zwiener, &amp; Pletcher, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, as with calorie restriction, although dietary macronutrient ratio appears to influence body composition, the relationship between diet and body composition and lifespan appears complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Improving our understanding of how variation in dietary macronutrient ratio influences body composition may shed light on the causes of the lifespan cost of being fed imbalanced diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>An obvious candidate is that there are metabolic or storage costs of excess nutrients merely being absorbed in relation to their relative abundance in the diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is known that the body has a limited capacity for storing excess protein, with surplus nitrogen being excreted as urea (Delimaris, 2013; Heaney, 1998; Tarnopolsky et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, there is a positive relationship between fat intake and fat storage, with ingestion of high‐fat diets resulting in increased fat storage and obesity and thus potentially the associated negative consequences for health and survival (reviewed Hariri &amp; Thibault, 2010; but see Liao et al., 2011; Chiba et al., 2014; Park et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The protein leverage hypothesis suggests that individuals eat primarily to obtain a target protein level, with carbohydrate and fat being overconsumed on low‐protein diets in an attempt to reach this protein level (Huang et al., 2013; Simpson &amp; Raubenheimer, 2005; Sørensen et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although this hypothesis focuses on protein intake, it can be predicted that this modification of food intake in relation to protein availability will also affect body composition (Simpson &amp; Raubenheimer, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>For example, when eating to a target protein intake, nonprotein constituents are consumed in relation to their abundance in the diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, across multiple diets with varying ratios of protein:nonprotein, we would expect the protein content of the body to remain stable, but the content of other components to vary in relation to their relative abundance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Studies from agriculture and aquaculture would seem to support this; when protein is limiting, individuals appear to prioritize protein ingestion and consequently overconsume lipid and carbohydrate, resulting in greater adiposity (Aletor, Hamid, Niess, &amp; Pfeffer, 2000; Andrews &amp; Ørskov, 1970; Donaldson, Combs, &amp; Romoser, 1956; Ruohonen, Koskela, Vielma, &amp; Kettunen, 2003; Ruohonen, Simpson, &amp; Raubenheimer, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>If metabolic or storage costs of excess nutrients are driving the cost of imbalanced diets, we would expect that the protein:lipid ratio of the carcass would be similar to that of the diet and would have the same rank order of protein:lipid ratios as the diets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation for the survival cost of imbalanced diets is that animals have the potential to selectively absorb and or excrete particular nutrients and that the cost of an imbalanced diet is due to the costs of these selective processes (Fanson, Fanson, &amp; Taylor, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Under this scenario, body and diet macronutrient compositions would not be expected to match, but body compositions would be expected to be more similar than diet compositions, as individuals selectively absorb or excrete particular nutrients in attempt to reach a target protein:lipid ratio within the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>If individuals are targeting a specific carcass protein:lipid ratio, then the protein content of the carcass would differ across diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we would expect to see clustering and a reduction in variability in carcass protein:lipid ratio, as individuals would be trying to achieve a particular protein content in relation to their lipid content. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In addition to body composition, physical activity and performance (e.g., endurance) are commonly linked with health and lifespan and are affected by diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that an increase in activity in response to short‐term food shortage would improve an individual's ability to find new food sources, thus explaining the commonly observed biphasic pattern of activity (reviewed Speakman &amp; Mitchell, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, recent evidence suggests that the effect of calorie restriction differs between different components of activity (Mitchell et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is little to no exploration of how shortage of a specific macronutrients, rather than overall calorie deficit, affects activity and endurance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Finally, the effect of diet appears to be sexually dimorphic, with lifespan extension under DR greater in females than males (Nakagawa et al., 2012 but see Speakman et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>It is thought that this sex difference is a result of a differences between males and females in their investment in reproduction (Shanley &amp; Kirkwood, 2000; but see Moatt, Nakagawa, Lagisz, &amp; Walling, 2016), but work exploring the effect of DR on reproduction in males is often lacking (Moatt et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>One measure of reproductive investment in males is testes mass, but this is often difficult to study as it would require sacrificing males in studies where lifespan is the key trait of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In mice, it has been shown that testes mass is only reduced at high restriction levels, suggesting testes are protected against the effect of DR (Mitchell et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The same study reported a marginal effect of protein restriction on testes mass (Mitchell et al., 2015), with a further study reporting increased testes mass on high protein:carbohydrate ratios (Solon‐Biet et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>However, very few other studies look at the effect of dietary macronutrients on testes mass. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="?"><plain>Here, we used three‐spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) reared on diets that varied in macronutrient ratio to investigate the following questions: (1) what is the effect of macronutrient intake on growth and body composition and is this driven by variation in protein content of the diet; (2) how does macronutrient manipulation affect activity and swimming endurance; (3) are there sex differences in the effect of macronutrient manipulation; and (4) what is the effect of macronutrient manipulation on testes size? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We predicted that growth would be highest on the diet with the best balance, containing high levels of both protein and lipid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In line with the protein leverage hypothesis, we expect the rank order of carcass protein:fat ratios will match that of the diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we expect dietary protein content to predict carcass fat content but not carcass protein content, with little difference in carcass protein content across treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Thus, the protein content of the diet will predict carcass body composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we expected carcass fat content to be higher with high lipid intake and low protein intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>For endurance and activity, we predicted that endurance would be greater on high‐protein diets, as protein is important for muscle development while activity would be higher on low‐protein diets to allow protein‐restricted individuals to locate better food sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Finally, we predicted that testes size would be larger on high‐protein diets. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Diet is known to be an important determinant of key fitness traits (Fontana &amp; Partridge, 2015; Partridge et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>However, what mediates this effect is much less well understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Our study explores the relationship between dietary macronutrient ratio and the macronutrient composition of the body, a key determinant of fitness traits such as health and lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In particular, we explore the direct effect of dietary protein and lipid intake on protein and lipid content in the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our findings suggest that individuals are able to alter their utilization or uptake of ingested macronutrients, with the ratio of protein:lipid in the carcass being vastly different from that of the diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we found no effect of dietary protein intake on body composition, rather carcass protein and lipid content was predicted only by dietary lipid intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Although the protein leverage hypothesis focuses on protein intake, these results conflict with our predicted outcomes of this for body composition (Simpson &amp; Raubenheimer, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Under the protein leverage hypothesis, we expected the rank order of diet protein:lipid ratios to be maintained in the ratio of protein:lipid in the carcass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we expected that the protein content of the diet would predict carcass body composition and the relative protein content of the body would be relatively stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However here, there was no effect of protein intake on body composition, the rank order of protein:lipid ratios was not maintained from the diet to the carcass, and the protein content of the body varied across diets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>These findings have striking implications for studies exploring the relationship between diet and health or organismal fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that being consigned to a specific diet, but fed ad lib, allows individuals to increase or decrease their intake of that diet, but prevents them from altering the ratio of macronutrients they ingest (Simpson &amp; Raubenheimer, 1995, 2007; Simpson, Sibly, Lee, Behmer, &amp; Raubenheimer, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>However, our results show individuals clearly alter their utilization or uptake of the ingested macronutrients, resulting in vastly different macronutrient ratios in the carcass compared to the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the range of protein:lipid ratios was 1.4:1 to 3.9:1 in the carcasses, but was 1.6:1 to 10.2:1 in the diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This suggests a pattern of modification toward a lower and less variable carcass protein:lipid ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Previous work has suggested that lifespan is maximized on low protein:nonprotein intakes, with high‐protein diets negatively affecting lifespan (Carey et al., 2008; Fanson et al., 2009; Jensen et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2008; Maklakov et al., 2008), which could imply that individuals are targeting lower protein:nonprotein ratios in an attempt to increase fitness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Previous research suggests a survival cost to being maintained on an imbalanced diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Two obvious alternative explanations for this are the cost of storage of excess nutrients or the cost of their selective absorption or excretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Our results provide some support for the latter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Individuals fed diets of vastly different macronutrient ratios appeared to converge on more similar body compositions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>This suggests that nutrients are not simply stored in proportion to their availability in the diet and thus that survival costs of imbalanced diets are likely associated with selective absorption or excretion of particular nutrients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Given that here, dietary lipid content, not protein, is driving body composition and the positive association between dietary lipid intake and adiposity (Hariri &amp; Thibault, 2010), we suggest that this modification is achieved via metabolism of excess protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The body has a limited capacity for storing excess protein, which must be converted into urea and excreted (Delimaris, 2013; Heaney, 1998; Tarnopolsky et al., 1992) which may represent one potential cost of a high‐protein diet (Fanson et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide mixed support for the well‐known theory of protein sparing in fish, where individuals prioritize lipid use for energy expenditure and use protein for growth and muscle development (De Silva et al., 1991; Helland &amp; Grisdale‐Helland, 1998; Vergara et al., 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The lack of an effect of protein content of the diet on protein content of the carcass suggests individual fish were able to maintain the protein content of their carcass on protein intakes as low as 31.2% and conforms to the theory of protein sparing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, the negative linear effect of lipid intake on carcass protein content is counter to predictions from protein sparing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>There was little effect of diet on growth, despite diets of differing energy levels being well known to affect size (e.g., Colman et al., 1998; McCay et al., 1935). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>However, in our study, food was provided ad libitum, meaning that despite the diets differing in energy content (Table 1), fish on lower energy diets could increase their intake and avoid caloric restriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Only fish on the 2.5:1 diet were different in size, being significantly larger than all other fish in all other diets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the protein:lipid ratio in this diet is closest to the ratio that maximizes growth in European Whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (Ruohonen et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Ruohonen et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>(2003) suggested that growth was maximized on a 2.25:1 protein:lipid ratio as this feed had a high energy value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, this explanation is unlikely here, as food was provided ad lib (see above), and there were no differences in growth between other diets differing greatly in energy content (e.g., 7.1 MJ/kg to 14.8 MJ/kg). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the 2.5:1 diet resulted in the greatest growth because it had the highest energy content in combination with a balance of protein and lipid and that high levels of no single dietary component can generate high levels of growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide evidence of sexual dimorphism in body composition, with males being significantly shorter and having greater fat deposits, and females being longer and having higher bone and mineral deposits (indicated by the higher ash content). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>These findings fit with a previous study (Kitano, Mori, &amp; Peichel, 2007), where female G. aculeatus were also found to be longer than males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this is likely a result of the different reproductive behaviors exhibited by the sexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>When reproducing, male three‐spine sticklebacks defend territories, construct nests, court females, and fan eggs, which likely impacts on their ability to forage (Wootton, 1984). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Therefore, males potentially invest in fat deposition, rather than growth in length, to provide greater energy reserves prior to the breeding season. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This would explain the higher fat content of males here, as our fish were culled immediately prior to the breeding season. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>We found no effect of diet on swimming endurance or activity, despite calorie restriction being known to affect activity and endurance (reviewed Speakman &amp; Mitchell, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>However, individuals in the current study were fed ad libitum and could therefore obtain sufficient energy to maintain activity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Additionally, as discussed above, fish appeared able to selectively utilize their ingested macronutrients and therefore may not have been under major macronutrient imbalance; thus, there was no stimulation to increase activity levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, these findings could suggest that the effects of calorie restriction on performance are not reproducible through macronutrient manipulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that any differences in activity and endurance were too subtle to be detected in the current study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found no direct or indirect effect of diet on testes mass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>This could reinforce the suggestion that the testes are protected from the effect of diet (Mitchell et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, it could suggest that testes size in the three‐spine stickleback is a low‐cost reproductive trait, and thus that the effect of diet is correspondingly small and therefore difficult to detect (Moatt et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we show that body macronutrient composition differs from that of the diet and that this pattern of variation suggests individuals are attempting to achieve a particular protein:lipid ratio in the body rather than prioritising a single macronutrient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>We suggest individuals are achieving a balance of protein and lipid in the body by excreting excess protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In contrast to a number of recent studies and the protein leverage hypothesis (Huang et al., 2013; Lee, 2015; Ponton et al., 2015; Skorupa et al., 2008; Solon‐Biet et al., 2015; Sørensen et al., 2008), our results suggest lipid intake is the key determinant of body composition, rather than protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that the key macronutrient for determining body composition may differ between species, which, if this extends to lifespan, has striking implications for studies of DR, where effects have been suggested to be evolutionarily conserved (e.g., see Moatt et al., 2016; Nakagawa et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The results presented here seem to conflict with predicted outcomes of the protein leverage hypothesis, but we do not directly quantify intakes of either protein or lipid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Given that the protein leverage hypothesis directly relates to intake, it would be interesting to examine the intake of the diets used here and see if they match the patterns observed for body composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Future studies should also look to test whether a particular body composition is achieved via protein excretion and whether the costs of excreting protein could be one explanation for the emerging survival cost of being maintained on a high‐protein diet (Fanson et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
