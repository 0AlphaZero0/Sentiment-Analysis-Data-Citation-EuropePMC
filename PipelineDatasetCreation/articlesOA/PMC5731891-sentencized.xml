</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is uncommon [1], and the prognosis for high-stage UTUC has not improved over the past two decades [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Adjuvant chemotherapy has been considered a therapeutic option; however, loss of renal function after radical nephroureterectomy decreases the eligibility for cisplatin-based chemotherapy [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This evidence strongly suggests a need for changing the treatment protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A multimodal approach including neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and surgical resection might improve patient outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, only a few prospective studies are available regarding the benefit of NAC for UTUC [4, 5] and to our knowledge, no definitive recommendation exists because of insufficient evidence, such as data on appropriate regimens [4, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The benefit of NAC for locally advanced UTUC has been debated based on studies of bladder cancer indicating improved survival after cisplatin-based NAC [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Several retrospective studies have addressed the prognostic benefit of NAC for UTUC [8–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported the oncological benefits of NAC for locally advanced UTUC in a single-center study [14]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Among 426 patients, the number of the patients with cTis, cT1, cT2, cT3, cT4, and cN+ were 2, 92, 103, 217, 12 and 34, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We identified 234 high-risk patients who received either 2 to 4 courses of NAC (n = 101, NAC group) or surgery alone (n = 133, Control [Ctrl] group; Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in preoperative patient characteristics between the groups except for tumor location and laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The regimens in the NAC group were gemcitabine plus carboplatin (GCarbo) in 76 patients (75%), gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GCis) in 21 (21%), and others (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin [MVAC], or a docetaxel-based regimen) in 4 (4%; Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The incidence of postoperative complications showed no significant differences between the Ctrl and NAC groups, and no grade 4 or 5 complication was observed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Due to the long-term period of the study, the use of laparoscopic surgery was significantly different between the groups (P = 0.001). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The essential finding of our study was that NAC for locally advanced UTUC has potential to improve oncological outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that patients with locally advanced UTUC were potential candidates for NAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis using the IPTW model revealed that the impact of NAC on intravesical RFS, visceral RFS and CSS was significant, but it was not significant on OS (P = 0.081). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Limited impact of NAC on OS might be due to the elderly population with UTUC and the short-term follow up of the NAC group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with our previous study that reported efficacy and safety of platinum-based NAC for locally advanced UTUC in 51 pair-matched patients [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The two arms (without vs. with NAC) were matched using propensity scores to minimize selection bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The retrospective evaluation of safety, tumor response, post-therapy pathological downstaging, LVI, and prognosis showed feasibility and potential efficacy of NAC for locally advanced UTUC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Pathological downstaging of the primary tumor was significantly higher in patients with NAC than in those without NAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>NAC for locally advanced UTUC significantly prolonged oncological prognosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox regression analysis using an IPTW model revealed that the impact of NAC was significant on CSS (HR, 0.37; 95%CI, 0.15–0.92; P = 0.031) but not on OS (HR, 0.46; 95%CI, 0.21–1.02; P = 0.056) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, the clinical impact of NAC on OS might be limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Firstly, we thought that the rate of other cause of death might be higher in the NAC group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, the number of other cause of deaths were not different between the Ctrl (n = 7, 5.3%) and the NAC (n = 5, 5.0%) groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The next possible reason for this discrepancy might be the long-term study periods under the paradigm shift. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We started NAC for locally advanced UTUC in selected patients after 2006 based on studies of bladder cancer indicating improved survival after NAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>After 2010, we expanded our inclusion criteria for all patients with locally advanced UTUC regardless of age and renal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Therefore, short follow-up periods in the NAC group may have influence on the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Therefore, further studies with long-term follow-up are needed on this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The use of carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting and the optimal number of courses still are being debated [15–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Because no evidence clearly supports the superiority of a cisplatin-based against a carboplatin-based regimen in a neoadjuvant setting in patients with UTUC [16, 21], we designed a strategy including carboplatin-based NAC followed by immediate surgery in patients with UTUC and impaired renal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Because multiple studies have suggested that a delay of &gt; 90 days in undergoing radical cystectomy is associated with adverse outcomes [22], we basically planned two courses of NAC and surgery within 90 days in accordance with the presence of muscle-invasive bladder cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that there were no clear differences in tumor responses and prognosis between the two regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Although it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion on the efficacy of a carboplatin-based regimen and optimal number of NAC courses, the potential activity of a carboplatin-based regimen is worth noting as it could be a viable option in patients with locally advanced UTUC who are unfit for cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Although the body of evidence suggested a survival benefit of those based on the outcomes from muscle-invasive bladder cancer, to our knowledge no robust evidence exists to recommend the role of NAC for UTUC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Currently, only a few prospective randomized studies are ongoing for locally advanced UTUC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>One ongoing randomized trial (NCT02876861) evaluating the role of 2 to 4 cycles of NAC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for patients with locally advanced UTUC who are eligible for cisplatin hopefully will provide insight for clinical benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, this study will not provide the useful information for the role of NAC in cisplatin-ineligible patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The use of carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting is still a matter of debate [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The present study showed that there were no clear differences in tumor responses and prognosis between the two regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Although the limitations of the present study prevent us from drawing definitive conclusions on the efficacy of a carboplatin-based regimen, it is worth noting the potential activity of carboplatin-based regimens as a viable option in patients with locally advanced UTUC who are unfit for cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, efficacy and feasibility of immune-oncology therapy in cisplatin-ineligible patients have been reported and are promising [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>The single-arm phase II IMvigor210 trial included 119 cisplatin-ineligible, treatment-naive patients with metastatic bladder cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that the objective response rate with atezolizumab was 23.5% (n = 28; 95% CI, 16.2–32.2), including a complete response rate of 9% without severe toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical benefit of immune-oncology therapy in a neoadjuvant setting for treatment of UTUC remains unclear, these results encouraged us to see continued progress in the treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Response to salvage chemotherapy after recurrence may become concern about negative effect of NAC use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the recurrent disease might be resistant to salvage chemotherapy when patients already received systemic (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>However, recent study suggested that adjuvant chemotherapy after NAC and radical cystectomy may prolong OS among patients with locally advanced muscle invasive bladder cancer [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>They investigated 788 patients with pT3-4 and/or pN+ bladder urothelial carcinoma and compared OS among patients who received NAC and radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy vs observation using IPTW-adjusted analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>IPTW-adjusted Kaplan-Meier curves showed that median OS was significantly longer for NAC and radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (29.9 months, 5-year OS rate: 36.8%) vs NAC and radical cystectomy followed by observation (24.2 months, 5-year OS rate: 24.7%) (P = 0.046). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In the IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, NAC and radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a significant OS benefit (HR 0.78; P = 0.046). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Although this study was retrospective, the patients with NAC shows better response to salvage chemotherapy after recurrence than those without. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Therefore, response to secondary chemotherapy may be not worse in these patients with NAC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Several limitations must be acknowledged, including the limited sample size and retrospective study design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>We were unable to control selection bias and other unmeasurable confounders despite the use of statistical methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>We could not obtain the safety profiles in the patients receiving NAC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>This long-term retrospective study included uncontrollable inherent factors such as the NAC use and/or laparoscopic surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Tumor downstaging was not evaluated by ureteroscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Due to the retrospective nature, the information for dissected lymph nodes was limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Because no strong recommendation exists for template lymph node dissection, most patients underwent sampling dissection of regional lymph nodes alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In addition, cN+ patients were not indicated or marginal for surgery approximately in a decade ago. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there were strong limitations in the exact information such as number of dissected lymph nodes and areas in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion of clinical benefit of carboplatin-based NAC for locally advanced UTUC because of the limited number of patients with selection bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Regardless of these limitations, our study supported the potential benefit of NAC for locally advanced UTUC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the platinum-based NAC for locally advanced UTUC potentially improves oncological outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>A carboplatin-based regimen might be a useful alternative in patients with UTUC who are ineligible for cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Further prospective randomized studies are needed to confirm the benefits of NAC in patients with locally advanced UTUC. </plain></SENT>
