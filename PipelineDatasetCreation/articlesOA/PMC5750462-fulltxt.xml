However, it remains largely unknown why matrix protein 1 (M1), the major structural protein encoded by M gene, exhibits pH-dependent conformational changes during virus replication. Understanding the mechanisms underlying efficient virus replication can help to develop strategies not only to combat influenza infections but also to improve vaccine supplies. M(NLS-88R) and M(NLS-88E) are two M1 mutants differing by only a single amino acid: G88R vs G88E. G88R but not G88E was the compensatory mutation naturally selected by the virus after its nuclear localization signal was disrupted. Our study shows that, compared with M(NLS-88E) M1, M(NLS-88R) M1 dissociated quickly from viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) at higher pH and took less time to dissemble <italic>in vitro</italic>, despite forming thicker matrix layer and having stronger association with vRNP in assembled virions. Correspondingly, M(NLS-88R) replicated more efficiently and was genetically more stable than M(NLS-88E). Crystallographic analysis indicated that M(NLS-88R) M1, like wild-type M1, is able to switch from a face-to-back-oriented conformation to a face-to-face-oriented conformation when pH drops from neutral to acidic, whereas G88E mutation causes M(NLS-88E) M1 to be trapped in a face-to-face-arranged conformation regardless of environmental pH. Our results suggest that maintaining M1 pH-dependent conformational flexibility is critical for efficient virus replication, and position 88 is a key residue controlling M1 pH-dependent conformational changes. Our findings provide insights into developing M1-based antiviral agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>conformational change</kwd><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>matrix protein 1</kwd><kwd>pH dependent</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>virus replication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The viral core of influenza A virus (IAV) contains eight gene segments that are individually incorporated along with nucleoprotein (NP) into viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> As the most abundant viral protein encoded by the M gene segment, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms a shell underneath a host cell-derived lipid biolayer to connect the vRNPs with the viral envelope in mature virions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that reassortment with the M gene segment of a high growth IAV, for example, A/PR/8/34 or A/WSN/33 (WSN), often generates a new virus with high growth potential,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> suggesting M gene plays an important role in virus replication.</p><p>The full-length M1 protein includes 252 amino acids consisting of a highly organized N-terminal domain and a flexible but less ordered C-terminal domain that are linked by a protease-sensitive loop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> So far, only the N-terminal domain of M1 has been structurally resolved at an atomic level, showing that at neutral pH the physiological monomers have a high tendency to oligomerize via a so-called &#x02018;face-to-back&#x02019; arrangement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> whereas at acidic pH the N-terminal domain exists as a dimeric structure in a so-called &#x02018;face-to-face&#x02019; arrangement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Acidic conditions (pH ~5.0 or lower) have also been used to selectively isolate M1 from assembled virions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> These results indicate that M1 exhibits various conformations depending upon environmental pH.

These results suggested that M(NLS-88R), in spite of a stronger M1&#x02013;vRNP association than that in M(NLS-88E), was more sensitive to pH drops whereby M1&#x02013;vRNP dissociation occurred at a higher pH.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> replication and genetic stability of M1 mutants</title><p>The multiple-step growth curves at pH 7.4 confirmed that M(NLS-88R) replicated more efficiently than M(NLS-88E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Both M(NLS-88R) and M(NLS-88E) have identical HA gene,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> but have different amounts of HA spikes on viral surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Unlike M(NLS-88E) that acquired 3 additional mutations in the M1 gene after four serial egg passages, M(NLS-88R) gained no additional mutations in the M1 gene until egg passage 11 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our previous study indicated that M(NLS-88R) not only possessed much thicker M1 layer but also had stronger M1&#x02013;vRNP association in viral particles than M(NLS-88E) virions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Thus, it would presumably be more difficult to disrupt the M1 layer in M(NLS-88R) virions than that in M(NLS-88E) virions. However, M(NLS-88R) showed a faster cytoplasmic M1 disassembly than that of M(NLS-88E) after pH 5.5 pretreatment, suggesting M(NLS-88R) M1 is more sensitive to acidic pH than M(NLS-88E) M1, irrespective of M1 layer thickness. Furthermore, M(NLS-88E) had a more difficult M1&#x02013;vRNP dissociation than M(NLS-88R) in response to pH drops, clearly indicating that this was also irrelevant to a weaker physical binding strength between M1 and vRNP. In addition, the faster cytoplasmic M1 disintegration and more facile M1&#x02013;vRNP dissociation after mild acidic exposure correlated well with more efficient replication of M(NLS-88R). Moreover, our current study also showed that cellular membrane-associated M1 was not affected by environmental pHs. These results taken together suggest that acidic pH-induced M1 conformational changes are likely to play a role in M1&#x02013;vRNP dissociation, rather than to affect virus assembly during viral life cycle. This is consistent with recent TEM studies that M1 may undergo conformational changes before dissociation from vRNP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup></p><p>Although differing by a single amino acid (G88R vs G88E), M(NLS-88R) M1 and M(NLS-88E) M1 respond to environmental pH differently as indicated by the crystal structures obtained in the current study. M(NLS-88R) M1, similar to wt-M1, is able to switch from a face-to-back monomer&#x02013;monomer association at neutral pH to a face-to-face-oriented dimeric conformation at acidic pH. However, M(NLS-88E) M1 is trapped in a face-to-face-oriented conformation irrespective of environmental pH. The face-to-back monomeric arrangement of M1 occurring at neutral pH is likely necessary for the formation and maintenance of a confluent and strong matrix layer underneath the viral envelope, whereas the face-to-face dimeric arrangement at acidic pH may describe M1 that has dissociated from the extended matrix layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Consistent with previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> we have observed that the N<sup>1&#x02013;165</sup>-domain of wt M1 purified only under acidic conditions retains dimeric conformation.

Thus, the acid-facilitated M1 conformational change is likely irreversible, presumably to prevent dissociated M1 from re-associating with vRNP in the cytosol after virus uncoating.</p><p>At neutral pH where basic and acidic amino acid residues exist predominantly in their ionized forms, M1 monomers are driven to interact in a face-to-back manner that involves predominantly electrostatic contacts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> for example, wt-M1 1EA3 (pH 7.0) and M(NLS-88R)-neutral. At acidic pH, M1 dimerization is anticipated as it is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions between the symmetry-related helices H6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> for example, wt-M1 1AA7 (pH 4.0), M(NLS-88R)-acidic and M(NLS-88E)-acidic. Surprisingly, M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimerizes in a face-to-face manner at neutral pH in contrast to a face-to-back monomer&#x02013;monomer arrangement as possessed by wt-M11EA3 (pH 7.0) and M(NLS-88R)-neutral. A further look at M(NLS-88E)-neutral structure reveals that the G88E mutation results in three inter-subunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions including Lys104-NZ to Glu88-OE1 (and its symmetry-related counterpart) and Arg134-NE to Glu88-OE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) that may explain why M(NLS-88E)-neutral that is predicted to crystallize as monomers in a face-to-back arrangement is actually driven to dimerize in a face-to-face manner at neutral pH. When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate <italic>in vitro</italic> at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. The G88R mutation also results in two additional inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds (Lys104-NZ to Glu29-OE2 and Arg134-NE to Glu29-OE1) in M(NLS-88R)-neutral (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) that make the subunit rotation slightly difficult than similarly face-to-back-oriented wt-M1 neutral structure 1EA3. This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles. Nevertheless, M(NLS-88R) M1 retains pH-dependent conformational transition like WSN.</p><p>In sharp contrast to M(NLS-88R), both M(NLS-88E) neutral and acidic structures are in a face-to-face-oriented dimeric mode and lack pH-dependent conformational switches. This is because the G88E mutation causes Tyr100-OH to interact with the side chain instead of the carbonyl oxygen of mutated Glu88-OE1 (OE2), and Asn85-ND2 to interact with Arg134-NE2 instead of Arg134-O in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88E)-neutral (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). These changes result in a strong bifurcated hydrogen-bond interaction between Tyr100 and Glu88 that further stabilizes the three inter-subunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions (Lys104-NZ to Glu88-OE1 and its symmetry-related counterpart, and Arg134-NE to Glu88-OE2) unique to M(NLS-88E)-neutral. This presumably makes the fulcrum in the misshapen face-to-face-oriented M(NLS-88E)-neutral very difficult to break when the pH drops, and this may explain why it requires much lower pH and takes longer time to eventually solubilize the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88E) virion than in M(NLS-88R) particles. As for M(NLS-88E)-acidic structure, it contains two face-to-face-arranged dimers. Dimer 2 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is significantly different from all other obtained dimeric structures by showing neither apparent contact between Asn85 and Arg134 nor apparent inter-subunit interaction involving Glu88 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Dimer 2 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic likely represents an intermediate conformation due to incomplete transition after the pH drops. However, dimer 1 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is more like M(NLS-88E)-neutral that owns a strong bifurcated hydrogen-bond interaction between Tyr100 and Glu88 because of the G88E mutation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>) that makes it more difficult to dissemble M(NLS-88E) M1 in acidic conditions than M(NLS-88R) M1.</p><p>Compared with M(NLS-88E), that M(NLS-88R) has less difficulty to break the fulcrum likely translates into a smaller cooperative energy requirement of monomer-to-dimer conversion under subtle pH changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> This flexibility facilitates M(NLS-88R) M1 to dissociate from vRNP in the acidified endosome, thus prompting virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic>. In contrast, M(NLS-88E) M1 is locked in a face-to-face-arranged dimeric conformation regardless of environmental pH. This conformational inflexibility requires much lower pH to dissociate M(NLS-88E) M1 from vRNP in the acidified endosome that not only puts M(NLS-88E) at a disadvantage in replication competency but also hinders M(NLS-88E) M1 oligomerization and genetic stability.</p><p>It is important to note that the C-terminal domain of M1, which is absent in the published crystal structures including our current study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> has also been shown experimentally to influence oligomerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> Very recently, the crystal structure of a full-length M1 protein from a closely related Orthomyxovirus&#x02014;the infectious salmon anemia virus&#x02014;has just been released, showing that its C terminus plays a critical role in stabilizing M1 oligomerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> In the case of M(NLS-88E)-neutral with misshapen face-to-face monomer&#x02013;monomer interactions that seem unfavorable for M1 oligomerization, a thin, uneven and broken M1 layer still forms beneath the M(NLS-88E) viral envelope as exhibited in our TEM images. This could be due to the presence of the C terminus that may provide sufficient stabilization for a malformed M1 layer. Nevertheless, the exact structural details of the full-length IAV M1 with the C terminus under different pH conditions remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Our results also indicate that the compensatory G88R mutation was not a random mutation but was chosen by the virus purposefully to retain pH-dependent conformational flexibility for efficient virus replication. Thus, critical atomic-level interactions involving position 88 of M1 are key to maintaining a delicate balance between stability and rigidity. Hence, manipulating M1 flexibility without destroying its multifunctionality can be a strategy to attenuate IAV without compromising virus replication for vaccine development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Impairing M1 oligomerization through the use of a small molecule &#x02018;wedge&#x02019; has also proven to be a viable approach to develop broad-spectrum anti-IAV agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Besides IAV, many enveloped viruses such as <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (Dengue and Zika viruses) and <italic>Filoviridae</italic> (Ebola and Marburg viruses) also have similar M1 structure in their viral particles.
