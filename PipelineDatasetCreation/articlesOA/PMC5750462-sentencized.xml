</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The viral core of influenza A virus (IAV) contains eight gene segments that are individually incorporated along with nucleoprotein (NP) into viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs).1 As the most abundant viral protein encoded by the M gene segment, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms a shell underneath a host cell-derived lipid biolayer to connect the vRNPs with the viral envelope in mature virions.1, 2 It has been reported that reassortment with the M gene segment of a high growth IAV, for example, A/PR/8/34 or A/WSN/33 (WSN), often generates a new virus with high growth potential,3, 4, 5, 6 suggesting M gene plays an important role in virus replication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The full-length M1 protein includes 252 amino acids consisting of a highly organized N-terminal domain and a flexible but less ordered C-terminal domain that are linked by a protease-sensitive loop.7, 8, 9 So far, only the N-terminal domain of M1 has been structurally resolved at an atomic level, showing that at neutral pH the physiological monomers have a high tendency to oligomerize via a so-called ‘face-to-back’ arrangement,10, 11, 12 whereas at acidic pH the N-terminal domain exists as a dimeric structure in a so-called ‘face-to-face’ arrangement.10, 13, 14 Acidic conditions (pH ~5.0 or lower) have also been used to selectively isolate M1 from assembled virions.15, 16 These results indicate that M1 exhibits various conformations depending upon environmental pH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As the major structural protein in mature virions, the mechanism(s) by which M1 exhibits pH-dependent conformational changes during virus replication remains largely undefined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>After endocytosis, virions are internalized to late endosomes where they are exposed to low pH (≤~5.5) to induce hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion with the endosomal membrane.17, 18 The low-pH environment inside endosomes also activates M2 ion channels embedded in the viral envelope, resulting in proton influx into the interior of the virion.1, 19 This leads to stepwise acidification inside the viral compartment.20, 21 The initial pH drop from neutral to pH ~6.0 in early endosome is believed to soften the M1 layer and make the viral envelope more pliable for membrane fusion, yet is insufficient to expose the viral core.20, 21, 22 The second drop to pH ~5.0–5.5 in the late endosome triggers the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane by inducing conformational changes in HA.20, 21, 23 This further pH drop also causes M1 dissociation from vRNP and releases vRNP into the cytosol where they are imported into the nucleus for transcription and replication.2, 20, 21, 24, 25 Inhibition of M1–vRNP dissociation via acidification blockage by M2 inhibitors leads to abortive replication.26, 27, 28 M1 can also enter the nucleus through its nuclear localization signal motif (NLS, 101RKLKR105).29 By reassociation with M1, newly synthesized vRNPs are exported out of the nucleus for virus assembly and budding at the host plasma membrane.1, 2, 24, 25 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Apparently pH-induced M1 conformational changes are dynamic and complex, and depend upon the stage of virus replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is difficult to fully capture these changes using biophysical techniques alone, including crystallography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is unclear what controls M1 conformational changes at the atomic level following pH drops and how pH-dependent M1 conformational changes affect virus replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the mechanisms underlying efficient virus replication is the prerequisite for the development of effective countermeasures against both seasonal and pandemic influenza. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Both M(NLS-88R) and M(NLS-88E) are M1 mutants in the WSN background that differ in a single mutation at M1 position 88 (G88R vs G88E).30 G88R but not G88E was originally acquired by the virus as a spontaneous compensatory mutation after NLS disruption.30 As a result, M(NLS-88R) not only has a thick M1 layer in assembled virions but also replicates efficiently in vitro and in vivo, similar to the parent virus WSN.30, 31 In contrast, M(NLS-88E) has a thin M1 layer in mature virions and replicates inefficiently in vitro and in vivo.30 Using M(NLS-88R) and M(NLS-88E) as model viruses, we revealed that the transition from a face-to-back orientation at neutral pH to a face-to-face orientation at acidic pH allows M1 to quickly dissociate from vRNP for efficient replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the G88E mutation causes M1 to be trapped in a face-to-face orientation regardless of pH that consequently resulted in inefficient virus growth and genetic instability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that maintaining M1 pH-dependent conformational flexibility is critical for efficient IAV replication, and position 88 serves as a ‘switch’ that controls M1 pH-dependent conformational changes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>A further look at M(NLS-88E)-neutral structure reveals that the G88E mutation results in three inter-subunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions including Lys104-NZ to Glu88-OE1 (and its symmetry-related counterpart) and Arg134-NE to Glu88-OE2 (Figure 1F; see Supplementary Table S3) that may explain why M(NLS-88E)-neutral that is predicted to crystallize as monomers in a face-to-back arrangement is actually driven to dimerize in a face-to-face manner at neutral pH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (Figures 1F and 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The G88R mutation also results in two additional inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds (Lys104-NZ to Glu29-OE2 and Arg134-NE to Glu29-OE1) in M(NLS-88R)-neutral (see Supplementary Table S3) that make the subunit rotation slightly difficult than similarly face-to-back-oriented wt-M1 neutral structure 1EA3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, M(NLS-88R) M1 retains pH-dependent conformational transition like WSN. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast to M(NLS-88R), both M(NLS-88E) neutral and acidic structures are in a face-to-face-oriented dimeric mode and lack pH-dependent conformational switches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This is because the G88E mutation causes Tyr100-OH to interact with the side chain instead of the carbonyl oxygen of mutated Glu88-OE1 (OE2), and Asn85-ND2 to interact with Arg134-NE2 instead of Arg134-O in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88E)-neutral (see Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>These changes result in a strong bifurcated hydrogen-bond interaction between Tyr100 and Glu88 that further stabilizes the three inter-subunit salt-bridge/hydrogen-bond interactions (Lys104-NZ to Glu88-OE1 and its symmetry-related counterpart, and Arg134-NE to Glu88-OE2) unique to M(NLS-88E)-neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This presumably makes the fulcrum in the misshapen face-to-face-oriented M(NLS-88E)-neutral very difficult to break when the pH drops, and this may explain why it requires much lower pH and takes longer time to eventually solubilize the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88E) virion than in M(NLS-88R) particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>As for M(NLS-88E)-acidic structure, it contains two face-to-face-arranged dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Dimer 2 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is significantly different from all other obtained dimeric structures by showing neither apparent contact between Asn85 and Arg134 nor apparent inter-subunit interaction involving Glu88 (see Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Dimer 2 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic likely represents an intermediate conformation due to incomplete transition after the pH drops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, dimer 1 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is more like M(NLS-88E)-neutral that owns a strong bifurcated hydrogen-bond interaction between Tyr100 and Glu88 because of the G88E mutation (see Supplementary Table S3) that makes it more difficult to dissemble M(NLS-88E) M1 in acidic conditions than M(NLS-88R) M1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Compared with M(NLS-88E), that M(NLS-88R) has less difficulty to break the fulcrum likely translates into a smaller cooperative energy requirement of monomer-to-dimer conversion under subtle pH changes.10 This flexibility facilitates M(NLS-88R) M1 to dissociate from vRNP in the acidified endosome, thus prompting virus replication in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In contrast, M(NLS-88E) M1 is locked in a face-to-face-arranged dimeric conformation regardless of environmental pH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This conformational inflexibility requires much lower pH to dissociate M(NLS-88E) M1 from vRNP in the acidified endosome that not only puts M(NLS-88E) at a disadvantage in replication competency but also hinders M(NLS-88E) M1 oligomerization and genetic stability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that the C-terminal domain of M1, which is absent in the published crystal structures including our current study,10, 11, 12, 13, 14 has also been shown experimentally to influence oligomerization.7, 8, 9 Very recently, the crystal structure of a full-length M1 protein from a closely related Orthomyxovirus—the infectious salmon anemia virus—has just been released, showing that its C terminus plays a critical role in stabilizing M1 oligomerization.41 In the case of M(NLS-88E)-neutral with misshapen face-to-face monomer–monomer interactions that seem unfavorable for M1 oligomerization, a thin, uneven and broken M1 layer still forms beneath the M(NLS-88E) viral envelope as exhibited in our TEM images. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the presence of the C terminus that may provide sufficient stabilization for a malformed M1 layer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the exact structural details of the full-length IAV M1 with the C terminus under different pH conditions remain to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Our results also indicate that the compensatory G88R mutation was not a random mutation but was chosen by the virus purposefully to retain pH-dependent conformational flexibility for efficient virus replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Thus, critical atomic-level interactions involving position 88 of M1 are key to maintaining a delicate balance between stability and rigidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Hence, manipulating M1 flexibility without destroying its multifunctionality can be a strategy to attenuate IAV without compromising virus replication for vaccine development.30, 31 Impairing M1 oligomerization through the use of a small molecule ‘wedge’ has also proven to be a viable approach to develop broad-spectrum anti-IAV agents.42 Besides IAV, many enveloped viruses such as Flaviviridae (Dengue and Zika viruses) and Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses) also have similar M1 structure in their viral particles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Thus, our current study offers new insights into developing M1-based countermeasures beyond IAV. </plain></SENT>
