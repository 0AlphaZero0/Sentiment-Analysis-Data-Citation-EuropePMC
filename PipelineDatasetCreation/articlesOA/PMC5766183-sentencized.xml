</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During evolution, protein domains are used as building blocks that can be combined in different arrangements, resulting in enzymes with altered activity, specificity or entirely new functions (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A remarkable illustration of this process is provided by Type II restriction endonucleases (REases), one of the largest and most diverse groups of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At present, &gt;4000 REases specific for more than 400 recognition sites were identified in different bacteria and archaea species (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite a similar function, i.e. cleavage of DNA within or close to short (4–8 bp) specific recognition sites, REases, even those specific for the same DNA sequence (isoschizomers), often differ dramatically in their domain organization, oligomeric structure and DNA cleavage mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Notable examples are enzymes specific for the 5′-GGCGCC-3′ sequence: of 7 biochemically characterized REases, 5 different reaction mechanisms could be discerned (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Another example, backed up by extensive structural data, is enzymes specific for a set of closely related pseudopalindromic recognition sequences 5′-CCNGG-3′ (Ecl18kI), 5′-CCWGG-3′ (PspGI, EcoRII, MvaI) and 5′-CCSGG-3′ (BcnI), where N stands for any nucleotide, W = T, A, and S = G, C (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As revealed by the co-crystal structure, PspGI is a one-domain homodimeric enzyme that forms a symmetric complex with a single copy of the 5′-/CCWGG-3′ site (‘/’ marks the cleavage position), placing two catalytic centers in the proximity of two scissile phosphodiester bonds (Figure 1A, (4)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Such mode of DNA binding and cleavage is historically considered as normal for Type II REases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Another homodimeric enzyme, EcoRII, is a two-domain protein capable of simultaneous binding of three copies of the 5′-/CCWGG-3′ recognition site, one by the PspGI-like dimer of the C-terminal domains, and two more by the N-terminal effector domains that are structurally related to the B3 domains of plant transcription factors (Figure 1B (5,6)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Only one DNA site is cleaved (the one bound by the C-terminal domains), the other two sites helping to activate the enzyme to cleave the first copy (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>EcoRII and other REases containing two functionally distinct types of DNA binding clefts, one capable of DNA cleavage and the other (or others) of activator sequence(s) binding are classified as Type IIE enzymes (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the one-domain Type IIF enzyme Ecl18kI forms a homotetrameric complex with two copies of the 5′-/CCNGG-3′ sequence, and simultaneously cuts both copies of the recognition site in each of the two PspGI-like primary dimers (Figure 1C (9,10)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Finally, BcnI (5′-CC/SGG-3′), and the closely related REase MvaI (5′-CC/WGG-3′) are monomeric one-domain enzymes containing a single catalytic center (Figure 1(D) (11,12)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To accomplish cleavage of double-stranded DNA these enzymes must first bind the recognition sequence in one orientation, nick the first DNA strand, then re-bind the nicked recognition site in the opposite orientation and nick the second DNA strand (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, biochemical studies of BcnI and preliminary characterization of MvaI suggest that both these enzymes, despite having a single catalytic center, are highly efficient REases, capable of cleaving both strands of the recognition site during a single binding event (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It was proposed that the switch in enzyme orientation on the nicked site must involve enzyme hopping and sliding on the DNA without dissociation into the bulk solution, as now is confirmed for BcnI using single molecule techniques (15). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>(C) Ecl18kI (5′-/CCNGG-3′) is a type IIF enzyme, which forms a tetramer on the DNA and simultaneously cuts both recognition sites (PDB ID 2fqz (9,10)). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We perform structural analysis of the N-terminal accessory domain and show that UbaLAI, being an unusual fusion of building blocks found in other REases, is a monomeric Type IIE enzyme that employs a DNA cleavage mechanism that is distinct from the PspGI, EcoRII, Ecl18kI and MvaI/BcnI mechanisms described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We propose that the UbaLAI-N domain acts as a handle that tethers the monomeric UbaLAI-C domain to the DNA, thereby helping UbaLAI-C to perform two sequential DNA nicking reactions on the second recognition site during a single DNA-binding event. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Formation of a single UbaLAI-2×DNA complex in EMSA experiments is also indicative of highly cooperative DNA binding by wt UbaLAI, when attachment of the first DNA site stimulates binding of the second site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, one would expect formation of two different UbaLAI–DNA complexes, one with a single DNA (a low mobility complex, as observed with UbaLAI-2mut, Figure 5A), and one with two DNAs (the higher mobility complex, Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Indeed, two different protein-DNA complexes are resolved in the case of REase BfiI, an enzyme that shows little cooperativity in DNA binding (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Under enzyme excess conditions (e.g. 100 nM wt UbaLAI, 2 nM DNA), the preferential UbaLAI binding to DNA via the N-terminal domain results in significant inhibition of both 1-site and 2-site DNA cleavage reactions (Figure 3C), as in this case the productive synaptic complexes are replaced by complexes where all recognition sites are occupied by protein molecules bound via the non-catalytic UbaLAI-N domain (cartoons in Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Cooperative binding of two recognition sites by wt UbaLAI may also explain relatively small differences between the nicking rates observed on the 1- and 2-site plasmids under substrate excess conditions (almost equal nicking rates, but different products, Figure 3A), and with equimolar enzyme and substrate concentrations (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>3-fold difference, Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Presumably, under these conditions wt UbaLAI bridges a significant fraction of the 1-site plasmids in trans (cartoons in Figure 3B), despite the fact that this type of protein-DNA complex is less stable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Efficient nicking of the 1-site substrate discriminates UbaLAI from other enzymes that tether two recognition sites, e.g. SfiI and Bse634I, which both cut the 1-site plasmids &gt;10-fold slower than the optimal 2-site substrates (18,20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The situation is quite different with the UbaLAI-2mut enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Presumably, the residual DNA binding ability of mutant UbaLAI-N is still sufficient to ‘authorize’ DNA binding by the UbaLAI-C domain, resulting in formation of a catalytically competent in cis synaptic complex on the 2-site substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Indeed, under equimolar enzyme and DNA conditions UbaLAI-2mut cuts the 2-site plasmid with a comparable rate to the wt enzyme (Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of 1-site plasmid, impaired DNA binding by the mutant N-domain and loss of DNA binding cooperativity precludes formation of the less stable in trans synaptic complexes, resulting in very slow 1-site plasmid cleavage at low enzyme concentrations (the 1-site plasmid is cleaved ∼10-fold slower than the 2-site plasmid, Figure 6B; most of the 1-site plasmid under these conditions may also remain enzyme-free, as depicted in Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>But in stark contrast to wt UbaLAI, an increase in UbaLAI-2mut concentration does not inhibit, but instead accelerates DNA cleavage, especially in the case of the 1-site plasmid (Figure 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>We attribute this lack of inhibition to preferential binding of UbaLAI-2mut to DNA via the catalytic UbaLAI-C domain, thereby forming productive complexes (Figure 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Such direct interaction of UbaLAI-2mut with the DNA via the C-domain bypasses the ‘authorization’ by UbaLAI-N, and therefore requires higher enzyme concentrations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Structural homologs of UbaLAI-C, REases BcnI and MvaI, are monomeric single-domain REases (Figure 1D) that form an asymmetric complex with their recognition sites (11,12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>To cut double-stranded DNA they must first associate with the recognition sequence in one orientation, nick the first DNA strand, re-bind the nicked intermediate in the opposite orientation, and nick the second strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the switch in enzyme orientation occurs without dissociation into bulk solution, but instead via sliding and hopping of the protein on the DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>This enables cleavage of both DNA strands during a single enzyme-DNA association event (14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>DNA cleavage kinetics of wt UbaLAI under substrate excess conditions indicates that wt UbaLAI, despite being a monomeric REase with a single catalytic center, is also able to introduce a double-strand break during a single binding event (linear DNA product accumulates from the start of the steady-state 2-site plasmid cleavage reaction, Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>But for this UbaLAI requires (i) the presence of two specific sites in cis, as no linear product is formed in the steady-state reaction on a 1-site plasmid (Figure 3A); and (ii) an intact N-terminal DNA binding domain, as UbaLAI-2mut enzyme variant cuts only one DNA strand prior to dissociation, both on the 1-site and the 2-site plasmid substrates (Figure 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The UbaLAI reaction mechanism consistent with the above requirements is depicted in Figure 7B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>First, UbaLAI forms a complex with two recognition sites in cis, and the UbaLAI-C domain nicks the first recognition site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Next, UbaLAI-C dissociates from the nicked intermediate, but remains tethered to the nicked substrate via the UbaLAI-N domain, bound to the second recognition site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>This enables the UbaLAI-C domain to re-bind the nicked site in the opposite orientation and cut the remaining strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The reaction is then completed by dissociation of UbaLAI-N from the intact recognition site, the slowest reaction step. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The lower limit for the latter step can be inferred from the UbaLAI steady-state reactions (Figure 3A): since the reaction rate observed with 0.2 nM enzyme is 0.0016 nM s−1, the lower limit for UbaLAI turnover rate is 0.008 s−1 (0.0016 nM s−1/0.2 nM; the real turnover rate of UbaLAI might be higher, since part of the enzyme under our reaction conditions could remain in the DNA-free state). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This rate constant is indeed considerably lower than the observed first-order DNA cleavage rate constants observed in the single turnover reactions (0.04 s−1, Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>This ‘sequential nicking via tethered activation’ mechanism would also be efficient on multi-site DNA substrates: while UbaLAI-N keeps the enzyme tethered to one site, UbaLAI-C may nick and eventually cleave some of the remaining recognition sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the 3-site DNA (plasmid pEcoRII-3, as described in (7)) cleavage kinetics was similar to experiments performed on 2-site DNA, with the only difference that now two types of products (DNA with 1 and 2 double strand breaks) accumulated in the reactions (Supplementary Figure S9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The mechanism in Figure 7B predicts that if the UbaLAI-N–DNA interaction time was shorter than the time required for UbaLAI-C to change its orientation on the DNA, this would result in complete dissociation of UbaLAI from the nicked reaction product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>We believe that the latter happens with the UbaLAI-2mut protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Residual DNA binding ability of UbaLAI-N domain of this protein (more than 1000-fold decrease in affinity in comparison to wt UbaLAI-N, Supplementary Figure S5D) is sufficient to form an in cis synaptic complex on 2-site DNA, but this complex completely dissociates before UbaLAI-C can complete cleavage of the second DNA strand (Figure 7C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>The mechanism in Figure 7B is also in good agreement with accumulation of nicked products in the 1-site DNA cleavage reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In this case wt UbaLAI may form a synaptic complex in trans, but after cleavage of the first DNA strand and dissociation of the UbaLAI-C domain, UbaLAI is no longer physically linked to the nicked DNA molecule (Figure 7D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>A ‘sequential nicking via tethered activation’ mechanism similar to UbaLAI may also be employed by other monomeric two-domain Type II REases, consisting of one catalytic/DNA binding and one DNA binding domain, for example DpnI and Sau3AI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Structural studies of DpnI revealed that it consists of the N-terminal PD-(D/E)XK domain that binds one Dam methylated 5′-Gm6ATC-3′ site, an cuts one DNA strand after ‘A’, and the C-terminal non-catalytic winged helix (wH) domain that binds the second 5′-Gm6ATC-3′ site (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>A possible role of the DpnI wH in anchoring the catalytic domain to the substrate via the second Dam site was discussed by Siwek et al. (24). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Sau3AI (recognition sequence 5′-/GATC-3′) is a biochemically characterized Type IIE enzyme, which consists of two PD-(D/E)XK domains, both structurally related to MutH and BcnI/MvaI (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Despite being a homodimer, BfiI contains a single catalytic center at the interface of the nuclease domains, and uses it for sequential nicking of the two DNA strands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Throughout these reactions, which involve swiveling of the catalytic center between DNA strands of opposite polarity, the catalytic domains of BfiI remain tethered to the DNA via the DNA recognition domain (30). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>UbaLAI consists of two structural domains that are recurring in various DNA binding proteins and enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The UbaLAI-N domain is structurally related to the B3 domains of plant transcription factors; similar domains are also widespread in various REases, including Type IIE enzymes (e.g. EcoRII (5)), Type IIS enzymes (e.g. BfiI (31)) and unusual ATP-driven enzymes (e.g. NgoAVII (32)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The second building block, the monomeric MutH/MvaI-like PD-(D/E)XK catalytic domain, is found in different structural contexts and performing different functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>For example, MutH is a nicking endonuclease involved in DNA repair that binds the hemimethylated GATC sequence in one orientation (33), while BcnI and MvaI are single-domain restriction endonucleases that bind their recognition sites in both orientations, and cleave both DNA strands at the target site in a reaction involving enzyme re-orientation via sliding and hopping (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the MvaI-like catalytic domain of UbaLAI has no such DNA sliding/hopping ability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>It therefore acts as a fusion to the second DNA binding domain and employs a reaction mechanism that is unique among structurally and biochemically characterized REases specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ recognition site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In addition, the two domain structure and preference for multi-site substrates in the case of UbaLAI provides extra functionality—the ‘safety-catch’ that prevents host DNA cleavage if a single unmodified site becomes available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Such requirement for multiple recognition sites is widespread among many families of evolutionary unrelated Type II REases, implying the importance of this ‘safety catch’ mechanism in the function and spread of restriction-modification systems (17,34,35). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the specific case of UbaLAI, and the more general case of restriction enzymes possessing various combinations of structural domains, demonstrate how recombination of different protein building blocks during evolution may yield a myriad of possible reaction mechanisms an functions. </plain></SENT>
