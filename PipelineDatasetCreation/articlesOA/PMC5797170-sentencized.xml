</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The past decades, extensive genomic analysis of tumor specimens using massive parallel sequencing by large sequencing consortia (e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.icgc.org/icgc">https://www.icgc.org/icgc</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</ext-link>) have revealed the major somatic drivers of human cancer, that have been reported in numerous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the small circular genome of the mitochondria has been largely ignored in such analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of ~16,569 base pairs encoding 37 genes: two rRNAs and twenty-two tRNAs functioning in the mitochondrial translation apparatus and thirteen proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The total number of mtDNA molecules per cell varies between cell types from a few up to several thousand, and depends on both the number of mitochondria per cell as well as the number of mtDNA molecules per mitochondrion1–3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Similar to chromosomal DNA in the nucleus (nDNA), mtDNA may contain rare or polymorphic variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Currently nearly 10,000 variable positions within mtDNA are reported in public databases4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>When variation is acquired, genetically different mtDNA molecules can reside within a single cell, referred to as heteroplasmy (that is, &gt;0% and &lt;100% allele frequency per cell). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Importantly, heteroplasmic patterns can differ within an individual across tissues5–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite inherited and somatically acquired variants in mtDNA being associated with multiple human diseases9, the exact significance of somatic mtDNA variants in cancer remains controversial10,11. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recently, taking advantage of publically available data from the large sequencing consortia, a handful of papers reported on the catalog of somatic mitochondrial variants in multiple tumor types12–14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, a complicating issue in the genomic analysis of mtDNA is the presence of sequences of mitochondrial origin in the nDNA (termed nuclear insertions of mitochondrial origin, NUMTs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>NUMTs have likely originated from joining mtDNA/RNA fragments to nDNA ends during double strand break repair15,16 and are found in nearly all eukaryotes that contain mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This process may occur at any moment during lifetime17 as well as during tumor evolution18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There are fixed NUMTs present in virtually every human genome–and thus reported in the human reference genome–inserted millions of years ago, but also more recent NUMT insertions have been described19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, due to their sequence similarity to mtDNA, NUMTs can interfere with accurate variant detection and thus investigation of mitochondrial heteroplasmy16,19–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Estimations based on the human reference genome indicate that for each 175 base pairs mtDNA segment an average of 9.5 NUMT copies are present in the human nDNA24, but this number may likely be higher19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In addition, since the insertion of the mitochondrial genome is an ongoing process, this number is even larger in tumor cells since they also contain all somatic insertions events of NUMTs18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition, in tumor cells the processes shaping nDNA25,26 are substantially different from the one that shapes the mtDNA13, resulting in somatic variants in NUMTs and complicating accurate mtDNA heteroplasmy detection even further for tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the large variation in mtDNA between and within individuals as well as the presence of NUMTs demands a highly specific and sensitive detection of mtDNA variants, especially for low-frequent tumor-specific variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the study described here, we aimed to develop a sensitive procedure to detect low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA variants in frozen tumor tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Multiple efforts in developing methods for extraction of pure mtDNA exist27–34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These include methods using commercial kits or (laborious) ultracentrifugation to obtain pure mitochondria, and techniques to enrich for mtDNA by either the isolation technique or enzymatic degradation of nDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the majority of previous studies focused on either cultured cells or cells from the blood and not on more physically and biochemically complex structures formed by tissue specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus, the application of these techniques to frozen tumor tissue specimens–an important source to assess tumor cell characteristics–has not been shown to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we compared four easily implementable procedures to extract mtDNA as pure as possible from frozen tumor tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Also, we evaluated three state-of-the-art techniques for the detection of low-frequent mtDNA-specific variants: Pacific Biosciences’ SMRT sequencing35, UltraSEEK chemistry36 and digital PCR. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To obtain mtDNA as pure as possible from frozen tumor tissue, our first focus was on the most optimal isolation procedure to extract mtDNA with minimal carry-over of nDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>For this, we extracted DNA from fresh frozen primary tumor specimens using four easily implementable methods, and compared the yields via quantification of the percentage of mtDNA (Fig. 1A) and total amount of dsDNA (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A silica-based total cellular DNA extraction method (I) used as reference for yield resulted in median 863 ng (interquartile range IQR 94 ng) dsDNA of which 0.1% (IQR 0.0%) mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A method (II) based on alkaline extraction–commonly used to extract plasmid DNA and thus designed to extract circular DNA28,30,32,33–yielded median 144 ng (IQR 140 ng) dsDNA with 0.5% (IQR 0.6%) mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Extracting DNA from isolated mitochondria (III)34 yielded median 825 ng (IQR 529 ng) dsDNA with 0.2% (IQR 0.1%) mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>A selective lysis method (IV) that starts with the disruption of the plasma membrane to release the cellular components29,37 followed by sedimentation of cell nuclei, and DNA extracted from the remaining cytosol fraction yielded median 403 ng (IQR 321 ng) dsDNA with 1.0% (IQR 0.8%) mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Note that a similar trend was obtained by these methods using frozen cultured cells as input (Supplementary Figure 1A/B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is evident that the best isolation procedure to extract mtDNA from frozen tumor tissue is method IV–DNA from cytosol fractions–with the highest mtDNA percentage and sufficient dsDNA yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>To increase the mtDNA fraction, we applied an enzymatic exonuclease reaction to degrade specifically linear nDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This greatly increased the percentage of mtDNA in DNA extracts from cytosol fractions, from median 1% (IQR 0.8%) to median 27% (IQR 40%) (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This result was also obtained when using DNA from frozen cultured cells as input material (Supplementary Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Exonuclease treatment on total cellular DNA extracts increased the percentage of mtDNA as well, but not to the same extent as for DNA extracts from cytosol fractions, and total dsDNA yield was lower (Supplementary Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Concluding, the preferred procedure to obtain mtDNA as pure as possible from fresh frozen tumor tissue is to extract DNA from cytosol fractions followed by exonuclease treatment.Figure 1Comparison of methods for mtDNA extraction from fresh frozen tumor specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Cryosections originating from ten frozen tumor specimens (biological replicates) were subjected to different extraction procedures including (I) a total cellular DNA extraction method, (II) a method based on alkaline extraction, (III) a method extracting DNA from isolated mitochondria and (IV) a selective lysis method extracting DNA from cytosol fractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>For each method, the percentage of mtDNA (A) and total amount of dsDNA (B) was quantified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Also, DNA extracts from cytosol fractions originating from ten frozen tumor specimens were subjected to exonuclease-based enrichment and the percentage of mtDNA quantified, with for each specimen the mtDNA percentage before and after treatment connected by lines (C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Next we explored sequencing methods for the detection of mtDNA variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>First, whole genome sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) was applied to total cellular DNA extracts (method I) and DNA extracts from cytosol fractions (method IV), both without and with additional enrichment for mtDNA by exonuclease treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>As expected, the cell line DNA extract from cytosol fraction treated with exonuclease yielded the highest percentage of aligned reads to mtDNA (86%), whereas the other methods yielded much lower percentages (&lt;25%) (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The DNA extract from cytosol fraction treated with exonuclease derived from fresh frozen tumor tissue yielded a percentage of aligned reads to mtDNA in line with the PCR-based mtDNA percentage (respectively 12% and 10%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the relatively high fraction of 10% mtDNA, a major proportion of reads were derived from nuclear DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The observed spread in mtDNA percentage in exonuclease treated method IV extracts from frozen tumor tissue (Fig. 1C) will therefore lead to a variable proportion of mtDNA reads using whole genome SBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To circumvent this variability, we decided to explore a targeted approach for sequencing mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>For this, nine primer sets covering the complete mtDNA were evaluated for their specificity to mtDNA, as in silico BLAST search showed that the primers did not match to known NUMT sequences in the reference genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Specificity of the nine primer sets was confirmed by the absence of PCR products in two mtDNA-depleted cell lines (Supplementary Figure 3), allowing mtDNA-specific sequencing of the nine amplicons using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This method is able to generate long reads, covering each amplicon in a single read. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To obtain an estimate of sequencing output and to evaluate variants detected by the whole genome SBS and targeted SMRT sequencing approaches, we compared for the two approaches the sequencing output of MDA-MB-231 DNA extracts from cytosol fraction treated with exonuclease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Whole genome SBS generated a total of 800,504 reads of 100 nucleotides (of which 87% duplicated reads) and after alignment resulted in an evenly distributed coverage of median 201x (IQR 2, range 13–404). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The 2,727 reads of 1,738–2,836 base pairs by targeted SMRT sequencing displayed more variable coverage among the amplicons with median 282x (IQR 132, range 87–761) (Supplementary Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The more variable coverage in targeted SMRT sequencing was mainly due to regions where amplicons overlapped, causing an increase in coverage (Supplementary Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Both sequencing approaches detected all 29 positions with a documented alternative allele in MDA-MB-231 against rCRS at homoplasmic levels (&gt;99% allele frequency). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Also additional heteroplasmic variants were detected, with no major differences observed between the two sequencing approaches (Supplementary File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Given the lower output in read depth per number of generated reads by whole genome SBS sequencing–due to a loss of reads which map to the nuclear genome–and the risk of introducing NUMTs hampering downstream analysis, we continued sequencing experiments using the targeted SMRT sequencing approach. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To detect low-frequent single-nucleotide variants in mtDNA, we evaluated three approaches: SMRT sequencing, UltraSEEK chemistry and digital PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>As a source of mtDNA we used breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>A total of respectively 29 and 13 variants alternative to rCRS have been documented in the mtDNA of MDA-MB-231 (also see above) and MCF-7, with a total of 28 positions containing a different allele between the two cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>To determine detection limits empirically, we prepared mixtures of the cell lines–considering MDA-MB-231 as the mutant variant–to generate samples with allele frequencies of 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.1%, 1% and 10% variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The mixture samples were subjected to the three detection methods, and we evaluated their ability to detect the mutant variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>By SMRT sequencing, we obtained a median coverage of 4,060x per sample (IQR 4,842x, range 648–34,263x) (see Supplementary Table 2 for coverage per sample per amplicon). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In the 0% variant allele sample (pure MCF-7), we confirmed all 13 positions with an alternative allele against rCRS38 at &gt;95% allele frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>At 5/28 positions known to be different between the two cell lines, heteroplasmic variants were observed in all mixture samples (Supplementary Table 3), prompting us to omit these positions in further analysis for limit of detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Thus, we explored 23 positions by SMRT sequencing and confirmed all variant alleles, with a detection limit of 0.1% for 21 positions and a detection limit of 1% for 2 positions (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The UltraSEEK method employs amplification of the region(s) of interest by PCR and subsequent detection of the variant(s)-of-interest via a single-base extension using chain terminators labeled with a moiety for solid phase capture, allowing enrichment of product, and identification of the product using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>By UltraSEEK, we explored 7 positions and detected all variant alleles at those positions, with a detection limit of 0.1% for 5 positions and a detection limit of 1% for 2 positions (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In digital PCR, a sample is partitioned into many individual parallel probe-based PCR reactions, each reaction contains either one target molecule or none, allowing a “yes” or “no” answer for the target molecule containing the mutant and wildtype allele in each reaction. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In this research, we aimed to develop a sensitive procedure to detect low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA variants from frozen tumor tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In assessing tumor cell characteristics, tissue specimens are an important source to detect tumor-specific variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Especially when the focus is on low-frequent variants, frozen tissue is more suitable than formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue since the latter is prone to deamination artefacts40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>We started by establishing an extraction procedure to obtain mtDNA as pure as possible from frozen tumor tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The optimal method was DNA from cytosol fractions (method IV) treated with exonuclease, and resulted in a 270-fold mtDNA enrichment when compared to total cellular DNA extraction (27% versus 0.1% mtDNA yield, Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The method based on alkaline extraction that is normally applied to extract plasmid DNA has also been described by others for preparation of mtDNA-enriched samples28,30,32,33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In line with the work by Quispe-Tintaya et al.33, we find for frozen cultured cells a good mtDNA enrichment compared to total cellular DNA extraction (158-fold, Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>However, application to frozen tumor tissue resulted in only a 5-fold mtDNA enrichment (Fig. 1) indicating that this method is less suited for frozen specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The method that extracts DNA from isolated mitochondria has also been described by others34, for which we find for frozen cultured cells similar mtDNA enrichment levels compared to total cellular DNA extraction (3-fold, Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>However, again for frozen tumor tissue we observe lower mtDNA enrichment (2-fold, Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Note that, although the alkaline-based and mitochondria-based extraction methods were equivalent, different methods were applied to extract total cellular DNA in the above mentioned studies, and even among silica-based extraction methods mtDNA yield can be different41,42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Importantly, DNA from cytosol fractions either with or without exonuclease treatment compared to total cellular DNA extraction did also show better results for cultured cells (resp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>33-fold and 760-fold enrichment, Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Thus, generally, extraction methods that significantly enrich for mtDNA from frozen cultured cells (and possibly also blood cells) do not guarantee a proper enrichment for mtDNA from frozen tissue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>A high fraction of mtDNA obtained within the DNA extract is vital to minimize the presence of NUMTs, which may lead to misinterpretation of mtDNA variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Due to the variable number of mtDNA molecules per cell and the variable frequency of NUMTs, estimating the potential misinterpretation with NUMTs is difficult and unique for each position in each individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Since the generation of NUMTs is an ongoing process17–19 estimating NUMT frequency is even more difficult for tumor cells since, they contain all private and all somatic NUMT events that have occurred during tumorigenesis and before that time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This is why we have chosen–and recommend–to analyze a mtDNA extract as pure as possible in SMRT sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Exemplifying, in the case of 20x abundance of a NUMT (which is the case for numerous mtDNA regions24) in a cell type with 500 mtDNA molecules, it is possible to misinterpret the NUMT as a mtDNA variant with 8% heteroplasmy (2 × 20/500) in a total cellular DNA extract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Indeed, misinterpretation of non-identical mtDNA and NUMT positions is not a rare event and multiple examples have been highlighted in the literature16,20–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Therefore, obtaining a high mtDNA fraction corresponds to obtaining a high number of mtDNA molecules as opposed to nDNA molecules, decreasing the variant allele frequency of the NUMTs, thus diminishing the likelihood for misinterpretation: a 270-fold increase in mtDNA for the example mentioned above would result in suppressing the NUMT variant to 0.03% heteroplasmy (2 × 20/270 × 500). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>To detect low-frequent variants in mtDNA, we compared three state-of-the-art approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>All three methods–SMRT sequencing, UltraSEEK, digital PCR–obtained 100% sensitivity at 1% variant allele frequency (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Specifically, SMRT shows a sensitivity of 100% at 1% allele frequency, 91% at 0.1% allele frequency and 0% at 0.01% allele frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>SMRT sensitivity mainly depends on the read depth: positions 6221 and 6371 were sequenced less deep and had a detection limit of 1% (Supplementary Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>UltraSEEK shows a sensitivity of 100% at 1% allele frequency, 71% at 0.1% allele frequency and 0% at 0.01% allele frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Digital PCR shows a sensitivity of 100% at 0.1% allele frequency, of 50% at 0.01% allele frequency and 0% at 0.001% allele frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Notably, whereas UltraSEEK and digital PCR are limited to the positions chosen beforehand, the SMRT sequencing approach is able to evaluate the entire mtDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Since to date no mutational hotspot regions have been described for mtDNA in primary tumor specimens12–14, this is a valuable feature to study tumor-specific mtDNA variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>A limitation of all three methods is that they start with PCR amplification, and due to the large variation in mtDNA between and within individuals, primer binding sites can encounter variants that can bias PCR amplification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>A whole genome sequencing method would enable a more unbiased approach, where a DNA sample is fragmented and subsequently sequenced independent of variants present in the sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>However–as shown by our results using whole-genome sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS)–this method requires deeper sequencing since a substantial part of the reads will be derived from nDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>A bioinformatics approach would also be needed to filter reads originating from known NUMTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In addition, the observed spread in mtDNA percentage in DNA extracts from frozen tumor tissue (Fig. 1) will lead to variability in the proportion of mtDNA reads between specimens when using a whole genome sequencing approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>This variability is likely due to biological variability in the number of mtDNA molecules within a cell or biochemical differences (e.g. fat or stromal content) between specimens, or due to technical variability in the multiplex qPCR assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Samples with an extreme high mtDNA:nDNA ratio (and thus those greatly enriched for mtDNA) will have their mtDNA Ct value at the upper end whereas the nDNA Ct will be at the lower end, making the ratio estimation more variable because Ct estimations are less reliable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Also, the observed number of duplicated reads in SBS (87%) is within the expected range for single-end sequencing of the mitochondrial genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Due to its small size, it contains only 16,569 starting positions for the 776,959 generated reads (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>When no variants or sequencing errors would be present within the reads, this would result in 97.9% of the reads appearing as duplicate reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>One could also use a targeted approach prior to SBS sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Amplification of the complete mitochondrial genome in a single amplicon has been applied in SBS approaches, obtaining an error rate of 0.33% at a read depth of 20,000x43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Sequencing such an amplicon by SMRT is not feasible with the current chemistry, since it would require a read length &gt;80,000 base pairs (5 passes of ~16,569 base pairs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Our targeted approach to amplify mtDNA by primer sets to generate amplicons between 1,700 base pairs and 3,000 base pairs does allow for high quality SMRT reads (≥5 passes to create a consensus sequence, minimizing sequencing errors) covering the complete amplicon, and simultaneously minimizes the risk of NUMT amplification (87% of known NUMTs are mtDNA fragments ≤1,500 base pairs22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In addition, the used primer sets did not generate an amplification product in mtDNA-depleted counterparts of two cell lines (Supplementary Figure 3) nor products by in silico BLAST, affirming that known NUMTs are unlikely to interfere. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>A drawback is that template amplification by PCR can introduce errors that may result in false positive calls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>To decrease this, the PCR used a high fidelity polymerase (error rate of ~10−7) and the number of PCR cycles was limited (15 + 5 cycli). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>This would theoretically mean that 98.5–97.5% of the generated products per amplicon are entirely error-free, or that each product contains 0.02 random errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>By setting alternative allelic calls to at least 5 independent high-quality reads we intent to minimize calling PCR errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>An alternative would be to employ molecular barcodes prior to PCR amplification, which will allow tracing PCR duplicates and thus yield more confident calls of the original molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Note that five of the de novo variants detected by SMRT present in only a single sample appeared on two amplicons and are thus independent observations and unlikely to be PCR errors (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>For the de novo variants that appear in only one sample on one amplicon (n = 16) we cannot rule out that they are not PCR errors, despite their phasing with a particular genotype (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>All those were low-frequent variants (allele frequency between 0.03% and 0.34%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Thus, given the 100% sensitivity at 1% allele frequency, the SMRT approach is able to call variants reliable ≥1% allele frequency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>To ascertain that variants below 1% allele frequency are true variants, validation is necessary by either independent re-sequencing (an additional sample, or in some cases in overlapping regions of amplicons within the same sample) or an orthogonal method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Both UltraSEEK and digital PCR prove suitable as orthogonal methods to confirm allelic calls, since they are both able to detect low-frequent variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Analysis by UltraSEEK can be performed in multiplex (up to hundreds): the region(s) of interest are PCR amplified and subsequently the variant(s)-of-interest are detected via a single-base extension using chain terminators labeled with a moiety for solid phase capture, enrichment of product, and identification using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>However, both UltraSEEK and digital PCR are not suitable for de novo variant detection because they do need information on the variants-of-interest beforehand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Also, primer design has to be done for each variant separately, which can be limiting due to design constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of UltraSEEK mainly depends on the number of molecules analyzed, where 3 variant copies would suffice for detection (corresponding to at least 3,000 total copies for a 0.1% allele frequency). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Analysis by digital PCR can be performed in multiplex (up to 4–8), with for each DNA molecule the region of interest is PCR-amplified and subsequently detected by specific probes on the variant-of-interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Also in here, sensitivity mainly depends on the number of input molecules (minimal 2 variant copies of ≤20,000 total copies). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The SMRT sequencing approach is as performant in terms of sensitivity (dependent on minimal 5 alternative reads) compared to these two methods, but is not limited to the necessity of knowing positions of variants-of-interest beforehand. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>To conclude, our sensitive procedure to detect low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA variants from frozen tumor tissue is based on the extraction of DNA from cytosol fractions followed by exonuclease treatment to obtain high mtDNA yield, and subsequent SMRT sequencing for (de novo) detection and allelic phasing of variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Orthogonal validation of variants can be done by either UltraSEEK (in the case of numerous variants) or digital PCR (in the case of a few variants). </plain></SENT>
