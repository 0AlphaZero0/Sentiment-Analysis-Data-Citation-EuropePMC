<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Intestine Chip, the epithelium forms villi-like projections lined by polarized epithelial cells that undergo multi-lineage differentiation similar to that of intestinal organoids, however, these cells expose their apical surfaces to an open lumen and interface with endothelium. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The small intestine is the major site for digestion, drug and nutrient absorption, interaction with commensal microbiome, and development of mucosal immunity, as well as a primary site for many diseases, such as bacterial, viral and parasitic infections and inflammatory bowel disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the lack of human-relevant responses has rendered many animal models unsuitable to study causal factors and treatment strategies for human intestinal infections and disorders1, three-dimensional (3D) human tissue surrogates, such as intestinal organoids (also known as enteroids) have emerged as promising alternatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These spheroidal ex vivo tissue cultures include Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells2 and are grown embedded within a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) gel (Matrigel) with Wnt3a, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Noggin and R-spondin 1 (collectively, WENR) to support their indefinite propagation3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Organoids faithfully recapitulate the cellular diversity of the intestinal epithelium and are ideally suited for in situ visualization and continuous monitoring of epithelial development and differentiation4–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of an enclosed lumen is non-physiological, as secreted material from goblet, enteroendocrine and Paneth cells, as well as shed apoptotic cells, accumulate within this central space instead of being removed through peristalsis and luminal flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, the inaccessibility of apical cell surface renders the use of organoids experimentally challenging for transport studies as well as exposure to living commensal microbiome or pathogenic bacteria for more than approximately one day in culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Finally, organoid cultures lack a tissue-tissue interface, mechanical forces (fluid flow and peristalsis-like motions), immune cells, and a vascular compartment, which are all key contributors to normal intestinal physiology and disease development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, there still remains a compelling need for more complex and physiologically relevant intestinal organ culture systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One alternative approach involves the use of 2-channel Organs-on-Chips (Organ Chips), which are microfluidic cell culture devices that contain two parallel hollow culture chambers lined by living human cells and separated by a porous ECM-coated membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These chips recapitulate normal tissue-tissue interfaces and mimic the complex physical and biochemical microenvironment of living human organs9–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This technology has been previously applied to develop human Gut Chips that emulate many features of human intestinal structure and function, however, these studies utilized established human intestinal cell lines, such as Caco-2 or HT-29 cells19–21,24, which were originally isolated from tumor samples and they harbor multiple gene mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In these studies, the intestinal cells also were either cultured alone or in the presence of a non-specialized endothelium (e.g., human umbilical vein endothelial cells)21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, these human Gut Chips may not fully recapitulate normal human intestinal functions, and they would be inappropriate to use to study human conditions where genome fidelity is important (e.g., intestinal cancer, drug development, etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Other investigators have engineered in vitro intestine models using fetal intestinal tissue explants, but these progressively deteriorate after 24 h of culture25,26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the present study, we set out to develop a primary human Small Intestine Chip (Intestine Chip) using an approach that combines two of the most advanced tissue engineering technologies: intestinal organoids3,4,27 and Organ Chips9,10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The Intestine Chip contains normal human intestinal epithelial cells derived from organoids established from endoscopic biopsies or tissue resections of living human intestine, and intestinal tissue-specific microvascular endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This microengineered environment recapitulates many key anatomical and functional features of its in vivo small intestine counterpart including 3D intestinal villi-like structures, multi-lineage differentiation, epithelial barrier function, enzymatic activity of brush border enzyme and mucus production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the transcriptome of the primary Intestine Chip more closely resembles that of adult human duodenum in vivo than the organoids that were used to plate the chips or other currently available intestinal cell culture models, including our previous Caco-2 Gut Chip, especially with regard to expression of genes relating to digestion, response to nutrients, cell proliferation, and host defense response to infection. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We set out to create an Organ Chip-based surrogate of the human small intestine that incorporates biopsy-derived epithelium, intestinal endothelial cells, physiological fluid flow and peristalsis-like mechanical motions that would allow analysis of human intestinal physiology and pathophysiology in a more in vivo-relevant culture microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, we first established organoid cultures using intestinal crypts derived from macroscopically normal regions of human intestinal endoscopic biopsies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Once the organoids matured (after 5 to 25 passages in culture), we then released organoid fragments through enzymatic treatment and finally seeded these fragments on the upper surface of the ECM-coated porous membrane of a microfluidic Organ Chip (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip devices we used contain two parallel, cell culture microchannels: an upper ‘epithelial’ channel (1 mm high × 1 mm wide) and a lower ‘vascular’ channel (0.2 mm high x 1 mm wide) separated by a thin (50 μm) flexible PDMS membrane containing multiple pores (7 μm diameter, 40 μm spacing) coated with ECM (type I collagen and Matrigel) (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Each microchannel has a dedicated inlet and outlet for the inoculation of human cells, molecules or microbes as well as for the precise control of physicochemical parameters through the perfusion of laminar flow of appropriate culture medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Dedicated outlets provide means to collect effluents from the individual chambers for downstream characterization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The upper epithelial channel and lower vascular channel are surrounded on either side by two hollow (1 mm high × 300 µm wide) chambers that permit application of cyclic suction to mechanically stretch and relax the sidewalls, as well as the attached flexible PDMS membrane and adherent tissues in the central channel, thereby emulating peristaltic motions of a living human small intestine.Figure 1Fabrication of the primary human Intestine Chip. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The membrane is elastic and can be extended and retracted by the application of cyclic vacuum to the hollow side chambers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This actuation causes outward deflection of the vertical side walls and lateral extension of the attached horizontal, porous elastic membrane, which induces mechanical deformation of the adherent tissue layers cultured in the central channels. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To obtain primary human intestinal epithelial cells, we utilized a previously published cell culture model based on 3D propagation of human intestinal crypts containing functional stem cells to create a bank of organoids derived from normal duodenal endoscopic biopsies or surgical specimens3,4,28. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Duodenal organoids cultured for 3–5 days after passaging in expansion medium (EM) were dissociated into fragments and plated in the epithelial channel of the microfluidic devices (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Organoids from the duodenal region of the small intestine were used in this study because they display higher culture efficiency than those formed from ileum or jejunum, as previously described28. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We first cultured the organoid fragment-derived intestinal epithelial cells alone (without endothelium) in the upper channel, while perfusing both channels with epithelial expansion medium (EM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The large majority of cells initially appeared spread individually across the surface of the porous membrane at the start of the experiment and progressively grew to form a continuous epithelium that underwent villus morphogenesis over 8–12 days (Supplementary Fig. S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This resulted in formation of a well-developed intestinal epithelium with a high density of finger-shaped, villus-like protrusions (~30/cm2) along the entire length of the upper channel by 12 days of culture, as detected by phase contrast (Supplementary Fig. S1b), differential interference contrast (DIC) (Fig. 2a), and 3D confocal microscopy (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence staining of the intestinal epithelium for Ki67 and mucin 5AC (Muc5AC) confirmed the presence of proliferative Ki67-positive cells, which were limited to basal regions of the villi-like structures in close proximity to the PDMS membrane (Fig. 2c), whereas mucin-producing cells were present primarily along the apical regions of the villi-like structures (Fig. 2d), as is observed in living intestine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Computerized image analysis revealed that these villus-like structures were significantly more elongated than the more spherical organoids from which they were derived, with the villi-like structures exhibiting average major and minor axes of 232 ± 17 and 122 ± 7 μm (mean ± SEM) compared to 256 ± 13 and 220 ± 11 μm for the organoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In the course of these studies, we also found that more effective epithelial cell seeding and efficient monolayer formation can be achieved if organoid fragments are used, as single cell suspensions (produced using longer enzymatic dissociation times) do not expand as efficiently to develop a functional intestinal epithelial barrier (Fig. 3a), and whole organoids remain in their cystic spherical form and thus, never form a continuous monolayer (data not shown).Figure 2Morphological analysis of Organ Chips lined by primary duodenal organoid-derived epithelial cells in the absence of endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>All chips were maintained for 1 or 12 days under continuous apical fluid flow of expansion (day 1–8) and differentiation media (day 9–12) and basal perfusion of EGM2-MV medium. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Note the presence of villi-like structures across the entire length of the channel. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To create an organ-level model of the human intestine containing a tissue-tissue interface, fragments released from intestinal organoids were seeded on the top of the ECM-coated PDMS membrane, while primary human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs) were plated on the bottom surface of the same membrane in the lower ‘microvascular’ channel; control studies were carried out with epithelium alone in the absence of HIMECs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>To maintain the viability and growth of the HIMECs, we perfused endothelial cell medium (EGM2-MV) through the bottom channel while EM was flowed through the top. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>These studies revealed that cultures that included HIMECs in the microvascular channel required less time to form a confluent epithelium in the upper channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Organoid fragments achieved confluency within 6 days when seeded alone, while in the presence of endothelium they only required 2 days of co-culture (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The presence of HIMECs also did not compromise barrier function and possibly enhanced it to a slight degree: with or without HIMEC, the Papp was sustained at 1–2 × 10−6 cm s−1 for up to 12 days of culture (with 8 days of perfusion of EM, followed by 4 days of differentiation (DM) through the upper channel, while EGM2-MV was flowed through the lower channel) (Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>After that time, we detected cells that were shed and removed by the fluid flow, as expected from the fast turnover of human intestinal epithelium in which mature enterocytes are shed from the gut lining every 3–5 days29,30. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The Intestine Chip recapitulates important structural features and functions of the native duodenum, including formation of elongated villi-like structures lined by a polarized epithelium expressing markers of enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells and Paneth cells, as well as basal proliferative cells, strong barrier function, brush border digestive enzyme activity, and continuous accessibility to fluids flowing through the apical lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>This Organ Chip technology differs substantially from past in vitro microfluidic models of human intestine, including a microfluidic human Gut Chip20,21,39, as it incorporates the use of primary intestinal epithelium isolated from individual patient biopsy-derived organoids as well as gut-specific microvascular endothelial cells; it also support formation of villus-like structures without requiring use of a micropatterned villus-shaped scaffold40,41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the villi-like projections formed in the Intestine Chip do not exhibit the strict villus/crypt compartmentalization present in native human intestine; however, further improvement could be induced through application of chemical gradients of growth factors (e.g., Wnt-3A, R-spondin and noggin) to the basal-luminal axis or by incorporation of pericryptal mesenchymal cells that secrete factors which are essential for maintenance of intestinal stem cells (e.g., Wnt2b, R-spondin1, and Gremlin1)40–43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which these villi-like structures form under flow conditions remains unclear; however, recent findings with the human Gut Chip lined by Caco2 cells suggests that intestinal epithelial cells can establish their own a transepithelial gradient of a Wnt antagonist when cultured under flow, which contributes to this response (Kim et al., unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The vascularized Organ Chip design we utilized enables application of physiologically relevant mechanical cues, including luminal fluid flow within both the epithelial and vascular channels that is critical for formation of villus-like structures, as well as peristalsis-like cyclic deformations, in addition to providing precise independent control over the chemical composition of culture medium in each channel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The ability to collect effluents of the two separate channels independently also enables dynamic sampling and analysis of biochemical compounds that are produced or secreted by the intestinal epithelial cells or endothelial cells, such as inflammatory cytokines or metabolic products, which is not possible with conventional organoid cultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Additionally, intestinal epithelial cells grown within Organ Chips could be exposed from the apical side to pathogens, or co-cultured with commensal microbes to model enteric infection or the natural microbiome, as previously demonstrated with the Caco-2 Gut Chip19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The presence of the endothelium-lined microchannel (which is absent in organoid cultures) also can enable analysis of absorption of nutrients or oral drug absorption and their bioavailability, as well as characterization of physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic parameters because they are significantly influenced by the passage of drug compounds back and forth across the endothelial-parenchymal tissue-tissue interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of the endothelium permits analysis of the contributions of circulating immune cells that may be recruited under physiological flow conditions within microfluidic Organ Chips, as demonstrated in previous studies11,21,44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, our head-to-head transcriptomic comparison of the Intestine Chip organoids used to supply the cells for the chips revealed that the Intestine Chip more closely mimics living duodenum, and that it better recapitulates many key functions of the living small intestine, including host defense response to infection, cell proliferation, digestion, and response to nutrients, than do the duodenal organoids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings suggest that while organoids may be an outstanding tool to study and probe intestinal stem cell differentiation and histogenesis, they are limited in comparison to the Organ Chip technology when it comes to studying organ-level functions and pathophysiology, particularly in relation to mechanobiology, immunology, infectious disease and drug development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ability to create Chips from individual donors as demonstrated in this study opens the possibility of creating Intestine Chips lined by cells from individuals with specific genotypic and disease-related phenotypic characteristics. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this organ-level synthetic biology approach permits one to gain insight into mechanisms of biological regulation by manipulating potential contributing physical factors (e.g., flow, peristalsis) and cellular components separately while simultaneously providing a window on molecular-scale biochemical, genetic and cellular responses in real-time. </plain></SENT>
