<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Notably, targeted pathway inhibition has shown clinical success particularly in HH‐driven basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma.1, 2 However, rapid and frequent development of resistance to HH inhibitors urgently calls for additional treatment options.3 Canonical HH/GLI signaling is initiated by the binding of secreted HH protein to Patched (PTCH), a transmembrane domain protein that represses HH signaling in its unliganded state by inhibiting the ciliary localization and activation of the essential HH effector Smoothened (SMO). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Binding of HH to PTCH allows the translocation of SMO into the primary cilium, where activated SMO triggers the formation of active GLI transcription factors (GLI2 and GLI3) by preventing proteolytic GLI repressor formation and by releasing them from their repressor Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) (for reviews, see Refs.4, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Active full‐length GLI proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they induce HH target gene expression including the strong transcriptional activator GLI1 that not only amplifies HH signal strength but whose expression level also serves as robust readout for HH/GLI pathway activation.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Active GLI proteins drive tumor formation and promote cancer progression by inducing proliferation, survival, self‐renewal and metastasis.7, 8 To target oncogenic HH/GLI signaling, small molecule SMO inhibitors (SMOi) have been developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Vismodegib and sonidegib represent two FDA‐approved SMOi for the treatment of advanced and metastatic BCC, a nonmelanoma skin cancer driven by aberrant activation of HH/GLI signaling.1, 9 Despite striking therapeutic efficacy, severe side effects of SMOi drugs and frequent development of SMOi resistance pose major challenges to future HH pathway inhibitor therapies.3, 10, 11 Therefore, the identification of targets and drugs to be used in combination or as an alternative to SMOi, particularly in settings of SMOi‐resistance, is critical to improve anti‐HH‐therapies in oncology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Targeting epigenetic regulators such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) has proven a successful therapeutic option in several malignancies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, HDACs have been shown to modulate the activity of HH/GLI signaling with evidence for both a positive and repressive impact, demanding selective inhibition of HDACs, which enhance oncogenic HH/GLI signaling.12, 13, 14, 15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In this study, we show that the clinically suitable class I HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) 4SC‐202 efficiently abrogates HH/GLI signaling in a human model of oncogenic HH/GLI signaling. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>4SC‐202 is a novel small‐molecule inhibitor selectively targeting class I HDACs 1/2/3 and the lysine‐specific demethylase LSD1.17 Notably, 4SC‐202 has shown excellent safety and promising anti‐leukemic activity in a recent phase I clinical trial (see TOPAS study at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> trial no. NCT01344707 and J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To analyze whether 4SC‐202 affects HH/GLI signaling, we first treated Sonic Hh stimulated murine Hh/Gli luciferase reporter cells with 4SC‐202 and found that 4SC‐202 strongly repressed Gli activity with an IC50 of ∼50 nM (Fig. 1 a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To address the relevance of this finding to physiological HH/GLI signaling in a human context, we used HH responsive human medulloblastoma cells (i.e., Daoy) as a human model of canonical HH/GLI signaling in cancer cells.18 Daoy cells and NIH/3T3 express robust levels of HDAC1/2/3 (Figs. 1 b and 1 c) and activation of HH signaling by Smoothened agonist SAG induces HH target genes (e.g. GLI1 and HHIP) at the mRNA and protein level.18 Notably, 4SC‐202 treatment efficiently repressed SAG‐induced GLI1 (Fig. 1 d) and HHIP (Fig. 1 e) expression with an IC50 of ∼240 nM and ∼140 nM, respectively, without affecting primary cilia formation, an essential process for the coordination of HH/GLI signal activation (Supporting Information, Fig. 1).19 Analysis of GLI1 protein expression confirmed the concentration‐dependent repressive effect of 4SC‐202 on HH/GLI signaling (Figs. 1 f and 1 g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>RNAi‐mediated inhibition of individual class I HDACs in Daoy cells suggests a dominant role for HDAC3, though the repressive effect on HH target gene activation was less pronounced when compared to 4SC‐202 treatment, most likely due to functional redundancy of class I HDACs (Supporting Information, Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, and in line with the proliferative role of HH/GLI in medulloblastoma, 4SC‐202 treatment also reduced the growth of SAG‐stimulated Daoy cells (Fig. 1 h). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether 4SC‐202 represses HH/GLI by inhibiting LSD1, we first tested the potent LSD1 inhibitor OG‐L00220 on SAG‐stimulated Daoy cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 2 b, OG‐L002 only moderately repressed SAG‐induced HH signaling to 75% of controls as monitored by GLI1 mRNA expression analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that the repressive effect of 4SC‐202 on HH/GLI signaling does not involve inhibition of LSD1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>To further support the requirement of class I HDACs in HH/GLI signaling, we treated SAG‐stimulated Daoy cells with the selective HDAC1/2/3 inhibitor entinostat.21 Similar to 4SC‐202, entinostat effectively reduced GLI1 and HHIP expression in a concentration‐dependent manner (Figs. 2 d and 2 e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>By contrast, treatment with the FDA‐approved pan‐HDAC inhibitor SAHA (vorinostat) was unable to efficiently abrogate HH/GLI signaling (Fig. 2 f), which may be a consequence of targeting HDAC6, whose inhibition has been shown to promote ciliogenesis and HH signaling.14 Together, we conclude that 4SC‐202 represses HH/GLI signaling by blocking class I HDACs, in line with a recent report identifying HDAC1/2 as important positive effectors of HH/GLI signaling in a murine model of medulloblastoma.15 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>SMOi provide clear clinical benefit to BCC patients, though rapid development of SMOi resistance and a priori insensitivity to SMO antagonists limit the therapeutic efficacy of SMO targeting.11 The lack of efficacy can, at least in part, be attributed to the many possibilities of malignant cells to activate GLI transcription factors in a noncanonical (SMO‐independent) manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Examples for potent noncanonical and SMO‐independent GLI activator signals include TGFβ, RAS, MAPK/ERK, DYRKs, PI3K/AKT, EWS‐FLI1 and others.5, 23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identify the potent and clinically suitable class I HDACi, 4SC‐202, as novel inhibitor of HH/GLI signaling in human cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Importantly, 4SC‐202 but not the FDA‐approved inhibitor vismodegib, efficiently abrogated HH/GLI signaling in SUFU‐depleted human medulloblastoma cells resistant to SMOi‐therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The SMO‐independent mode of action of 4SC‐202 may lead to benefits for patients, who do not qualify for therapy with SMOi either due to acquired or a priori SMOi resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of GLI transcription factors is also an attractive strategy as GLI transcription factors frequently integrate with other oncogenic signaling cascades, thereby contributing to cancer progression and malignant traits of cancer and cancer stem cells.5 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, our results are in agreement with a previous study by Canettieri et al., who showed that acetylation of GLI proteins negatively regulates their DNA‐binding capacity.24 In fact, we found that 4SC‐202 treatment strongly reduced binding of the GLI1 oncogene to the PTCH target promoter despite inducing an active chromatin as evidenced by increased H3K27 acetylation levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In addition, class I HDACs may also act at the level of GLI processing, as we found that 4SC‐202 treatment increased the level of Gli3R in Ptch1‐deficient mouse medulloblastoma cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Whether this is due to increased Gli3 acetylation remains to be addressed in follow‐up studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have also identified interactions between different HDACs and HH/GLI signaling, though with partially different results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Canettieri et al. demonstrated a positive feedforward loop involving upregulation of HDAC1 expression in response to HH/GLI,12 while Dhanyamraju et al. describe a positive role of HDAC6 in the regulation of the mammalian HH pathway.13 By contrast, inhibition of HDAC6 has also been shown to restore primary ciliogenesis, thereby compensating for reduced HH signaling in STK11/LKB1‐depleted cells.14 HDAC6 may therefore exert context‐dependent positive and negative functions in the regulation of the HH/GLI pathway, which may also explain the failure of the FDA‐approved pan‐HDACi SAHA/vorinostat to efficiently inhibit HH/GLI signaling in medulloblastoma cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, analysis of the genetic landscape of SHH subgroup medulloblastoma identified frequent somatic alterations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.25 In light of these findings, our data together with the previous studies by the Canettieri group may provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and guide possible new therapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>The clinical relevance of our findings is further underlined by a recent phase I clinical trial with 4SC‐202, where 18 out of 24 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies went into follow up treatment, one patient showed complete response and remained on study medication for &gt;28 months, while another patient had a partial response over a period of 8 months (Clinical trial: NCT01344707, poster J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Although it is unclear whether the promising clinical response to 4SC‐202 treatment was due to inhibition of GLI activity, the results of the present study warrant further clinical evaluation of 4SC‐202 as a treatment for GLI‐dependent cancers including BCC, medulloblastoma and possibly other malignancies with high medical need. </plain></SENT>
