</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>MTC is a malignancy originating from the thyroid parafollicular cells (C cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Although MTC only accounts for 3% to 8% of all thyroid cancers,[1,2] it represents up to 13.4% of thyroid cancer-related deaths.[3] C cell is the endocrinal cell that originates in the spinal cord, namely amine precursor uptake decarboxylation cell, which secretes 5-serotonin, histamine, prostaglandins, and adrenocorticotropic hormone like substances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Thus, results in painless intractable diarrhea, bone pain, facial flushing, and other endocrinal symptoms in a portion of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Some reports[2,5] exhibited diarrhea as a relatively specific clinical manifestation of MTC, and could reflect the differentiation level of MTC, with better prognosis for patient's having diarrhea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>MTC can be classified as sporadic or familial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Domestic data show that MTC cases are mainly sporadic and no familial types have been found in China, even though familial MTCs account for 20% of total MTC cases, as reported by foreign studies.[6] MTC is a multiple endocrinal carcinoma that mainly manifests as multiple bilateral lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Serum calcitonin has been universally regarded as a sensitive and specific marker for MTC, which is of great significance for the early diagnosis, assessment of efficacy and residual reoccurrence and metastases, and postoperative observations in MTC cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Some studies[7–9] reported that an increased level of calcitonin was correlated with poor prognosis of MTC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In our case, the patient had no familial history and only suffered from unilateral lesions; therefore, it is likely that this was sporadic MTC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>After the surgery, regular calcitonin monitoring was not achieved for this patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Within 1 year of starting treatment, she started to suffer from painless diarrhea and a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome was made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Antidiarrheal medications such as diosmectite were administered by an outside hospital, and this interfered with the calcitonin monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Then, we prescribed apatinib for antitumor treatment, and symptoms of diarrhea disappeared 2 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>According to previous studies,[2,5] MTC patients may experience painless intractable diarrhea, bone pain, facial flushing, and other endocrine symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>However, diarrhea can reflect the differentiation of MTC; therefore, we considered the symptoms of diarrhea as endocrine symptoms caused by the reoccurrence of MTC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In terms of treatment, for patients with persistent or recurrent MTC, chemotherapy should not be the first-line option owing to the low response rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>For MTC patients with significant tumor nidi, obvious symptoms, or progressive metastatic nidi, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that suppress rearranged during transfection (RET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) are considered to be the first-choice systemic therapeutic approaches.[10,11] From the perspective of clinical features, it is concluded that MTC was robustly invasive and susceptible to the metastasis occurring in the early stages via lymphatic and vascular transportation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of angiogenesis plays an important role in metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry results from a study[12] displayed that VEGFA, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were overexpressed in &gt;90% of MTC patients, indicating the essential role of VEGFR transactivation in rapid tumor growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>VEGFR activates downstream signaling pathways of the network, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, and hence promotes tumor angiogenesis and blood supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Its biological activities include promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and survival, enhancement of endothelial cell migration and invasion, which subsequently increases the vascular permeability, promotes chemotaxis and homing of bone marrow-derived vascular progenitor cells.[13] Therefore, VEGFR-associated angiogenesis remains to be a critical target for molecular-targeted therapy of MTC.[14] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>RET oncogene is another critical target for molecular-targeted therapy of MTC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The mechanism under RET-targeted drug therapy attributes to the signal transduction pathway of RET/PTC-RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated protein kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Blockade of RET mismatched repair and fusion, together with inhibition of transactivation of the rearranged gene in the thyroid follicular cell occurs in this signaling pathway, which leads to the impairment of uncontrolled cell proliferation; or, blockade of epigenetic mutation at specific sites inhibit RET protein aberrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This in turn inhibits tyrosine kinase self-phosphorylation and pathogenesis of MTC from the thyroid parafollicular cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Many new drugs targeting these 2 genes have been developed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="TABLE"><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Multitarget kinase inhibitors used in the treatment of thyroid cancer and their main cellular targets[13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e8704-g005"/></table-wrap></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>According to the 2013 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for thyroid carcinoma,[15] targeted therapy with cabozantinib or vandetanib is the type I recommendation for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic MTC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Vandetanib is a nonspecific TKI that specifically targets VEGFR-2, EGFR, and RET, and is approved by Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced MTC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Cabozantinib is also a TKI that targets VEGFR-2 and MET, but had higher affinity to RET than Vandetanib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>However, phase III trials of vandetanib[16] and cabozantinib[17] for MTC have only shown improved progression-free survival, not long-term survival, in MTC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Other trials for drugs targeting MTC (such as sorafenib, axitinib, and motesanib) are still at phase II and lack evidence from phase III trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Since the patient did not have access to vandetanib or cabozantinib and her economic condition did not allow her to receive some of the more expensive therapies, she and her relatives opted for the domestically developed targeted drug apatinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>As an orally administered low-molecular weight VEGFR-targeting TKI recently developed in China, apatinib can effectively inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway, demonstrating a particularly high selectivity for VEGFR-2.[18,19] Apatinib blocks the signal transduction pathway emanated from VEGF binding with the cognate receptor, which thus potently inhibits the tumor angiogenesis, playing an antitumor role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>At higher concentrations, apatinib can also inhibit platelet-derived growth factor receptor, C-KIT, SRC, and other kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies show that apatinib is effective and well-tolerated during treatment of multiple cancers, such as advanced gastric cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and advanced liposarcoma.[19,20] Lin et al[21] have investigated the antitumor activities and mechanisms of apatinib in RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, finding that the KIF5B-RET fusion protein promoted cell invasion and migration, possibly via the Src signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The antitumor effects of apatinib are realized via cytotoxicity and inhibition of the RET/Src signaling pathway, which further inhibit metastasis and invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These results support the potential activity of apatinib for the treatment of KIF5B-RET-driven tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Also, RET gene mutations are believed to be associated with MTC pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Apart from MTC, a team led by Professor Yansong Lin from the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital initiated a phase II trial for apatinib in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in early 2016.[22] Ten patients were enrolled in the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Rapid and conspicuous efficacy was observed after treatment with apatinib in the findings of serology, CT imaging, and tumor metabolic characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>After 2-week treatment with apatinib, Tg reduction reached up to 70% in majority (80%) of the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Their results showed that 90% of the patients showed PR after 8 weeks of treatment, achieving a superior short-term remission rate compared with the results of previously reported studies on sorafenib or levitinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>This result has further indicated the application prospects of apatinib in radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>A national multicenter phase III clinical register study by Professor Yansong Lin's group is currently ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03048877). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Also a newly paper shows that apatinib also has a good effect on osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastases and may be related to the rich vascular supply of osteosarcoma.[23] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In terms of adverse events, milder adverse events have been observed with apatinib compared with other targeted drugs, which may be because of its high selectivity for VEGFR-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>These adverse events mainly include hypertension, proteinuria, hand–foot syndrome, and increased bleeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In our case, adverse events related to the use of apatinib were systemic migrating bone and joint pains and grade II hypertension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>For systemic migrating bone and joint pains, we conducted a total-body bone scan but observed no metastases to the bone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In addition, all of the autoimmune indicators were normal once the pain was relieved after discontinuing apatinib. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>We later administered oral celecoxib in combination with apatinib to the patient, and her pain was then tolerable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Thus, we considered these symptoms to be adverse effects of apatinib, even though bone pain has not been previously reported as an adverse event. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Our follow-up duration for this patient was rather short, and more cases and continuous follow-up are needed to further identify the efficacy and side effects of apatinib in the treatment of MTC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, neither the patient nor her family underwent genetic testing for RET because of economic considerations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we still infer that the roles of apatinib in MTC involve antiangiogenesis and genetic inhibition of dysfunctional RET signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>We believe that more patients will benefit from the use of apatinib if future basic studies and clinical trials can further determine the therapeutic mechanisms and indications of apatinib for MTC. </plain></SENT>
