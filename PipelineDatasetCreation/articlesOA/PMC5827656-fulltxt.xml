Previous study has indicated that Nestin-positive progenitor cells differentiate into microglia and replenish the brain after depleting most brain microglia. Microglia have also shown the capacity to repopulate the retina after eliminating all retinal microglia. However, the origin(s) of repopulated retinal microglia is/are unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the origins of repopulated microglia in the retina. Interestingly, we find that repopulated retinal microglia are not derived from Nestin-positive progenitor cells. Instead, they have two origins: the center-emerging microglia are derived from residual microglia in the optic nerve and the periphery-emerging microglia are derived from macrophages in the ciliary body/iris. Therefore, we have for the first time identified the extra-retinal origins of microglia in the adult mammalian retina by using a model of microglial repopulation, which may shed light on the target exploration of therapeutic interventions for retinal degenerative disorders.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cell regeneration is relatively slow in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Though new neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can be generated during adulthood, neurogenesis and gliogenesis are relatively slow in the mammalian CNS due to the complicated regulations of intrinsic properties and extracellular environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Once the CNS get injured, the insulted cells cannot be repaired to the normal situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, the consequences of CNS degeneration are permanent and irreversible, making it critical to understand the cell regeneration in CNS for regenerative medicine design.</p><p id="Par3">Microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes in the CNS, which play important roles in the development, homeostasis and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In the traditional understanding, there are no microglial progenitor cells in the CNS, and microglia maintain their population through self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, this notion has been challenged by a recent study that latent Nestin-positive cells in the brain are able to differentiate into microglia and repopulate the whole brain after pharmacological depletion of most resident microglia (~99%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. As an important part of the CNS, the regenerative capacity is largely limited in the adult mammalian retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although a few cells are sporadically regenerated in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, no massive cell regeneration had been observed. Therefore, whether microglia can regenerate in the retina is unknown. If newly formed microglia can repopulate the whole retina after elimination of retinal microglia, it would be the first time observing a robust and massive cell regeneration in the retina. Furthermore, if repopulated retinal microglia are derived from the latent progenitor cell(s) as those in the brain, it will be the first definitive evidence that uncovers the progenitor or stem cell(s) in the adult mammalian retina. More importantly, it also provides insight into a novel target of therapeutic interventions for retinal degenerative disorders.</p><p id="Par4">To this end, we first investigated the origin of repopulated microglia in the retina. New microglia were found to emerge and replenish the entire retina after elimination of all the resident microglia in the retina. Intriguingly, our fate mapping results demonstrated that Nestin-positive cells were not the precursor cells of repopulated retinal microglia, different from repopulated brain microglia. In contrast, repopulated retinal microglia have two populations of distinct origins: the majority of center-emerging microglia and the minority of periphery-emerging microglia. The center-emerging microglia were solely derived from residual microglia in the optic nerve, whereas the periphery-emerging microglia were derived from macrophages in the ciliary body/iris.</p><p id="Par5">Therefore, by using the microglial repopulation model, we for the first time observed a robust and massive cell regeneration in the adult mammalian retina.

Due to the lack of progenitor/stem cells, no robust and massive cell regeneration has been observed in the adult mammalian retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, whether microglia can regenerate is largely unknown. To address this question, we first treated adult Cx3cr1<sup>+/GFP</sup> mice with PLX5622 for 14 days to eliminate all retinal microglia. Then we replaced PLX5622 formulated diet by AIN-76A control diet (CD) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). We found that repopulated microglia began to emerge in the central retina near the optic nerve head (ONH) at day 5 of recovery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Then center-emerging microglia primarily relocated in the retina in a center-to-periphery manner (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Microglial cell numbers significantly increased in the OPL of the middle peripheral retina (50% eccentricity) at day 14-60 of repopulation (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for day 14 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001 for day 21 and 60), but the densities of repopulated microglia were still lower than resident microglia in na&#x000ef;ve retinas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

A small number of microglia sporadically appeared in the peripheral retina at day 7 of repopulation (7 out of 12 retinas) and became evident by day 10 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Out of 12 retinas, 5 were apparently demarcated by 2 populations of microglia at day 14 of repopulation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>). The morphology of periphery-emerging microglia was less ramified than that of center-emerging cell (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>). The less ramified microglia can still be observed in the peripheral retina at day 60 of microglial repopulation (3 out of 6 retinas). These results suggest that, unlike the transient-lasting blood-borne microglia/macrophages found in the diseased CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, the periphery-emerging microglia in the retina are long-lasting cells in the retina. Converging evidence of distinct emerging sites, disparate distributions and diverse morphologies suggests that center and periphery-emerging microglia have different cellular origins. In spite of the differences, both populations underwent cell division in the repopulating retina (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>).

We thus asked whether microglial repopulation in the retina shared the same origin. To this end, we crossed the Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice, in which Nestin-positive cells express the tamoxifen inducible recombinase CreER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, with Ai14 mice for fate mapping. Adult Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup>::Ai14 mice were administered by tamoxifen (150&#x02009;mg per kilogram of body weight) for 4 days to label Nestin-positive cells (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). Since tdTomato expression is induced by the irreversible genome recombination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), Nestin-positive cells and their progenies permanently express tdTomato even if the cell fate changes. We reasoned if the newly formed microglia were derived from Nestin-positive cells, they must be labeled with tdTomato (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>; hypothesis 1).

The evidence thus suggests that the periphery-emerging microglia are not derived from residual microglia. To determine the origin, we first examined the tdTomato expression pattern in macrophages of the ciliary body and iris, the affiliated tissues to the peripheral retina. In the adult Cx3cr1-CreER::Ai14 mice with neonatal tamoxifen treatment, some macrophages did not express tdTomato in the ciliary body and iris (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>; arrow heads), probably due to the 2-month interval in the experimental procedure allowing the turnover of macrophages. We thus hypothesized that the periphery-emerging microglia were derived from ciliary body/iris macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we designed two experiments. First, we applied the tamoxifen administration from day 1 of depletion to day 4 of repopulation to minimize the number of tdTomato-negative macrophages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

Two distinct groups of extra-retinal cells contribute to repopulated microglia. First, the residual microglia in the optic nerve. They migrate to the retina through the optic nerve head. Then they repopulate the retina along the center-to-periphery axis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This center-emerging population constitutes approximately 85% of the repopulated microglia. Second, the macrophages from the ciliary body/iris.

Based on our results, macrophages in the ciliary body can relocate to the peripheral retina and migrate towards the central retina (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Since the ciliary body and iris are tightly connected, macrophages in the iris are possible to migrate to the peripheral retina through the ciliary body (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).

In the diseased retina, the vertical migration of microglia has been observed. For instance, insulted photoreceptors in retinitis pigmentosa attracts microglia in the inner retina to migrate towards the outer retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, the radial migration of microglia (either centrifugally or centripetally) has not been reported in the retina, especially for the long-distance migration. In our study, the center-emerging microglia migrated along the center-to-periphery axis and the periphery-emerging microglia migrated along the periphery-to-center axis. The physiological and pathological roles of the microglial radial migration need to be further elucidated. Furthermore, what signals attract microglia to radially migrate in the retina is unknown. Microglial migration in pathological conditions is triggered by inflammatory signals. However, based on our study, inflammatory response was not detected during the microglial depletion or repopulation period. Therefore, other factors may direct the microglia to migrate. Investigating the underlying mechanism of microglial migration in repopulation will provide new insights on understanding the regulatory principles of microglia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethics statements</title><p id="Par25">All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par26">C57BL/6J, beta-actin-GFP (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)131Osb/LeySopJ, JAX: 006567), Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> (C57BL/6-Tg(Nes-cre/ERT2)KEisc/J, JAX: 016261), Cx3cr1<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> (B6.129P-Cx3cr1tm1Litt/J, JAX: 005582), Cx3cr1-CreER (B6.129P2(C)-Cx3cr1tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Jung/J, JAX: 020940) and Ai14 (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, JAX: 007914) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories.
