<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Though new neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can be generated during adulthood, neurogenesis and gliogenesis are relatively slow in the mammalian CNS due to the complicated regulations of intrinsic properties and extracellular environments3–5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Once the CNS get injured, the insulted cells cannot be repaired to the normal situation4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the consequences of CNS degeneration are permanent and irreversible, making it critical to understand the cell regeneration in CNS for regenerative medicine design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Microglia are resident mononuclear phagocytes in the CNS, which play important roles in the development, homeostasis and diseases6–10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the traditional understanding, there are no microglial progenitor cells in the CNS, and microglia maintain their population through self-renewal11–13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this notion has been challenged by a recent study that latent Nestin-positive cells in the brain are able to differentiate into microglia and repopulate the whole brain after pharmacological depletion of most resident microglia (~99%)14,15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>As an important part of the CNS, the regenerative capacity is largely limited in the adult mammalian retina3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although a few cells are sporadically regenerated in the retina16–19, no massive cell regeneration had been observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Therefore, whether microglia can regenerate in the retina is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>If newly formed microglia can repopulate the whole retina after elimination of retinal microglia, it would be the first time observing a robust and massive cell regeneration in the retina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, if repopulated retinal microglia are derived from the latent progenitor cell(s) as those in the brain, it will be the first definitive evidence that uncovers the progenitor or stem cell(s) in the adult mammalian retina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>More importantly, it also provides insight into a novel target of therapeutic interventions for retinal degenerative disorders. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, our fate mapping results demonstrated that Nestin-positive cells were not the precursor cells of repopulated retinal microglia, different from repopulated brain microglia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>When CSF1R is genetically knocked out or pharmacologically inhibited, brain microglia are largely depleted14,20,21. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we first treated adult Cx3cr1+/GFP mice with PLX5622 for 14 days to eliminate all retinal microglia. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>A small number of microglia sporadically appeared in the peripheral retina at day 7 of repopulation (7 out of 12 retinas) and became evident by day 10 (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Out of 12 retinas, 5 were apparently demarcated by 2 populations of microglia at day 14 of repopulation (Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that, unlike the transient-lasting blood-borne microglia/macrophages found in the diseased CNS33–35, the periphery-emerging microglia in the retina are long-lasting cells in the retina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Converging evidence of distinct emerging sites, disparate distributions and diverse morphologies suggests that center and periphery-emerging microglia have different cellular origins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In spite of the differences, both populations underwent cell division in the repopulating retina (Supplementary Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the residual retinal microglia did not contribute to microglial repopulation in the retina, since all retinal microglia were eliminated before repopulation (Figs. 1-2 and Supplementary Fig. 1-3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Although with different morphologies, both groups of microglia undergo cell division during repopulation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The previous study has indicated that repopulated brain microglia were primarily derived from Nestin-positive progenitor cells14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We thus asked whether microglial repopulation in the retina shared the same origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>To this end, we crossed the Nestin-CreERT2 mice, in which Nestin-positive cells express the tamoxifen inducible recombinase CreER36, with Ai14 mice for fate mapping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Adult Nestin-CreERT2::Ai14 mice were administered by tamoxifen (150 mg per kilogram of body weight) for 4 days to label Nestin-positive cells (Figs. 3a, b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Since tdTomato expression is induced by the irreversible genome recombination (Fig. 3b), Nestin-positive cells and their progenies permanently express tdTomato even if the cell fate changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We reasoned if the newly formed microglia were derived from Nestin-positive cells, they must be labeled with tdTomato (Fig. 3c; hypothesis 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the repopulated microglia should be tdTomato-negative (Fig. 3c; hypothesis 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>We thus removed all retinal microglia in tamoxifen-treated mice, followed by CD administration for 14 days (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, tdTomato was not detected in repopulated retinal microglia (Fig. 3d; n = 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>There is an alternative possibility that the Nestin-positive progenitor cells could be a transient cell type that only emerges in response to the inhibition of CSF1R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>To label the potential transient Nestin-positive progenitor cells (if any), we administered the animals by tamoxifen during the last 4 days of PLX5622 treatment (Fig. 3e). </plain></SENT>
