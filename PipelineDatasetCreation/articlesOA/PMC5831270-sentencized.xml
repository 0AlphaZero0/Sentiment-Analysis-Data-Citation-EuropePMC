<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the most important cereal crop in the world, feeding more than 50% of the human population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In South America, Brazil is the main producer [1], with flooded rice fields accounting for 50% of the total crop area under cultivation in the country [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In flooded rice, the need to maintain adequate water depth throughout most of the crop year characterizes the agricultural system as aquatic in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other aquatic environments, such as lakes, ponds, and swamps, the environmental conditions in flooded rice fields are relatively unstable due to physical and chemical and biological characteristics that vary according to current agricultural practices and water supplies [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The varying physical and chemical properties in this environment could support the growth of microorganisms possessing wide ranges of metabolic plasticity, allowing them to quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Thus, the rice ecosystem may be a prime habitat for microorganisms adapted to fluctuating nutritional levels and oxygen and light availability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria have been previously found in soil samples of rice-alfalfa [5] and rice-wheat cropping [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In these agroecosystems, rice exudates and nutrients from straw incorporation were shown to influence the bacterial community's composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Breidenbach and Conrad [7] found a uniform bacterial composition in soil over the rice growing season, with Proteobacteria being the most highly abundant phylum, while Firmicutes represented the fifth most abundant phylum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Firmicutes were also present in relatively low abundance upon the introduction of a maize rotation into an irrigated rice field [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although these microorganisms are common inhabitants of agriculture soils, the low counts of Firmicutes are intriguing considering that this group contains the classes Bacilli and Clostridia, which are often highly abundant in rice agricultural soils where they decompose plant residues using cellulolytic enzymes [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the researchers observed higher bacterial 16S rRNA abundance in the flooding stage than in drainage stage, which was ascribed to the rice straw that remained in the field [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In the studies mentioned above, the shifts in microbial community structure were governed by environmental factors found in rice fields. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These factors can be related to the input of nutrients from water sources, rice residues, and fertilizers, weather conditions, and crop rotation, highlighting the complex network of elements that govern bacterial structure in this agricultural system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although microbial ecology studies in soil, rhizosphere, and endophytic environments have been previously conducted in rice systems [11–14], the dynamics of bacterial communities in floodwaters from rice fields have not been extensively studied despite the important roles of the floodwaters and microbial communities in rice plant nutrition [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Because microbes can contribute strongly to rice nutrition and production, there is much interest in surveying the microbial communities in this flooded agroecosystem and determining how agricultural practices influence the composition and structure of these communities [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the bacterial community structure and composition in floodwaters associated with vegetative and reproductive stages of rice in order to verify if there is a microbial community related to a particular stage of the rice system. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The 454 amplicon data from bacterial communities sampled from floodwaters from the reproductive (n = 1) and vegetative (n = 1) stages were analyzed using the mothur pipeline (version 1.32.1) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In brief, flowgrams were demultiplexed using the trim.flows command and denoised using the shhh.flows command, which is the mothur implementation of PyroNoise [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In addition, adapters, barcodes, primers, short reads, and reads containing more than eight homopolymer bases were removed from the dataset with trim.seqs command. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Chimeric sequences were flagged and removed from the dataset using the uchime algorithm with the reference=self-flag [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Then, the remaining high quality sequences were taxonomically classified using the Wang method of the classify.seqs command and the Silva reference taxonomy files. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>An 80% confidence score was required for all taxonomic assignments. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Rarefaction curves were calculated using the rarefaction.single command at a genetic distance of 0.03, while the summary.single command was used to compute various community metrics including the Shannon-Wiener (H′) and Simpson indices, the Chao 1 richness estimator [26], which estimates species richness based on the number of rare OTUs detected in each community, and the Abundance Coverage-based Estimator (ACE), which estimates the number of undetected OTUs based on the abundance and distribution of rare OTUs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Prior to computing rarefaction curves and community diversity/richness metrics, the same number of reads (7,348) were subsampled without replacement from each of the libraries for normalization and to prevent differences in library yields from driving differences between the two communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The mothur command Libshuff was used to determine whether the bacterial communities from the vegetative and reproductive stages have the same structure with iters set to 1000. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In general, the abundances of Beijerinckia, Pelomonas, and Rhodoferax were similar in flood waters from both communities; however, the relative abundance of Curvibacter was slightly higher in vegetative stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The abundances of the genera Aeromonas, Bradyrhizobium, Emticicia, Massilia, Methylibium, and Spirosoma were lower and did not differ significantly between vegetative and reproductive stages (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Figure 5 shows a comparative analysis of the twenty-two most abundant bacterial genera detected in the reproductive and vegetative stages of flooded rice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Polynucleobacter (29.5%), Curvibacter (23%), and Rhodoferax (10.3%) represented the most abundant genera in the vegetative stage, while Curvibacter (18.3%), Alcaligenes (11.8%), and Flavobacterium (11.3%) were more abundant in the reproductive stage (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The Shannon-Wiener (H′) index was approximately 25% higher in the water sample collected from the vegetative stage compared to the reproductive stage, suggesting that the vegetative community is richer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Simpson index, which represents the probability that two reads selected at random belong to the same OTU, was higher in the sample collected from the reproductive stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>This finding is probably due in part to the lower richness associated with the reproductive stage, the higher number of rare OTUs found in the vegetative stage, and the overabundance of three genera, Alcaligenes, Curvibacter, and Flavobacterium in the reproductive stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The Chao 1 richness estimator predicted a total of 2,282 OTUs in the vegetative bacterial community (32% more OTUs than what were detected), while 822 OTUs were predicted in the reproductive bacterial community (27% more OTUs than what were detected). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Considering these results, it is clear that a larger number of rare species were associated with water collected from the vegetative stage compared to the reproductive stage (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Reflecting the higher richness and higher numbers of rare OTUs, the rarefaction curve of the vegetative stage did not reach complete saturation considering the number of sequences sampled, indicating that additional OTUs will likely be detected with additional sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, rarefaction curve of the reproductive stage showed stabilization, indicating that the sequencing effort was sufficient to capture the majority of the OTUs associated with this community (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>In flooded rice, the water source used for cultivation is a key component in the management of the crop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Nutrient levels in these water sources can have significant effects on plant nutrition [28] while varying physical and chemical properties in these water sources can also influence the structure, diversity, and taxonomic composition of microbial communities in the floodwaters, which in turn can also profoundly impact plant nutrition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In the rice field plots used for this study, the primary water source contains a high proportion of wastewater input from both urban and agricultural areas [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a variety of chemical elements enter the floodplain and the temporal fluctuations in the abundance and types of chemical elements entering the fields can have strong influences on the microbial community in rice floodwaters [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the water samples retrieved from vegetative and reproductive stages showed variations in physical and chemical parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The abiotic parameters most strongly associated with the vegetative stage were pH, P, and K and in the reproductive stage, the parameters were temperature and turbidity (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Of these parameters, temperature (higher in floodwaters from the reproductive stage) and K (higher in floodwaters from the vegetative stage) differed significantly between the two rice development stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>These results reflect differences in microenvironments between the rice plant-phenological stages that may have affected microbial growth and persistence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Supporting the possible impact of these environmental conditions on bacterial communities, significant differences in community composition were observed between the vegetative and reproductive stages of flooded rice, with the diversity and richness values associated with the vegetative stage exceeding those observed in the reproductive stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Previous research on rice crops reported that the richness and diversity of bacterial communities can change throughout the rice cultivation period in aquatic environments [31–33] and in the soil and rhizosphere environments [34–36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Although previous studies did not elucidate the environmental factors responsible for these changes in community structure, floodwater characteristics, such as pH, temperature, changes in nutrient profiles, and seasonal variations in fertilizer application, have been related to shifts in microbial community structure and composition over crop development [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Additional factors related to plant growth can also cause shifts in microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>For example, Okabe and coworkers [31] determined that plant growth varies with the incidence of sun light, which, in turn, can impact the water temperature and algal growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Higher photosynthesis rates associated with algal proliferation and also plant growth [34] can ultimately lead to increased levels of photosynthates in the water, altering the water pH and potentially altering the bacterial community. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,066 OTUs at 3% dissimilarity were identified in floodwaters collected from the reproductive and vegetative developmental stages of rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In flooded rice systems, the short spacing between the plants, the low depth of the floodwaters (10 cm deep), and soil management regimes can increase the levels of suspended soil particles in the floodwaters [37], which is in contrast to other more static aquatic ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Due to the high turbidity and the presence of soil in the floodwaters, it is expected that bacterial groups associated with soil, such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, will be present in the floodwaters of rice fields, contributing to the total bacterial diversity [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Supporting this hypothesis, the major phyla identified in the floodwaters associated with both developmental stages were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes, while Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria were less frequent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The same phyla were highly abundant in other rice habitats [7], and specifically in water samples collected from flooded rice crops [3, 32, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Proteobacteria (alpha- and beta-subdivision), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were also cited as the major groups of bacteria found in freshwater environments [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In unstable environments, such as rice fields, Proteobacteria may contribute to the growth, development, and physiology of rice plants due to the presence of plant growth-promoting bacteria, which are often able to induce callus in rice and produce phytohormones [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>According to Mhuantong et al. [16], the presence of these bacterial groups in a variety of freshwater ecosystems is related to their metabolic plasticity to decompose an assortment of organic matter. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of several common phyla in floodwaters sampled from both developmental stages, only 88 (4.08%) of the OTUs were common between vegetative and reproductive stages, suggesting that the dynamics of the bacterial communities in floodwaters change throughout the growing season. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>These changes could reflect temporal variations in carbon availability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>For example, in a previous study, Aulakh and coworkers [41] documented higher exudation rates over the course of rice plant development, in which sugars in the exudates were eventually replaced by organic acids in later developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Both sugars and organic acids are essential for bacterial nutrition and contribute to the process of microbial colonization [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when soluble carbon is released into the rhizosphere, microbes in the soil quickly mineralize the available carbon [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Thereby, the amount of root exudates in the soil could affect the relative amounts of carbon and nitrogen available for microbial growth [44], promoting transitions in the size of populations and structure of microbial communities in the rhizosphere [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the composition and quantity of exudates are dynamic in time and space, and therefore it becomes difficult to resolve the role of a single component in the structure of microbial community [46]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The richest bacterial classes found in the vegetative stage were Gammaproteobacteria (276 OTUs), Alphaproteobacteria (237 OTUs), and Betaproteobacteria (211 OTUs), while richness was the highest in Gammaproteobacteria (24 OTUs), followed by Bacilli (46 OTUs) and Clostridia (18 OTUs) during the reproductive stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In flooded plains, the adherence of Betaproteobacteria representatives to particles can play an important role in their transport from the terrestrial environment to floodwater [47], while the rice phyllosphere is greatly colonized by Alphaproteobacteria class [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Thus, Beta- and Alphaproteobacteria represent relevant bacteria groups in the soil whose abundances are strongly linked to carbon supply [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In flooded rice systems, these bacterial groups decompose organic matter derived from rice straw and other fermentable crop residues along with fertilizer where organic molecules (humic substances) can act as an electron donor during microbial respiration [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Gammaproteobacteria were present in high richness and abundance in floodwaters associated with both rice developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Overall, members from the phylum Proteobacteria are often the most abundant freshwater prokaryotes, but Gammaproteobacteria are usually present in low or transient abundances [38], although they were previously found in high amounts in the rice phyllosphere [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that specific environmental factors associated with the rice agroecosystem, such as the source of water used to irrigate the fields and the turbidity of the floodwaters, provided conditions for the survival and persistence of members of this phylum with the entrance of nutrients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This class hosts the genera Escherichia, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas characterized by their metabolic plasticity that can be adapted to varying levels of temperature, oxygen supply, and nutritional requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Hence, members of the class Gammaproteobacteria often dominate microbial assemblages after nutrient enrichment [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In addition, the members of this group contain pathways for degradation of carbohydrates, amino acids, and xenobiotics that may provide competitive advantages under certain ecological condition [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the interaction between Gammaproteobacteria members and rice plants may be beneficial to both parties, with the leaf exudates providing nutrients that support microbial growth and microorganisms assisting better rice yield [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Beijerinckia, Curvibacter, Pelomonas, and Rhodoferax were the four most abundant genera in both stages of the crop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>These bacterial groups are often associated with high availabilities of sugar (e.g., glucose) [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In agricultural and freshwater environments, Beijerinckia are reported as growth promoters in plants [53], while the genomes of Curvibacter spp. often code for large numbers of sugar transporters [54], enhancing its ability to explore nutrients from the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Other genera, such as Pelomonas sp. and Rhodoferax sp., were found in approximately the same proportion in both rice stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Previous rDNA 16S amplicon analysis showed that Rhodoferax spp. are common in diverse freshwater systems [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Some species of the genera Rhodoferax are nitrate-reducers [56], while Pelomonas spp. often code for machinery required for nitrogen fixation (nifH gene) [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Thus, the OTUs assigned to these genera in the current study may contribute to nitrogen flux in flooded rice fields. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the abundance of the genus Polynucleobacter differed significantly in floodwaters from the two life stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Its abundance was significantly higher in the vegetative stage (29.5%) compared to reproductive stage (4.6%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This result could suggest that the OTUs derived from this genus are not well adapted to environmental conditions associated with floodwaters collected from reproductive stage plants. Polynucleobacter members often dominate planktonic freshwater communities [58], where pH, conductivity, and dissolved organic carbon concentration play an important role in colonization [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Also, flagellate grazing and the consumption of low molecular weight substrates are related to the survival of Polynucleobacter in freshwater environments [60, 61]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Rises in temperature can increase the abundance of prokaryotes of the natural communities by enhancing their growth rates [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The abundance of the phylum Firmicutes (5.52%) found in the reproductive stage is consistent with the abundance of this phylum commonly found in the rice fields [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of these spore-forming populations in the reproductive stage may be related to the characteristics of the organic matter available associated with this developmental stage [63] which may vary from straw residues and root residues [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Species belonging to the class Clostridia are able to express enzymes that degrade the cellulose and sugar transport systems to quickly uptake sugars released from plant cell walls [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>In rice field soil, these organisms were responsible for the decomposition of straw residue at 15 and 30°C [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>From this basis, conditions found in reproductive stage such as the high temperature and carbon available to be degraded may have promoted the proliferation of OTUs belonging to Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Rhizodeposition occurs continuously during the lifetime of plants in the form of water soluble exudates, secretions, and plant dead cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>This process contributes as a primary source of energy and nutrients for microbes in the floodwaters [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In future studies, the release of carbon compounds from rice roots should be considered in the investigation of the factors responsible for shaping the structure of the bacterial communities in floodwaters of rice systems [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>With respect to environmental and nutritional conditions during the vegetative stage, approximately 20% of the absorbed photosynthetic carbon is released through rhizodeposition [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Moreover, during the reproductive stage, the plants release lower amounts of carbon compounds in their exudates because they devote the majority of their energy to seed production [68, 69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Breidenbach and Conrad [7] investigated the bacterial community of the soil from rice fields using 16S rDNA amplicon analysis and also profiled the expression level of various taxa throughout the vegetative, reproductive, and maturation stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>According to quantitative PCR, the authors detected elevated bacterial abundances in soil from the reproductive stage, but there were no major differences between the bacterial community compositions during the two growth stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Changes in bacterial abundance between soil collected from the vegetative and reproductive stages were strongly attributed to decreased levels of root exudates by plants nearing maturity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In general, the abundance of bacteria in the soil was dynamic throughout the development of rice plants; however, no microbial taxa appeared to be exclusively associated with a particular stage of development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Heterotrophic microorganisms, which represent a large portion of the rice field microbiome [70, 71], are dependent on carbon substrates for their energy supply. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The vegetative stage (tillering) is the most vigorous growth period of the rice plant [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>As plant biomass and growth increase, intensifications of organic carbon secretions can also occur [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Thus, considering that the higher carbon levels could support the persistence of a larger diversity of microbes, the higher levels of exudates could contribute to the higher richness observed in this study in floodwaters collected from vegetative stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the use of urea in fertilizers, which is applied mainly during the vegetative stage, can affect the concentrations of available nutrients, especially NH4+, which is the main form of available N in the soil [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>These factors, alone or in combination, may have helped to shape the bacterial communities, increasing its diversity in the vegetative stage of crop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In that sense, the release of root exudates can influence the dynamics of bacterial communities during crop development and should be investigated as a contributor to bacterial community dynamics in rice floodwaters. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This study revealed that the communities associated with rice floodwaters were variable and differed between floodwaters from the vegetative and reproductive stages of rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The higher bacterial richness observed in floodwaters associated with vegetative plants may have been favored by the higher concentration of nutrients (for example, phosphorus and potassium) due to changes in rhizodeposition and crop management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>OTUs from the phylum Proteobacteria were present in floodwaters collected from both developmental stages, indicating the persistence of this phylum in flooded rice ecosystems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the predominance of the class Gammaproteobacteria and the occurrence of the phylum Firmicutes in the reproductive stage demonstrated that the environment was favorable to microbes that can persist longer in paddy fields where they are able to utilize the degradable fraction of organic materials and survive in waterlogged and dry conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>However, further investigations regarding the composition and quantification of root exudates and the impacts of rice exudates on microbial communities in rice fields are essential to decipher the linkage between the microbial community dynamics and rice plant over cultivation time. </plain></SENT>
