</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Modern genomic data and analyses are revealing that naturally occurring hybridization, and admixture between divergent lineages is not rare (Maqbool, Grabherr, Martinez‐barrio, &amp; Promerova, 2015; Pease, Haak, Hahn, &amp; Moyle, 2016; Racimo, Sankararaman, Nielsen, &amp; Huerta‐Sánchez, 2015; Wallbank et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary consequences of hybridization are, however, diverse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On one hand, hybridization has been described as “the grossest blunder in sexual preference which we can conceive of an animal making” (Fisher, 1930). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other, hybridization can be a generative force, facilitating adaptive evolution via introgression (Dasmahapatra et al., 2012; Song et al., 2011) or promoting diversification through hybrid speciation (Anderson &amp; Stebbins, 1954; Buerkle, Morris, Asmussen, &amp; Rieseberg, 2000; Gross &amp; Rieseberg, 2005; Mallet, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases of hybrid speciation exist (Duenez‐Guzman, Mavárez, Vose, &amp; Gavrilets, 2009; Gompert, Fordyce, Forister, Shapiro, &amp; Nice, 2006; Hermansen et al., 2014; Lamichhaney et al., 2018; Nice et al., 2013; Rieseberg et al., 2003; Salazar et al., 2010), and some have suggested that hybridization may be responsible for a larger fraction of species diversity than previously appreciated (Mallet, 2007; Mavarez &amp; Linares, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, linking the specific mechanism(s) through which hybridization causally leads to the evolution of reproductive isolation (RI) between hybrids and their parents, in many putative cases, remains a major challenge (Schumer, Rosenthal, &amp; Andolfatto, 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hybrid speciation can occur either with or without a change in ploidy between hybrid lineages and their parents (Hegarty &amp; Hiscock, 2005; Mallet, 2007; Rieseberg, Van Fossen, &amp; Desrochers, 1995; Stebbins, 1959). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Polyploid hybrid speciation is rare in animals, but relatively common in plants (see Hegarty &amp; Hiscock, 2005; Stebbins, 1959), because relative to plants, incidence of polyploidy is rare in most groups of animals (Mable, 2004; Orr, 1990; Otto &amp; Whitton, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, homoploid hybrid speciation (HHS) has been shown to occur in plants (e.g., Helianthus anomalus; (Rieseberg et al., 1995, 2003; Ungerer, Baird, Pan, &amp; Rieseberg, 1998), animals (e.g., Heliconius heurippa; (Jiggins, Salazar, Linares, &amp; Mavarez, 2008; Melo, Salazar, Jiggins, &amp; Linares, 2009; Salazar et al., 2010), and fungi (Leducq et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional examples of putative homoploid hybrid species are becoming more common (reviewed in Gross &amp; Rieseberg, 2005; Mavarez &amp; Linares, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For details of specific examples of hybrid species, I refer the reader to citations presented throughout this article; hereafter, I focus specifically on the processes generating RI during HHS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At least four studies have quantitatively explored conditions that can lead to HHS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that admixed populations are more likely to stabilize, and evolve RI from their parental species, when they display a high rate of selfing (in plants; McCarthy, Asmussen, &amp; Anderson, 1995) or assortative mating (in animals; Duenez‐Guzman et al., 2009), show transgressive segregation at traits influencing fitness in a novel environment (Buerkle et al., 2000), and/or are geographically isolated from their parental species (Buerkle et al., 2000; McCarthy et al., 1995; Schumer, Cui, Rosenthal, &amp; Andolfatto, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Each of these factors can promote reproductive isolation between admixed and parental lineages and allow for genomic stabilization and independent evolution to occur within admixed populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition to cohesion through geographic, ecological, or sexual isolation, hybrid populations can display intrinsic incompatibilities with their parental species (Hermansen et al., 2014; Rieseberg et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These intrinsic incompatibilities can help maintain stable hybrid populations despite the opportunity for ongoing gene flow with their parental species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In order to better appreciate when hybridization is most likely to drive speciation, it is therefore important to understand the conditions and mechanisms that result in genomic stabilization within hybrid lineages, and the evolution of RI between hybrid lineages and their parents. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One such mechanism is when two or more independently acting genetic incompatibilities fix for alternate parental genotypes in a hybrid population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This “balancing” of incompatibilities results in admixed genomes (or more specifically, haplotypes) that are compatible with each other, but will manifest at least one incompatibility with either of their parental species (herein referred to as “symmetrical incompatibilities”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Loci that can generate symmetrical incompatibilities include chromosomal rearrangements (Buerkle et al., 2000; McCarthy et al., 1995) or epistatic pairs of loci that affect fitness as a result of interallelic interactions (e.g., Dobzhansky–Muller Incompatibilities) (Schumer et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For example, consider a pair of loci that interact through epistasis and are segregating for both parental ancestries at equal frequencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Under the assumptions that selection favors interactions between alleles sharing the same ancestry within each pair symmetrically (e.g., Table 2) and that the strength of selection is greater than drift (i.e., greater than ~1/(2N e)), both parental ancestries have an equal probability of fixing within each of the two pairs of interacting loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Extending this example to multiple independent pairs of “epistatic loci,” the probability of fixing for either parent 1 or parent 2 alleles across all epistatic pairs is 2 × 0.5n, where n is the number of epistatic pairs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the probability of evolving mixed ancestry and some amount of RI due to symmetrical incompatibilities across the n epistatic pairs is 1 − (2 × 0.5n). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>All else being equal (e.g., independent assortment of loci and no selection acting on additional traits), symmetrical incompatibilities may therefore readily evolve in sufficiently admixed populations (Schumer et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>McCarthy et al. (1995) and Buerkle et al. (2000) tested the probability that symmetrical incompatibilities would evolve between admixed populations and their parents as a result of novel “chromosomally balanced” genotypes with respect to two rearrangements that differed between the parental species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Their simulations show that admixed populations can evolve RI under this mechanism, and that the probability of evolving RI increases both as hybrid fitness in a novel environment and geographic isolation from parental populations increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Taken with the results presented by Schumer et al. (2015), these analyses describe (1) how symmetrical incompatibilities can evolve in admixed populations and generate RI between admixed and parental populations and (2) suggest that the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities is contingent upon the nature of selection acting on hybrid individuals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In nature, the fitness of naturally occurring hybrids in different environments relative to their parents is seldom known; however, it is likely to vary depending on multiple factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In some cases, such as in Helianthus sunflowers, hybrids may be more fit than their parental species in certain environments (Rieseberg et al., 1995, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In others, hybrids may be less fit than their parents, and this may (or may not) depend on the environment that a hybrid finds itself in (Bridle, Saldamando, Koning, &amp; Butlin, 2006; Delmore &amp; Irwin, 2014; Linn et al., 2004; Turissini, Comeault, Liu, Lee, &amp; Matute, 2017; Vamosi &amp; Schluter, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities will be affected by the specific fitness function acting on admixed genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>By extension, selection acting at linked sites will also affect the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Understanding the genetic architecture of traits, and the form of selection acting on those traits, is therefore important to fully appreciate the scenarios that either permit or constrain the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities in admixed populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this article, I use forward‐time individual‐based simulations to illustrate how the nature of selection acting on, and the linkage relationships between, loci that generate incompatibilities (hereafter “epistatic” loci) and those that affect an additional trait under selection (hereafter “adaptive” loci) affect the probability that admixed populations evolve symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To accomplish this, I simulate three different types of selection acting on adaptive loci and varied (1) the strength of selection acting on both adaptive and epistatic loci, (2) the order of loci along a chromosome, and (3) recombination rates between adjacent loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Each of these parameters was varied in a “hybridizing deme” experiencing gene flow from demes containing their parental species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous work, these simulations show how selection favoring admixed genotypes at adaptive loci tends to increase the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities, while selection favoring alleles from one or both parental species at adaptive loci tends to decrease the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Both the strength of selection acting on the different types of loci and their genetic architecture affect the probability that a hybrid population will evolve symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Below, I summarize these effects and highlight how understanding how selection acts on hybrids, along with knowledge of the genetic basis of traits that are subject to selection and underlie reproductive isolation between parental species, can be used to predict when we expect to observe homoploid hybrid species evolve. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>I carried out forward‐time simulations of demes composed of 1,000 diploid individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Hybrid populations in nature seldom evolve without some level of ongoing hybridization with parental populations; therefore, I simulated structured populations that consisted of two “parental demes” and a central “hybrid deme.” Hybridization occurred in the hybrid deme that experienced immigrants from the two parental demes at rate m, per parental deme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>I simulated three different rates of m: 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01, corresponding to an average of 0.1, 1, and 10 immigrant individuals from each parental deme per generation, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Simulations were initiated under each of two different conditions: (1) The hybrid deme was composed of equal proportions of randomly mating parental genotypes or (2) the hybrid deme was composed of an equal number of males and females that were heterozygous with respect to ancestry across all loci (i.e., all individuals were F1 hybrids). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Each individual's genome consisted of a single chromosome with seven equally spaced loci (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Two pairs of loci were subject to selection due to epistasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>(Two is the minimum number of pairs required to allow for symmetrical incompatibilities to evolve.) The remaining three loci additively affected an individual's fitness in the environment (e.g., ecological, social, or sexual environment). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The relative fitness of an individual was a function of their genotype at these loci (see “Selection” below; Tables 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>I tracked allele frequencies at each locus, within each simulated population, for 1,000 generations, recording allele frequencies every 10 generations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>I simulated 500 replicate populations for each combination of the parameter values described below and listed in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Mating was accomplished by randomly sampling individuals, with replacement, with the probability of sampling an individual being proportional to their fitness. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>First, I simulated “directional selection,” where selection on the three adaptive loci acted additively and alleles with ancestry from one of the parents (hereafter referred to as “P1”) were always favored over alleles with ancestry from the other parent (hereafter “P2”), except in the case where there was no selection acting on these loci (Table 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>My rationale for simulating this scenario is to expand on treatments of hybrid speciation where hybrids are afforded a fitness advantage in a certain environment (Buerkle et al., 2000) or where their fitness is independent of the environment (Schumer et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The particular parent that I deem selectively favored is arbitrary and represents a scenario where ancestry from one parental species at adaptive loci is favored over the second, while hybrids have intermediate fitness. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>This scenario reflects one where hybrid genotypes are at a fitness disadvantage relative to parental genotypes, and parental genotypes are equally fit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Third, I simulated “selection‐for‐admixture,” where selection favored admixed genotypes across the three adaptive loci over parental and heterozygous genotypes (Table 3C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>An important parameter that affects the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities is the strength of selection acting to maintain functional epistatic interactions within independent epistatic pairs (s epistatic). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>When I simulated populations initiated with 1,000 randomly mating parental individuals (equal proportions) subject to weak (0.001) or nonexistent (0) s epistatic, little gene flow from parental populations (m = 0.0001), moderate linkage between adjacent loci (r = 0.2), and no selection on adaptive loci (i.e., s adaptive = 0), a maximum of three of 500 simulated populations evolved symmetrical incompatibilities, across all three genetic architectures (blue and black points in Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This is because populations tended to maintain parental diversity at epistatic loci when s epistatic was weak (less than or equal to 0.001 for the simulations summarized in this article). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>More generally, when epistatic interactions are subject to weak selection and symmetrical incompatibilities do evolve, the magnitude of RI will also be weak. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>For example, the reduction in fitness of an offspring produced by a mating between an individual from an admixed population that evolved symmetrical incompatibilities and either parent species would be 0.1% when s epistatic = 0.001. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The same scenario for s epistatic = 0.05 or s epistatic = 0.1 would result in a 5% or 10% decrease in fitness, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Therefore, meaningful RI is unlikely to evolve through symmetrical incompatibilities unless parental species have accumulated genetic differences that result in at least moderately strong incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>When s epistatic is strong, recombinant haplotypes are less likely to be maintained in the population and symmetrical incompatibilities are less likely to evolve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>For example, when I simulated hybridization in populations experiencing little gene flow from parental populations (m = 0.0001) and no selection on additional adaptive loci (s adaptive = 0), the greatest proportion of populations evolved RI when s epistatic was moderate (0.01; see purple line in left column of panels in Figure 2a–c), with the proportion evolving RI decreasing as the strength of s epistatic increased (gold and red lines in left column of panels of Figure 2a–c). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Specifically, because gene flow can swamp locally adapted epistatic interactions, higher rates of gene flow tend to increase the threshold strength of s epistatic required for symmetrical incompatibilities to evolve. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>By contrast, for s epistatic &gt; 0.01, a similar proportion of populations evolve RI when m = 0.0001 or m = 0.001 because the relative strength of s epistatic is greater than rates of gene flow from parental populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, with modest gene flow (m = 0.001), symmetrical incompatibilities were able to evolve under all three models of s adaptive I simulated, as long as selection against hybrids was not too strong (increasing values on the x‐axes of Figure 2a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This result also depended on the strength of linkage between epistatic and adaptive loci, with tighter linkage further reducing the proportion of populations evolving symmetrical incompatibilities (Figures 4 and S1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In addition to the strength of epistatic selection and rates of gene flow, changes in allele frequencies at epistatic loci can be influenced by selection at linked sites (Barton, 2000; Maynard Smith &amp; Haigh, 1974). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Below, I explore the effect of three different models of selection acting on “adaptive” loci linked to the epistatic loci responsible for generating symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>I first present results from simulations initiated with a hybrid deme composed of randomly mating parental species, and then discuss the consequences of a forced bout of admixture in the Section 2.5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Selection acting on sites subject to s adaptive either decreased or increased the probability that symmetrical incompatibilities evolved, and the direction of this effect depended on the form of s adaptive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Directional selection that favored ancestry from one parental species over the other at adaptive loci always reduced the probability that populations of hybrids evolved incompatibilities (Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>When there is no linkage between epistatic and adaptive loci (r = 0.5), this reduction occurs because selection favors ancestry from one parent over the other and limits the opportunity for recombinant haplotypes to form (left column of panels in Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Specifically, selection favoring ancestry from one parent over the other at the adaptive loci biases epistatic loci to evolve toward the fitter parent's ancestry (Figures S2–S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>This effect was consistent at low, moderate, and high levels of gene flow (Figures 2a and 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Under the directional selection model, we therefore expect that as s adaptive increases, ancestry within admixed populations will evolve toward the fitter parent and the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities will be less likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>For the parameter values I simulated, this resulted in no symmetrical incompatibilities evolving when s adaptive was greater than 0.03 and there was at least some linkage between adaptive and epistatic loci (Figure 2a and 4a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Linkage between epistatic and adaptive loci tends to decrease the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities when adaptive loci are subject to directional or diversifying selection (panels in a and b, respectively), but increase the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities when selection favors admixture (c). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic id="nlm-graphic-9" xlink:href="ECE3-8-2926-g004"/></fig><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>When parental genotypes have equal fitness, and hybrids are less fit than their parental species (i.e., the diversifying selection model), increasing selection against hybrids (and admixed genotypes) also tends to reduce the probability of evolving symmetrical incompatibilities; however, the magnitude of this effect is much less than for the directional selection model (compare panels between Figure 2a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>For example, when s adaptive is greater than 0.03 and s epistatic is greater than 0.001, an appreciable proportion (&gt;0.1) of admixed populations evolved symmetrical incompatibilities under the diversifying selection model (Figure 2b), while almost none evolved symmetrical incompatibilities under the directional selection model (Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Unlike under the directional selection model, the arrangement of loci along the chromosome affected the magnitude of the reduction in the proportion of populations that evolved RI with increasing s adaptive under the diversifying selection model (compare down panels in Figure 2a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>For example, with moderate s epistatic (0.01), low migration (m = 0.0001), weak linkage (r = 0.2), and diversifying selection, as s adaptive increases from 0.02 to 0.08 there is a 35%, 30%, and 17% reduction in the proportion of simulated populations that evolve symmetrical incompatibilities for the dispersed, interspersed, or modular genetic architectures, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>A modular architecture can therefore facilitate the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities relative to the dispersed and interspersed architectures when s adaptive is strong (yellow and red lines in Figure 2b), migration rates are modest (right panels in Figure 2b), and parents do not differ in their fitness (i.e., under the diversifying selection model). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The two models of selection summarized above both impose selection against hybrid and admixed genotypes at adaptive loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>A third outcome of hybridization is that there is transgressive segregation for fitness‐associated traits, resulting in admixed genotypes that are at a selective advantage relative to parental genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Indeed, previous work has shown how symmetrical incompatibilities are more likely to evolve when hybrids have a fitness advantage in a novel environment (see figure2of Buerkle et al., 2000), and novel ecological traits in hybrids is a hallmark of one of the best examples of homoploid hybrid speciation: sunflowers in the genus Helianthus (Rieseberg et al., 1995, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The simulations that I present here recapitulate this result, with the primary difference being that I explicitly simulate linkage between the loci subject to ecological selection (s adaptive) and those that generate incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Linkage and the ordering of loci along the chromosome (genetic architecture) has the opposite effect on the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities under the selection‐for‐admixture model when compared to the directional or diversifying selection models: symmetrical incompatibilities were more likely to evolve under the dispersed and interspersed architectures, on average, than the modular genetic architecture (compare down panels of Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>(Note that selection‐for‐admixture only pertains to the adaptive loci and selection acts on epistatic loci the same way in all three models of “adaptive selection.”) This result is due to both selection favoring admixed genotypes (in the case where r = 0.5) and linkage between adaptive and epistatic loci in the dispersed and interspersed architectures (when r &lt; 0.5; Figures 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Consistent with previous work (Buerkle et al., 2000), symmetrical incompatibilities are therefore most likely to evolve when selection favors hybrids, with linkage and genetic architecture interacting to increase the probability that different pairs of epistatic loci evolve to fix different ancestries. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Because hybridization requires two species or their gametes to be present in the same location (at least temporarily), the faster that incompatibilities are able to stabilize within admixed populations, the more likely they will show meaningful RI from their parental species in the face of ongoing hybridization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>To determine how quickly RI evolved due to symmetrical incompatibilities, I recorded the time (to the nearest 10 generations) it took novel hybrid genotypes to evolve a mean allele frequency difference at the two epistatic pairs of loci greater than 0.9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>As expected, the stronger s epistatic was, the faster symmetrical incompatibilities tended to evolved (different colored points in Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Relative to s epistatic, both s adaptive and genetic architecture had negligible effects on the time it took to evolve RI (x‐axis of panels and panel columns in Figure 5, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The one exception to this pattern was that increasing s adaptive under the selection‐for‐admixture model resulted in decreasing the time it took to evolve symmetrical incompatibilities when s epistatic was moderate (s epistatic = 0.01; purple points in Figure 5c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This result highlights how once populations begin to evolve allele frequency differences at epistatic pairs of loci, the primary factor affecting the speed that those pairs fix alternate parental alleles is the strength of selection acting to maintain viable epistatic interactions; however, increasing selection on linked loci can increase the speed at which RI evolves in situations where s epistatic is not already very strong. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Genome‐wide sequence data have led to an increased appreciation of the prevalence of admixture and introgression between species (Payseur &amp; Rieseberg, 2016; Pease et al., 2016; Wallbank et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>While the consequences of hybridization have historically been viewed as maladaptive (Fisher, 1930), others have proposed that hybridization can be a generative force that facilitates adaptive evolution and speciation (Hedrick, 2013; Mallet, 2007; Nieto Feliner et al., 2017; Seehausen, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>If this is the case, hybridization may play a significant role in the production of biodiversity (Mallet, 2007), and a few empirical examples have even linked the evolution of RI, without a change in ploidy, to hybridization and admixture occurring between different species (Jiggins et al., 2008; Lamichhaney et al., 2018; Melo et al., 2009; Rieseberg et al., 1995; Ungerer et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Ascribing a causative role to hybridization and admixture in generating RI is, however, challenging, and the prevalence of HHS still remains largely unknown (Schumer et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Here, I have focused on one general mechanism that can lead to the evolution of RI in hybrid populations: the fixation of different parental alleles at two or more groups of “coadapted” or interacting loci (Buerkle et al., 2000; Schumer et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Through simulation, I have shown that the evolution of RI due to symmetrical incompatibilities is strongly affected by (1) the strength and form of selection acting on different types of loci, (2) linkage relationships between adaptive and epistatic loci, (3) the arrangement of those loci along a chromosome, (4) gene flow between populations of hybrids and their parental species, and (5) the degree of hybridization occurring in a hybrid zone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there will be “sweet‐spots”—both genetic and ecological—that will be most conducive to the evolution of RI in hybrid populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>From a genetic perspective, weak incompatibilities between parental genomes are only capable of generating weak RI due to symmetrical incompatibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>By contrast, strong and pervasive (in terms of number) incompatibilities will reduce the probability that admixed haplotypes will form and increase in frequency within a population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities will be most likely when parental species display an intermediate level of incompatibility; this will allow selection to maintain linkage disequilibrium between “coadapted” alleles but not severely limit the ability of recombinant haplotypes to be present at an appreciable frequency within a population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>From an ecological perspective, the evolution of symmetrical incompatibilities is most likely when selection favors hybrid and admixed genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Previous empirical work has shown that hybrid species tend to show novel ecologies or phenotypes when compared to their parental species (e.g., Helianthus sunflowers: (Rieseberg et al., 1995) Heliconius butterflies: (Melo et al., 2009; Salazar et al., 2010), Geospiza finches: (Lamichhaney et al., 2018)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>These novel ecologies and phenotypes may be required to afford recombinant genotypes the opportunity to establish and evolve RI from their parental species, especially in a situation where hybrid populations are not found in geographic isolation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Future work in speciation will benefit from continuing to quantify the extent of admixture within regions of hybridization and ultimately measure the fitness of hybrids relative to their parental species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Collecting these types of data across taxa that differ in the nature of hybridization (e.g., the extent of genetic divergence between parental species) and across a variety of environments is not a trivial tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>However, these data are needed if we are to understand the consequences of hybridization between species and populations in nature, and when and where we might expect to see admixed genomes stabilize and hybrid species evolve. </plain></SENT>
