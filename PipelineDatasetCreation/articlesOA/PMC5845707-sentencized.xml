<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has been documented in particular for the T-cell receptor (TCR)αβ+ T-cell compartment, showing reduced naive T-cell outputs and an accumulation of terminally differentiated clonally expanding effector T-cells, leading to increased proneness to autoimmunity and cancer development at older age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even though TCRαβ+ and TCRγδ+ T-cells follow similar paths of development involving V(D)J-recombination of TCR genes in the thymus, TCRγδ+ T-cells tend to be more subjected to peripheral rather than central selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the impact of aging in shaping of the peripheral TRG/TRD repertoire remains largely elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing analysis methods were optimized based on a spike-in method using plasmid vector DNA-samples for accurate TRG/TRD receptor diversity quantification, resulting in optimally defined primer concentrations, annealing temperatures and cycle numbers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Next, TRG/TRD repertoire diversity was evaluated during TCRγδ+ T-cell ontogeny, showing a broad, diverse repertoire in thymic and cord blood samples with Gaussian CDR3-length distributions, in contrast to the more skewed repertoire in mature circulating TCRγδ+ T-cells in adult peripheral blood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During aging the naive repertoire maintained its diversity with Gaussian CDR3-length distributions, while in the central and effector memory populations a clear shift from young (Vγ9/Vδ2 dominance) to elderly (Vγ2/Vδ1 dominance) was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Together with less clear Gaussian CDR3-length distributions, this would be highly suggestive of differentially heavily selected repertoires. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Despite the apparent age-related shift from Vγ9/Vδ2 to Vγ2/Vδ1, no clear aging effect was observed on the Vδ2 invariant T nucleotide and canonical Vγ9–Jγ1.2 selection determinants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A more detailed look into the healthy TRG/TRD repertoire revealed known cytomegalovirus-specific TRG/TRD clonotypes in a few donors, albeit without a significant aging-effect, while Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific clonotypes were absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Notably, in effector subsets of elderly individuals, we could identify reported TRG and TRD receptor chains from TCRγδ+ T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia proliferations, which typically present in the elderly population. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Immunological aging, also referred to as immunosenescence, is a complex phenomenon consisting of senescence and exhaustion processes, which are characterized by different functional and marker expression profiles (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Immunosenescence acts on different levels in the immune system, e.g., reduced antigen-specific responses (3), thymic shrinkage, and a significantly reduced naive T-cell output (3–5), convergence of the innate and adaptive immunity (6), and ultimately T-cell exhaustion (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Immunosenescence is believed to play a major role in shaping of the antigen receptor repertoire of T-cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>T-cells develop in the thymus, where they undergo commitment, rearrangement, selection and maturation processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The main event during T-cell development is the rearrangements of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes of the T-cell receptor (TR) loci, in order to establish a large diversity of antigen receptors (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Two main types of T-cells are generated; first, TCRγδ+ thymocytes, through early TR delta and gamma (TRD, TRG) rearrangements, then followed by TCRαβ+ thymocytes upon TR beta and alpha (TRB, TRA) rearrangements (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>TCRαβ+ thymocytes undergo positive selection through TCR signaling to subsequently mature into functional T-cells, followed by negative selection in order to eliminate self-reactive T-cell precursors (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TCRγδ+ thymocytes do not undergo positive and/or negative selection in the thymus (10), but extrathymic development and peripheral (antigenic) selection of TCRγδ+ T-cells have been described (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>TCRγδ+ T-cells appear to be the first functional population of circulating T lymphocytes in both murine and human peripheral blood (PB) [reviewed in Ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>(12)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In the human fetal and neonatal situation these functional circulating TCRγδ+ T-cells mainly concern Vδ1+ cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Readily after birth and during further development to adulthood a switch occurs in the circulating TCRγδ+ T-cell population with the number of Vδ1+ cells decreasing and Vγ9/Vδ2 cells becoming the predominant TCRγδ+ T-cell types (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This process is believed to be the result of peripheral antigenic selection, exemplified by the presence of an invariant T nucleotide in the majority of the selected Vδ2–Jδ1 rearrangements (13–15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, epitopes from pathogens or other antigens that could stimulate and select TCRγδ+ T-cell types have been described: Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been found to be a major stimulator of Vγ9/Vδ2 cells in both infected lungs and PB (16), whereas non-Vγ9/Vδ1 cells are known to be stimulated by viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) (17, 18) and Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>TCRγδ+ T-cells do not only recognize antigens via their receptor, but they also respond to lipid antigens presented on CD1d-molecules, and that are associated with stress, inflammation and cancer [reviewed by Ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>(20)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Most TCRγδ+ T-cells recognizing these CD1d-lipid antigen complexes are Vδ1 or Vδ3 cells, commonly located in the gut (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>TCRγδ+ T-cells can also recognize butyrophilins, tumor-antigens, endothelial antigens, antigen-presenting cells, and Toll-like receptors [reviewed in Ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>(22)], all of which are postulated to contribute to shaping of the TCRγδ+ T-cell repertoire. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>TCRγδ+ T-cell recognition and selection has been mostly described in the context of the developing immune system from fetus to neonate and adulthood, but—contrary to the TCRαβ+ T-cell repertoire—effects of aging on the TCRγδ+ T-cell repertoire have not been extensively addressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Since it has been found that TCRγδ+ T-cells follow the classical aging model as found in mainly CD8+ TCRαβ+ T-cells (23), we hypothesized that the naive mature TCRγδ+ T-cell repertoire would depict a broad spectrum of rearrangements and that it would show a more skewed pattern during further development from neonates to young adults and eventually elderly individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in view of the fact that T-cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia typically presents as a proliferation of effector cells in elderly, we were interested to compare our TRG/TRD repertoire findings to the LGL clonal repertoire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To this end, we investigated the developing and aging TRG/TRD repertoire in TCRγδ+ T-cell subsets, using an optimized experimental next-generation sequencing (NGS) procedure to minimize technical biases of PCR-based methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Our data show subset- and donor-specific TRG/TRD repertoires, suggestive of selection, with significant differences in the combinatorial repertoire in especially memory populations between young and elderly individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>When looking closer into TRG/TRD clonotypes, TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia receptor chains could be traced in especially the effector subsets of elderly individuals, which would fit the current idea that TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia cells originate from the normal healthy antigen-experienced TCRγδ+ T-cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Aging of the immune system has become increasingly important due to increased hygiene and higher life expectancies in the Western World (3, 5, 50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Immunosenescence plays an additional role in shaping the immune repertoire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Shaping of the immune system during ontogeny and upon aging relies on continuous antigenic exposures, varying from pathogens to cellular stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we showed that (antigenic) selection starts during early ontogeny in the thymus and CB samples and continues in circulating TCRγδ+ T-cells in young and elderly individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>While maintaining diversity in the naive subsets, the effect of aging is most significant in memory subsets, characterized by strong receptor skewing, and in effector subsets. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Following technical optimization of multiplex PCR assays for NGS analysis, we demonstrated highly diverse TRG, but Vδ1-skewed TCRγδ+ T-cell repertoires in precursor TCRγδ+ T-cells from thymus and CB, with low inter-sample variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This was in clear contrast to circulating mature TCRγδ+ T-cells that showed Vγ9/Vδ2 receptor skewing with high inter-sample variation and donor-specific patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>As we recently showed significant effects of aging on maturation profiles of TCRγδ+ T-cells (49), we investigated the immune repertoire composition of different TCRγδ+ T-cell subsets including naive, central, and effector memory, and effector cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Even though the naive TCRγδ+ T-cell population shrinks upon aging (3, 5, 49), its diversity—being the primary source for mounting immune responses—was maintained in elderly individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>To date, only one study documented the maintenance of the naive CD4+ TCRαβ+ T-cell repertoire until the age of 70, after which the repertoire profoundly declined (51) [reviewed in Ref. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>(52)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>These results are in line with our findings, although our cohort consisted of elderly until the age of 70. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This is one drawback of our study, but the maximum age to donate blood at our national blood bank is 70. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it would be interesting to also study healthy individuals &gt;70 years of age, although the high volumes of blood needed to obtain sufficient numbers of naiveTCRγδ+ T-cells could complicate such studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Low cell numbers pose serious limitations to studying the repertoire due to potentially low levels of input DNA and skewed data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>To overcome such limitations and to directly link overall receptor usage for both TRG and TRD loci, single molecule-based assays could be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>However, these assays are rather novel and require extensive optimization and validation experiments as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Another limitation of our study is the fact that due to limited cell material, we could not go into mechanistic and functional implications of our findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Age-related differences were most evident in central and effector memory populations: Vγ9 usage was highly important in young individuals, while a shift toward Vγ2 and other Vγ1-family genes was observed in effector memory TCRγδ+ T-cells of elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The significant increase in Vγ2 usage in elderly was accompanied by a significant decrease in Vδ2 and increase in Vδ1 usage, collectively indicating a shift from Vγ9/Vδ2 specificity in young to Vγ2/Vδ1 in elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>These findings might suggest differences in antigenic selection, or might be due to underlying clonal expansion in these populations (53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Also, CMV is known to elicit Vδ1+ TCRγδ+ T-cell-specific responses (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we have recently demonstrated the effect of CMV on the TCRγδ+ T-cell immune system, through increasing Vδ1+ TCRγδ+ T-cells in elderly carrying CMV (49), and it has been shown that latent CMV carriage is related to the expansion of CMV specific T-cells (54). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>When zooming in on the antigen-binding part, the CDR3 region, we could indeed identify CMV-specific CDR3 regions in a few donors, albeit without a significant aging effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>This could reflect high anti-CMV responses mounted by Vδ1+ TCRγδ+ T-cells, although such responses were mainly observed in renal allograft recipients and not in healthy controls (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Given that CMV infects mainly fibroblasts and epithelial cells (55), and that the majority of Vδ1+ TCRγδ+ T-cells reside in epithelial and mucosal tissues (56–58) these findings could indicate that healthy individuals have a local, rather than circulatory, protection by Vδ1+ TCRγδ+ T-cells against CMV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in a recent study Davey et al., showed that the Vδ1 population in CB is unfocused, but that in adult PB clonal expansions could be found that had directly differentiated from naive into effector phenotypes with parallel CD27 downregulation (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Vδ2 cells maintained their TCR expression from birth to adulthood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Together with the CMV effect upon aging, these findings could explain the higher Vδ1 usage in elderly and possibly the occurrence of clonopathies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In this study, we also examined other dominant TRG/TRD clonotypes, such as for M. tuberculosis, since TCRγδ+ T-cells are known to elicit strong responses (16), but these were not identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>This could be related to the recruitment of our donors (mostly of Caucasian descent) via the national Dutch blood bank, and the fact that donors are tested prior to blood donation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, open tuberculosis is not endemic in the Netherlands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Curiously, some TRG/TRD clonotypes derived from complete TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia receptors were identified in the healthy effector subset repertoire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>These findings would be in line with earlier correlations identified between TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia cells and healthy effector TCRγδ+ T-cells (49) and would support the concept that TCRγδ+ T-LGL is a disease that typically arises in effector cells of elderly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Our optimized multiplex PCR assays for NGS analysis could also be applicable to other disease states, such as TCRγδ+ T-cell lymphomas, or treatments, such as bone marrow transplantation (BMTx). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>TCRγδ+ T-cells have been described to reconstitute in increased numbers after BMTx in acute leukemia patients (60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>The here described method would allow to investigate to what extent the TRG/TRD repertoire has changed upon BMTx, and how the TCRγδ+ T-cell compartment regenerates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Also, circulating TCRγδ+ T-cells have been described in metastatic melanomas, in which it would be interesting to distinguish pro- and anti-tumor specific TCRγδ+ T-cells (61), the latter particularly in view of tumor-eradicating effects (45, 62). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Also, investigating the TRG/TRD repertoires of tissue-residing TCRγδ+ T-cells could be relevant, not only for CMV-specific responses, but also for other local antigens contributing to the TCRγδ+ T-cell repertoire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>As the ability of TCRγδ+ T-cells to move in and out of tissues has not been convincingly demonstrated yet, sequencing TCRγδ+ T-cells from different tissues could provide insight in both residing, migrating and circulating properties, as well as in development of local immune repertoires and additional functions and specificities of TCRγδ+ T-cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>In summary, using an optimized NGS assay we identified specific TRG/TRD repertoires during ontogeny and upon aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Despite strong individual-specific repertoire compositions, significant differences in Vγ and Vδ gene usage were identified upon aging in especially the memory TCRγδ+ T-cell subsets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>These age-dependent effects caused shifts from Vγ9/Vδ2 dominance in young to Vγ2/Vδ1 dominance in elderly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Additionally, some TRG/TRD clonotypes related to TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia were identified in normal effector TCRγδ+ T-cells of especially elderly individuals, which fits the idea that TCRγδ+ T-LGL leukemia originates from normal circulating, antigen-experienced effector TCRγδ+ T-cells. </plain></SENT>
