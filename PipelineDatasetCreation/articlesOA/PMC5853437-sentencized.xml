</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lupins (Lupinus spp.) are minor legume crops that produce beans with a remarkably high protein content (up to 40%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>During most of human history, however, they were grown primarily as green manure, as the toxic alkaloids in the beans hindered their use as food and feed crops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the early 1930s, German and Russian breeders produced the first low-alkaloid varieties directly suitable for human and animal consumption (Ivanov et al., 1932; von Sengbusch, 1930). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The introduction of these ‘sweet varieties’ paved the way for wider adoption in Europe and later in Australia, but at the same time resulted in higher susceptibility to herbivores (Wink, 1990; Kozłowski et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising given the proposed roles of the lupin alkaloids in defense (Wink, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, sweet varieties are not alkaloid-free, and the alkaloid levels in sweet beans vary greatly from year to year under field conditions, often surpassing the thresholds established by the food and feed industries (Cowling and Tarr, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This variation is dependent on complex genotype–environment interactions yet to be unraveled (Cowling and Tarr, 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The toxic alkaloids in lupins belong to the family of quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs), whose common feature is the presence of at least one quinolizidine ring in their chemical structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Present in legumes of the tribes Sophoreae and Genisteae (Bunsupa et al., 2012b), QAs are being increasingly recognized as a pharmacologically important class of compounds with a wide range of bioactivities, including anti-tumor, anti-viral, and hypoglycemic (Liang et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a particular QA called sparteine has found prominent use in chemistry, where it is employed as a ligand in asymmetric synthesis (Chuzel and Riant, 2005; Firth et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The chemical synthesis of sparteine is too complex to be viable and, thus, commercial sparteine is obtained from natural sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, however, sparteine has become much less available for reasons that remain unclear (Ritter, 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This has prompted a strong interest in the development of synthetic analogs (O’Brien, 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In order to fully exploit the potential offered by lupins, both as a source of QAs and as a protein crop, there is a need to understand the basic mechanisms behind QA biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Lupins accumulate many different QAs, most of which are derivatives of sparteine, which is the simplest tetracyclic QA (Wink et al., 1995) (see structures in Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The core biosynthesis of QAs remains a biochemical mystery, as only the first enzyme in the pathway, lysine decarboxylase (LDC), has been discovered so far (Fig. 1) (Bunsupa et al., 2012a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The second step has been postulated to be catalyzed by a copper amine oxidase (Bunsupa et al., 2011, 2012b), but this proposal awaits experimental validation, including cloning of the respective gene and characterization of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>What follows next in the pathway, namely the conversion to (–)-sparteine, is a notorious ‘black box’ in plant biochemistry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>From (–)-sparteine, the pathway takes different routes depending on the species/variety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In narrow-leafed lupin (L. angustifolius, NLL), for example, this route involves oxygenation to give lupanine and subsequent ring opening to give angustifoline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The differently oxygenated QA backbones can be subject to decorations such as glycosylation and acylation (Bunsupa et al., 2012b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A dedicated acyltransferase adding tigloyl groups to two related QA backbones has been cloned from white lupin (L. albus) (Okada et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>QAs are an important family of plant-derived alkaloids with relevance to the chemical and agricultural industries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>However, their core biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated, and only the first enzyme in the pathway has been discovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the first tissue-specific transcriptome profiling of a high-QA (bitter) variety of NLL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Two different sequencing technologies were used, namely Illumina and PacBio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>In general, de novo transcriptome assembly from Illumina reads can be challenging due to a very large number of short reads and the existence of closely related (but different) transcripts (Martin and Wang, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>In order to address this issue, we decided to complement our Illumina data using a long-read (&gt;1000 bp) sequencing technology, PacBio (Bachall, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Prior to the de novo assembly of Illumina reads, we first mapped them to the PacBio assembly, and only the remaining unmapped ones were subjected to de novo assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>By doing so, we reduced the workload for the de novo assembly of Illumina reads by half and generated a robust and reliable transcriptome, as revealed by BUSCO benchmark analysis and by sequence-level comparison with the reference protein database of the related model species M. truncatula. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Comparison with a published NLL transcriptome obtained from a sweet variety (Kamphuis et al., 2015) revealed that our transcriptome encoded &gt;6000 additional NLL proteins (Supplementary Table S1) and that the N50 transcript length was more than twice as long. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>In addition, the RNA-seq data obtained for each tissue in this study (~5 Gb) is more than twice as large as that of the published NLL transcriptome study (~2 Gb), and this probably also resulted in the detection of more transcripts including low expressed genes, gene isoforms, and splice variants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>The tissues used in this study include tissues reported to synthesize QAs, namely leaves (Bunsupa et al., 2012a) and stems (Wink, 1987), tissues reported not to be able to synthesize them, namely roots (Wink, 1987), and other tissues with unknown biosynthetic status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the expression pattern of LDC confirmed the biosynthetic status of leaves and stems, but challenged the claim that roots do not synthesize QAs, as intermediate levels of expression were detected in this organ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>With respect to other tissues, it is remarkable that LDC expression could not be detected in large seeds, as it has been proposed that half of the high QA content in dry lupin seeds is synthesized in situ (Lee et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>The large seeds in our study were estimated to still be at the filling stage, and thus, absence of LDC expression might indicate that QAs in seeds are exclusively transported into the seeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>Detailed studies analyzing LDC expression at different stages of seed development are needed to confirm this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome profiling followed by gene co-expression analysis is a powerful strategy to identify new genes involved in a given specialized metabolite pathway (Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Based on this strategy, we selected a series of genes showing a similar expression pattern to LDC (Bunsupa et al., 2012a) (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>These genes include potential biosynthetic genes such as a geraniol 8-hydroxylase-like gene, regulatory genes such as a myb-like transcription factor, and transporter genes such as a purine permease 1-like transporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>These genes are of great interest for follow-up studies on QA biosynthesis, regulation, and transport in lupin plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a gene involved in gibberellin signaling (gibberellin receptor GID1) also showed a similar expression pattern to LDC, indicating that gibberellins may be able to regulate QA biosynthesis as reported for other alkaloids (Pitta-Alvarez and Giulietti, 1997; Srivastava and Srivastava, 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Among the candidate genes selected above, we identified a gene coding for a copper amine oxidase, LaCAO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The second step of QA biosynthesis has long been postulated to be catalyzed by a copper amine oxidase converting cadaverine to 5-aminopentanal, which is then spontaneously cyclized to 1-piperideine (Wink and Witte, 1987; Golebiewski and Spenser, 1988; Frick et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>The presence of a conserved NYE/X motif and three characteristic histidine residues (Kumar et al., 1996) suggested that LaCAO was an active enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>We confirmed the activity of LaCAO against cadaverine via heterologous expression, purification, and enzymatic assays, including detection of 1-piperideine via double derivatization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>In addition, kinetic experiments showed a high affinity of LaCAO towards cadaverine, with a KM of 6.5 ± 0.5 μM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>In plants, polyamines such as cadaverine are catabolized by either copper amine oxidases or by FAD-dependent polyamine oxidases as part of poorly understood processes related to cell wall restructuring, programmed cell death, and plant development (Tavladoraki et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>For these enzymes, the reported KM values for cadaverine range from 81 µM to 1919 µM (Equi et al., 1991; Heim et al., 2007; Katoh et al., 2007; Kivirand and Rinken, 2007; Naconsie et al., 2014; Zarei et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The low KM value obtained for LaCAO, together with its strong co-regulation with LDC, indicates that cadaverine is very likely to be LaCAO’s physiological substrate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>LaCAO localized to peroxisomes (Fig. 7), and this localization contrasts with the subcellular localization of LDC in the plastids (Bunsupa et al., 2012a) and with the accumulation of final QA pathway products in vacuoles (Mende and Wink, 1987). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Thus, QA biosynthesis might involve frequent subcellular trafficking of pathway intermediates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>This possible trafficking of intermediates has also been reported in the biosynthesis of other alkaloids, such as the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (Beaudoin and Facchini, 2014), the monoterpene indole alkaloids (Payne et al., 2017), and nicotine (Dewey and Xie, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>The intracellular transporters involved in these translocation processes may be further engineering targets for the manipulation of QAs and other alkaloids in crop plants. </plain></SENT>
