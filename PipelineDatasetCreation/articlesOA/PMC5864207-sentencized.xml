</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The marine habitat is the largest on Earth and marine microbes play fundamental roles in global biogeochemical nutrient cycling [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Planktonic communities are permanently stratified by light into two different zones with remarkably different microbial compositions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The photic zone occupies the uppermost ca. 200 m and is characterized by intense photosynthetic activity amidst steep gradients of light intensity, nutrients and temperature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The far larger aphotic zone extends all the way down to the sea floor and is permanently dark, cold, oligotrophic and heavily dependent upon organic input from the more productive layers above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Microbial communities are further stratified within these two zones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>For instance, a clear stratification is observed among several planktonic cyanobacterial genera, Prochlorococcus being located below the Synechococcus maxima in the photic zone [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>When spatio-temporal distributions of microbes in the water column of the marine habitat began to be explored by 16S rRNA sequences, novel and widespread microbial groups were discovered. e.g., SAR11 [4] and mesophilic group I (now Thaumarchaeota) and II archaea [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Among the early discoveries was a group of 16S rRNA sequences named SAR202 cluster that affiliated to the phylum Chloroflexi and had no previously described representatives in the marine habitat [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These sequences were found preferentially at the lowermost bounds of the photic zone (depth 250 m) in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Additional SAR202 sequences were retrieved in 16S rRNA clone surveys in deep waters of the Pacific Ocean (3000 m), extending the presence of this group to the deep- sea [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Similar sequences were also retrieved from the deep, cold hypolimnion (500 m) of an oligotrophic lake (Crater Lake) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Unequivocal evidence for the widespread prevalence of the SAR202 throughout the mesopelagic and bathypelagic realms was provided by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), revealing high numbers of SAR202 cells throughout the aphotic water column ( &gt; 10% of total prokaryotic community), down to nearly 3500–4000 m in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Despite the SAR202 group being among the first widespread microbial lineages discovered in the aphotic zones [7] we still lack cultured representatives for this group and their physiological characteristics remain completely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In-situ substrate uptake experiments suggested that a large fraction of SAR202 cells utilize L-aspartic acid at all depths in favor of the more refractory D-asp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the global bacterial and archaeal community that shows decreased uptake rates for L-Asp with increasing depth, suggesting adaptability of SAR202 to available dissolved organic matter in the deep sea [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A metagenomic analysis of the deep Mediterranean Sea water column also reported a high abundance of Chloroflexi in the deep sea and suggested the potential for carbon-monoxide oxidation in these microbes [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>FISH analyzes showed that SAR202 cells have a coccoid morphology with a diameter of &gt; 1 µm [10] that does not vary with depth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This is unlike SAR11, whose cell-size generally increases with depth [11], something that correlates with a slight increase in genome size for deep SAR11 ecotypes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>SAR202 does not show strong correlation to environmental parameters (except perhaps to lower temperatures and increasing depth). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Reports are sometimes conflicting in this respect, e.g., correlation to high oxygen concentrations found by Giovannoni et al. [7] and lack thereof by Schattenhofer et al. [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This in itself is quite remarkable for a group that at some sites may comprise &gt; 40% of the total bacterial community in the deep oceans [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes in general provides little information regarding metabolic traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is particularly true for Chloroflexi, which display a broad spectrum of lifestyle characteristics, e.g., anoxygenic photosynthesizers [16, 17], obligate aerobic/anaerobic heterotrophs [18–21], thermophiles [18, 20, 22], halophiles [23], nitrite oxidizers [24, 25], predators with gliding motility [26], some with capacity for reductive dehalogenation [27, 28] and even endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria in a largely Gram-negative phylum [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The only genomic information from the SAR202 group at present is from an incomplete single cell amplified genome (SAGs), Pac-SCGC-AAA240-N13, obtained from a depth of 770 m from the ALOHA station in the Pacific Ocean north of Hawaii [31] but no genomic analyzes have been reported. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this work, we reconstructed several SAR202 genomes from deep marine and brackish metagenomics datasets from the Ionian, Aegean and the Caspian Sea as well as Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>By screening publicly available unclassified Chloroflexi genomes we also identified another SAG, Atl-SCGC-AB-629-P13, (obtained from a depth of 553 m in the mid-Atlantic) as belonging to the SAR202 lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These metagenome-assembled SAR202 genomes (MAGs), together with the two SAGs provide a first insight into the metabolic capabilities of this group and suggest a significant role in the deep-ocean sulfur cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Moreover, metagenomic fragment recruitment analyzes reveal that highly related SAR202 genomes are prevalent at geographically distant locations (from the Mediterranean to the Pacific) implying their global distribution as a deep stratified cluster with a sizeable contribution to global ocean biogeochemical cycles, particularly the sulfur cycle. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>A broad overview of presence of phylum Chloroflexi representatives in the water column of marine and brackish environments using 16S rRNA metagenomic reads is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A (See also Supplementary Table S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>While SAR202 were barely detectable in the photic zone and deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) datasets (Western and Eastern Mediterranean, Caspian and Red Sea, HOTs and BATs), they comprised a substantial fraction of the microbial community in the datasets from the deep aphotic zones of eastern Mediterranean (Aegean ca. 5% and Ionian ca. 10%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>The Caspian datasets also showed a progressive increase in the percentage of reads assigned to Chloroflexi with increasing depth, reaching a maximum of ca. 4% at 150 m, suggesting the existence of novel brackish SAR202 representatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the Red Sea depth profile did not show any significant amounts of Chloroflexi members (maximum sample depth 500 m), suggesting that SAR202 does not show an ecological preference for the particular physico-chemical conditions characterizing the dark Red Sea [64, 65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>An integrated view of the distribution of 16S rRNA reads assigned to Chloroflexi in metagenomic datasets from the surface, DCM, mesopelagic and bathypelagic ocean layers shows clearly an increasing abundance with depth (Supplementary Fig. S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>There are statistically significant differences between the surface-mesopelagic, surface-bathypelagic datasets, DCM- mesopelagic and DCM-bathypelagic datasets (Kruskal–Wallis test, P = &lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Apart from the deep Mediterranean, the high abundance of Chloroflexi across different geographical locations in the global ocean and depths in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans reaffirms the deep dark waters of global oceans as their preferred niche (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S3). Chloroflexi even comprised up to 14% of microbial community in some deep ocean datasets of the MALASPINA expedition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>They appear to be present in variable proportions at all deep aphotic zones for which data are available (largely −40 N to 44 S) without obvious preferences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Only one deep ocean dataset is available from the Antarctic Province that is outside these latitudinal bounds (TARA expedition, 790 m depth, −61.98 S, −49.36 W) and it also contained 3.35 percent of 16S rRNA reads of Chloroflexi (Supplementary Fig. S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Overall, these analyzes recapitulate previous findings indicating that the SAR202 abundance increases with depth [7, 10–12, 14] and has a global distribution in the marine water column. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The closest relatives of this clade all originate from MAGs of sediment microorganisms (Chloroflexi bacterium CSP1-4 [94] and the Candidatus Rokubacteria, representative of a new phylum [94, 95]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In our case, given that the deep ocean is largely oxic, and that we found no evidence of dissimilatory sulfite reductases (dsr) genes in these genomes, the aprA genes from SAR202 likely represent a new group of sulfur-oxidizing aprA genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>While aprA genes have also been reported in deep specific SAR11 SAGs [15], they cluster together with the aprA genes of surface SAR11 genomes in the sulfur-oxidizing proteobacteria lineage I of aprA phylogeny (Supplementary Fig. S9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>These genes were proposed to participate in taurine metabolism to detoxify the highly reactive sulfite (producing APS) and play a key role in the sulfur metabolism in deep specific SAR11 bacteria [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>However, to produce ATP from sulfite via the activity of aprBA genes, a second step involving conversion of APS to sulfate is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The gene encoding the corresponding enzyme (sat, sulfate adenylyltransferase) was also identified in SAR202 genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This would allow SAR202 to utilize the excess sulfite produced as a by-product of organosulfur compound metabolism as an energy source, producing sulfate as a final product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if the complete sulfate assimilation pathways are present in SAR202, as only a single phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase was found in one MAG (Casp-Chloro-G4) and no sulfite reductases were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>It may be that SAR202, similar to SAR11, rely on availability of reduced sulfur compounds [15, 96–98]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The dark ocean is several times larger than the photic zone in sheer size and the majority of its microbial inhabitants are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have reconstructed genomes of the uncultivated SAR202 cluster (phylum Chloroflexi), which appears particularly abundant in the aphotic zone of global oceans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the distribution of SAR202 sequences in the currently available deep metagenomic datasets (n = 50) suggests that SAR202 populations are vertically stratified, with distinct mesopelagic and bathypelagic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>In particular, at least five genomes (belonging to only two distinct species) appear to be widely distributed in geographically distant regions in the bathypelagic zone of the world’s oceans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Based on the higher abundance of the SAR202 cluster in the metagenomes of 0.–0.8 µm size fraction in the MALASPINA datasets, it is expected that these are free living microbes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Genome size estimations suggested sizes in the range of 2.5–3 Mb, that is in line with the large cell sizes observed by FISH [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Their larger cell-sizes coupled with higher abundances in the deep ocean suggest they alone make up for a significant fraction of the total biomass in this oligotrophic habitat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>It must be considered however that total cell numbers are an order of magnitude lower in the deeper oceans than at the surface [99]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The genomes of the SAR202 group described here contain several pathways for metabolizing multiple organosulfur compounds as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur sources, which in turn implies that at least some of these compounds (e.g., DMS, DMSP, taurine, hypotaurine) may be more widely available in the deep ocean than suspected before [100, 101]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>There are multiple sources of sulfur containing compounds, e.g., DMSP in sinking particulate cells (algal or microbial) from the upper layers, release of osmolytes from deep marine invertebrates (e.g., taurine, hypotaurine), production by heterotrophic microbes [103], hydrogen sulfide emissions from deep-sea vents, cold seeps and ocean sediments, especially at continental margins, or others that are as yet unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Similar disparities also exist in the measurements of total carbon input into this realm that do not match the higher estimated respiration rates [99], illustrating our as yet incomplete understanding of the remineralization processes and the participating entities at work in the dark ocean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In this work, we present initial evidence that hints at the presence of multiple, broadly available sulfur compounds in the deep sea that may be used by the abundant SAR202 group both as carbon and energy sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Moreover, multiple degradation pathways found in these genomes appear to converge upon the production of sulfite, that may be oxidized to sulfate by adenylylsulfate reductase, suggesting that SAR202 are sulfite-oxidizers, making them key players in the sulfur cycle at the deep marine environment. </plain></SENT>
