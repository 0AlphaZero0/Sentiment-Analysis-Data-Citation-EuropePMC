As viral gastroenteritis is generally self-limiting, clinical samples for epidemiological studies only partially represent circulating noroviruses in the population and is biased towards severe symptomatic cases. As infected individuals from both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases shed viruses into the sewerage system at a high concentration, waste water samples are useful for the molecular epidemiological analysis of norovirus genotypes at a population level. Using Illumina MiSeq and Sanger sequencing, we surveyed circulating norovirus within Australia and New Zealand, from July 2014 to December 2016. Importantly, norovirus genomic diversity during 2016 was compared between clinical and waste water samples to identify potential pandemic variants, novel recombinant viruses and the timing of their emergence. Although the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant was prominent in 2014 and 2015, its prevalence significantly decreased in both clinical and waste water samples over 2016. This was concomitant with the emergence of multiple norovirus strains, including two GII.4 Sydney 2012 recombinant viruses, GII.P4 New Orleans 2009/GII.4 Sydney 2012 and GII.P16/GII.4 Sydney 2012, along with three other emerging strains GII.17, GII.P12/GII.3 and GII.P16/GII.2. This is unusual, as a single GII.4 pandemic variant is generally responsible for 65&#x02013;80% of all human norovirus infections at any one time and predominates until it is replaced by a new pandemic variant. In sumary, this study demonstrates the combined use of clinical and wastewater samples provides a more complete picture of norovirus circulating within the population.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a new and rapidly evolving technology that facilitates the simultaneous sequencing of large amounts of genetic material. Over the past decade, NGS has advanced and revolutionised pathogen genomic sequencing, with increased turnaround times and outputs, generating more data at much lower per base costs. Owing to the availability and cost-effectiveness of NGS, it can be used as a tool to study viral genetic diversity in waste water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Molecular epidemiological studies of norovirus are usually performed with clinical samples collected from patients presenting at medical facilities. However, this is not representative of the whole norovirus population and is biased towards severe symptomatic cases, thus offering only a narrow picture of the complete viral diversity. Community norovirus infection and prolonged shedding results in high levels of norovirus in waste water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, making waste water a useful medium for population-based, epidemiological scale, enteric virus surveillance.</p><p id="Par4">Norovirus is a leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis (AGE) among people of all age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Norovirus-associated outbreaks commonly occur in closed environments such as nursing homes, hospitals, childcare centres and cruise ships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Institutional outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are difficult to control and have significant global economic burden to public healthcare systems (USD $4.2 billion) and communities (USD $60.3 billion) each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Norovirus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route. It is highly infectious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and transmission is aided by its stability in the external environment. Clinical symptoms of norovirus infection include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, headaches, chills and abdominal cramps, usually lasting 2 to 4 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Severe and persistent symptoms can be experienced in vulnerable populations including children, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Norovirus is a non-enveloped, 27&#x02013;35&#x02009;nm virion, which contains a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~&#x02009;7500 nucleotides (nt). The <italic>Norovirus</italic> genus is classified within the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family and can be divided into seven genogroups (GI&#x02013;GVII), and further separated into more than 40 genotypes, based on the amino acid sequence of the full-length capsid region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. GI, GII and GIV have been shown to infect humans; however, viruses from GII genotype 4 (GII.4) are responsible for pandemics and 65&#x02013;80% of all norovirus infections globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Norovirus GII.4 evolution is driven through the generation of genetic variants, by antigenic drift and shift (recombination), leading to the emergence of novel and potential pandemic viruses approximately every 2&#x02013;3 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Amino acid divergence in the P2 protruding domain of the capsid (VP1) contributes to the emergence of these viruses through escape from herd immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Another important mechanism driving the evolution and emergence of norovirus is recombination, with the breakpoint usually found at the ORF1/ORF2 overlap region, which separates the non-structural and structural regions of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Six distinct norovirus GII.4 variants have been associated with pandemics of AGE over the past two decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Pandemic variants are distinguished based on the complete full-length capsid amino acid sequences, where more than 5% amino acid divergence is considered indicative of a new pandemic variant. GII.4 pandemic variants are named based on the location first identified, followed by the year. The GII.4 pandemic variants include the following: US 1995/96<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, Farmington Hills 2002<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, Hunter virus 2004<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, Den Haag 2006b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, New Orleans in 2009<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and, in early 2012, Sydney 2012. The GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant was first identified in March 2012 in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and originated through recombination between the GII.4 Osaka 2007 variant and GII.4 Apeldoorn 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Despite the predominance of norovirus GII.4, several non-GII.4 strains are also an important cause of norovirus infections. In the 2014/2015 winter in Southeast Asia, a sudden increase in gastroenteritis was observed, as the GII.17 Kawasaki strain emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, this trend was not observed in North America or Europe, with only a low reported prevalence&#x000a0;of GII.17 infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, norovirus GII.3 appears to have a major role in childhood infections and has been the capsid genotype most frequently associated with children for the past few decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These strains are often recombinants, in particular the GII.3 capsid is often associated with a GII.P21 ORF1 (GII.P21/GII.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, formerly termed GII.Pb/GII.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Continuous surveillance of circulating norovirus genotypes in the community is essential to better understand the evolution and diversity of norovirus. Only through early identification of potential pandemic variants can sufficient warning be provided to public health sectors, to implement infection control measures. These include isolation of infected individuals, community health warnings and education for robust hygiene and decontamination practices. Therefore, we examined the molecular epidemiology of circulating norovirus from clinical samples collected in Australia and New Zealand (NZ) from July 2014 to December 2016, to monitor current epidemic strains, to identify emerging pandemic variants and to characterise recombinant viruses. Using NGS (Illumina MiSeq platform), the diversity of norovirus in waste water was monitored at a city-based population scale in both Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. The changing patterns of prevalent strain emergence were compared with those found in clinical samples with a particular focus on the timings of viral emergence. This study highlights the importance of multiple sample types for a more complete understanding of the norovirus diversity at a population level and establishes the relationship between clinical and waste water findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="Par10">University of New South Wales (UNSW) Human Research Ethics Advisory Panel reviewed and approved the ethics application for this study (HC16826 and HC17459).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical specimen collection and outbreak identification</title><p id="Par11">All samples were collected between July 2014 and December 2016.

The genotypes of circulating norovirus strains were determined in Australia and NZ between July 2014 and December 2016 in clinical samples. However, as people infected with norovirus would not necessarily seek medical advice, this can create a bias towards severe symptomatic cases and therefore does not fully represent circulating noroviruses within a population, with less pathogenic strains perhaps under-represented. The application of NGS to monitor norovirus population diversity in waste water can provide a better understanding of norovirus epidemiological data at the population scale by screening waste water produced from many thousands or millions of people. Moreover, the comparison of clinical and waste water data allows a more complete representation of norovirus epidemiology at a city-based population level.</p><p id="Par39">Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase and capsid overlapping regions revealed the Sydney pandemic variant (GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney 2012) remained the predominant strain in the Oceania region in 2014 (65.4% of norovirus outbreaks and cases) and 2015 (42.1%). The Sydney 2012 variant emerged in 2012 and over the ensuing 4 years herd immunity in the population is likely to have accumulated against the virus. This could account for the sudden decline of GII.4 Sydney pandemic variant in 2016 (only 13.4% of norovirus cases), concomitant with the emergence of five new viruses including two novel GII.4 Sydney 2012 recombinants, GII.P12/GII.3, GII.P16/GII.2 and GII.17.

Analysis of the VP1 full-length capsid sequences revealed no amino acid changes to account for the rapid predominance through antigenic variation.

In addition to the other emerging viruses detected, a novel GII.P12/GII.3 recombinant was identified in 2015 and 2016 in NZ and Australia, respectively. This recombinant was found to be associated with childhood infections and probably replaced the GII.P21/GII.3 recombinant childhood strain, as its prevalence declined rapidly from May 2015 onwards. The majority (90%) of Australian patients infected with GII.P12/GII.3 strain were under 12 years old, suggesting this virus has a predilection for infecting children. In 2016, this recombinant was detected at a prevalence of 8.1% in clinical samples compared with 0.57% of genotypes identified in waste water samples. We hypothesise that this is because children have lower norovirus immunity and infection would elicit more severe symptoms upon their first norovirus exposure. Therefore, children are more likely to visit a hospital or general practitioner for medical advice compared with adults.This is not without precedence, e.g., children with respiratory syncytial virus infection results in more severe outcomes and are present for medical intervention far more than adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Therefore, the use of clinical samples for surveillance could create bias towards viruses from children and selection viruses that induce symptoms, thus skewing genotypic distribution patterns.</p><p id="Par45">Waste water is an ideal source for molecular epidemiological studies, because infected individuals excrete high levels of virus and continue to shed for up to 8 weeks, even after symptom resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In the present study, NGS was used to examine the genetic diversity, prevalence and temporal dynamics of GII noroviruses present in complex waste water samples.

A high level of norovirus genotypic diversity was identified in waste water samples from Sydney and Melbourne, with 18 of 22 capsid genotypes detected (GII.1-8, 10-14, 16, 17, 20-22), compared with 12 capsid genotypes detected in clinical samples.

From May 2016, GII.4 prevalence declined and the prevalence of GII.2 strains increased. This data correlated with an increase in GII.2-positive clinical samples, suggesting that waste water samples could augment clinical samples for norovirus surveillance. The increased abundance of GII.2 in wastewater was observed two months prior increased GII.2 detection in clinical samples, signifying its use as a predictive model, which could be used as a warning of impending epidemics leading to peaks of season.</p><p id="Par46">To date, only a handful of studies have examined the genotypic diversity of viruses in wastewater, in which most used traditional Sanger sequencing/cloning methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, with only two employing NGS technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.
