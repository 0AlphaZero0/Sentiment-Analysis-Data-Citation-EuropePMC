<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As viral gastroenteritis is generally self-limiting, clinical samples for epidemiological studies only partially represent circulating noroviruses in the population and is biased towards severe symptomatic cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As infected individuals from both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases shed viruses into the sewerage system at a high concentration, waste water samples are useful for the molecular epidemiological analysis of norovirus genotypes at a population level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using Illumina MiSeq and Sanger sequencing, we surveyed circulating norovirus within Australia and New Zealand, from July 2014 to December 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Importantly, norovirus genomic diversity during 2016 was compared between clinical and waste water samples to identify potential pandemic variants, novel recombinant viruses and the timing of their emergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant was prominent in 2014 and 2015, its prevalence significantly decreased in both clinical and waste water samples over 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was concomitant with the emergence of multiple norovirus strains, including two GII.4 Sydney 2012 recombinant viruses, GII.P4 New Orleans 2009/GII.4 Sydney 2012 and GII.P16/GII.4 Sydney 2012, along with three other emerging strains GII.17, GII.P12/GII.3 and GII.P16/GII.2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is unusual, as a single GII.4 pandemic variant is generally responsible for 65–80% of all human norovirus infections at any one time and predominates until it is replaced by a new pandemic variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In sumary, this study demonstrates the combined use of clinical and wastewater samples provides a more complete picture of norovirus circulating within the population. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a new and rapidly evolving technology that facilitates the simultaneous sequencing of large amounts of genetic material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, NGS has advanced and revolutionised pathogen genomic sequencing, with increased turnaround times and outputs, generating more data at much lower per base costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Owing to the availability and cost-effectiveness of NGS, it can be used as a tool to study viral genetic diversity in waste water1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Molecular epidemiological studies of norovirus are usually performed with clinical samples collected from patients presenting at medical facilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, this is not representative of the whole norovirus population and is biased towards severe symptomatic cases, thus offering only a narrow picture of the complete viral diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Community norovirus infection and prolonged shedding results in high levels of norovirus in waste water2,3, making waste water a useful medium for population-based, epidemiological scale, enteric virus surveillance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Norovirus is a leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis (AGE) among people of all age groups4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Norovirus-associated outbreaks commonly occur in closed environments such as nursing homes, hospitals, childcare centres and cruise ships5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Institutional outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis are difficult to control and have significant global economic burden to public healthcare systems (USD $4.2 billion) and communities (USD $60.3 billion) each year6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Norovirus is transmitted from person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It is highly infectious7 and transmission is aided by its stability in the external environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms of norovirus infection include diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, headaches, chills and abdominal cramps, usually lasting 2 to 4 days8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Severe and persistent symptoms can be experienced in vulnerable populations including children, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Norovirus is a non-enveloped, 27–35 nm virion, which contains a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~ 7500 nucleotides (nt). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The Norovirus genus is classified within the Caliciviridae family and can be divided into seven genogroups (GI–GVII), and further separated into more than 40 genotypes, based on the amino acid sequence of the full-length capsid region10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>GI, GII and GIV have been shown to infect humans; however, viruses from GII genotype 4 (GII.4) are responsible for pandemics and 65–80% of all norovirus infections globally11,12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Norovirus GII.4 evolution is driven through the generation of genetic variants, by antigenic drift and shift (recombination), leading to the emergence of novel and potential pandemic viruses approximately every 2–3 years13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Amino acid divergence in the P2 protruding domain of the capsid (VP1) contributes to the emergence of these viruses through escape from herd immunity13,14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Another important mechanism driving the evolution and emergence of norovirus is recombination, with the breakpoint usually found at the ORF1/ORF2 overlap region, which separates the non-structural and structural regions of the genome15. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Six distinct norovirus GII.4 variants have been associated with pandemics of AGE over the past two decades15,16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Pandemic variants are distinguished based on the complete full-length capsid amino acid sequences, where more than 5% amino acid divergence is considered indicative of a new pandemic variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>GII.4 pandemic variants are named based on the location first identified, followed by the year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The GII.4 pandemic variants include the following: US 1995/9617, Farmington Hills 200218, Hunter virus 200419, Den Haag 2006b12, New Orleans in 200920 and, in early 2012, Sydney 2012. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant was first identified in March 2012 in Australia21,22 and originated through recombination between the GII.4 Osaka 2007 variant and GII.4 Apeldoorn 200813. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Despite the predominance of norovirus GII.4, several non-GII.4 strains are also an important cause of norovirus infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the 2014/2015 winter in Southeast Asia, a sudden increase in gastroenteritis was observed, as the GII.17 Kawasaki strain emerged23,24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, this trend was not observed in North America or Europe, with only a low reported prevalence of GII.17 infections25,26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In addition, norovirus GII.3 appears to have a major role in childhood infections and has been the capsid genotype most frequently associated with children for the past few decades27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>These strains are often recombinants, in particular the GII.3 capsid is often associated with a GII.P21 ORF1 (GII.P21/GII.3)27, formerly termed GII.Pb/GII.328. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Continuous surveillance of circulating norovirus genotypes in the community is essential to better understand the evolution and diversity of norovirus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Only through early identification of potential pandemic variants can sufficient warning be provided to public health sectors, to implement infection control measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These include isolation of infected individuals, community health warnings and education for robust hygiene and decontamination practices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we examined the molecular epidemiology of circulating norovirus from clinical samples collected in Australia and New Zealand (NZ) from July 2014 to December 2016, to monitor current epidemic strains, to identify emerging pandemic variants and to characterise recombinant viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Using NGS (Illumina MiSeq platform), the diversity of norovirus in waste water was monitored at a city-based population scale in both Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The changing patterns of prevalent strain emergence were compared with those found in clinical samples with a particular focus on the timings of viral emergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the importance of multiple sample types for a more complete understanding of the norovirus diversity at a population level and establishes the relationship between clinical and waste water findings. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The Sydney 2012 variant emerged in 2012 and over the ensuing 4 years herd immunity in the population is likely to have accumulated against the virus. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The emergence of new viruses is likely to be responsible for the increase of institutional gastroenteritis outbreaks reported to the NSW Ministry of Health between July and November 2016. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 capsid in the population was facilitated by two separate recombination events, resulting in the emergence of the intra-genotypic GII.P4 NO 2009/GII.4 Sydney 2012 and the inter-genotypic GII.16/GII.4 Sydney 2012 recombinant viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>These two recombination events likely provided the viruses a selective advantage to evade host immunity directed towards the GII.Pe-encoded non-structural region of the Sydney variant (GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The GII.P4 NO 2009/GII.4 Sydney 2012 virus arose, although an unusual recombination event between a pandemic variant and its pandemic predecessor37. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This timing is consistent with a study by Bruggink et al40. in Victoria, Australia, who showed this recombinant emerged in Melbourne in August 2015, but did not cause a significant increase of gastroenteritis until June 2016. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In addition to the other emerging viruses detected, a novel GII.P12/GII.3 recombinant was identified in 2015 and 2016 in NZ and Australia, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This recombinant was found to be associated with childhood infections and probably replaced the GII.P21/GII.3 recombinant childhood strain, as its prevalence declined rapidly from May 2015 onwards. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The majority (90%) of Australian patients infected with GII.P12/GII.3 strain were under 12 years old, suggesting this virus has a predilection for infecting children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In 2016, this recombinant was detected at a prevalence of 8.1% in clinical samples compared with 0.57% of genotypes identified in waste water samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that this is because children have lower norovirus immunity and infection would elicit more severe symptoms upon their first norovirus exposure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Therefore, children are more likely to visit a hospital or general practitioner for medical advice compared with adults.This is not without precedence, e.g., children with respiratory syncytial virus infection results in more severe outcomes and are present for medical intervention far more than adults51. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Among the four genotypes not identified, two were not expected (GII.18 and GII.19) as these only infect pigs53. </plain></SENT>
