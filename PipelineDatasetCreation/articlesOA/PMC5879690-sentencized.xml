<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This finely tuned balance is often mediated by enzymes involved in central metabolism, reflecting the ancient origin and strong selective pressure of immune regulation (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is one such enzyme that oxidizes the essential amino acid tryptophan to produce N-formylkynurenine, which is further hydrolyzed to kynurenine (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This enzyme is present in many tissues and is up-regulated in response to inflammation, specifically the presence of cytokines, such as IFN-γ, as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (4, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cells expressing IDO1 are able to deplete the inflamed environment of the metabolically expensive substrate, tryptophan, inhibiting the proliferation of immune targets (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>IDO1 is also able to serve as an immunosuppressive enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In a seminal paper, IDO1, which was known to be highly expressed in placental tissue, was shown to be essential for the protection of embryos from maternal immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>An IDO1 inhibitor, 1-methyl-tryptophan, caused rejection of fetuses capable of provoking the maternal immune response, whereas fetuses closely related to the mother, and thus less likely to provoke an immune response, survived (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This remarkable ability of a single enzyme to mediate such complex immune behavior has since been studied in depth, revealing a rich variety of mechanisms by which this enzyme affects immune regulation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Expression of IDO1 inactivates surrounding immune cells through the combined effects of low tryptophan and high concentrations of kynurenine (1, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>T cells are especially sensitive to low tryptophan concentrations, where they undergo cell cycle arrest (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the downstream metabolites of the product of IDO1 are potent activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor through which apoptosis of immune cells can be initiated (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>IDO1 has further been shown to provide protection from oxidative stress caused by inflammatory processes (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The importance of IDO1 in precise immune regulation is highlighted by its effects in a variety of processes and disease states, including autoimmune disorders, response to infection, tolerance in transplantation, HIV infection, and blood pressure regulation (13–15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This regulation/dysregulation is perhaps most sinisterly manifested in cancer cells that co-opt the immunosuppressive ability of IDO1 to evade immune destruction (16–18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional control of IDO1 in cancers is often altered through mutation of the Bin1 repressor that allows for vastly up-regulated levels of IDO1 (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Tumors displaying high IDO1 activity are associated with poor prognoses (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, IDO1 is a prime target in the treatment of almost all cancers for which IDO1 inhibition could restore the ability of the immune system to remove these cancer cells on its own or in combination with other treatments (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The immunosuppressive effects of IDO1 are also implicated in persistent bacterial infection, wherein IDO1 inhibition has been shown to aid in clearing the infection (21). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of IDO1 proceeds through a sequential oxygen insertion reaction, where molecular oxygen binds to the ferrous heme and then adds across the C2-C3 double bond of tryptophan through an alkylperoxo intermediate to afford the epoxide with the second atom of molecular oxygen left on the heme in a ferryl compound II structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This IDO1 ferryl is then proposed to attack the epoxide, breaking the oxygen–iron bond and reducing the iron back to the ferrous resting state (22–24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>This surprising ferryl attack on an epoxide has not been fully explored, as it is not the rate-determining step, but it is consonant with the recent revelations of the reactivity and versatility of compound II in other enzymes (25–27). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Typical of other heme proteins, IDO1 is vulnerable to competitive inhibitors, such as substrate mimics or compounds with heme binding capabilities (28–31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This strategy, however, has suffered from a paucity of inhibitors capable of the specificity and nanomolar binding affinity desirable in a pharmaceutical (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Exceptions to this long-standing paradigm have been reported recently that bind to the enzyme without binding directly to the heme iron (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We report here an examination of the unique inhibitory modes of two classes of inhibitors that display favorable specificity and robust inhibition of IDO1 (HeLa cell IC50 = 4.2 and 0.50 nM for compounds 1 and 2, respectively) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1719190115/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new">SI Materials and Methods</ext-link>) (34). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, IDO1 with added apo-myoglobin was seen to lose activity, interpreted as heme loss to apo-myoglobin, with nearly the same time and temperature dependence as it does with 1 and 2 (t1/2 = 17, 14, and 11 min, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This behavior is in contrast to the steadily maintained activity of IDO1 incubated in the absence of inhibitor or apo-myoglobin, indicating that heme binding to IDO1 is a dynamic, reversible process (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
