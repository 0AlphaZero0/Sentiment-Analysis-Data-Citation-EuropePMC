In China, the Lanzhou lamb rotavirus (LLR) vaccine is the only vaccine used to prevent rotavirus disease. From 2006 to September 2014, more than 54&#x02009;million doses of LLR vaccines have been lot released. It is a safety issue whether PCV1 is present in the LLR vaccine. Although the cell substrate of LLR, bovine kidney (BK), is different from that of Rotarix, we have investigated the cell&#x02019;s permissivity for PCV1 by both infectivity and full-length PCR analysis. We have assessed the LLR using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. A total of 171 random batches of LLR final products over a period of 5&#x02009;years were tested, and no PCV1 was detected (0/171). Infectivity studies showed that two strains of PCV1, the PCV1-prototype, which was derived from PK-15 cells, and the mutant, PCV1-GSK, which was isolated from Rotarix, were capable of replicating in BK cells over a wide m.o.i. ranging from 10 to 0.01. After culture for 6&#x02009;days, copies of PCV1-prototype DNA were higher than those of PCV1-GSK on average. The genome of the virus was detected at 6 days post-infection. In summary, the LLR vaccine is free of PCV1. Nevertheless, because PCV1 can replicate in the BK cell substrate, manufacturers need to be vigilant in monitoring for this adventitious agent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Porcine circovirus</kwd><kwd>Adventitious agents</kwd><kwd>Rotavirus vaccine</kwd><kwd>Infectivity study</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>LLR</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="sp1">National High Technology Research and Development Program</funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">2006AA02A206 &#x00026; 2012AA02A402</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="sp2">The 12th Five-year National Science and Technology Major Project</funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">2012ZX10004702</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="sp3">The Research and Development Fund for the Young and Middle-aged</funding-source><award-id rid="sp3">2011B02</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OpenAccessEmbargo</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1-2"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2010, porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) was discovered in Rotarix [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While only nucleic acid of PCV1 and PCV2 was found in RotaTeq without intact PCV virions, infectious PCV1 was shown to be present in Rotarix [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), vaccine manufacturers, and academic scientists confirmed the original results and investigated the source of contamination. It turned out that the Vero cell lines used to manufacture the vaccine were contaminated with porcine circovirus (PCV) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and arose most likely from the porcine trypsin used in the propagation of the Vero cells. PCV was first described as an unexpected contamination in the PK-15 (porcine kidney cells) cell line [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are two types of PCV: PCV1 and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). PCV2 causes post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PWMS) in swine, while PCV1 has not been shown to cause any porcine disease [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PCV DNA has been detected in 5&#x0200a;% of stool samples from US adults [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In another study which investigated whether PCV2 sequences could be detected in the stool of recipients of RotaTeq (which is contaminated with PCV2 DNA), 235 out of 826 samples (28.5&#x0200a;%) from 59 vaccine recipients were positive for PCV2 DNA [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, there was no evidence that this DNA shedding was associated with viable PCV. Neither PCV1 nor PCV2 is known to be pathogenic in humans [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1, 7, 8</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, PC?V is a novel adventitious agent that needs to be considered by the vaccine industry, especially since PCV infection is distributed worldwide in swine [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;12</xref>]. Unintentional introduction of adventitious agents is a recognized potential concern due to their exposure to animal-derived raw materials, such as porcine trypsin. In addition, PCV is highly resistant to many widely used inactivation procedures [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13, 14</xref>] and thus the risk of contamination is raised. These two rotavirus vaccines &#x02013; Rotarix and RotaTeq &#x02013; are widely used worldwide but not in China. In China, the LLR vaccine is produced in BK cells. From 2006 to September 2014, more than 54&#x02009;million doses of the LLR vaccine have been lot released [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Considering the similarity of the attenuated live vaccines and the manufacture processes among the rotavirus vaccines, an investigation for PCV1 in the BK cell substrate was warranted. However, there are differences between China&#x02019;s LLR vaccine and the other vaccines. The Vero cell lines used to produce Rotarix and RotaTeq are consistent batch-to-batch and easier to monitor because of the stability of the cell substrates. In contrast, BK cells are prepared with fresh bovine kidney (BK) cells and new cells are required for each batch of vaccine. Thus, the potential for contamination is increased and it is important to investigate whether the PCV1 was cultured in the BK cell. Consequently, the LLR final products should be monitored for PCV1 at the same time. In this study, we focused on detection of PCV1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>DNA sequencing and<bold><sc>blast</sc></bold> results</title><p>The full-length genomes of two PCV1 strains were amplified by PCR.

There are eight nucleotide differences between the two sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Results of infectivity studies</title><p>Results of infectivity assay are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The mock-infection groups (without virus inoculation) were PCV1 negative. After 6&#x02009;days of culture, the experimental groups were PCV1 positive with or without <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine pretreatment. However, pretreatment of <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a, c</xref>) significantly enhanced the viral replication at 3 days post-infection (p.i.) compared with the group without pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b, d</xref>). According to the data 6 days p.i., positive signals were detected from the infection with 106 copies ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (m.o.i.=10) and 103 copies ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (m.o.i.=0.01), which means that a small quantity of PCV1 could be enough to infect the BK cells. It is worth noting that using the same copies of PCV1 to infect the BK cells, the replication ratio differed between the two strains of PCV1. At 6 days p.i., copies of the PCV1-prototype are 13.3-fold (m.o.i.=10), 40.6-fold (m.o.i.=1), 85.3-fold (m.o.i.=0.1) and 50.7-fold (m.o.i.=0.01) higher than those of PCV1-GSK.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>PCV1 quantification results after the infectivity assay on BK cells.

From SV40 in polio vaccines [(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and bacteriophages in live viral vaccines [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17, 18</xref>], to reverse transcriptase activity in measles and other vaccines [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and PCV in rotavirus vaccines [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is not clear whether these adventitious agents are potential or real threats to human health. According to subsequent studies, PCV1 infects not only porcine source cells, but also cells from other species, such as the Vero cells in the recent incident, which indicates that PCV1 is capable of using more than one kind of cell as a host. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) investigated Rotarix extensively and the materials used at different stages of the production process. These assessments found the presence of PCV1 DNA in master and working cellular banks, as well as master and working viral seed stocks. Infectivity studies showed that PCV1 sequences in Rotarix bulks and final products were infectious. Although final products of GSK&#x02019;s other live viral vaccines were shown to be clear of PCV1, the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) harvest tested positive for PCV1, an unexpected contamination derived from the same cell bank as that used to produce Rotarix [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, no infectious virus was detected in IPV bulks. It was concluded that the source of PCV-1 contamination was non-irradiated trypsin that was used in the mid-1990s to manufacture the Vero cell banks [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Once passaged cells are contaminated by the infectious and intact PCV1, which persists without causing any visible cell changes, it is almost impossible to eradicate these agents.</p><p>PCV was reported as an unexpected contamination in the PK-15 (porcine kidney cells) cell line [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and thus we screened PCV1 in materials for cell culture in our laboratory to avoid confusing results before we started infectivity studies. Samples from the culture medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin (for cell culture and rotavirus activation, porcine-derived and bovine-derived), <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin, PBS and HEPES were tested and were found to be PCV1-free (data not shown). RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma cells), MA104 (African green monkey kidney cells), HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells), CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary cells), Vero (African green monkey kidney cells) and MRC-5 (human fetal lung fibroblast cells), which are widely used for vaccine production and in quality control assays, were also used in infectivity studies along with BK cells. PCV1 replicated significantly in Vero and BK cells while the other cell lines involved could not support PCV1 replication (data not shown), suggesting that PCV1 has a restricted host range. However, our results indicated that both strains of PCV1 have the ability to spread across species: from PK-15 to Vero (pig to monkey) and to BK (pig to cattle). The capacity of PCV1 to cross host species brings new concerns to the vaccine industry. Finding that PCV1 is able to infect CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD19+ and CD56+ human cells [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and the observation of productive PCV1 infection in a subclone of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] suggests potential risks for humans. The consequence of long-term contact with live PCV1 remains uncertain.</p><p>In our study, two strains of PCV1 were found to be able to infect BK cells within a range of m.o.i. from 10 to 0.01. This indicates the permissivity of BK cells for PCV1 and also demonstrates that PCV1 could be a contaminant in specific cells. Although the virus needs some special conditions (e.g. <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine) for optimal infection and replication, previous studies demonstrate that some commonly used substances (e.g. NH4Cl) might be able to achieve the same function [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Even without <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine being used for PCV12 infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, after 6&#x02009;days of cultivation the genome of PCV was detected in infected BK cells, suggesting the possible formation of the progeny virus. <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine accelerated the replication of virus at 3 days p.i. but did not increase the total amount of virus at 6 days p.i. However, the toxicity of <sc>d</sc>-glucosamine on low passage cells might affect the ratio of cell survival and decrease the virus production.</p><p>The BK cells used to produce the LLR vaccine are different from Vero cells. BK cells are only used within a finite period and then changed for the next batch of the LLR vaccine, which has advantages and disadvantages. Changing the production cells allows less time for PCV1 to adapt to the heterogeneous cells and decreases the possibility of permanent contamination. Using immortalized cells such as Vero, the vaccine manufacturing process might have an increased chance of being exposed to such an adventitious agent. Once established, though, the master cell bank is not changed during manufacture. This brings better consistency not only for vaccine quality, but also for the control of adventitious agents. In contrast, control of BK cells consumes much more energy because the cells are frequently changed. Thus, prevention and detection of adventitious agents are challenging.</p><p>The introduction of new technologies makes it possible to detect agents that we were unable to detect before, such as the product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for agents with transcriptase activity, and microarrays and high-throughput sequencing [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] for other potential contaminants. The virus itself does not remain stable genomically. The PCV1-GSK strain, compared with the PCV1-prototype, has eight point mutations, which might cause attenuation or adaption to the BK cells. Certainly, the PCV1-replicating capacity will require further study. The contaminated Vero cells and the vaccine final product might need to be cleansed of PCV1. Q Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography has been investigated with promising results [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Both the discovery of new adventitious agents and the solution of problems bring demands for development of technology.</p><p>We have monitored the LLR vaccine over 5&#x02009;years, including 171 batches. All of these rotavirus vaccine batches were PCV1 negative, suggesting the safety of the LLR vaccine with respect to PCV1 contamination. This may partly be a consequence of the cells used and of conventional monitoring. However, the production process of the vaccine is complicated, containing animal sera and other raw biological materials. The use of BK cells as the cell substrate for vaccine production requires attention to PCV1 control. Using PCV1 test is recommended in multiple steps of LLR vaccine production and in the screening of raw materials. Long-term surveillance is still essential.</p></sec><sec id="s1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although the BK cells are susceptible to PCV1, we have shown that 171 batches of the LLR vaccine are free from PCV1 contamination over 5&#x02009;years. We should strengthen our monitoring and incorporate the PCV1 test item as routine in the future to ensure the safety of vaccines and the health of recipients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1-6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Cells</title><p>BK cells were courtesy of Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products (LIBP, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, PR China).
