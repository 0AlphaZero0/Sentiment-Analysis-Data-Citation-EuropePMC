</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The intestinal inflammation associated with CD is caused by mucosal immune system reactivity to luminal antigen in genetically susceptible individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Active intestinal inflammation is associated with dysbiosis of the fecal and mucosal microbiota and increased intestinal permeability with alterations in innate lymphoid cell (ILC) populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Defects in the innate immune pathway in CD are implicated by pathogenic mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16L1) genes which suggest impairment of bacterial sensing and clearance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CD is associated with increased IL-12/IL-23 release from antigen-presenting cells and an imbalance in the differentiation of Th1/Th17 effector and regulatory lymphocytes (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CD is increasing in young adults who live with their disease for six decades (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition, there has been a significant increase in CD incidence in newly industrialized countries of Africa, Asia, and South America (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of CD in the UK stands at approximately 145/100,000 (5) with 9.5 new cases per 100,000 annually (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The highest prevalence in North America is reported in Canada at 319/100,000 (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Traditional medical management focuses on controlling intestinal inflammation using conventional or biological therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although many patients respond to first line biologic therapy, a recent prospective UK registry of 1,500 patients with CD commencing their first anti-TNF therapy reports primary non-response in between 16.9 and 23.7% of patients (7) and a secondary loss of response in a further 29% of patients over 2 years (7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recent single and multicenter cohort studies have reported a significant burden of adverse events with anti-TNF therapies including an increased risk of lymphoma independent of the use of concomitant thiopurine therapy (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The anti-integrin vedolizumab and the IL-12/23 antibody ustekinumab are both licensed as second-line biologic therapy for refractory CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, both therapies are less effective at inducing and maintaining remission in patients that have been exposed to anti-TNF therapy previously (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Although novel biological therapies are in clinical development none have reported short- or long-term remission rates in more than 50% patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, biologic therapies currently constitute the largest proportion of the total treatment costs of patients with CD (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Patients refractory to medical therapy and those who develop stricturing or penetrating complications of disease progression require surgical resection of the affected intestine (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, disease recurrence after surgery is common and many patients face repeated or extensive surgeries that may require a stoma or result in short bowel syndrome and a requirement for parenteral nutrition support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although the introduction of biologic therapies has been associated with a reduction in the rates of surgery over the recent decade, there has been no reduction in the requirement for repeat surgery (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Patients with active disease refractory to currently licensed therapies in whom surgery is inappropriate or declined face ineffective biologic therapy and frequent courses of corticosteroids which are associated with a significant burden of treatment-related morbidity and mortality and high health-care resource utilization (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There is a clear unmet need for an effective long-term therapy for this cohort of patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Over the last two decades, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) has been identified as a promising therapeutic option for patients with severe autoimmune diseases (ADs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients underwent peripheral blood stem cell mobilization with high-dose cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), after which they were randomized to immediate auto-HSCT or conventional care for 1 year (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint for the trial was defined as clinical disease remission (CDAI &lt; 150) for 3 months, with no medication for CD and no evidence of active disease on imaging and endoscopy at 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Few patients randomized to immediate HSCT or who underwent mobilization and were then randomized to conventional care achieved the ambitious primary endpoint at 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>However, ASTIC did demonstrate benefits of auto-HSCT over conventional care in more traditional endpoints for therapeutic trials in this area (18), such as steroid-free clinical remission (CR) and mucosal healing (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In addition, after the primary endpoint had been assessed, patients who had undergone mobilization and then been randomized to conventional care were offered auto-HSCT and then followed for a further year with identical assessments as in the randomized trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Subsequent analysis of the 38 patients who underwent auto-HSCT in the ASTIC program and had data at baseline and 1 year reported a significant reduction in clinical and endoscopic disease activity at 1 year, with 19 out of 38 (50%) patients showing regression of all endoscopic ulceration (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>There were also significant improvements in quality of life between baseline and 1 year after auto-HSCT (17, 19, 20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Importantly, disease recurrence after HSCT responded to the introduction of anti-TNF therapies (15, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The doses of cyclophosphamide used in both groups resulted in significant numbers of adverse events and one death (17, 21, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Subsequent expert review has suggested that the high dose cyclophosphamide regimen used at both mobilization and conditioning was a factor for many of the adverse events (17, 21, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This view is supported by the outcome of an uncontrolled series of 14 patients with refractory Crohn’s disease (CD) who underwent auto-HSCT using a lower dose of cyclophosphamide during mobilization (2 g/m2) and conditioning (50 mg/kg for 4 days). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The median duration of anemia and neutropenia was shorter after both mobilization and conditioning than that seen in previous reports using higher cyclophosphamide dosing, and few episodes of febrile neutropenia were reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The lower intensity regimen still resulted in marked reduction in clinical disease activity with 13 patients achieving disease remission (CDAI &lt; 150) at 30 days (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition, favorable long-term outcome after auto-HSCT in a single-center cohort of 29 patients with CD (some of whom participated in the ASTIC trial) has been described (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This includes 5-year follow-up data with scheduled clinical, endoscopic and radiological assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Drug-free clinical and endoscopic remission (CDAI &lt; 150, SES-CD &lt; 7) was seen in 61% at 1 year, 52% at 2 years, 47% at 3 years, 39% at 4 years, and 15% at 5 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>However, 80% of those patients who experienced a relapse responded to the re-introduction of anti-TNF therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Six out of the 29 underwent surgery after auto-HSCT, and 1 patient died of CMV infection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Clinical data were obtained for 82 patients from 19 centers in 7 countries, with clinical response being categorized as remission (no abdominal pain and normal stool frequency), significant improvement (improved pain and frequency), no change, or worsening of symptoms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 41 months (range 6–174). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>At 100 days post-HSCT, 64% of patients were in CR and a further 28% had experienced significant improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>At 1 year after transplantation, data from 75 patients indicated that 43% were in CR, 20% improved, 17% unchanged and 20% worsened. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>37% patients required surgery after auto-HSCT, and 73% re-started medical therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Of those requiring further treatment, 57% responded to therapies to which they had previously been refractory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Treatment-free survival, defined as survival without major surgery or medical therapy, was 27 and 22% at 3 and 5 years respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In addition, the EBMT ADWP has produced a historical summary of the AD section of the registry, which has characterized outcomes following auto-HSCT in various indications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Compared with MS, relapse is more common in CD, which may reflect fundamental differences in disease processes (24). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>As of November 2017, there have been a total of 166 transplant registrations for auto-HSCT of CD within the EBMT registry, with the majority 91.5% being in adults over 18 and 24% being treated as part of the ASTIC trial. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Specific studies of immune reconstitution in CD patients after auto-HSCT are limited to a few observations (25, 26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this review focuses on the general literature relating to immune reconstitution in ADs and highlights how it might be best investigated in patients with CD to identify mechanisms of action of auto-HSCT and gain insights into the pathogenesis of CD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="S2-1"><title><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Rationale and Mechanistic Studies of Auto-HSCT for ADs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The original goal of auto-HSCT in ADs was to eradicate existing autoreactive immunological memory and regenerate a naïve, self-tolerant immune system (27, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Auto-HSCT has been shown to profoundly impact the immune system, as indicated by the regeneration of naïve B cells (29, 30), thymic reactivation (29, 31–33), the emergence of a polyclonal T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (29, 31, 33), and restoration of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) (34, 35) and B regulatory cell levels (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>In addition, disease associated restriction of the peripheral blood Treg TCR repertoire is completely reversed by auto-HSCT, both in terms of number and uniqueness of Treg cell TCR sequences (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Functional assays investigating the fate of autoreactive T cells post-transplantation are limited due to restricted access to such cell clones in human disease compared to animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in vitro stimulation assays in SLE have been able to demonstrate that T cell responses to antinuclear antigens were abolished, whereas virus-specific T cells were readily detectable in the first months after HSCT (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Likewise, stimulation assays with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptides in auto-HSCT-treated MS patients revealed reduced interleukin-17 responses and enhanced transforming growth factor-β1 production compared to natalizumab-treated patients, suggesting removal of autoreactive T cell clones as well as enhanced suppressive responses after HSCT (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these observations suggest that auto-HSCT has indeed the potential to restore self-tolerance by “resetting” the chronic autoreactive immune system into a naïve state. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Compared with MS and rheumatological diseases, there are relatively little data specifically relating to immune reconstitution following auto-HSCT in CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The following sections will discuss how components of aberrant immunity may be investigated further in CD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Impact of Auto-HSCT for CD on the Innate Immune System </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The intestinal innate immune system not only protects against invading pathogens, it also regulates the interactions between the commensal intestinal microbiota and the host at multiple levels, many of which are altered in CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>A small study investigating the effect of auto-HSCT on the innate immune system in seven patients with moderate to severe CD has reported elevated numbers of peripheral blood TLR-4 expressing monocytes that also express TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma at baseline compared to healthy controls, which were normalized after transplantation (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>The impact of auto-HSCT on other intestinal innate immune populations has not been assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Studies on ILCs would be of particular relevance given their role in orchestrating immune defense and regulation at mucosal surfaces and their role in CD pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Impact of Auto-HSCT for CD on the Adaptive Immune System </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The increased responses of CD4+ Th17/Th1 cells toward bacterial-derived proteins that have been described in patients with CD suggest a potential mechanism for sustaining persistent disease (39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Elimination of such cells in vivo by immunoablative chemotherapy is presumed to ameliorate intestinal inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Conversely, recurrence of regulatory Foxp3+ Treg cells could restore self-regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate in CD after auto-HSCT is considerably higher compared to other ADs, which could be related to an insufficient eradication of the autoreactive immunologic memory by the conditioning regimens applied and/or a more prominent genetic contribution that favors disease recurrence. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Based on clinical trials and EBMT registry data, auto-HSCT represents a promising therapy for patients with severe resistant CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Prolonged responses have been achieved in some patients that have otherwise been resistant to conventional treatments and biological therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>In the patients who relapse, there appears to be a re-sensitization to previous agents, consistent with a “setting back of the immunological clock.” Previous clinical trials and case series report a relatively high relapse rate and high frequency of serious adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Future trials will assess the efficacy and safety of lower intensity mobilization and conditioning regimens and the benefit of protocoled introduction of maintenance therapy in patients who relapse after auto-HSCT. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinical trials of auto-HSCT provide a unique opportunity to characterize the nature of immune reconstitution as well as the interaction between the peripheral and mucosal immune system in CD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This will allow deep interrogation and characterization of the localized mucosal immune environment in patients with disease before and after auto-HSCT during ASTIClite, as well as the immunome of the periphery (by profiling peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) before and after auto-HSCT and during the progression toward disease relapse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Recently, the EBMT and European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation have published a review to encourage and guide inter-specialty collaboration in both clinical and scientific development of this auto-HSCT in CD (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Thus, in addition to therapeutic benefits, destroying and re-building the dysfunctional immune system and mucosal environment, a program of modern scientific investigation carefully scheduled around auto-HSCT may yield valuable insights into the etiology, pathogenesis, and mechanisms of treatment resistance in CD. </plain></SENT>
