</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In-stent restenosis (ISR), characterized by neointimal proliferation and/or neoatherosclerosis in the vessel of the stent, can cause a reduction in lumen diameter after stent implantation, which can directly induce the recurrence of angina symptoms or an acute coronary syndrome in patients and is usually life-threatening.[1]–[3] ISR has also been considered as formidable clinical problem for the interventional cardiologists. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In recent years, many remarkable improvements in medical technology of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), such as first-generation bare metal stents (BMS) and newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) have been achieved, which significantly reduce ISR occurrence in patients with PCI.[4],[5] For example, growing evidence has suggested that the safety and efficacy of revascularization procedures of newer-generation DES was greatly superior to those of first generation DES and BMS.[6]–[10] However, ISR rate remains as high as 5% to 10% for patients treated with newer-generation DES at two years.[11] More recently, a newly developed drug-eluting balloon (DEB) coated with paclitaxel, an antiproliferative drug that could inhibit neointimal hyperplasia, had emerged as an alternative therapeutic tool for ISR disease.[12],[13] DEB plays the anti-restenosis efficacy through a high-concentration, rapid local delivery of paclitaxel without the use of polymers on a stent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To date, there are numerous randomized trials performed to compare the safety and efficacy among plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), DES and DEB for the treatment of ISR.[14] One recent meta-analysis enrolled eight randomized controlled trials and indicated that DEB was a better option for treatment of ISR when compared to POBA.[15] Another meta-analysis showed that DEB and DES have similar efficacy and safety for the treatment of ISR.[16] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SeQuent® Please DEB is the only approved product utilized for ISR treatment in China.[17] Currently, a novel paclitaxel-coated balloon (RESTORE DEB) has been invented for the treatment of ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, clinical information on the two different types of DEB in treatment of ISR is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This trial aims to compare the safety and efficacy of the RESTOREDEB versus SeQuent® Please DEB for the treatment of coronary ISR in Chinese patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of ISR has greatly decreased with the remarkable improvements in medical technology, there were also numerous patients which were required target vessel revascularization.[1],[2],[18] DEB has emerged as a novel therapeutic tool for ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The advantages of DEB include effective anti-proliferative drugs delivery in the vessel wall, reduced duration of dual antiplatelet therapy without polymers and the avoidance of the stent implant.[14],[19],[20] The most commonly used DEB was the SeQuent® Please DEB and there were numerous studies have reported the safety and efficacy of SeQuent® Please DEB compared with other strategies for the treatment of ISR.[17],[21],[22] However, due to the lipophilicity and prolonged tissue retention rate of paclitaxel, the drug chemical status (crystalline or amorphous), the excipient or carrier used (different for each DEB), varied delivering balloon surface and the technology used to assemble all these components are equally important for the efficacy and contribute to each unique final DEB product. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>RESTORE DEB is the newer-generation coronary balloon catheter coated with paclitaxel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The RESTORE DEB catheter is a double lumen catheter for rapid exchange use with semi-compliant balloon and two radiopaque markers, proximal and distal, to aid in the balloon positioning under fluoroscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The coating of RESTORE DEB for the balloon consists of a degradable, drug-eluting Ammonium Salt-Paclitaxel composite, which could avoid drug washing off and the potential risk of micro embolization during catheter tracking to the lesion site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The coating layer of the RESTORE DEB catheter is applied to release an effectual proportion of paclitaxel to the vessel wall of the artery at the dilated stenosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The drug substance paclitaxel is known to reduce the risk of restenosis by inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>During the insertion of the balloon catheter and the coronary lesion tracking, the multi-folded balloon protects the loaded drug substance from early wash-off effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The anti-proliferative drug substance paclitaxel will be immediately released at the lesion site within 30-60 s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Bioavailability of paclitaxel is guaranteed because the drug substance is an integral part of the coating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Although there were a number of advantages in RESTORE DEB, few clinical trials have been conducted to study the safety and efficacy of this newer-generation DEB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In order to compare the safety and efficacy of the newer-generation DEB (RESTORE DEB) versus the most frequently used DEB (SeQuent® Please), we perform the first randomized clinical trial of the world to determine RESTORE DEB will be non-inferior to SeQuent® Please in Chinese ISR patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>As there was only one study showed the results of DEB in Chinese patients with ISR, we selected the parameter values in the PEPCAD China trial to calculate the sample size of this study and also consideration of possible 20% drop-out from the angiography follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Finally, the sample size of this study is 240, larger than that in the PEPCAD China trial (220 patients), and will be compared for in-segment late loss, the primary endpoint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our study will also be powered for the comparison of other secondary angiographic endpoint, binary restenosis rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The in-segment late loss and binary restenosis rate has been widely used and validated in previous trials comparing between different therapeutic strategies in PCI. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In the management of BMS-ISR, the PACCOCATH-ISR trial first reported that DCB was superior to POBA in fifty-two patients with BMS-ISR.[23] Following the cohort, angiographic results at six month and clinical outcomes at five years also confirmed the same conclusion.[24] The PEPCAD II trial enrolled 131 patients with BMS-ISR to compare the efficacy of DCB and DES, and showed that DCB was superior to paclitaxel DES in in-segment late lumen loss at 6 months.[25] However, the Ribs V Clinical Trial demonstrated that DES (everolimus) provide superior late angiographic findings compared with DEB.[26] The two randomized trials both demonstrated clinical outcomes were similar in DEB and DES groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Thus, all clinical data indicated that DEB was superior to POBA, and non-inferior to DES in the treatment of BMS-ISR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of DES-ISR is less than 10%, the treatment of DES-ISR is more therapeutic challenging than BMS-ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>In patients with DES-ISR, Rittger and his colleagues demonstrated that DCB was superior to POBA not only in late lumen loss, but also in clinical outcomes.[27] Another randomized clinical trial also reported angiographic and clinical superiority of DCB compared with POBA in 90 DES-ISR patients.[28] In addition, when compared the efficacy of DCB versus first generation DES, the non-inferiority of DCB was suggested by ISAR-DESIRE 3 trials in 402 patients with DES-ISR and by PEPCAD China ISR Trial in 220 Chinese patients with DES-ISR.[17],[29] Furthermore, several clinical trials were performed to compare the DCB with newer-generation DES in DES-ISR patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>However, the results were inconsistent or even contradictory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The RIBS IV randomized clinical trial enrolled 309 patients with DES-ISR to compare the DCB with DES (everolimus-eluting stents) and showed that newer-generation DES was superior to DCB in in-segment minimal lumen diameter at 9 months and clinical outcomes at 12 months.[30] Kawamoto, et al.[31] reported that there was no significant difference of clinical outcomes at 12 months between DCB and newer-generation DES in 179 patients with DES-ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>However, Almalla and his colleagues demonstrated that DEB was superior to newer-generation DES on the clinical outcomes in the treatment of DES-ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In this study a MACE rate of 8.6% was found in the DEB group at 12 months, which is much lesser than that in the newer-generation DES group in patients with DES-ISR.[32] These studies indicate that DEB is superior to POBA, but has similar efficacy for the treatment of DES-ISR. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>First, this trial included only 240 patients with ISR, the sample size was relatively small which was not fully powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Regarding the analyses in which the patients were stratified by diabetes status, the sample sizes in the subgroups were too small to limit the ability to explore effects in these subgroups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Second, this study is not a double-blinded trial as the treating physician could not be blinded since the two types of DEB were obviously different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Third, some clinical or angiographic features should also be considered in the process of random grouping, which could be helpful to study on the interaction effects between these selected features and the main outcomes, which will be beneficial for patients favor to select one DEB over another. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The results of this study will determine whether RESTORE DEB are able to obtain similar angiographic results compared with SeQuent® Please DEB in patients with coronary ISR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study will also compare the late clinical outcome of these two DEBs, thus providing new evidence to inform clinical decision-making. </plain></SENT>
