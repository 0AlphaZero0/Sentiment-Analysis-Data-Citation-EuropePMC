Mounting evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota likely contribute to the etiology of enterocolitis, so the aim of this study was to use a mouse model of post pull-through HAEC to compare the fecal bacterial communities of animals which developed HAEC to those free of enterocolitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ten <italic>Ednrb<sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic>/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup></italic> and 8wild type mice underwent the microsurgical pull-through surgery, and stool was collected at the time of surgery, and then either at 2 and 4 weeks after the operation, or when the mice developed enterocolitis. The mid-colon of all animals was collected, prepared and histologically graded for enterocolitis. Fecal DNA was isolated and bacterial 16S rRNA genes analyzed using Illumina sequencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Six <italic>Ednrb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice developed HAEC with a mean enterocolitis score of 5.7, while the remaining 4 mutant and 8 WT mice remained free of enterocolitis by 4 weeks. The HAEC group had lower alpha diversity by Chao1 analysis compared with WT group, while the <italic>Ednrb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice demonstrated distinct bacterial communities from WT mice on beta diversity analysis. The most striking finding was increased proportion of <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reduced Bacteroidetes compared with the NO HAEC and WT groups, suggesting <italic>Akkermansia</italic> may contribute to development of enterocolitis while Bacteroidetes may be protective.

These findings characterized the dynamic shifts in the gut microbial communities through the onset of post pull-through HAEC, and suggests that there may be identifiable bacterial community differences in HSCR patients that are high risk for developing HAEC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis</kwd><kwd>Hirschsprung enterocolitis</kwd><kwd>HAEC</kwd><kwd>pull-through surgery</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd><italic>Akkermansia</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteroidetes</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">DK104040</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">DK090281</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="31"/><page-count count="0"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most frequent potentially life-threatening complication of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) patients&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Reported incidence varies widely, ranging from 17&#x02013;50% with most contemporary series reporting approximately 30&#x02013;40% incidence in HSCR patients, with more than 80% occurring after pull-through surgery&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"> 3</xref>). While the etiology of HAEC is not clear, recent clinical studies have identified marked fecal bacterial and fungal community differences in patients with HAEC compared with those free from enterocolitis&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Some of the challenges with interpreting these human studies is variability between individual patient diets, antibiotic exposure, type of operation for HSCR, as well as lack of clear definition of what constitutes HAEC. To address some of these shortcomings, we created an experimental system to investigate HAEC bacterial community dynamics from the time of pull-through surgery to 4 weeks after surgery. Our lab employed a robust surgical model of post pull-through HAEC using Endothelin receptor B-null (<italic>Ednrb<sup><italic>&#x02212;</italic>/<italic>&#x02212;</italic></sup></italic>) mouse model of Hirschsprung disease with partial colon aganglionosis, that underwent a single-stage microsurgical pull-through operation closely mimicking treatment of HSCR in infants&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"> 8</xref>).

When post-surgical animals developed clinical signs of enterocolitis, they were euthanized and had stool and colon collected.

Animals that survived through the perioperative period of 5 days were then followed prospectively for development of clinical signs of enterocolitis for 28 days. All study animals had health assessments daily including body weight monitored every 2 to 3 days. Any animal appearing clinically ill was euthanized when it developed clinical enterocolitis defined as: reduced activity and weight loss, and either new onset of loose stools or lack of stooling. Stool specimens were collected for each animal at two or three time points: the first was collected on all animals at time 0, (the time of pull-through surgery); the second either at 14 days after surgery, or at the time of enterocolitis diagnosis and euthanasia; and the third 28 days after surgery for those animals surviving to this end point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). All feces specimens were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

More striking is the loss of species (OTU) richness associated with development of HAEC and the accompanying shifts in composition of taxa that had not previously been identified. Importantly, the HAEC phenotype had a marked expansion of phyla Verrucomicrobia and its genus <italic>Akkermansia</italic> with reduction of Bacteroidetes compared with the NO HAEC phenotype during the first 2 weeks after pull-through surgery. These novel findings suggests a causal role for <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, a mucin degrading gut commensal found in rodents, humans and many other species&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). While <italic>Akkermansia</italic> has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), it has been noted in mouse models to be markedly increased after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment to induce colitis in multiple studies (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and not in others&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Recent studies in IBD patients find reduced <italic>Akkermansia </italic>(<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"> 25</xref>). In light of these conflicting reports, it is unclear whether <italic>Akkermansia</italic> was acting as a pathobiotant promoting development of HAEC, or possibly playing a compensatory &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; role.</p><p>Conversely, Bacteroidetes were significantly lower in animals that developed HAEC (HAEC 2). These findings were remarkably similar to a study of the colonic bacteria in children with active HAEC at the time pull-through surgery by Li et al., which also identified reduced Bacteroidetes and a predominance of Proteobacteria compared with children without enterocolitis&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). An earlier study by our group focused on patients with a history of HAEC (but not active HAEC), found the proportion of Bacteroidetes unchanged compared with HSCR patients free from enterocolitis&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Bacteroidetes may be protective in active HAEC, and may return to baseline for HSCR patients after an HAEC episode. Of note, IBD patients also have reduced Bacteroidetes compared with normal subjects&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) suggesting that lower fecal Bacteroidetes may be associated with gastrointestinal inflammation rather than specific to HAEC. Furthermore, these findings lend support to our surgical mouse model of HAEC robustly mimics HAEC in children.</p><p>A new finding in this study was the reduction in the genus <italic>Dysgonomonas</italic> with HAEC (HAEC 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST5">Table S5</xref>), which has not been previously identified as associated with HAEC in human or animal studies. These findings suggests that <italic>Dysgonomonas</italic> may protect against development of enterocolitis in an acute setting, while a recent study of IBD patients found <italic>Dysgonomonas</italic> to be expanded in Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients and contracted in those with ulcerative colitis making it unclear of the role it may be playing in chronic gut inflammation&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Further, we also found <italic>Clostridium</italic> XIVa was elevated in the NO HAEC 2 and NO HAEC 4 groups compared with the NO HAEC 0 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST5">Table S5</xref>) suggesting <italic>Clostridium</italic> XIVa may also be protective against HAEC. Similarly, <italic>Clostridium</italic> XIVa has also been shown to be lower in ulcerative colitis patients compared with normal controls&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>When we compared our findings with two observational, non-surgical mouse studies utilizing <italic>Ednrb</italic> mutant strains similar to the one used in this study, there was an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, with reduced Firmicutes compared with wild type animals&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr"> 27, 28</xref>). Surprisingly, we found no difference between genotypes in Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes prior to surgery, while there were barely detectible fecal Proteobacteria in our mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST3">Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, as animals in the non-surgical mice developed enterocolitis, the only change was a reduction in proportion of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> while Bacteroidetes and <italic>Clostridium</italic> remained unchanged&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). We identified lower Bacteroidetes in both the HAEC and NO HAEC groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST3">Table S3</xref>), and increased <italic>Clostridium</italic> XIVa in the NO HAEC groups after surgery compared with WT groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST6">Table S6</xref>), and we did not identify <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> as a significant proportion of the bacterial community in our mice. It is important to point out some major differences in study design likely influenced the intestinal microbial ecology in both of these prior studies compared with our study. A significant difference is that animals in the non-surgical observational studies had untreated colonic obstruction (equivalent to untreated HSCR in humans) contributing to bacterial overgrowth, while in this study, the obstructing aganglionic colon was surgically removed and intestinal continuity reestablished. Another important difference is that in the current study we employed enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, around the time of surgery for wound infection prophylaxis which affected the fecal microbial communities. Lastly, the diagnosis of enterocolitis in the prior studies was based solely on subjective clinical observation of animal behavior rather than more objective histological grading of colon tissue for enterocolitis as performed in the current study. This critical difference opens the possibility that &#x0201c;ill-appearing&#x0201d; animals in the prior studies may, or may not, have actually had HAEC. Given these notable differences between study designs, comparing the results of prior non-surgical studies to the current study should be done with caution.</p><p>We also identified bacterial communities were altered by the pull-through surgery in the wild type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST1">Table S1</xref>) and were not associated with enterocolitis. On taxa analysis we found <italic>Dysgonomonas</italic> was lower in WT 2 and WT 4 animals compared with WT 0&#x000a0;(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST5">Table S5</xref>),&#x000a0;while <italic>Hymenobacteraceae</italic> and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> were elevated in WT 4 compared with WT2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ST7 ST8">Tables S7, S8</xref>). In one study, all three genera were altered after of gastric bypass surgery in adults with type 2 diabetes&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and elevated <italic>Lachnospiraceae,</italic> a mucus degrading commensal, was recently shown to be associated with anastomotic leak in colorectal operations&#x000a0;(<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), suggesting complex shifts occur in microbial populations depending on organ system, disease state and type of surgical procedure performed.</p><p>Treatment with antibiotics before and after the pull-through operation altered the bacterial microbiome significantly, but was necessary to successfully perform the microsurgical pull-through surgery and achieve post-surgical survival. It is also important to note that treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics is commonly performed in clinical care of children with HSCR prior to pull-through surgery and continued after surgery as well. Hence, our use of antibiotics in this study quite closely mimics clinical care children around the time of pull-through surgery. Nevertheless, these findings leave open the possibility that bacterial microbiome dynamics and changes in diversity play a role in development of HAEC, rather than specific phyla and genera as described DeFilippo et al (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Alternatively, differences in the fungal and viral microbiomes may provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying HAEC development but were not evaluated in this study.</p><p>Our findings raise the possibility that determination of fecal <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and/or Bacteroidetes proportions in children with Hirschsprung disease prior to their pull-through operation, may be able to identify high-risk patients for developing HAEC after surgery. However, given the obvious difference in species maintained in a controlled environment with SPF conditions and similar chow, which is not representative of the &#x0201c;dirty&#x0201d; world, it is likely that any microbial predictors in humans would be different from the ones identified above. Testing this hypothesis in children would require an appropriately powered and controlled study.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have identified a number of gut bacterial changes associated with the development of HAEC after pull-through surgery. We found increased <italic>Akkermansia</italic> and reduced Bacteroidetes suggesting that these and others may contribute to the HAEC phenotype in this model, and raising the intriguing possibility that there may be pre-surgical microbial markers in humans to identify high risk patients for HAEC. In the future, a prospective human study is needed to explore the microbiome changes that occur in Hirschsprung children around pull-through surgery and with development of HAEC.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The research protocol and all animal care procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol #2302) at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived study and designed the experiments: PF, JB.
