</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is the most frequent potentially life-threatening complication of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) patients (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Reported incidence varies widely, ranging from 17–50% with most contemporary series reporting approximately 30–40% incidence in HSCR patients, with more than 80% occurring after pull-through surgery (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While the etiology of HAEC is not clear, recent clinical studies have identified marked fecal bacterial and fungal community differences in patients with HAEC compared with those free from enterocolitis (4–6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Some of the challenges with interpreting these human studies is variability between individual patient diets, antibiotic exposure, type of operation for HSCR, as well as lack of clear definition of what constitutes HAEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To address some of these shortcomings, we created an experimental system to investigate HAEC bacterial community dynamics from the time of pull-through surgery to 4 weeks after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Our lab employed a robust surgical model of post pull-through HAEC using Endothelin receptor B-null (Ednrb−/−) mouse model of Hirschsprung disease with partial colon aganglionosis, that underwent a single-stage microsurgical pull-through operation closely mimicking treatment of HSCR in infants (7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Herein, we studied Ednrb−/− and wild type littermate control mice at the time of colon pull-through surgery, 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We compared the colonic bacterial populations of mice which developed enterocolitis with those free of enterocolitis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>A major finding of the study is that Ednrb−/− mice had distinct bacterial communities from the WT mice indicating that genotype was the primary factor selecting for these differences which was not surprising (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>More striking is the loss of species (OTU) richness associated with development of HAEC and the accompanying shifts in composition of taxa that had not previously been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the HAEC phenotype had a marked expansion of phyla Verrucomicrobia and its genus Akkermansia with reduction of Bacteroidetes compared with the NO HAEC phenotype during the first 2 weeks after pull-through surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>These novel findings suggests a causal role for Akkermansia, a mucin degrading gut commensal found in rodents, humans and many other species (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>While Akkermansia has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory properties (19), it has been noted in mouse models to be markedly increased after dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment to induce colitis in multiple studies (20–23) and not in others (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in IBD patients find reduced Akkermansia (19, 25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In light of these conflicting reports, it is unclear whether Akkermansia was acting as a pathobiotant promoting development of HAEC, or possibly playing a compensatory “protective” role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Conversely, Bacteroidetes were significantly lower in animals that developed HAEC (HAEC 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>These findings were remarkably similar to a study of the colonic bacteria in children with active HAEC at the time pull-through surgery by Li et al., which also identified reduced Bacteroidetes and a predominance of Proteobacteria compared with children without enterocolitis (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>An earlier study by our group focused on patients with a history of HAEC (but not active HAEC), found the proportion of Bacteroidetes unchanged compared with HSCR patients free from enterocolitis (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings suggest that Bacteroidetes may be protective in active HAEC, and may return to baseline for HSCR patients after an HAEC episode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Of note, IBD patients also have reduced Bacteroidetes compared with normal subjects (25) suggesting that lower fecal Bacteroidetes may be associated with gastrointestinal inflammation rather than specific to HAEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these findings lend support to our surgical mouse model of HAEC robustly mimics HAEC in children. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>A new finding in this study was the reduction in the genus Dysgonomonas with HAEC (HAEC 2) (Figure 6, Table S5), which has not been previously identified as associated with HAEC in human or animal studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>These findings suggests that Dysgonomonas may protect against development of enterocolitis in an acute setting, while a recent study of IBD patients found Dysgonomonas to be expanded in Crohn’s disease patients and contracted in those with ulcerative colitis making it unclear of the role it may be playing in chronic gut inflammation (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Further, we also found Clostridium XIVa was elevated in the NO HAEC 2 and NO HAEC 4 groups compared with the NO HAEC 0 group (Figure 6, Table S5) suggesting Clostridium XIVa may also be protective against HAEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Clostridium XIVa has also been shown to be lower in ulcerative colitis patients compared with normal controls (26). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>When we compared our findings with two observational, non-surgical mouse studies utilizing Ednrb mutant strains similar to the one used in this study, there was an increased proportion of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, with reduced Firmicutes compared with wild type animals (17, 27, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we found no difference between genotypes in Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes prior to surgery, while there were barely detectible fecal Proteobacteria in our mice (Figure 5, Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, as animals in the non-surgical mice developed enterocolitis, the only change was a reduction in proportion of Lactobacillus while Bacteroidetes and Clostridium remained unchanged (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>We identified lower Bacteroidetes in both the HAEC and NO HAEC groups (Figure 5, Table S3), and increased Clostridium XIVa in the NO HAEC groups after surgery compared with WT groups (Figure 6, Table S6), and we did not identify Lactobacillus as a significant proportion of the bacterial community in our mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>It is important to point out some major differences in study design likely influenced the intestinal microbial ecology in both of these prior studies compared with our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>A significant difference is that animals in the non-surgical observational studies had untreated colonic obstruction (equivalent to untreated HSCR in humans) contributing to bacterial overgrowth, while in this study, the obstructing aganglionic colon was surgically removed and intestinal continuity reestablished. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Another important difference is that in the current study we employed enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, around the time of surgery for wound infection prophylaxis which affected the fecal microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the diagnosis of enterocolitis in the prior studies was based solely on subjective clinical observation of animal behavior rather than more objective histological grading of colon tissue for enterocolitis as performed in the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This critical difference opens the possibility that “ill-appearing” animals in the prior studies may, or may not, have actually had HAEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Given these notable differences between study designs, comparing the results of prior non-surgical studies to the current study should be done with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>We also identified bacterial communities were altered by the pull-through surgery in the wild type animals (Table S1) and were not associated with enterocolitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>On taxa analysis we found Dysgonomonas was lower in WT 2 and WT 4 animals compared with WT 0 (Table S5), while Hymenobacteraceae and Lachnospiraceae were elevated in WT 4 compared with WT2 (Tables S7, S8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In one study, all three genera were altered after of gastric bypass surgery in adults with type 2 diabetes (29), and elevated Lachnospiraceae, a mucus degrading commensal, was recently shown to be associated with anastomotic leak in colorectal operations (30), suggesting complex shifts occur in microbial populations depending on organ system, disease state and type of surgical procedure performed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Treatment with antibiotics before and after the pull-through operation altered the bacterial microbiome significantly, but was necessary to successfully perform the microsurgical pull-through surgery and achieve post-surgical survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It is also important to note that treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics is commonly performed in clinical care of children with HSCR prior to pull-through surgery and continued after surgery as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Hence, our use of antibiotics in this study quite closely mimics clinical care children around the time of pull-through surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these findings leave open the possibility that bacterial microbiome dynamics and changes in diversity play a role in development of HAEC, rather than specific phyla and genera as described DeFilippo et al (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, differences in the fungal and viral microbiomes may provide additional insights into the mechanisms underlying HAEC development but were not evaluated in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Our findings raise the possibility that determination of fecal Akkermansia and/or Bacteroidetes proportions in children with Hirschsprung disease prior to their pull-through operation, may be able to identify high-risk patients for developing HAEC after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>However, given the obvious difference in species maintained in a controlled environment with SPF conditions and similar chow, which is not representative of the “dirty” world, it is likely that any microbial predictors in humans would be different from the ones identified above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Testing this hypothesis in children would require an appropriately powered and controlled study. </plain></SENT>
