</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating headache disorder and has been described as the most painful condition in humans.[1] Given the excruciating nature of the disorder, instituting proper treatment is paramount to improve the quality of life of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, many patients are undertreated, and in some cases, not treated.[2] Furthermore, individuals with CH are more likely to use prescription and nonprescription pain medications, including opiates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The chances of drug dependence are also higher among CH sufferers.[2] For these reasons, it is important than clinicians are aware of the different treatment options for CH, the evidence base to support their use and their appropriate implementation in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment for CH is involved three different strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The first is abortive, which refers to the treatment of an individual attack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Transitional treatment refers to the treatment given at the onset of a cluster period with the intention of decreasing the frequency of attacks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous with transitional therapy, preventive treatments are used for the anticipated duration of the cluster period to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of individual cluster attacks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We will review each of these below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that CH is a relatively uncommon disorder, affecting just 0.1% of the population, and there is a paucity of large-scale, controlled clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Many treatments are based on the lower quality of evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Below, we will discuss those agents with the highest quality of evidence, those most commonly used, and those which show promise and are under investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="sec1-2"><title><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>ABORTIVE TREATMENT </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A number of agents have been studied with regard to their abortive role in CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Given the rapid onset of a cluster attack with a very short time to peak intensity (&lt;15 min) and a relatively short duration of each attack (&lt;3 h), many of these agents are parenterally administered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The recommendations from the American Headache Society (AHS) guidelines for use vary from Level A to C.[3] There are also several agents that are sometimes used in clinical practice despite an uncertain level of evidence and no clear guideline recommendation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Oral </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The oral options for abortive therapy are limited, although Zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg have been shown to be effective at improving headache in one Class I randomized controlled trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was headache reduction at 30 min and reached significance in the episodic CH group (P = 0.02)[4] but not in the chronic CH[4] group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Other oral triptans, while sometimes used have not been studied in controlled trials for CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>While other oral triptans are sometimes used for the acute treatment of cluster headache, they have not been evaluated for efficacy in placebo-controlled clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Inhalational </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Oxygen is an established effective acute treatment option for CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Oxygen (100%) delivered at a rate of 6–15 L/min by nonrebreather face mask has been shown to improve headache in CH patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There have been several studies investigating the effectiveness of oxygen in CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The first double-blinded cross-over study was conducted in 1985 with 11 patients, treated with 6 L/min of oxygen by nonrebreather. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this study, 56% achieved complete or adequate pain relief in 80% of their attacks compared with 7% in the placebo group.[5] A subsequent double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study of 76 patients in 2009 found that 100% oxygen 12 L/min by nonrebreather face mask resulted headache response in 78% of patients compared with 20% for placebo.[6] Other series, unblinded or open-label studies have shown similar results, however, higher flow rates appear to be more effective.[78] More recently, a demand valve has been investigated in an open-label pilot study of four patients using a demand valve with promising results.[9] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Given the safety and efficacy of oxygen, all patients with CH or who are suspected to have CH warrant a trial of oxygen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It currently carries a Level A recommendation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The main drawback for oxygen is its lack of portability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It can be cumbersome and inconvenient for those with frequent attacks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, valves allowing for higher-flow oxygen which can be needed are not always readily accessible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Compared with zolmitriptan or sumatriptan, however, there is no defined limit to the number of times it can be used in a given day, and thus oxygen is a good choice for those with multiple attacks per day. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Intranasal </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Both zolmitriptan and sumatriptan are available in intranasal formulations and both have been studied in the abortive treatment of CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Zolmitriptan, both 5 and 10 mg have been shown to be effective (Level A).[91011] In a study of 52 patients, headache relief at 30 min was achieved in 50% of patients treated with 5 mg and 63.3% of those treated with 10 mg of zolmitriptan intranasal compared with 30% in the placebo group.[10] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Sumatriptan 20 mg is also likely effective in the acute treatment of CH and is a reasonable alternative to zolmitriptan.[12] Sumatriptan intranasal was evaluated in one double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 118 patients showing 30 min responder rates of 57% versus 26% for the placebo group (P = 0.002).[12] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The intranasal triptans are probably less effective than the injectable forms (discussed below) and are contraindicated in those patients with cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and severe hypertension. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, triptans, intranasal lidocaine have also been evaluated for the acute treatment of CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The exact dosages and preferred method of administration remain uncertain, but nasal drops, sprays, and application with cotton swabs with concentrations ranging from 4% to 10% have been suggested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The first study demonstrated that about one-third of the patients responded to ipsilateral lidocaine administration, but this was a small cohort and was not randomized or blinded.[13] In a subsequent double-blinded randomized study of 15 CH patients, all patients had a response to lidocaine administered bilaterally.[14] There does not appear to be any significant adverse effects from lidocaine, and despite the absence of a robust evidence base remains a viable option for some patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>While sometimes used in clinical practice, dihydroergotamine (DHE) has not been proven as an effective abortive therapy in CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>It may be worthwhile to attempt a trial of DHE in patients who are refractory to the more conventional treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>One double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of DHE in 25 CH patients suggests that intranasal DHE reduced the intensity, but not the duration of a cluster attack.[15] The typical dose for intranasal DHE is 1 mg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Like the triptan medications, DHE is contraindicated in those with coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Injection </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Injection therapies can be an excellent choice for patients with CH as they are rapidly acting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Subcutaneous sumatriptan has been shown in two Class I randomized control trials.[1617] One study of 131 CH patients reported headache relief in 75% of patients compared with 35% of placebo at 15 min (P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In a study involving 131 patients with CH, 75% treated with subcutaneous sumatriptan reported headache relief at 15 minutes compared to 35% treated with placebo (P &lt; 0.001).[17] An earlier, smaller study yielded nearly identical results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>It also found that 13% of patients also required oxygen as an adjunct.[16] Higher doses have been with higher incidence of adverse effects, and in fact, 12 mg was not found to be superior to 6 mg.[17] There are lower doses of sumatriptan injectable available (3 mg) which may also be effective some patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Those with long duration cluster periods and multiple attacks per day must be aware of the amounts of their overall consumption of the drug due to the risk of medication overuse headache. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>One randomized, placebo-controlled trial of octreotide 100 μg ended with 46 attacks treated with octreotide and 45 treated with placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The 30-min headache response rates were 52% and 36% (P = 0.007), respectively while the 30-min headache free rates were 33% and 13%, respectively (P = 0.04).[18] Overall, the treatment appears to be relatively well tolerated and may be a reasonable second-line alternative for those patients who have failed to respond or have contraindications to triptans. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) has long been a therapeutic target in the treatment of CH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Blockade of the SPG with suprazygomatic alcohol injections relieved pain in 85% of 120 patients (follow-up between 6 months and 4 years), but this procedure has fallen out of favor because of the potential for painful neuritis of the maxillary nerve.[19] Radiofrequency ablation of the SPG has been employed in uncontrolled small case series, with efficacy in 60%–80% of episodic cluster headache (ECH) and 30%–70% of chronic cluster headache (CCH) patients.[2021222324] While pulsed radiofrequency in 16 refractory patients with ECH and CCH resulted in complete remission within 6 days in 12 patients.[23] In 16 patients with refractory ECH and CCH, pulsed radiofrequency resulted in complete remission in 12/16 patients within 6 days. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Using endoscopic technique, 20 patients with refractor CCH were treated with injections of corticosteroid and local anesthetic directed toward the SPG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The improvement was seen in 58% of patients, but the duration of benefit was short making repeated injections less than attractive over time.[2526] Using a novel image-guided navigation system, 10 patients with refractory CCH were treated with SPG-directed injections of OnabotulinumtoxinA (25–50 units).[27] An average attack frequency reduction of 77% was seen in 5/10 patients over a 6-month follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>A multicenter, sham-controlled study using an implantable, on-demand SPG microstimulator (Pulsante®) in medically refractory chronic CH (Pathway CH-1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Of the 28 patients treated, 67.1% of patients had pain relief at 15 min compared with 7.4% of sham-control and 7.3% of subperception-treated attacks (P &lt; 0.0001).[28] In this trial, 36% of patients also experienced a reduction (&gt;50%) in the frequency of attacks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>A 24-month open-label follow-up study (n = 33) revealed an acute response in 45% and a frequency reduction in 33.[29] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>A second multicenter sham-controlled trial (Pathway CH-2) is now underway to further investigate the efficacy and safety of SPG stimulation (NCT02168764). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Transitional treatment (or transitional prophylaxis) is employed at the onset of a cluster period to provide rapid cessation or reduction in attack frequency during a short period of time until a long-duration prophylactic agent has its onset of effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Therefore, transitional and maintenance prophylaxis is often started simultaneously. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec2-6"><title><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Oral </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The options for oral transitional therapy are rather limited and are essentially restricted to corticosteroids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>While the optimal amount and duration of steroid treatment for transitional therapy are unknown, prednisone 1 mg/kg or a minimum dose of 40 mg is a commonly employed strategy in clinical practice.[30] One study of 19 CH patients revealed complete pain relief in 11 patients, 50%–99% relief in 3, 25%–49% relief in 3, and no response in 2 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Two other studies have yielded similar results.[31] The benefit of oral steroids is that their administration is not depending on an operator or a medical setting and is more convenient for the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>A tapering schedule over 1–3 weeks is a reasonable approach, but some studies have observed a taper period of as many as 30 days, which for some patients may be excessive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Oral triptans have been reported to be a potential option for transitional treatment in CH, but have been inadequately studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>While recent retrospective reviews have shown a possible benefit of Naratriptan,[32] studies on frovatriptan BID[33] and sumatriptan TID[34] have been disappointing and are not currently recommended as first- or second-line therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to determine whether certain patients be candidates for short-term triptan prophylaxis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids may also be of benefit for some patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Administering a single dose of 30 mg/kg of intravenous methylprednisolone has been shown to provide some patients with relief in open-label studies,[35] but this strategy has not been adequately studied to provide a more widespread recommendation for its use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, an intravenous dose can be used before starting an oral regimen for transitional therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Intravenous DHE may be a reasonable therapy for some patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>It has been studied when administered over an inpatient admission with repetitive infusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>All patients studied were headache free by the fifth admission day, 90% by the 3rd day and many patients remained headache free in the 3 months that followed although this was more robust in the episodic CH group compared with chronic CH.[36] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Injection therapies may be an excellent resource for some refractory patients, but they require resources such as an ambulatory infusion center, or in the case of DHE, may require admission to hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>As such, these strategies may not be readily available to all patients and place a larger burden on health-care resources. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>One randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of 43 CH patients demonstrated a robust effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>There was a reduction of daily attacks in 20 of 21 patients compared with 12 of 22 controls (odds ratio 15.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8–116.9, P = 0.012).[27] The effect of these injections appears to be temporary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>At 15- and 30-day posttreatment, the treatment and placebo groups did not differ in a study by Leroux et al.[37] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>A recent observational study revealed that triamcinolone and bupivacaine injections lead to a longer pain-free period in episodic compared with chronic CH patients.[38] In clinical practice, the steroid component and injection pattern may differ somewhat among practitioners and further research is required to determine which ingredient is superior and whether the combination of a steroid and local anesthetic is superior to either in isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>It is typical to introduce a maintenance prophylactic treatment simultaneous with the suboccipital steroid injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>These injections are typically well tolerated and safe with minimal adverse effects but do require a visit to a provider who can perform the procedure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Most treatments that are available for the preventive treatment of CH are oral medications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Despite routine clinical use of many of these treatments, the evidence for their use is modest. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The dose range used for verapamil is wide and ranges from 240 to 960 mg/day (in divided doses), although most patients will respond at doses lower than 480 mg daily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>No high-quality studies have been carried out, but even a small dose of 360 mg has been found to be superior compared with placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 30 CH patients.[39] By week two of the trial, both the attack frequency and abortive medications used were lower in the verapamil group compared with placebo (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.004, respectively).[39] Verapamil has a Level C recommendation from the AHS guidelines[30] but a Level A recommendation from the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines.[31] Patients using verapamil should be counselled regarding its side effect such as constipation, peripheral edema, and hypotension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Because of a risk of heart block, a baseline electrocardiogram should be obtained before beginning treatment and should be repeated 2–4 weeks after each dosage increase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Lithium has a Level C recommendation from the AHS[3] and a Level B from the EFNS.[40] Several open-label studies have shown efficacy[41], and a comparison with verapamil showed similar results between the two agents.[42] The target dose is typically 600–1500 mg daily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Common side effects include tremor, diarrhea, and polyuria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>As it has a rather narrow therapeutic range, serum levels may need to be monitored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Lithium is generally considered a second-line agent.[42] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Melatonin (Level C recommendation from the AHS[3] and EFNS)[40] at a dose of 10 mg may be effective in patients with episodic CH,[43] but is less effective in chronic CH.[44] Melatonin is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Clinical experience suggests that some patients may respond to elevated dosages of melatonin (20 mg). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>At higher doses, there may be issues with paradoxical insomnia or nightmares. </plain></SENT>
