In contrast, the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has enabled gene discovery in mutant lines maintained on an inbred genetic background. This approach utilizes genetic variation derived from ENU-induced variants for mapping and reduces the likelihood of phenotypic variation, making it an ideal method for genetic modifier screening. Here, we describe the results of such a screen, wherein we determined the minimal number of mutant genomic DNA samples to include in our analyses and improved the sensitivity of our screen by individually barcoding each genomic DNA library. We present several unique cases to illustrate this approach&#x02019;s efficacy, including the discovery of two distinct mutations that generate essentially identical mutant phenotypes, the ascertainment of a non-ENU-induced candidate variant through homozygosity mapping, and an approach for the identification of putative dominant genetic modifiers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Mus musculus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Colgalt1</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plod3</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Kif20b</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Tgds</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Fbn2</italic></kwd><kwd>Mutant screen report</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Historically, mutagenesis screens in the mouse have relied on polymorphic variation between strains to facilitate homozygosity mapping. This strategy requires an outcross, which may involve a great deal of time, breeding, and effort. After mapping the locus, one may need to rely on beneficial recombination in subsequent affected individuals to narrow the interval, while searching for ENU-induced mutations by individually sequencing exons within the locus. This method also does not lend itself particularly well to genetic modifier screening, as the polymorphic variation from the outcross strain may add additional complexity to both the phenotype and the genetic analysis. Our laboratory (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gallego-Llamas <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>) and others (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bull <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Simon <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Caruana <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>) have developed strategies that use next-generation sequencing technologies to accelerate homozygosity mapping, variant calling, and confirmation on an inbred background. Doing so minimizes phenotypic variation and limits genetic variation to ENU-induced variants. We sought to optimize this approach for the discovery of genetic modifiers of developmental phenotypes.</p><p>The traditional outcross has been similarly optimized to provide fine mapping of the locus with a minimal number of markers (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Moran <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). ENU induces roughly 3000 heritable variants per genome (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Quwailid <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>); ascertainment of even half that number of variants is more than enough to map a causal locus (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Moran <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Our bioinformatics analysis of mutagenized inbred lines involves dividing the genome into windows of a specified size and calculating the following for each window: the number of homozygous SNPs, percentage of homozygous SNPs, and the percentage of nonreference alleles, which we call the novel allele frequency (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gallego-Llamas <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). Loci with a high number and percentage of homozygous SNPs and a high novel allele frequency represent regions that contain a concentration of homozygous ENU-induced variants. It is worth noting that the variants used to map the locus will likely include the causal mutation. We focused our analysis on variants that occur in coding regions or splice sites and conducted Sanger sequencing on additional affected embryonic DNA samples to identify the causal variant.</p><p>Our initial attempt to map and ascertain ENU-induced variants using this method was successful and yielded valuable insights (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gallego-Llamas <italic>et al.</italic> 2015</xref>). First, we found that WGS provided better mapping resolution than whole-exome sequencing. Second, pooling samples without individually barcoding them can complicate the analysis. We conducted WGS on individually barcoded sample libraries in all the work described in this report. This led to some additional insights regarding the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and power of our approach. We discovered five mutant alleles: two of which have not been previously described, and three that are remutations of previously characterized mutant loci (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Rautavuoma <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ruotsalainen <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dwyer <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Arteaga-Solis <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Browning <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chaudhry <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Miller <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Shi <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref>). We have successfully mapped loci using as few as two mutant samples, we have learned that this technique is sensitive enough to identify two independent mutations that cause what was thought to be one mutant phenotype, and we have used this method to clone a non-ENU-induced mutant locus. Additionally, this strategy can be used to query putative modifying loci regardless of inheritance pattern.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Generation of mutant mice</title><p>All animal work was reviewed and approved by the Seattle Children&#x02019;s Research Institute&#x02019;s (SCRI) Institutional Care and Use Committee.

G1 male mice were shipped to Seattle Children&#x02019;s Research Institute and bred to C57BL/6J females. G2 daughters were backcrossed to the G1 male and were checked daily for the presence of a copulation plug. Embryos were screened at either E17.5 or E18.5 for mutant phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Genomic DNA isolation</title><p>Genomic DNA for WGS was extracted from mutant embryonic liver samples using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (#69504) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, but with some modifications. Approximately 10 mg of embryonic liver was used, and was snipped into very small pieces in individual plastic weigh boats with fine dissecting scissors. Lysis buffer was used to collect all of the tissue from the weigh boat. Samples were digested with the Proteinase K provided in the kit (20 mg/ml) for 1 hr, with vortexing every 10 min. RNA was digested with 8 &#x003bc;l of RNase A (QIAGEN #19101, 100 mg/ml at 7000 units/ml) for 2 min. Two elutions were conducted into two separate microfuge tubes, with elution buffer incubated on the column for 5 min before centrifugation. DNA was tested at SCRI for purity and quality using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and the Qubit dsDNA Broad Range Assay (#Q32850; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In summary, we divided the genome in windows and identified high-quality ENU SNPs. We subsequently counted the number of homozygous variants, percentage of homozygous variants, and average nonreference allele frequencies for each window. To identify potential casual variants, we identified all coding and splice site (within 10 bp of an exon) homozygous mutations of good quality.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Heterozygous modifier identification</title><p>We used two approaches to identify ENU-induced dominant modifiers, either using individual mice or a combination of all reads for a phenotype. For individual mice, we identified ENU SNPs by eliminating from further consideration those in dbSNP, Sanger mouse strains, in-house pedigrees, or repeat regions. We then identified SNPs that had total coverage of five reads or greater per individual sample, and had either a heterozygous or homozygous mutant genotype in all mice analyzed (five individuals for cleft palate and three individuals for exencephaly). For the combined sets, we identified high-quality ENU SNPs by; removing SNPS if they were in dbSNP, a Sanger mouse strain, an in-house unrelated pedigree, or a repeat region. We also required SNPs to have a quality score of &#x02265; 30 and coverage of five or more reads.

In addition, the founders of these mutant lines were offspring of our previously described sequential dosage pipeline (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gallego-Llamas <italic>et al.</italic> 2016</xref>), which resulted in many of our founder males belonging to one of several pedigrees. Mutant lines where multiple affected embryos were observed in more than one litter were selected for further study. Five mutant phenotypes were discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Together, they represent a collection with craniofacial, eye, and digital anomalies. Embryonic liver served as the source of genomic DNA for WGS, while liver and tail were used for other downstream applications, including PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing. Once more than eight embryos with these phenotypes had been collected, their genomic DNA was extracted and the samples with the highest yield and best A<sub>260</sub>:A<sub>280</sub> ratio were selected for WGS, followed by homozygosity mapping to map ENU-induced homozygous loci and variant calling to determine likely candidate variants.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Mutant phenotypes discovered by ENU mutagenesis.

Three founder males from the same ENU pedigree produced embryonic progeny with these phenotypes. Due to their shared lineage, we initially presumed that this phenotype was caused by a single mutation. Embryos exhibited bent wrists, open eyelids, eye defects, edema, short rib cages, and growth insufficiency. We named this presumed single mutant phenotype <italic>fosse</italic>. A total of eight genomic DNA samples from <italic>fosse</italic> embryos from two of the three founder males were used for library preparation and WGS analysis.

Multiple iterations of our analysis with different combinations of samples were conducted, which ultimately revealed that the presumptive <italic>fosse</italic> phenotype was, in fact, two nearly identical mutant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, A and B</xref>) caused by two independent mutations (Tables S1 and S2 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300292/-/DC1/FileS1">File S1</ext-link>).

While it is possible that a causal mutation will occur in nontranscribed sequences, there is presently only one report documenting an ENU-induced mutation occurring in a regulatory region (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Sagai <italic>et al.</italic> 2004</xref>) and a single report describing an ENU-induced mutation in a microRNA seed region (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Lewis <italic>et al.</italic> 2009</xref>). There may be bias in the conclusion that exons and their flanking regions are likely to contain the mutated nucleotide, as nontranscribed regions are often not examined in detail. However, in the characterization of ENU mutants mapped to loci where known candidates reside, causal sequence variants can usually be found in coding regions or splice sites [<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Hart <italic>et al.</italic> (2005)</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the homozygous regions in the two <italic>ugli</italic> mutants identified a missense mutation in <italic>Plod3</italic> as the only coding/splice site variant.

Our analysis of one of our mutants (<italic>timon</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), led to the identification of a non-ENU-induced candidate variant. The pedigree of this line was rather complex, given that the G1 male and his only G2 male offspring had reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To secure the line, progeny testing from brother&#x02013;sister matings was successfully utilized to identify obligate carriers, and the carrier males obtained were fertile. Three affected individuals&#x02019; genomic DNA samples were sent for WGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, arrows). However, the homozygosity map that we generated from all three individuals&#x02019; data did not yield a clear region of interest. Analysis of a map generated from two of the more closely related individuals&#x02019; data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, asterisks) identified two homozygous regions, one on chromosome 7 and one on chromosome 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Genotyping of additional affected embryos across these two intervals allowed us to exclude the locus on chromosome 7, and indicated that the causal mutation was in the distal portion of the interval on chromosome 18 (Table S4 in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.g3journal.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/g3.117.300292/-/DC1/FileS1">File S1</ext-link>). Importantly, examination of the third sequenced mutant confirmed that it also carried homozygous variants on distal chromosome 18. However, a recombination event occurred in the region that resulted in an interval in all three affected mice that was smaller than the window used for homozygosity mapping. While this initially confounded our mapping analysis, it ultimately facilitated the localization of the likely candidate mutation. In fact, reduction of window size uncovered the homozygous region; however, this was at the expense of marker numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Pedigree and homozygosity mapping of <italic>timon</italic> indicates autosomal recessive inheritance and a causal locus on mouse chromosome 18.

We tested the effect of an intronic variant in <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> on the mRNA transcript via RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, but the transcript sequence was normal (data not shown). This suggested the possibility that the causal variant was not induced by ENU, but was a spontaneous mutation of some kind.</p><p>To identify a larger insertion or deletion, we identified all reads within the recombination region that had been trimmed, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the full read did not map at the same location.

After many years of productive forward genetic screens in mice, this work illustrates that there are still new discoveries to be made using this strategy. In addition to generating new models of human disease, the generation of nonlethal hypomorphic alleles can allow the study of gene function <italic>in vivo</italic> in cases where a null allele would prove these analyses to be impossible. We have further refined our inbred screening genetic analysis, demonstrating that analysis of three samples from a mutant phenotype will identify candidate regions with high confidence. Importantly, individually barcoding the samples increases the likelihood that one will find the causal loci in genetically complicated scenarios, such as we experienced with <italic>Colgalt1</italic><sup>fosse</sup>, <italic>Plod3</italic><sup>ugli</sup>, and <italic>Fbn2</italic><sup>timon</sup>. We suggest that our strategy is useful for identifying both recessive and dominant genetic modifiers, and deeper sequencing of affected individuals could reduce the number of candidates to an even more manageable number.
