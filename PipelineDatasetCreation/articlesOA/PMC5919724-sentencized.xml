<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This strategy requires an outcross, which may involve a great deal of time, breeding, and effort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After mapping the locus, one may need to rely on beneficial recombination in subsequent affected individuals to narrow the interval, while searching for ENU-induced mutations by individually sequencing exons within the locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This method also does not lend itself particularly well to genetic modifier screening, as the polymorphic variation from the outcross strain may add additional complexity to both the phenotype and the genetic analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our laboratory (Gallego-Llamas et al. 2015) and others (Bull et al. 2013; Simon et al. 2015; Caruana et al. 2013) have developed strategies that use next-generation sequencing technologies to accelerate homozygosity mapping, variant calling, and confirmation on an inbred background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Doing so minimizes phenotypic variation and limits genetic variation to ENU-induced variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We sought to optimize this approach for the discovery of genetic modifiers of developmental phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The traditional outcross has been similarly optimized to provide fine mapping of the locus with a minimal number of markers (Moran et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>ENU induces roughly 3000 heritable variants per genome (Quwailid et al. 2004); ascertainment of even half that number of variants is more than enough to map a causal locus (Moran et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our bioinformatics analysis of mutagenized inbred lines involves dividing the genome into windows of a specified size and calculating the following for each window: the number of homozygous SNPs, percentage of homozygous SNPs, and the percentage of nonreference alleles, which we call the novel allele frequency (Gallego-Llamas et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Loci with a high number and percentage of homozygous SNPs and a high novel allele frequency represent regions that contain a concentration of homozygous ENU-induced variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that the variants used to map the locus will likely include the causal mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We focused our analysis on variants that occur in coding regions or splice sites and conducted Sanger sequencing on additional affected embryonic DNA samples to identify the causal variant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Our initial attempt to map and ascertain ENU-induced variants using this method was successful and yielded valuable insights (Gallego-Llamas et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>First, we found that WGS provided better mapping resolution than whole-exome sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Second, pooling samples without individually barcoding them can complicate the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>We conducted WGS on individually barcoded sample libraries in all the work described in this report. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This led to some additional insights regarding the sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and power of our approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We discovered five mutant alleles: two of which have not been previously described, and three that are remutations of previously characterized mutant loci (Rautavuoma et al. 2004; Ruotsalainen et al. 2006; Dwyer et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 1998; Arteaga-Solis et al. 2001; Browning et al. 2001; Chaudhry et al. 2001; Miller et al. 2010; Shi et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We have successfully mapped loci using as few as two mutant samples, we have learned that this technique is sensitive enough to identify two independent mutations that cause what was thought to be one mutant phenotype, and we have used this method to clone a non-ENU-induced mutant locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Additionally, this strategy can be used to query putative modifying loci regardless of inheritance pattern. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>While it is possible that a causal mutation will occur in nontranscribed sequences, there is presently only one report documenting an ENU-induced mutation occurring in a regulatory region (Sagai et al. 2004) and a single report describing an ENU-induced mutation in a microRNA seed region (Lewis et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>This leads us to conclude that the fosse phenotype is caused by the missense variant in Colgalt1, and that the ugli phenotype is caused by the missense variant in Plod3; this is supported by the functional relatedness of these two genes. Colgalt1 and Plod3 both encode enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of collagens [reviewed in Yamauchi and Sricholpech (2012)]. Colgalt1 is a galactosyltransferase and has been shown to act in vitro on hydroxylysines in collagen types I–V (Schegg et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The GGT activity of Plod3 is critical for collagen type IV deposition and function in vivo (Rautavuoma et al. 2004; Ruotsalainen et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, Plod3 mutations that result in either complete loss of function or loss of GGT activity result in embryonic lethality (Rautavuoma et al. 2004; Ruotsalainen et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Our Plod3ugli/ugli embryos die in either late gestation or neonatally. </plain></SENT>
