For example, the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chemotaxis machinery is localized to the cell poles. Here we describe the polar localization of the serine chemoreceptor Tsr using a strain synthesizing a fluorescent Tsr-Venus fusion at a low level from a single-copy chromosomal construct. Using photobleaching and imaging during recovery by new synthesis, we observed distinct asymmetry between a bright (old) pole and a dim (new) pole. The old pole was shown to be a more stable cluster and to recover after photobleaching faster, which is consistent with the hypothesis that newly synthesized Tsr proteins are inserted directly at or near the old pole. The new pole was shown to be a less stable cluster and to exchange proteins freely with highly mobile Tsr-Venus proteins diffusing in the membrane. We propose that the new pole arises from molecules escaping from the old pole and diffusing to the new pole where a more stable cluster forms over time. Our localization imaging data support a model in which a nascent new pole forms prior to stable cluster formation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM62662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wanner</surname><given-names>Barry L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000076</institution-id><institution>Directorate for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1244286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wanner</surname><given-names>Barry L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health award GM62662 to B.

The polar localization of chemoreceptors, like the serine chemoreceptor Tsr, is required sensing environmental signals [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Tsr is a highly abundant transmembrane methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) and is stably localized at the poles in variably sized clusters [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], which are necessary for collaborative signalling [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tsr is one of five MCPs that form heterotrimeric membrane complexes at the poles [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the polar distribution of Tsr is asymmetric and changes during the cell cycle. Such asymmetry may be crucial in chemotaxis, chromosome segregation, and motility [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One way polar localization is thought to be achieved depends on the geometrical curvature of the cell and segregation of chromosomal DNA to the polar regions [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The problem of polar localization has been previously investigated using single molecule techniques which provide direct imaging of the trajectories of individual molecules in living cells. Deich et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that the membrane-bound histidine kinase PleC localizes to the flagellar pole in motile swarmer cells of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> during asymmetric cell division. The mobile fraction of newly synthesized PleC molecules are homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasmic (inner) membrane and show no active, direct transport to re-localize during development from the motile swarmer cell to the pre-divisional cell. Similar results were observed for the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>crescentus</italic> chromosome anchor protein PopZ [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195887.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These results support a model in which protein redistribution arises from random diffusion and capture, as proposed by Rudner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Shapiro et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Other mechanisms of polar localization also exist. Targeting of the outer membrane virulence protein IcsA to the pole, which is required for unidirectional actin-based movement of <italic>Shigella flexneria</italic> in the host cell [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], is generated by its delivery exclusively at one pole. A polar gradient of IcsA is generated by lateral diffusion from the pole through the outer membrane. Similar observations were also seen in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as well as more distantly related <italic>Yersinia pseadotuberculosis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], suggesting that the mechanism of polar targeting of these outer membrane proteins is conserved. Jain et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] extended these findings to the large autotransporter family of virulence proteins. Chromosome segregation during cell division in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and related bacteria depends on separation of the nucleoids to polar regions. Woldringh et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] proposed that this is acheived by transient constraining of DNA segments by coupled transcription-translation-secretion (&#x0201c;transertion&#x0201d;) of membrane proteins and a bias in the creation of transertion regions when chromosomes are replicated bidirectionally and newly replicated neighboring genes for membrane proteins are expressed.</p><p>Considering the localization of chemoreceptors in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, recent publications have shown the importance of the Tol-Pal complex [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], nucliod-exclusion [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and membrane curvature [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Shiomi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the aspartate chemosensor Tar first appeared within the cylindrical portion of the cell and was distributed in a helical pattern that colocalized with the Sec translocation machinery but not with the helical cytoskeletal protein MreB. They found Tar localized to the poles 80 minutes after induction. Thiem et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed through fluorescently labeling CheR, which binds to the C-terminal of Tsr and Tar, that clusters of chemoreceptors occur at regular intervals along the cell body marking future cell division sites. Also using fluorescently labeled CheR, Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that deletion of the Tol-Pal trans-envelope complex severely disrupted the polar localization of chemoreceptor clusters. Neeli-Venkata et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] proposed a model where nucleoid exclusion coupled with diffusion-and-capture by the Tol-Pal complex fit their results on Tsr localization. Further, membrane curvature at the poles has been shown to assist in localization of large clusters of chemoreceptors [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195887.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been shown elsewhere that Tsr accumulates at the poles linearly over time [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The greater accumulation of Tsr at the old pole relative to the new pole was used to discriminate the two poles in this study. Here we examined how Tsr is localized to the poles. We coupled ensemble and single molecule quantitative imaging methods to study the asymmetry of the poles in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p><p>We recently found that the majority of newly synthesized Tsr accumulate at the old poles of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and diffuse at different rates at the polar and cylindrical surface regions [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also showed that there is no active transport for Tsr mobility. Single pole photobleach/recovery experiments show that newly emerging molecules are first aggregated at the old pole. Direct fluorescence imaging implies that the new pole matures through capture of molecules escaping the old pole and diffusing to the new pole region. Our results are consistent with the model that newly synthesized Tsr is first inserted at or near the old pole, where Tsr is captured by existing chemotaxis complexes, but can escape and freely diffuse throughout the cell membrane and captured by small or unstable seeds of Tsr (or other chemotaxis complexes) clusters at the new pole.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Experiments were carried out using cells attached to glass slides which permitted examining individual cells over time. By observing numerous cells over 5 min growth periods, we quantified the positions of individual Tsr-Venus molecules within single cells. In these experiments, we bleached all Tsr-Venus fluorescence in living cells at time zero and again at 1-min intervals after imaging newly observed Tsr-Venus molecules. Cells were sheltered from illumination between observations to allow for newly synthesized and maturing Tsr-Venus molecules appear without photobleaching.</p><p>We found through direct single molecule counting, a total of 2356 new fluorescent spots among 1956 cells were observed over a 5 minute time scale, with 630 cells displaying more than one event, implying an upper bound for the protein production rate of 0.24 proteins per cell per min. Further, spots were not homogeneously distributed; rather, 83% were localized near poles, defined as a sphere 0.5 &#x003bc;m in radius, located within 0.5 &#x003bc;m from a cell end. As expected, the synthesis rate of Tsr-Venus is low (0.24 proteins/min measured over 1956 cells) and newly synthesized Tsr-Venus was first observed mostly near the poles, which is where MCP chemotaxis clusters are located (see Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the photostability of the poles, we performed whole cell photobleaching. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows individual image frames extracted from a typical movie (out of ~100 cells imaged) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s002">S1 Movie</xref>) showing photobleaching of both poles under continuous illumination. The left panel is an integrated image of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s002">S1 Movie</xref> (1316 frames, at 30 fps), which shows one pole is significantly brighter than the other when viewed as a single, long exposure image with much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Here we will refer to the bright pole from the integrated image as the &#x0201c;old pole&#x0201d; and the dimmer pole as the &#x0201c;young pole&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The image sequences show young poles bleach more quickly than the old poles throughout. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows the intensity profile of a linear cross section along the long axis of the cell (red dotted line in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) as a function of bleaching time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1C</xref> shows the total intensity of young and old poles (circled areas in left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

The fluorescence intensity at old poles was reduced only 30% within 5 sec while intensity of young poles dropped 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

On average, cells recovered about 33% of their total initial fluorescence intensity through new synthesis and maturation of Tsr-Venus. Comparing the recovery pattern in each cell, we found one pole consistently recovered more quickly than the other. If one pole was brighter than the other before bleaching (e. g., cells 2 and 3), the brighter pole recovered more fully. When the poles were equally intense (e. g., cell 1), the fluorescence intensity recovered fully only at one pole and increased over time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref> after 30 min and 1 hr recoveries, respectively.</p><p>To test fluorescence intensity recovery at the poles individually, we shuttered illumination of one pole, photobleached the other, and monitored the fluorescence reduction of the sheltered pole. Loss of fluorescence from the sheltered area occurs when the number of escaping molecules exceed the production of new Tsr-Venus molecules. For cells with one brighter pole, sheltering the brighter one and photobleaching the other led to an average of 25% (n = 21 cells) loss of fluoresecence intensity of the sheltered pole. In contrast, sheltering the dimmer pole and photobleaching the brighter one led to an average of 90% (n = 50) loss of fluoresecence intensity of the sheltered pole. These results imply that Tsr-Venus molecules at the dimmer pole are more loosely held and can easily escape. These experiments underline the asymmetry of Tsr complexes of the poles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s004">S3 Movie</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the asymmetry of Tsr-Venus at the poles, we carried out similar experiments except in the presence of subinhibitory chloramphenicol (20 &#x003bc;g/ml, final), which blocks cell division without inhibiting protein synthesis [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], leading to elongated cells of ca. 10 &#x003bc;m in length. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g003">Fig 3A</xref> illustrates recovery of fluorescence intensity of an elongated cell with poles of similar brightness.

By using Tsr-Venus, we specifically showed: a) the bright (old) pole photobleaches more slowly than the dim (new) pole when photobleaching the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g001">Fig 1</xref>); b) the old pole recovers fluorescence intensisty faster after whole cell photobleaching; c) both poles exchange Tsr-Venus with diffusing molecules in the membrane, however the old pole is more stable than the young pole (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g003">3</xref>); and d) localization analysis shows areas of the new pole where the new polar cluster forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195887.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Results from single pole photobleaching and recovery show the relative stability of the two poles. When both poles show similar intensities, sheltering the new pole from photobleaching shows substantial reduction of fluorescence of the new pole, implying that molecules localized near the new pole easily escape. Conversely, sheltering the old pole reveals much less reduction of fluorescence of the old pole, implying that the old pole is much more stable and/or rapidly accumulates newly synthesized Tsr-Venus after bleaching. We also observed that the old pole recovered fluorescence much faster than the new pole region after bleaching either pole singly.</p><p>We previously showed that Tsr-Venus molecules in the inner membrane freely diffuse on 5 ms time scales [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also found that the majority are trapped at the poles within nested compartments of 170 nm and 290 nm length scales. A non-Gaussianity test of individual Tsr-Venus trajectories showed that Tsr-Venus was constrained by these compartments at time scales longer than 5 ms. Notably, we found no evidence that Tsr-Venus is stably immobilized to any immobile structure at the poles, rather Tsr-Venus molecules are restricted from escape (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s001">S1 File</xref>) which is consistent with recently found mechanisms for corralling chemoreceptors into the polar region (such as the Tol-Pal complex [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and membrane curvature effects [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). A small fraction (7%) of molecules was found diffuse freely in the membrane with a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>/s. Presumably, these molecules are the ones that escape and are free to explore the entire cell. They may originate from the relatively stable old pole or unstable newly forming new pole.</p><p>By applying single molecule localization analysis techniques to images of the freely diffusing Tsr-Venus molecules, we obtained trajectories showing a propensity of Tsr-Venus to localize near the new pole, further underlining the relative stability of the two poles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195887.s001">S1 File</xref>). Together these findings are consistent with a transertion-diffusion-capturing mechanism for pole maturity combining the previously proposed transertion mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with diffusion-capturing mechanisms[<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195887.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195887.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for the polar localization of Tsr at the poles.</p><p>Accordingly, we propose that newly synthesized Tsr preferentially accumulates near the old pole by interacting with relatively stable chemotaxis complexes containing other proteins of the chemotaxis machinery at that pole. The new pole is populated by Tsr molecules (or small clusters) that escape the old pole and diffuse through the membrane to the newly forming pole. Over time, accumulation of Tsr into clusters containing other chemotaxis proteins at the new pole forms stable chemotaxis complexes that matures into stable old pole structures during cell division.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Cells</title><p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> K-12 BW36931 has a single copy of the CRIM plasmid[<xref rid="pone.0195887.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] pYY37 (<italic>att&#x003bb; kan phoAp</italic>-<italic>tsr</italic>-<italic>venus</italic>) in BW36010 (MG1655 &#x003a6;(<italic>lacZp4105</italic>(UV5)-<italic>lacY</italic>)<italic>638</italic>(DE<italic>lacZ</italic>) <italic>rph</italic><sup>+</sup> DE(<italic>araBAD</italic>)<italic>567</italic>).
