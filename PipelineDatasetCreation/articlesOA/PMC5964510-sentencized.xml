</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional profiling of pathogens in relevant host environments has led to increased understanding of the host-pathogen dialogue and to the identification of pathways that are essential for pathogen survival in a niche-specific manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Several studies have indicated that the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts toward the utilization of lipids in vivo (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The relevance of understanding the physiology of the pathogen in a lipid-rich environment is further supported by the fact that M. tuberculosis resides in triglyceride-rich caseating granulomas in tuberculosis patients (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These granulomas constitute a complex environment of extracellular bacilli that emerge after the necrosis of infected cells (7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>There have been several attempts to delineate the physiology of M. tuberculosis in a lipid-rich environment using transcriptome analysis, largely limited to in vitro conditions of fatty acids as the chief carbon source or the addition of detergents that mimic fatty acid stress (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, M. tuberculosis is known to cocatabolize multiple carbon sources (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The problem is compounded by the fact that nutrient availability in the host may affect other physiological characteristics that affect innate immune defenses (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, as macrophages differentiate to foamy macrophages in atherosclerosis, in addition to the lipid-loaded phenotype, lysosomal acidification is impaired (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The differentiation process may bring about differences in the relative abundances of several macro- and micronutrients that cannot be envisaged in a simplified in vitro model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a complex cellular system with lipids as the chief variable is required in order to understand pathogen physiology in a lipid-rich host environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>To understand the relevance of host lipid-associated features in guiding the adaptation of M. tuberculosis to a lipid-rich environment, we used an adipocyte model of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here we found bacilli achieving growth in a lipid-rich necrotic environment offered by adipocytes during infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to perform global transcriptome profiling of M. tuberculosis isolated from adipocytes and preadipocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Physiological and biochemical evidence supported transcriptomic evidence on increased fatty acid and differential iron availability encountered by bacilli associated with adipocytes, with the bacilli acquiring an increased ability to mitigate oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This work led us to identify an unprecedented link between iron storage in bacteria and the lipid content of the host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This finding provides a new perspective on host-pathogen interactions and raises the possibility that microbes that invade lipid-rich niches may have an inherent robust capacity to counter oxidative stress; hence, targeting these may provide improved pathogen clearance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional signatures of M. tuberculosis in human sputum and granulomas (13, 14) are limited in their ability to highlight the heterogeneity in bacterial physiology based on the lesion environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We wanted to understand the physiology of M. tuberculosis in a lipid-rich cellular environment, and therefore, we utilized triglyceride-rich 3T3L1 adipocytes and their precursor preadipocytes as hosts for infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Preadipocytes were differentiated to adipocytes with concomitant increases in triglyceride pools (see Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>S1A in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To check if adipocytes and preadipocytes internalize M. tuberculosis, we immunostained for collagen or the M. tuberculosis surface, followed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A, B, and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, ∼80% of bacilli were intracellular (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, as the duration of infection increased, there was evident extracellular growth of bacteria and necrosis of cells (Fig. 1; also Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>S1B in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>At this point, both cell types lost their integrity, and mycobacterial cords were found to be extracellular and tightly bound to the necrotic cells (Fig. 1B, C, and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Bacillary counts increased almost 50-fold in 5 days and remained constant thereafter in both cellular models of infection (Fig. 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The sustenance of bacillary growth by primary human adipocytes corroborated the growth of H37Rv on 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>By determining CFU counts in the culture supernatants and surface-attached contents of the well separately, we observed that the majority of the bacilli grew attached to the necrotic cells, while only ≤9% of the total population was recoverable from the cell culture medium (Fig. 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the number of surface-attached bacteria or the medium-recoverable fraction of bacteria between adipocytes and preadipocytes (Fig. 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We utilized the cell-impermeant DNA dye Sytox green to measure necrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>As early as 24 h postinfection, we observed approximately 5% Sytox green-positive adipocytes and preadipocytes; this proportion increased over 8 days to 50% and 20%, respectively (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>By day 10 postinfection, very few 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-positive nuclei could be observed (Fig. 1A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we concluded that both the cellular models of infection provide necrotic cellular environments, one with higher triglycerides than the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The surface-attached bacteria from both adipocytes and preadipocytes were further studied on the hypothesis that the necrotic adipocyte environment would mimic the necrotic lipid-rich environment of caseous granulomas found in human tuberculosis, whereas the preadipocyte environment, although necrotic, would not be lipid rich and therefore could serve as a control. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We found 144 protein-coding genes to be upregulated and 114 protein-coding genes to be downregulated in MtbA relative to MtbP (Fig. 2; see also File S1 in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In this study, we utilized the adipocyte model of M. tuberculosis infection to mimic bacterial physiology in a necrotic lipid-rich host environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Our study highlights the end-stage, extracellular state in which mycobacteria reside in a lipid-rich environment, akin to the caseous environment encountered by M. tuberculosis in a necrotic granuloma (7, 36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>We described differential expression of protein-coding genes and, on the basis of transcription factor network analysis, identified iron response as a major signature of these bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>We show that the host environment, besides being a rich source of fatty acids, is also enriched in ferritin, an iron carrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that oleic acid, a host-derived fatty acid, induces resistance to oxidation of the mycobacterial cytosol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This resilience helps an otherwise iron-mediated oxidative-stress-sensitive mutant of M. tuberculosis (ΔbfrAB) to grow in the adipocyte model, while it remains attenuated in preadipocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Additionally, host ferritin likely provides an iron-rich environment, which is limiting in preadipocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Previous work that has addressed the physiology of bacteria under in vitro conditions of fatty acid availability showed differential expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and redox mitigation (8), findings similar to those in our cellular model (File S3 in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>In this work, we delineate a functional coupling of ferritin and increased fatty acid availability in the context of cellular infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>This aspect seems to be unique to the host cell physiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>High ferritin levels are also associated with foamy macrophages in atherosclerosis (37) and during fibroblast-to-adipocyte differentiation (38), where ferritin is proposed to protect cells from oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The ability of host ferritin to load and offload iron might provide the requisite buffering of free iron, which, in an otherwise oxidative environment, may be damaging to the bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Specific distribution of high ferritin expression in lipid-rich macrophages of infected C3HeB/FeJ mice further validates the lipid-iron link we established using the adipocyte model of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Earlier work has also shown that caseous granulomas from human tuberculosis patients are associated with higher expression of ferritin (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>In addition, the guinea pig model of infection provided evidence for increased ferritin levels in cells peripheral to the necrotic core and increased extracellular iron within the acellular core of the TB granuloma (39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Increased availability of host ferritin therefore limits the requirement for siderophore production and export by mycobacteria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>BfrA has been shown to be dispensable for iron-dependent growth of M. tuberculosis, while BfrB is required for optimal growth in an iron-dependent manner (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The role of BfrB is particularly complex: not only does it provide protection against high iron levels, but it also enables growth under conditions of iron limitation (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, these genes synergize in the protection of M. tuberculosis against oxidative stress (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of the double mutant in guinea pigs could be due either to direct iron-dependent killing of the mutant or to sensitivity to oxidative stress (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Our data show that in lipid-rich cells, the bfrAB mutant could be protected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that ferritin and fatty acids, both of which are more abundant in adipocytes than in preadipocytes, offer protection to this mutant in otherwise growth-limiting broth culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that protection from oxidation of the cytosol may be responsible for the benefit offered by oleic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Previous work with bfrA, bfrB, and bfrAB double deletion mutants has revealed that both bfrB and bfrAB mutants are attenuated in mouse and guinea pig models of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>We predict that the same phenotype would be found in C3HeB/FeJ mice; lipid-rich foamy macrophages would appear during the course of infection, prior to which the bfrAB mutant would already be attenuated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>As these new niches develop, bfrAB might become nonessential for mycobacterial growth, while these genes would continue to be required for bacterial growth in nonfoamy macrophages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The adipocyte model was first described by Neyrolles et al. as a model for mycobacterial dormancy (40), while we describe a scenario of higher metabolic activity of M. tuberculosis using adipocytes as the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>One of the key differences between that study and ours is the finding that adipocytes are able to sustain the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, while the clinical strain used in the earlier study underwent nonreplicating persistence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>We suspect that this could be due to inherent strain differences, since subsequent studies that used H37Rv also found growth of M. tuberculosis in adipocytes (41, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Our model is a chronic infection model such that we capture bacilli attached to the necrotic cells on which they have grown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Recently, there has been interest in trying to understand mycobacterial physiology in environments that mimic the extracellular stage of infection in necrotic and cavitary lesions (7, 43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Attachment of bacteria to host components as a complex biofilm-like structure contributes to the formation of drug-tolerant extracellular bacilli (43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Our data describe the formation of extracellular cords of bacteria attached to the necrotic host cell components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Due to the complex nature of the infection model, where bacteria grew as cords attached to necrotic cells, an accurate assessment of individual bacillary counts that were intracellular or extracellular could not be made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>At least 90% of the cords were definitely extracellular in both cellular models at the time of transcriptome profiling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Intracellular bacteria might be facing hypoxia and iron limitation, while extracellular bacteria would be sufficiently oxygenated and would encounter adequate iron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Had we sampled the bacteria at earlier time points, lower expression of hypoxia and iron response genes in the adipocyte infection could be due to slightly higher numbers of extracellular bacilli in the adipocyte model than in the preadipocyte model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>The relatively lower expression of iron-scavenging genes in adipocyte-grown bacteria is likely not due to this difference at day 10, since even compared to medium-grown bacilli, adipocyte-grown bacilli had lower abundances of iron-scavenging gene transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The current model should be further improved to incorporate features of hypoxia that bacilli are likely to encounter within a granuloma in the necrotic core (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Our findings may have wider implications for the control of bacteria in caseous granulomas and also for other human pathogens that encounter lipid-rich environments, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Trypanosoma cruzi (45, 46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Further genetic approaches are required to understand pathways that are essential for the survival of bacteria in this environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In addition, oxidative stress is inherent to the mechanism of action of isoniazid, a frontline TB drug (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Adipocyte-grown M. tuberculosis exhibits tolerance to isoniazid (40; also data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Therefore, inhibiting pathways that are essential for oxidative stress mitigation under lipid-rich conditions might increase the efficacy of this antibiotic. </plain></SENT>
