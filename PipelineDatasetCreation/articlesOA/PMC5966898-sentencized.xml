</text></title><p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Recent advances to identification of gene regulation in cancer have enabled the selection of targeted therapies to inhibit specific regulators of oncogenic signaling pathways essential for tumor development and maintenance [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These therapies prolong survival but are not curative, since most patients develop acquired resistance within the first few years of treatment [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although a wide variety of molecular alterations that confer resistance to the treatment have been described, the mechanisms and timing of their evolution are still poorly characterized [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As serial biopsies along the treatment period are impractical due to the invasiveness and high costs of the procedure, the molecular alterations associated with acquired resistance are only known when resistance has already developed and little is known about what changes occur at earlier or later time points during the targeted therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The lack of adequate in vitro and in vivo time course datasets makes it challenging to delineate the two predominant hypotheses for how therapeutic resistance develops: (1) the presence of small populations of resistant cells that will survive the treatment and repopulate the tumor; or (2) the development of de novo resistance mechanisms by the tumor cells [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the dynamics of genomic alterations induced during acquired resistance can identify targetable oncogenic drivers and determine the best time point to introduce alternative therapeutic strategies to avoid resistance establishment [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors represent a common class of targeted therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against EGFR, is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>As with other targeted therapies, stable response is not observed for a long period and virtually all patients invariably develop acquired resistance [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the establishment of in vitro models of acquired cetuximab resistance [9] provide a unique opportunity to study the time course of genetic events resulting in acquired resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cell lines chronically exposed to the targeted agent develop resistance and can be sequentially collected during the course of treatment to evaluate the progressive molecular changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Previous studies to assess the mechanisms of acquired cetuximab resistance have been limited to comparing the genomic profile of the parental intrinsic sensitive cell line to stable clones with acquired resistance [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these studies fail to capture the dynamics of acquired molecular alterations during the evolution of therapeutic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The development of in vitro time course data to determine the molecular drivers of therapeutic resistance is crucial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These experimental systems have the further advantage that time course data can also be generated for untreated controls, enabling the distinction of the molecular mechanisms associated with acquired resistance from those that would occur due to the long-term culturing over the time period that resistance develops. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Along with novel time course datasets, inferring the specific and targetable signaling changes that drive therapeutic resistance also requires new bioinformatics pipelines to analyze and visualize these data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The bioinformatics pipelines must integrate genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional changes from multiple-high throughput platforms to infer the complex gene regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for acquired resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Current supervised bioinformatics algorithms that find time course patterns in genomic data adjust linear models to correlate molecular profiles with known temporal patterns [12–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Many unknown variables such as culture conditions, immediate response to cetuximab, and adaptive changes may have confounding effects on known covariates of therapeutic response such as growth rates, colony size, or apoptosis rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Unsupervised bioinformatics algorithms learn the dynamics directly from the high-throughput data, and therefore do not require a priori knowledge of the complex dynamics associated with therapeutic response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Some unsupervised algorithms [16–21] seek breaking points of coherent, regulatory relationships to infer the dynamics along pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Many of these algorithms trace individual phenotypes or individual genomics platforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Their ability to determine drivers of gene expression associated with acquired resistance from time course data in multiple experimental conditions and multiple genomics data modalities is emerging [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Further extensions are needed to contrast the dynamics of signaling response to therapy to the dynamics of control conditions to distinguish the specific molecular processes that are unique to resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Matrix factorization algorithms are unsupervised and can distinguish the relative molecular changes in each experimental condition over time without requiring prior knowledge of gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We have found that Bayesian, non-negative matrix factorization algorithms such as Coordinate Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) [23] can extend beyond clustering to robustly quantify the dynamics and infer the gene regulatory networks directly from the input time course data [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The CoGAPS error model can also be modified to enable data-driven inference in distinct molecular platforms for inference of epigenetic regulation of gene expression [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed a new bioinformatics analysis pipeline for integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation changes that occur during the time course progression of resistance to targeted therapies using CoGAPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Genes uniquely associated with these changes were selected using a PatternMarker statistic [26] to enable novel visualization of molecular alterations dynamics inferred with CoGAPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In order to benchmark our new bioinformatics pipeline, we used an in vitro HNSCC cell line model to induce resistance and measure the molecular changes using high-throughput assays while the resistant phenotype developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Gene expression and DNA methylation changes were screened weekly while acquired cetuximab resistance was induced in SCC25 cell line (intrinsic sensitive to cetuximab) and compared to the status of the untreated controls at the same culturing time point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>CoGAPS [26] inferred specific patterns of expression and DNA methylation that are associated with the gradual establishment of acquired cetuximab resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The onset of methylation changes associated with resistance is temporally delayed relative to expression changes suggesting that epigenetic alterations stabilize the transcriptional changes relevant to the resistant phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This analysis found anti-correlated changes between DNA methylation and gene expression in FGFR1 during acquired therapeutic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Upregulation of FGFR1 has previously been associated as a mechanism of acquired cetuximab resistance in HNSCC [27–29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The identification of a canonical marker of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in this present study corroborates the efficacy of our experimental model and analytical algorithm to identify mechanisms of resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the anti-correlation between FGFR1 methylation and expression suggestive of its epigenetic regulation in acquired resistance to cetuximab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Thus, this pipeline can identify mechanisms of gene regulation in acquired resistance from high-throughput, multi-platform time course data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The resulting bioinformatics pipeline is poised to infer the dynamics of acquired resistance from emerging time course data with other cancer types and therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
