Blockade of the TL1A pathway has been shown to reduce inflammatory responses while leaving baseline immunity intact, and to be beneficial in animal models of colitis and asthma. Given the therapeutic potential of blocking this pathway in IBD and asthma, we developed C03V, a human antibody that binds with high affinity to soluble and membrane-bound TL1A. In an assay measuring apoptosis induced by exogenous TL1A, C03V was 43-fold more potent than the next most potent anti-TL1A antibody analyzed. C03V also potently inhibited endogenous TL1A activity in a primary cell-based assay. This potency was linked to the C03V-binding epitope on TL1A, encompassing the residue R32. This residue is critical for the binding of TL1A to its signaling receptor DR3 but not to its decoy receptor DcR3, and explains why C03V inhibited TL1A-DR3 binding to a much greater extent than TL1A-DcR3 binding. This characteristic may be advantageous to preserve some of the homeostatic functions of DcR3, such as TL1A antagonism. In colitis models, C03V significantly ameliorated microscopic, macroscopic and clinical aspects of disease pathology, and in an asthma model it significantly reduced airways inflammation. Notable in both types of disease model was the reduction in fibrosis observed after C03V treatment. C03V has the potential to address unmet medical needs in asthma and IBD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>C03V</kwd><kwd>DcR3</kwd><kwd>DR3</kwd><kwd>fully human</kwd><kwd>inflammatory bowel disease</kwd><kwd>TL1A</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="29"/><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>TL1A (also known as tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 15 [TNFSF15]) is a member of the TNF ligand superfamily and, like other members, is homotrimeric.

</p><p>The affinity of C03V binding to human TL1A was determined using a Kinetic Exclusion Assay (KinExA). KinExA measures the free concentration of one of the binding partners without perturbing the equilibrium of the solution. The assay was performed with the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig.&#x000a0;2A</xref>), or TL1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Fig.&#x000a0;2B</xref>), as the constant binding partner (CBP). C03V is a high affinity antibody to TL1A with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 41 pM. Using SPR, C03V did not bind to other TNF ligand superfamily members, including TNF-&#x003b1;, GITR ligand, 4-1BB ligand, CD27 ligand, CD30 ligand, CD40 ligand, LIGHT, TRAIL, APRIL, BAFF, EDA-A1, EDA-A2, RANK ligand, OX40 ligand, lymphotoxin &#x003b1;, lymphotoxin &#x003b2; and FAS ligand (Supp. Figure&#x000a0;1A). TWEAK and CD27 were analyzed separately from the other family members as these required a different SPR assay format. C03V did not bind these family members either (Supp. Figure&#x000a0;1B and 1C).

Given the utility of blocking the TL1A pathway in IBD and asthma, we sought to develop a neutralizing antibody to exploit these attractive features.</p><p>Here, we report the characterization of C03V, a human antibody, which binds with high affinity (41 pM) and selectivity, and neutralizes TL1A bioactivity. Affinity determination by KinExA measuring free analyte after interaction equilibrium allows accurate measurements of affinity even in circumstances where avidity contributes to the binding, such as in this instance where TL1A is trimeric and the antibody is dimeric. Selectivity evaluation by SPR showed that, despite the high homology between members of the TNF ligand superfamily, there was no binding observed to known TNF superfamily member ligands. C03V is thus a high affinity antibody with exquisite selectivity for TL1A.</p><p>Given the respective roles of the two TL1A receptors, DR3 in proinflammatory signaling and DcR3 as a natural antagonist of this system, an antibody that preferentially inhibits the TL1A-DR3 interaction while allowing the TL1A-DcR3 interaction would be highly desirable, effectively enabling dual modes of TL1A blockade. Based on the X-ray crystal structure of TL1A in complex with DcR3, Zhan et&#x000a0;al. concluded that DR3 and DcR3 have distinct but overlapping binding sites on TL1A.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Despite this overlap, during our antibody discovery campaigns we were able to identify an antibody with preferential DR3 inhibition. We show that C03V is able to inhibit TL1A binding to DR3 to a greater extent than DcR3 (78-fold), and we have identified a site on TL1A to which the C03V antibody binds that preferably disrupts the DR3 interaction over the DcR3 interaction. This supports the hypothesis that, although DcR3 competes with DR3 for TL1A binding, the two do not share identical molecular footprints. Alanine scanning of the TL1A sequence identified TL1A-R32 as a critical residue for C03V binding. When substituted, this residue resulted in a 50% decrease in TL1A binding to DR3, but no decrease in DcR3 binding. Therefore, the epitope encompassing TL1A-R32 is a critical region involved in DR3 binding and confers on C03V a DR3&#x0003e;DcR3 selective inhibition profile. The residual DcR3 activity associated with this binding profile could contribute to homeostasis of TL1A and other DcR3 ligands FAS Ligand and LIGHT.</p><p>C03V, an antibody with high affinity and ability to preferentially block TL1A-DR3, was tested for functional activity in a TL1A-induced apoptosis assay using the TF-1 cell line. We compared the activity of C03V with antibodies publicly disclosed as inhibitors in this assay, including one that has progressed to clinical trial. With an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 12 pM, C03V was the most potent antibody at inhibiting TL1A-mediated apoptosis, being 43-fold more potent than the next most potent anti-TL1A comparator.</p><p>Whereas recombinant TL1A was used to evaluate C03V in the TF-1 functional assays, primary human blood cells were used to confirm that C03V could recognize and inhibit native TL1A. Native TL1A was detected with C03V, both as a secreted form from stimulated cell culture supernatants, and as a membrane-bound form by flow cytometry on human PBMCs. Functional inhibition of endogenous TL1A activity was also demonstrated: IC<sub>50</sub> was 128 pM for inhibition of TL1A-induced IFN&#x003b3; production in human PBMC culture. This data indicates that C03V is capable of inhibiting TL1A in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> human system and provides support for the investigation of C03V in humans.</p><p>Because C03V is a human IgG1 antibody and TL1A exists in a membrane-bound form, it has the potential to mediate ADCC. However, C03V did not induce detectable ADCC on TL1A+ cells despite ADCC being readily inducible by a positive control anti-CD20 antibody. We have not ruled out the possibility that the mechanism causing lack of ADCC is rapid internalization of anti-TL1A/membrane TL1A complexes, as has been described for anti-TNF/membraneTNF complexes.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref></p><p>Furthermore, C03V did not induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) on TL1A+ cells using human serum as the source of complement (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that C03V would lead to direct antibody-mediated depletion of immune cell types expressing membrane-bound TL1A, and it is more likely that the primary mode of action is via inhibition of TL1A binding to DR3.</p><p>Given the strong association between TL1A and mucosal immunity, C03V was tested in models of both IBD and asthma. In these models, antibody dosing was &#x0201c;semi-therapeutic&#x0201d;, i.e., treatment commenced after disease induction but prior to the development of frank disease. We consider this similar to what would be expected for clinical use of these antibodies, whose role would be one of chronic prophylaxis rather than treatment of acute exacerbations. One of the limitations of using rat models is that it is not possible to examine the therapeutic potential of preferential blockade of DR3 over DcR3 by C03V as there is no evidence that rats (or mice) have DcR3.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Nevertheless, rodent models of IBD and asthma have been used extensively to assess TL1A-DR3 antagonists, as we described in the Introduction.</p><p>In colitis models C03V dosing commenced on day 2, where significant histopathology has been reported for this type of model,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> and in asthma models treatment was commenced after antigen sensitization but prior to antigen challenge, a regime consistent with the clinical use of antibodies for asthma therapy.</p><p>Because existing literature has highlighted the potential for TL1A blockade to prevent and even reverse colonic fibrosis,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> we focused on the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of colitis. In these colitis models, C03V significantly ameliorated multiple aspects of disease pathology. In addition to improvement in colon inflammation, there was evidence of a meaningful effect on both stricturing and fibrosis, two elements of inflammatory bowel diseases that have no effective therapy to date. The longer duration of the DNBS-induced colitis study (14&#x000a0;days vs 7&#x000a0;days for TNBS-induced colitis) provided a greater window to assess the possibility that C03V treatment could not only prevent the progression of fibrosis, but also reverse established fibrosis to some extent. Some isotype control effect was observed in these colitis models, although the effect was always less than observed for the targeted C03V and did not reach statistical significance for any measure. We have observed this phenomenon in multiple colitis studies with this and other isotype control antibodies. It is dose-related, i.e., the magnitude increases with antibody dose, and is conceivably a genuine therapeutic effect. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) is a recognized treatment for IBD<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> and it is possible that in this context, the isotype control antibodies are having some level of IVIG-like effect.</p><p>The promising results in colitis models led us to further investigate the effects of C03V on mucosal inflammation of the respiratory system. In an ovalbumin-induced asthma model in rats, C03V significantly reduced airways inflammation. This was most readily observed in BALF, where a significant influx of eosinophils was seen for untreated and isotype control treated animals, but not for C03V-treated animals. As this is considered a model for eosinophilic asthma, reduction of lung eosinophil numbers to near-na&#x000ef;ve levels is highly relevant to the disease state. The C03V treatment group showed no fibrosis, although it should be noted that the level of structural change in control-treated animals was relatively low.</p><p>In both types of disease model, the reduction in fibrosis observed after C03V treatment was notable. Although fibrosis induction was modest in the asthma model, robust fibrosis was induced in the colitis models, and C03V treatment demonstrated a reduction in fibrosis between 7 and 14&#x000a0;days post-induction. This supports the previously reported role of TL1A blockade as anti-fibrotic.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel, human antibody, C03V, that binds to an epitope on TL1A allowing for highly potent and selective neutralization of DR3 signaling. We provide evidence for its utility in the treatment of diseases involving TL1A dysregulation, including disease with a fibrotic component. C03V has the potential to address unmet medical need in asthma and IBD, and other diseases in which TL1A contributes to pathology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0003"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003-0001"><title>Generation of TL1A and variants</title><p>The amino acid sequences of human, dog, cat, pig, cynomolgus monkey, guinea pig, rabbit, rat and mouse TL1A were obtained from UniProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>TL1A was produced using the mammalian HEK293E/pTT5 expression system<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> from an expression cassette encoding the extracellular domain of TL1A with N-terminally located HIS and FLAG tag.
