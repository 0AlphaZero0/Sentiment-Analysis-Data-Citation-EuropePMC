</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have long been considered the gold standard in clinical research design.1 Randomization helps minimize treatment allocation bias, while strict screening criteria diminish the effects of confounding variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>While RCTs aim to provide definitive empirical evidence, concerns remain as to whether these study populations adequately represent patients encountered in routine practice.1,2 Several robust reviews have substantiated this dynamic, concluding that many RCT samples lack sufficient representation of the pertinent diseased-state population.3–6 In some cases, such representation has been found to be as low as 4%–10% of intervention candidates.7–9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria for RCTs are often stricter than the approved indications for a device, which can bias the RCT population relative to the patient population who will be treated in general practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, physicians may take caution when extrapolating RCT data to the more heterogeneous “real-world” populations whom they treat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Therefore, observational post-market studies are critical to monitor and evaluate the safety and efficacy of new therapeutic techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Malchau has emphasized the importance of observational data sets being produced in close proximity with RCT results.10 These post-market studies can be used to confirm the applicability of RCT results to the more generalized “real-world” populations who will be treated by most physicians. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Management of large annular defects associated with lumbar disc herniation is one area in critical need of improved therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Large defects in the annulus fibrosis, commonly defined as defects ≥6 mm wide, are a significant risk factor for reherniation and revision surgery, with reherniation rates reported as high as 15%–27%.11–13 In contrast, the rate of reoperation for reherniation among the general discectomy population is around 4% (95% CI: 2%–6%).14 A recent meta-analysis of over 1,500 patients observed significantly greater rates of recurrence (OR =2.5, p=0.004) and reoperation (OR =2.3, p&lt;0.001) in patients with large vs small annular defects.15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Annular closure devices (ACD) aim to occlude or seal the defect in the annular ring and have been a strong topic of research for approximately two decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Some devices utilize suturing techniques, with or without anchors, in an attempt to seal and reapproximate the defect.16,17 Another strategy has been to occlude the defect with a mesh insert that is anchored to one of the adjacent vertebral bodies.18 Regardless of the technology, the primary goal of an ACD is to minimize reherniation and revision. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>There is currently one ongoing RCT that is focused on studying the safety and efficacy of a bone-anchored ACD in patients with large annular defects following lumbar discectomy (Clinicaltrials. gov ID: NCT01283438). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Various inclusion criteria for this ongoing RCT, such as minimum pain and disability scores, result in the exclusion of many patients from the trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Based on the indications of this ACD, many of these patients would still be eligible for treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to determine if the clinical outcomes would differ between patients who meet the strict RCT inclusion criteria and those who do not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective registry analysis of all patients who were treated with this ACD at a single site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Considering the immense diversity that exists among lumbar discectomy patients and surgical techniques, addressing the questions of safety and efficacy of this ACD in a wider spine care population is highly advantageous.19 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Comparison of RCT data to observational registry data is increasingly performed within spine research.22,23 Malchau has led this trend across musculoskeletal research, offering a stepwise approach to medical device introduction that seeks to substantiate RCTs by the collection of real-world evidence.10 One such example is Staub et al, a retrospective analysis of registry data, which examined patient-reported outcomes after total disc arthroplasty vs anterior interbody fusion and compared the results with the corresponding RCTs.24 These comparisons provide external validity for the extrapolation of RCT data for treatment decision-making when real-world patients are outside of the strict study inclusion criteria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, the authors examined 164 consecutive patients who had undergone limited discectomy with an ACD, mirroring the same intervention of an ongoing RCT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The observational group was screened against the RCT selection criteria and patients were stratified into Trial and non-Trial segments for comparative purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and intraoperative demographics were not significantly different between the groups, except when comparing patient-reported outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The Trial group had significantly worse preoperative ODI, VAS leg, and VAS back scores (p≤0.04). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>These differences were not unexpected, however, since the RCT was designed to include a high-risk discectomy population with ODI and VAS scores &gt;40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Patients with better preoperative scores were more likely to be included in the non-Trial group, with 34% of non-Trial patients qualifying under this criterion alone. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Clinical success rates between the groups tended to favor Trial patients but did not reach a statistically significant difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>The favoring of Trial patients was most likely due to this group beginning with a mean preoperative ODI score that was nearly 10 points worse than that of non-Trial patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Trial patients had more room to improve than non-Trial patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that improvements in ODI and VAS scores are attributable to the successful nerve decompression that is achieved during the discectomy procedure, independent of the ACD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the ACD is primarily realized by minimizing the risk of reherniation, which is often associated with symptom recurrence.18 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic reherniation, a primary concern with limited lumbar discectomy, was marginalized in both the groups, with the Trial group exhibiting a higher recurrence rate (6.8% vs 2.5%) (p=0.34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These rates compare favorably to the literature on recurrence rates in limited discectomy patients with large annular defects (15%–27%).11–13 Each of those studies examined patients by using screening criteria similar to those of the RCT and Trial group presented here, specifically targeting large annular defect (≥6 mm) patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Given the large annular defect area of non-Trial and Trial patients (44.3±13.9 and 39.2±8.9 mm2, respectively), the rates of recurrent herniation in the present study (2.5%–6.8%) suggest increased efficacy of limited discectomy when augmented with an ACD, relative to the literature rates of limited discectomy alone (15%–27%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, within the non-Trial group, no reherniations (with or without radicular symptoms) were observed in those patients who had undergone previous discectomy, demonstrating similar outcome scores to those patients who had undergone primary discectomy (p&gt;0.3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>These trends compare favorably to the literature in which Osterman et al reported that patients with one reoperation after lumbar discectomy had a 25.1% cumulative risk of subsequent surgical intervention within 10-year follow-up.25 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The mesh occlusion component partially or completely migrated from the bone anchor in 15 patients (9.1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The non-Trial and Trial patients were similarly susceptible to these migrations, indicating that an increased risk does not exist among the more generalized treatment population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Only two of those patients reported radicular pain, without any significant neurological dysfunction or motor deficits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Based on this study, a clear relationship between mesh migration and clinical outcomes could not be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>A 2-year sub analysis on the RCT data of this device examined the association of vertebral endplate changes (VEPC) with device complications and clinical outcomes.26 There were less mesh migrations in the subgroup with VEPC vs those without VEPC (1% vs 11%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VEPC and mesh subsidence were not correlated with any clinical outcomes in the ACD group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Those findings suggest that the mesh migrations may be a minor complication with respect to clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Continual follow-up with patients to monitor these mesh migrations will be important to better understand the effects of such complications. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>This study supports the conclusion that data from an ongoing RCT can be extrapolated to certain patients falling outside its selection criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, more definitive extrapolation can only be fully considered in the context of whether other real-world outcomes align with those reported from the RCT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Outcomes observed with the technique of combining limited discectomy with an ACD in this study were favorable in comparison with historical reherniation rates in the same large annular defect population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcomes from the RCT will better address the efficacy of this ACD, but the current study supports that similar outcomes can be expected in a more generalized patient population. </plain></SENT>
