</text></title><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Following the initial reports of clinical success using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to treat B cell leukemia and lymphoma (Kochenderfer et al., 2010; Porter et al., 2011), there have been intense efforts to improve the design and clinical translation of CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition to T cell receptor (TCR) engagement and costimulatory signaling, cytokines also play a fundamental role in modulating T cell function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an appealing strategy is to engineer cytokine production to promote CAR functions, such as interkeulin-12 (IL-12) (Chmielewski et al., 2011; Pegram et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2015), IL-15 (Hurton et al., 2016), and interferon-β (IFN-β) (Zhao et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that synthetic IL-18 expression might promote CAR T cell functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>IL-18 was initially characterized as an inducer of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in T cells (Nakamura et al., 1989, 1993) and has been shown to activate lymphocytes and monocytes without eliciting severe dose-limiting toxicity in clinical trials (Robertson et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that human recombinant (r)IL-18 could significantly enhance engraftment of human CD8+ T cells in a xenograft model (Carroll et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we discovered potent IL-18-mediated effects on human and mouse T cell proliferation and that synthetic IL-18 secretion by CAR T cells significantly enhanced CAR T cell expansion and antitumor activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To engineer IL-18-expressing CAR T cells, we introduced a human IL-18 transgene into anti-mesothelin (SS1) CAR (SS1-IL-18) and anti-CD19 CAR constructs (CD19-IL-18) (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The resulting SS1-IL-18 construct led to efficient SS1 CAR expression (Figure S1A) and secretion of bioactive human IL-18 (Figures S1B and S1C) and modestly enhanced the lytic activity of CAR T cells (Figure S1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>To evaluate IL-18-CAR T proliferation in vitro, we restimulated CAR T cells with artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs)—K562-expressing mesothelin (K562-Meso) or CD19 (K562-CD19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Robust IL-18 secretion was observed (Figure S1E), and IL-18-CAR T cells displayed enhanced secretion of IFN-γ and several other cytokines (Figure S1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells displayed significantly increased proliferation relative to SS1 CAR T cells (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells expanded similarly as the CD19 CAR T cell control (Figure 1B), which is perhaps related to our previous finding that the SS1 CAR has constitutive ligand-independent signaling, whereas the CD19 CAR does not have constitutive signaling (Frigault et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Encouraged by enhanced functions of IL-18-CAR T cells in vitro, we moved to investigate SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells in a xenograft model of mesothelin-expressing pancreatic tumor AsPC1 (labeled with click beetle green [CBG] and GFP reporter proteins) in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Given that AsPC1 cells do not express CD19, we were surprised, 3 weeks after T cell injection, to find that both CD19-IL-18 and SS1-IL-18 T cells were substantially elevated in peripheral blood 62-fold to 13,990 cells/μL or 74-fold to 38,210 cells/μL relative to CD19 or SS1 CAR T alone (p &lt; 0.01; Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We further confirmed the robust T cell expansion when injecting CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells into NSG mice bearing Nalm6 cells, a CD19+ leukemia cell line (Figure 1D), and SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells into tumor-free NSG mice (Figure 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Further analysis indicated that expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cells include both CAR+ and CAR− populations in the spleen (Figures 1F and 1G), which were polyclonal (Figure S1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results in the xenograft model suggested that IL-18 promotes target antigen-independent CAR T cell proliferation in vivo in tumor-free and tumor-bearing NSG mice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The observations of CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells proliferating in mice bearing CD19− tumors (Figure 1C) and SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells proliferating in tumor-free mice (Figure 1E) suggest that CAR signaling might be dispensable for IL-18-driven expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that a functional synergy exists between IL-18 signaling and TCR activation driven by xenogeneic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis in vitro, primary human T cells were stimulated using anti-CD3 only or with rIL-18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Exogenous rIL-18 enhanced increases in T cell volume compared with cells stimulated with anti-CD3 only, and the enhancement in blast transformation after addition of IL-18 was similar to that after addition of anti-CD3/28 beads (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Purified T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 only did not proliferate (Figure 2A); however, anti-CD3 in combination with IL-18 efficiently stimulated proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The costimulatory effect of IL-18 on T cell proliferation was confirmed in T cells isolated from two additional normal donors (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Further characterization of the cytokine profile in IL-18-activated T cells indicated that low concentrations of IL-18 significantly augmented IFN-γ production, whereas IL-2 levels were at least 20-fold lower than that induced by optimal stimulation by anti-CD3/28 beads (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The production of other cytokines was generally comparable between anti-CD3 plus IL-18 and anti-CD3/CD28 bead activation (Figure S2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Multicolor flow phenotype revealed that IL-18-expanded T cells had a primarily central memory (TCM) phenotype (CCR7+CD45RO+) on day 8 after activation, similar to that obtained with anti-CD3/28 beads (Figure S2B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To address the specific roles of T cell subsets in these responses, T cells expanded by standard anti-CD3/CD28 beads were sorted by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to generate CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>CD8+ T cells failed to proliferate after restimulation with rIL-18 and anti-CD3 beads, despite a significant increase in size (Figure 2D), and addition of IL-2 (20 U/mL) had no additional effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, CD4+ T cells or bulk T cells restimulated with rIL-18 and anti-CD3 beads proliferated efficiently in the absence of CD28 stimulation, at a level comparable with that of combined CD4+ and CD8+ T cells following anti-CD3/CD28 bead restimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>rIL-18-re-stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed transiently elevated TCM markers but ultimately expressed a primarily effector memory (TEM) phenotype (Figure S2C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Next, we hypothesized that GFP-IL-18-expressing human T cells would serve as a desirable platform to test the combinatorial effects of IL-18 signaling and TCR xenoreactivity in NSG mice (Figure 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>GFP-IL-18 CD8+ T cells failed to expand in vivo, whereas GFP-IL-18-expressing CD4+ or bulk T cells exhibited greater than 400-fold expansion between days 15 and 23 after T cell injection (Figure 2E), which was also associated with massively enlarged spleens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The number of expanded CD4+ T cells was comparable whether pure CD4+ T cells or total T cells were injected, suggesting that CD8+ T cells do not have a significant effect on CD4+ T cell expansion (Figure 2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, CD8+ T cells proliferated more than CD4+ T cells in magnitude within bulk T cells (Figure 2F), which is consistent with our previous finding that rIL-18 only enhanced CD8+ T cell engraftment (Carroll et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the observed T cell proliferation, serum human (h)IL-18 and IFN-γ levels increased in mice engrafted with GFP-IL-18 bulk T cells and GFP-IL-18 CD4+ T cells but not in mice engrafted with GFP-IL-18 CD8+ T cells (Figure 2G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Luminex analysis revealed very high levels of IFN-γ and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in mice engrafted with IL-18-secreting bulk T cells and IL-18 CD4+T cells (Figure 2H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Levels of IP10, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were also selectively elevated in mice engrafted with IL-18 CD4+ and IL-18 bulk T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>IL-17 levels were also selectively elevated in mice engrafted with IL-18 CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>In summary, these results suggest that genetically encoded IL-18 acts as a signaling cytokine that interacts synergistically with TCR activation to drive T cell proliferation and Th1-like cytokine secretion, largely dependent on effects through CD4+ helper T cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Based on the effects of IL-18 in vitro and the dramatic proliferation of GFP-IL-18-expressing T cells in vivo, we hypothesized that both the TCR and IL-18 receptor (IL-18R) are required for IL-18-driven proliferation in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To test this, we engineered TCR-deficient (TCR knockout [KO]) T cells expressing GFP or GFP-IL-18 using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>TCR+ GFP-IL-18 T cells expanded dramatically in the blood and spleen compared with TCR+ GFP control T cells, whereas TCR KO GFP-IL-18 T cells did not expand (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the requirement of the IL-18R, we generated IL-18Rα-deficient (IL-18Rα–) T cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and employed a cell competition assay (Figure 3B) involving CD19 CAR-IL-18 wild-type (WT) cells, GFP WT cells, DsRed TCR KO cells, and AmCyan IL-18R KO T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Successful deletion of the TCR and IL-18R was confirmed by flow cytometry, and MACS depletion was performed to remove residual T cells expressing either TCR or IL-18Rα proteins (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Following ex vivo expansion, all four T cell populations were mixed, and flow cytometry analysis confirmed the baseline frequencies of (WT CD19 CAR-IL18):(WT GFP):(TCR KO DsRed):(IL-18R KO AmCyan) cells to be 8.59%:7.45%:6.71%:7.27% within total T cells (Figure 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Each NSG mouse received the mixed cell populations consisting of approximately 1e6 cells of each type intravenously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Three weeks later, the number of CD45+ human T cells ranged from 32,800 to 79,600 cells/μL blood (Figure 3E), confirming robust T cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Staining for IL-18Rα indicated that some AmCyan-labeled T cells had low levels of residual IL-18R expression (Figure 3F), which likely represents contaminating T cells that did not undergo successful gene editing and were not completely removed by MACS depletion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>A representative FACS plot revealed that the final frequencies of (WT CD19 CAR-IL18):(WTGFP):(TCR KO DsRed):(IL-18R KO AmCyan) were 22.0%:18.0%:5.82%:0.43% (Figure 3G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the ratio of WT CD19 CAR-IL-18 to WT GFP T cells following in vivo expansion was essentially unchanged (Figure 3H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the proportion of IL-18R KO AmCyan T cells decreased significantly in the blood and spleen, and it was even more dramatic for TCR KO DsRed T cells (Figure 3H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that both the TCR and IL-18R are necessary for CAR-IL-18-mediated in vivo proliferation of human T cells and that neither alone is sufficient, as tested in the NSG model. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Given that IL-18 signaling augments TCR signaling, we hypothesized that IL-18 would also augment CAR T cell proliferation because the CAR contains the basic TCR signaling domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>To avoid potential antigen non-specific T cell activation and graft versus host disease (GVHD) associated with endogenous TCR reactivity (Labrecque et al., 2001), only TCR-deficient (TCR KO) human T cells (Ren et al., 2017) were used in xenograft experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In vitro experiments indicated that TCR KO CD19 CAR and TCR KO SS1 CAR T cells had equivalent proliferation, with or without the IL-18 transgene, after initial activation by anti-CD3/CD28 bead activation and IL-2 (Figure S3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, the TCR was disrupted on days 3–4 of culture so that the endogenous TCR was present during the baseline stimulation by anti-CD3/28 beads, and later in culture, the T cells became CD3-deficient (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, after aAPC restimulation with the surrogate antigens CD19 or mesothelin, IL-18 expression promoted a modest increase in proliferation in TCR KO CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells (Figure 4A) and SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells (Figure S3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Robust IL-18 secretion was observed during initial ex vivo expansion and after aAPC restimulation (Figures S3C and S3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In addition, TCR KO-IL-18-CAR T cells displayed enhanced secretion of IFN-γ and several other cytokines (Figure S3E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Restimulated TCR KO IL-18-CAR T cells displayed transiently elevated TCM markers but ultimately expressed a primarily TEM phenotype (Figure S3F). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>After confirming enhanced proliferation of TCR KO IL-18-CAR T cells in vitro, we next tested their antitumor activity in NSG mice bearing Nalm6 leukemia cells expressing CBG-GFP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>TCR KO CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells effectively cleared detectable tumor cells by day 10, in contrast to TCR KO CD19-GFP CAR T cells (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Notably, control TCR KO SS1-IL-18 CAR T cells had no effect on tumor progression, indicating that IL-18 was not sufficient for the antitumor effect (Figure 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>NSG mice treated with TCR KO CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells had a transient decrease in body weight on day 8 that returned to baseline levels and remained stable thereafter (Figure 4C), consistent with a transient cytokine release syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, mice injected with TCR KO CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells remained viable for over 185 days after T cell injection, except for one mouse that exhibited tumor relapse on day 101 (Figures 4B and 4C) because of downregulation of CD19 expression (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Additional analysis revealed no emergence of contaminating TCR+ CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells during treatment, significant proliferation of TCR KO CD19-IL-18 compared with CD19-GFP CAR T cells (350 versus 10.5 cells/μL blood), a high level of IL-18 in the plasma (77,500 pg/mL on day 10), persistence of CD4+ CD19− IL-18 CAR T cells, and a primarily TEM phenotype (Figure 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the number of T cells and IL-18 concentrations gradually decreased to below 1 CD45+CD3− T cell/μL and approximately 100 pg/mL in tumor-free surviving mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>These results collectively demonstrate that IL-18 can significantly enhance TCR KO CD19 CAR T cell proliferation and induces superior antitumor activity without TCR-mediated GVHD during therapy and that systemic IL-18 levels wane following elimination of the tumor burden. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Although the NSG mice have been the most widely used pre-clinical model of CAR T cell therapy in the study of human T cell adoptive transfer, it would be meaningful to extend the investigation of IL-18-CAR T cells to an immune-competent model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we engineered murine IL-18-expressing anti-mouse CD19 (murine CD19-IL-18) CAR T cells for adoptive transfer to C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 melanoma tumors stably expressing mouse CD19 (Figure 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Murine CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells have superior engraftment in lymphoreplete mice compared with CD19 CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In addition, murine CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells had augmented antitumor efficacy, as measured by tumor volume, and significantly enhanced survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, profound B cell aplasia on day 7 after T cell infusion was observed with CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, murine CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells resulted in high levels of IL-18 in the plasma on day 7, which decreased rapidly afterward. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Consistent with systemic IL-18 levels, mouse body weight decreased slightly on day 7 and then returned to baseline levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Except for the death of one mouse of 10 mice on day 9, potentially because of systemic IL-18 toxicity, there were no other clinical symptoms observed during the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that murine CD19-IL-18 CAR T cells have superior on-target effects, as judged by tumor elimination and B cell aplasia, with acceptable toxicity in an immune-competent B16F10 tumor model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we believe that a safer approach may be to minimize the potential toxicity associated with systemic IL-18 exposure observed in both xenograft and syngeneic models by designing an inducible system for IL-18 CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we created a nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)-based inducible system for coupling IL-18 production with CAR signaling along with simultaneous disruption of the endogenous TCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>We designated this approach antigen-propelled activation of cytokine helper ensemble (APACHE) CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Except for B cell tumors treated with CD19 CAR T cells, a major limitation of current CAR T cell approaches has been insufficient expansion and persistence of the infused T cells, as exemplified by several trials (Brown et al., 2016; Hege et al., 2017; Kershaw et al., 2006; Lamers et al., 2006; Park et al., 2007; Pule et al., 2008; Tanyi et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>IL-18 has been shown to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses through its effects on natural killer cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells (Dinarello et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The ultimate rationale for our studies is to enhance CAR T cell proliferation and to utilize IL-18 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine to recruit a second wave of immune cells to the tumor microenvironment to mediate antitumor effects toward cancer cells that are resistant to the direct effects of CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>A strength of the NSG xenograft model is that it enables investigation of human IL-18-mediated augmentation of CAR T cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>There are differences between mouse and human immunology; human T cells are more responsive to IL-18 than mouse T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>This might help explain why the in vitro effects of human IL-18 on T cells are more potent than those of mouse IL-18 (Carroll et al., 2008; Montufar-Solis et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Because of the immune deficiency of the NSG model and lack of a representative tumor microenvironment, further investigation is underway to comprehensively evaluate the safety of IL-18-CAR T cells, interaction with tumor infiltrating T and natural killer (NK) cells, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment in mice with intact host immune systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>IL12, a cytokine related to IL-18, has also been shown to augment the functional effects of CAR T cells (Chmielewski et al., 2014; Pegram et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be required to determine the relative merits and risks of these two approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>An inducible form of IL-12 was tested in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) cells given to melanoma patients and was found to be too toxic (Zhang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>One potential advantage of IL-18 is that it is monomeric, whereas IL-12 is heterodimeric and more susceptible to changes in potency, resulting in lethal toxicity (Cohen, 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Many biologic effects of IL-12 and IL-18 are overlapping, so it is unlikely that combining these approaches would be synergistic. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrate that CAR T cells can be engineered to secrete IL-18 that supports in vivo engraftment and persistence of CAR T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate that IL-18 has a previously unappreciated form of signaling that is primarily selective to human CD4+ T cells, and, therefore, these IL-18-expressing CD4 T cells can be categorized as synthetic T helper cells producing IL-18 (sTh18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>These findings may have therapeutic implications because the IL-18 CAR T cells can support the proliferation of CD8+ T cells and because increasing evidence points to the importance of adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells in antitumor effects (Hunder et al., 2008; Hung et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results point to a new approach to develop universal CAR T cells derived from allogeneic T cells that are devoid of the endogenous TCR. </plain></SENT>
