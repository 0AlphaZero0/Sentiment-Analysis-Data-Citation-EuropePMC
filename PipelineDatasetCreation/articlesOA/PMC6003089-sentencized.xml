</text></title><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have indicated that weaning can induce oxidative stress in pigs, resulting in oxidative damage [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Weaning stress has been reported to disrupt intestinal health, cause diarrhea, and to reduce growth and immunity in pigs [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Over the past number of decades, antibiotics, zinc oxide, and copper sulfate have been widely utilized in the swine industries for their effects in reducing diarrhea and improving immunity in weanling pigs [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the abuse of these additives has led to antibiotic resistance and heavy metal residues in livestock products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The rising incidence of these serious problems has compelled research institutes and farmers alike to search for safe feed additives [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Many essential oils from plants, either extracted or in their natural form, are used for their antioxidative properties, which are mainly due to phenolic compounds in the oil or in other phytochemical fractions [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Some nonphenolic substances also exhibit considerable antimicrobial and antioxidative potential [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that essential oils may improve nutrient digestibility, as well as intestinal morphology and microflora [15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Other studies have reported that essential oil supplementation improved the nutritional value and oxidative stability of fat, meat, and eggs, resulting in longer shelf-life [18–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These previous findings regarding animal products led us to hypothesize whether essential oils could improve systemic redox balance and reduce oxidative injury induced by weaning stress in young pigs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Cinnamaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula C6H5CH=CHCHO, and thymol is a natural monoterpene phenol with the formula C10H14O (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although several studies have indicated that cinnamaldehyde and thymol can improve growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and intestinal morphology, and stabilize the microflora of weaned pigs and poultry [11, 17, 24, 25], the effects of cinnamaldehyde and thymol on antioxidant activity and immune function in weaned pigs is still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of dietary supplementation with plant essential oil on both immune function and antioxidant activity in weaned pigs.Fig. 1Chemical structure of thymol (a) and cinnamaldehyde (b) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our results, previous studies have documented similar positive effects of PEO supplementation on growth performance in weaned pigs [17, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The improvement in nutrient absorption may be partly explained by increased secretions of saliva, bile and enhanced enzyme activity [35–38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Moreover, PEO supplementation has been reported to improve the immune status of pigs after weaning, as indicated by increased serum immunoglobulin levels [15, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that PEO supplementation increased the levels of ALB, IgA, and IgG in serum, and 200 ppm PEO addition got the highest levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It is well known that IgG offers newborn pigs extended systemic protection, while IgA and IgM offer transient luminal protection [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>During the first few days after weaning, piglets often experience low feed intake or starvation issues that can represent a major challenge for the producer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the administration of 200 mg/kg PEO to piglets during this time probably improve their immune status and prevent oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress is caused by excess oxidative radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which damage DNA, bio-membrane lipids, proteins, and other macromolecules [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>However, excess oxidative radicals can be eliminated by antioxidants, including nonenzymatic components and a series of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Within the enzymatic antioxidant system, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are the most important compounds [21], working together to detoxify superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide in cells [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Superoxide dismutase catalyzes superoxide anions to produce hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Glutathione peroxidase normally converts H2O2 to water [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The capabilities of the non-enzymatic antioxidant defense system are often measured as the total antioxidant capacity [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the level of malondialdehyde, a major product of lipid peroxidation, is an effective marker of oxidative stress in sepsis [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par47"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we measured GSH, CAT, MDA, and T-SOD levels, as well as T-AOC, in serum, intestinal mucosa, spleen, liver, and pancreas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Present results indicated that PEO supplementation significantly increased GSH levels in serum, duodenal and ileal mucosa and pancreas, T-SOD activity in jejunal mucosa and spleen, and significantly decreased MDA levels in serum, jejunal mucosa and pancreas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The results of this study were consistent with previous reports that T-AOC was improved and plasma MDA level was decreased in pigs receiving supplemental PEO [15, 41, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Previous study have confirmed that PEO could save the depletion of SOD and GSH-Px or enhance their capabilities [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The increased GSH and decreased MDA levels in serum indicated that whole-body antioxidant status was improved, and lipid peroxidation was reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In addition, the reduced MDA levels and improvements in GSH levels and T-SOD activity suggested that PEO could enhance both the non-enzymatic and enzymatic reactions of the antioxidant defense system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Various natural antioxidant extracts have been used to protect pigs from weaning stress in intensive pig production [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Our results suggests that dietary PEO supplementation may reduce oxidative stress and have the potential to ameliorate the adverse effects of early weaning syndrome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par48"><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the mechanism of PEO antioxidant activity in weaned pigs, we measured the expression of SOD1, CAT, GPX1, GST, GR, Nrf2, and Keap-1 in the spleen, liver, and pancreas. Keap-1 is the cytosolic protein with which the transcription factor Nrf2 is associated, and which functions to protect against oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress modifies Keap-1 at redox-sensitive SH groups, leading to the liberation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, Nrf2 binds to the ARE promoter sequence of antioxidant enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In this way, Nrf2 coordinates cytoplasmic responses to oxidative stress [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>A previous study reported that essential oils increased the mRNA expression of jejunal GPx1 and SOD1, ileal GST, and colonic GPX1, SOD1, and Keap-1 [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the present results indicated that PEO supplementation upregulated the expression of GST, GPX, CAT, and SOD1 in the spleen and the expression of GST and Nrf2 in the liver. It can be speculated that the different terpene compounds in PEO can modify Keap 1 at sensor –SH groups through chemical reactions [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress modifies Keap1 at redox-sensitive -SH groups, which leads to Nrf2 liberation and its nuclear translocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, Nrf2 binds to the ARE promoter sequence of antioxidant enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In this way, Nrf2 coordinates cytoplasmic responses to oxidative stress [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The changes in the expression of genes associated with oxidation and antioxidant compounds may explain the findings in serum and tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The spleen is a vital part of the immune system and the liver is important in detoxification and metabolism in pigs [46, 47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The improved splenic and hepatic antioxidant capacities may be reflected in the immunity and health of weaned pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Although the PEO used in our study has been confirmed to improve the antioxidant capacities of serum and other tissues, the molecular mechanisms through which PEO impacts the upstream Nrf2 pathways and then modulates antioxidant capacity remains to be further investigated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par49"><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that dietary PEO supplementation improved growth performance, immune function, and antioxidant status in weaned pigs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The benefits observed may be mediated by upregulation of antioxidant-related genes in the spleen and liver. And that supplementation of the PEO preparation at the levels of 200 mg/kg diet would seem to be economically feasible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This study not only provides new insights into the role of PEO in improving growth performance, immune function, and antioxidant capacity in weaned pigs, but also reveals a potential candidate to replace the antibiotics conventionally used in the livestock industry. </plain></SENT>
