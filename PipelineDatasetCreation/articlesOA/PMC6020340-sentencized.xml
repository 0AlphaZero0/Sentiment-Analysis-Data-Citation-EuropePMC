</text></title><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) is defined as elevated cardiac enzymes after surgery with or without relevant symptoms or electrocardiogram (EKG) changes, and is proportionally linked to short-term mortality [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The incidence of PMI after inpatient abdominal surgery is common - 12-21% - and is higher still in selected subgroups (e.g. gastro-oesophageal resection &gt; 50%) [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Cardioprotection studies in non-cardiac surgery have focused on clinical endpoints [4], using relatively hazardous interventions, such as medication or revascularization, in which harm outweighs benefit in lower risk patients [5–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, given that PMI is also linked with adverse outcomes and is more common, new cardioprotection studies with biochemical endpoints and appropriately low-hazard interventions are needed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a simple and safe procedure that may reduce ischaemia-reperfusion injury [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It involves temporary ischemia-and-reperfusion cycles to non-vital tissues, which may convey protective effects to distant sensitive organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The specific mechanisms are incompletely understood, and may involve transcriptional reprogramming to cytoprotective cascades, and reduced radical release from the mitochondrial transition pore [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Harmful effects of RIPC seem limited to skin petechiae, which occur in 3–4% and are self-limiting [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>RIPC for cardioprotection has been investigated in cardiac [16], renal surgery [17], and vascular surgery [18], albeit with mixed results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>However, whether RIPC influences PMI after abdominal surgery remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that RIPC could reduce the frequency and severity of PMI after major abdominal surgery, and so we designed a sham-controlled randomized study to test this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome measure was incidence of PMI (defined at our institution as &gt; 14 ng/L) within 72 h of surgery, and secondary outcomes were high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TNT) area under the curve (AUC), cardiovascular events and mortality. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>A dedicated and regularly calibrated study sphygmomanometer (Durashock DS54, Welch Allyn) was applied to an arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>For RIPC, a pressure of 200 mmHg was applied for 5 min, followed by 5 min rest, for three cycles, totalling a 30-min treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The cuff for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring was placed on a leg or on the RIPC arm after the 30-min treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Sham-RIPC was identical in all aspects except that the release valve on the sphygmomanometer was open throughout, so that cuff pressure was always &lt; 15 mmHg. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This was a randomized controlled trial designed to test whether RIPC can reduce PMI caused by elective major abdominal surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Within this cohort, RIPC was safe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Nearly a quarter of patients had a clinically significant PMI, supportive of several recent studies [1, 2, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>However, RIPC did not affect PMI incidence or severity, or associated clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>More recent outputs of the VISION collaboration suggests that absolute hs-TnT values of &gt; 5 ng/L are associated with modest risk of mortality [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>When the additional patients were included in the present analysis, RIPC significantly decreased the magnitude of hs-TnT at 12 h (P &lt; 0.033). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Promising animal studies [30], human randomized controlled trials [16, 31, 32] and meta-analyses [26, 27] showed that RIPC can reduce the PMI associated with cardiac surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>However, two meta-analyses have recently questioned whether RIPC affected clinical outcomes in this cohort [33, 34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>As the present study closed, two international RCTs (ERRICA and RIPHeart) powered to differences in detect a composite clinical outcome after cardiac surgery failed to show a treatment benefit for RIPC, both in terms of clinical and biochemical endpoints [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The neutral findings of RIPC in the present study may be explained by (i) the pathophysiology of myocyte injury in this surgical context is not influenced by RIPC (ii) no pre-specification of anesthesia (iii) inadequate definition of PMI in this surgical context. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial to address whether RIPC can influence PMI in patients undergoing inpatient abdominal surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The study was limited by the lack of available data on treatment effects in this surgical setting, so surrogate data from cardiac surgery was used, adjusting for PMI incidence in general surgery using VISION data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The second potential limitation is that anesthesia was not pre-specified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>There is limited evidence from dog and human studies that propofol maintenance abrogates the RIPC effect [23, 35], and it is interesting that the small group of propofol-only patients did not develop PMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In 90% ERRICA and 100% RIPHeart participants, anesthesia was solely propofol-based. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Advocates of RIPC have suggested that volatile anesthesia may yield different results [36, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>However, there was still no RIPC benefit in those with PMI (&gt; 14 ng/L), who all received volatile anesthesia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Several studies have found PMI to be common after inpatient abdominal procedure, and that it predicts mortality [1, 28, 38, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Confounding influences such as infective respiratory disease, renal impairment, and concurrent use of diuretics and anticoagulants are not fully characterized [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In this study, pre-existing infection was an exclusion criterion, and the other factors were not associated with raised hs-TnT (see Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In keeping with previous studies [38, 41], factors predictive of risk were age and abnormal pre-operative cardiac tests, suggesting genuine and presumably modifiable myocyte pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Thus, two lines of future investigation are proposed (i) perioperative studies using alternative cardioprotective therapies to reduce PMI (ii) post-operative therapeutic studies in which the presence of PMI stratifies to long-term risk reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Although RIPC may not be efficacious in treating PMI in the present general surgery study population, it may yet hold value in certain high-risk contexts, for example in oesophageal resections. </plain></SENT>
