</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Upper limb weakness is the most common impairment after stroke[1] and is associated with the need for assistance in activities of daily living and worsened quality of life.[2] Although motor recovery continues to improve up to 1 year after stroke, active recovery usually occurs around 3 to 6 months post-stroke.[3,4] The time window for the recovery for motor control and through neural plasticity is short and active rehabilitation strategies in the subacute stage is considered to be important.[5–7] Based on motor learning theory, task-oriented, intensive, and repetitive training during subacute stage after stroke is the key factor for promoting neural plasticity to induce motor recovery.[8] Increased therapy is related with greater motor functional improvement after stroke.[9] However, the amount of occupational therapy is usually less than the suggested guideline,[10] and active participation during conventional therapy is also less than the expected.[11,12] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Virtual rehabilitation (VR) is one of the candidate modalities for motor rehabilitation to induce active participation and more repetitions by motivating patients.[13] Although a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial using a commercial gaming system failed to show the superiority to conventional occupational therapy,[14] the VR system designed to deliver task-specific training for stroke patients can have beneficial effects on motor recovery.[15] However, few studies with relatively few patients have compared the performance of VR systems designed for stroke motor rehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, most of the studies did not focus on the subacute stage of stroke.[16] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We designed this study to prove the efficacy of our developed low-cost Kinect-based VR system for upper limb recovery among patients with subacute stroke, compared with sham VR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition, because we postulated that one of possible advantages of VR system may be a reduction on the intervention time by the therapists while maintaining a similar amount of arm movements during occupational therapy, we measured the amount of hemiparetic upper limb movements during real and sham VR by using an accelerometer, and the amount of time intervened by the therapists during real VR, to investigate whether our VR system has the potential to be used as a group therapy tool in the inpatient stroke rehabilitation setting. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study shows that upper limb function after stoke in both real and sham VR groups improves significantly with time in the subacute stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The compliance for both real and sham VR groups was good. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The reason for drop-out during the VR session, early discharge, was not directly related with the VR (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>VR for upper limb recovery after stroke has been investigated by using commercial gaming system (e.g., Nintento wii [Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan]) or specifically developed system.[27] Although a recent meta-analysis indicated that VR is significantly effective on the upper limb recovery after stoke, the quality and sample size of each included study were low and the results of individual studies were heterogeneous.[28] Recent randomized controlled studies with large sample size involving patients with subacute stroke showed no significant beneficial effect of non-immersive VR on upper limb recovery compared with the control group (active control or no therapy),[14,29] similar with our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The negative results of VR in this study could have been caused by the following possible limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>First, although our system was specifically developed to induce task-oriented repetitive motions according to the patient's ability, the induced motion itself might be less relevant or challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The motion in the real world and virtual world can be different and transfer of virtual training to the real world may not be possible in some conditions.[30] Our Kinect-based system can induce the repetitive arm and wrist motion effectively, but the hand motion which requires more fine motor activity and sensory feedback may be related with less relevant tasks compared with the real task.[20] In addition, although our system provided the various difficulty levels during the rehabilitation, the challenge level may not be sufficient to induce the continuous active participation and neural plasticity.[31] Lastly, we used the sham VR group as an active control to blind the subjects, because previous studies using VR had not tried double-blind design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The low and non-significant consistency between the real group allocation and the subject's guess demonstrates that subject blinding was successful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Although we expected the sham VR group to show less task-relevant activity and low dose, the combination of repetitive reaching and pushing the button during sham VR can also induced sufficient motion and some plastic changes, which might neutralize the results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In spite of limitation of this study, the results demonstrate the perspectives of low-cost VR use in subacute rehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this study, the direct intervention time by the therapist was 3.7 minutes on average during the 30-minute treatment session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The real VR group showed more activity in the hemiparetic upper limb than the sham VR group, and similar activity compared with the conventional occupational therapy group during the same duration of the rehabilitation sessions (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This means that it will be more feasible to apply this system as an adjuvant additional rehabilitation modality in the rehabilitation setting, which may be a tool for group therapy with supervision of 1 therapist or non-therapist such as a nurse or self-exercise between the therapy sessions or during weekend, to induce more repetitive movements, more recovery, and favorable outcomes.[32–34] The many portions of direct intervention time composed of selecting appropriate program according to the patient's recovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>If the automated algorithm can be adopted to this system, the direct intervention time could decrease and the supervision of more patients by one therapist using this system could be available.[35] In addition, our developed system can be easily used if the personal computer and depth-sensing camera is prepared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Various depth-sensing cameras have been developed and the cost is decreasing,[36] therefore the cost for setting this depth-sensing camera will also decrease, which may guarantee easier accessibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>In addition, the future development of depth sensing camera in terms of closer distance detection (e.g., Intel's Real sense)[37] or higher definition with many references[38–41] can be applied to simplify our camera-based rehabilitation system. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The low-cost Kinect-based upper limb rehabilitation system we developed was not more efficacious compared with the active sham VR control in this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with subacute stroke patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>However, the compliance in VR was good and our VR system induced more arm motion than control and similar activity compared with the conventional therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This characteristic of our system suggests the usability as an adjuvant additional therapy during inpatient stroke rehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>More advances in our current pilot version VR system with more detailed difficulty levels, task-relevant design, are numerous pleasurable gaming options could induce more active participation and transfer to the real environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Automated adoption system or more user friendly interface to select the appropriate rehabilitation program or difficulty level can reduce the direct intervention time by a therapist and increase the usability by patients or non-experts themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Further clinical trials with this low-cost VR system have to be more pragmatic, focusing on the feasibility as a group or self-therapy in the inpatient or home setting and a cost-effectiveness analysis has to be included. </plain></SENT>
