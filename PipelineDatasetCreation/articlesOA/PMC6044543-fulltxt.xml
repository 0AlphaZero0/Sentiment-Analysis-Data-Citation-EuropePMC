The majority of the genome is relatively stable, with mutation rates similar to most eukaryotic species. However, some regions are very unstable with high recombination rates, driving the generation of new immune evasion-associated <italic>var</italic> genes. The molecular factors controlling the inconsistent stability of this genome are not known. Here we studied the roles of the two putative RecQ helicases in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, <italic>Pf</italic>BLM and <italic>Pf</italic>WRN. When <italic>Pf</italic>WRN was knocked down, recombination rates increased four-fold, generating chromosomal abnormalities, a high rate of chimeric <italic>var</italic> genes and many microindels, particularly in known &#x02018;fragile sites&#x02019;. This is the first identification of a gene involved in suppressing recombination and maintaining genome stability in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. By contrast, no change in mutation rate appeared when the second RecQ helicase, <italic>Pf</italic>BLM, was mutated. At the transcriptional level, however, both helicases evidently modulate the transcription of large cohorts of genes, with several hundred genes&#x02014;including a large proportion of <italic>var</italic>s&#x02014;showing deregulated expression in each RecQ mutant. Aberrant processing of stalled replication forks is a possible mechanism underlying elevated mutation rates and this was assessed by measuring DNA replication dynamics in the RecQ mutant lines. Replication forks moved slowly and stalled at elevated rates in both mutants, confirming that RecQ helicases are required for efficient DNA replication. Overall, this work identifies the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> RecQ helicases as major players in DNA replication, antigenic diversification and genome stability in the most lethal human malaria parasite, with important implications for genome evolution in this pathogen.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Human malaria is caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, with most of the mortality (almost half a million deaths each year) being caused by one species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. This parasite has an unusual genome: it is exceptionally biased towards A and T nucleotides rather than G and C, and it contains specific areas rich in hypervariable virulence-associated genes which evolve very rapidly to produce new variants. This evolution is probably vital for the parasite to evade the human immune system and maintain chronic infections, but how it is controlled at a molecular level remains unknown. We have identified a helicase in the parasite with a huge influence on genome stability and the rate of genome evolution. It appears to function by unwinding various unusual DNA structures, and if this fails then the genome becomes unstable. In addition, the transcription of many genes whose DNA tends to form secondary structures is affected, and DNA replication is impeded. If this helicase was expressed variably in different parasite strains infecting humans, it could influence the parasites&#x02019; ability to grow and replicate efficiently, and also, crucially, its ability to evolve and thus evade the human immune system.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K000535/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7583-2176</contrib-id><name><surname>Merrick</surname><given-names>Catherine J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L008823/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7583-2176</contrib-id><name><surname>Merrick</surname><given-names>Catherine J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>090851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9835-1014</contrib-id><name><surname>Rayner</surname><given-names>Julian C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0024-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterkers</surname><given-names>Yvon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterkers</surname><given-names>Yvon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution>Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Montpellier</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sterkers</surname><given-names>Yvon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanojcic</surname><given-names>Slavica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by the UK Medical Research Council [grants MR/K000535/1 and MR/L008823/1 to CJM], the Wellcome Trust [grant 090851 to JCR], the Agence Nationale de la Recherche within the frame of the &#x0201c;Investissements d&#x02019;avenir&#x0201d; program [ANR-11-LABX-0024-01 &#x0201c;PARAFRAP&#x0201d; to YS], the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the French Ministry of Research and the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire of Montpellier [YS], and the &#x02018;Fondation pour la Recherche M&#x000e9;dicale&#x02019; (FRM) [SS].

Most malaria deaths are caused by the species <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, although four other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species also infect humans.</p><p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> has one of the most highly A/T-biased genomes ever sequenced, at ~81% A/T [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is maintained by a high mutational bias towards G/C to A/T transitions [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the resultant genome contains a preponderance of A/T repeat tracts [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These are prone to form structures such as hairpins and slipped-strand pairing, and they can expand and contract readily, producing a genome that is very prone to micro-indels [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Simple A/T repeats can also promote the duplication of whole genes via homologous recombination (HR) between repeats&#x02014;a mechanism that favours genome evolution via gene duplication followed by functional diversification and/or selection [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is specifically implicated in the evolution of drug resistance (e.g. amplification of the multi-drug resistance gene <italic>PfMDR1</italic>). As expected given the A/T bias, guanine-rich motifs are contrastingly very scarce. Only ~80 putative G-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences (non-double-helical structures that require four closely-spaced tracts of at least three guanines to form [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) are found outside the intrinsically guanine-rich telomeres in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].

The natural occurrence of HR during mitotic growth of haploid <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites in human erythrocytes has been quantified, showing that it occurs almost exclusively in subtelomeric regions and in chromosome-internal hypervariable regions.

The <italic>var</italic> recombination breakpoints that occur during <italic>in vitro</italic> culture are spatially associated with potential helix-disrupting structures including hairpins [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and G4s [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], suggesting that HR is initiated when replication forks stall at such structures. In fact, the observation that sequences with the potential to form G4s are strongly clustered around <italic>var</italic> genes [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] suggests that such rare sequences may actually be maintained for this purpose, conferring an evolutionary advantage in <italic>var</italic> gene diversification.</p><p>In model systems, non-canonical DNA structures including G4s are targeted by &#x02018;RecQ&#x02019; helicases, which suppress the stalling of replication forks and hence recombination events [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as modulating transcription through non-canonical DNA structures [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether either recombination or transcription in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> genome could be affected by the two putative RecQ helicases encoded by this parasite, <italic>Pf</italic>WRN and <italic>Pf</italic>BLM [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Characterisation of RecQ mutant lines revealed that these helicases have widespread and profound effects on genome recombination and diversification of the virulence gene repertoire, as well as on transcription of large cohorts of genes. We also measured DNA replication dynamics at a single-molecule level via DNA combing [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], revealing that the RecQ helicases affect the speed at which replication forks move and the rate at which they stall, and thus providing a mechanistic explanation for the genome stability and transcriptional phenotypes. Overall, this work identifies the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> RecQ helicases as major players in DNA replication, antigenic diversification and genome stability in the most important human malaria parasite.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>The two RecQ helicases in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> influence parasite growth</title><p>To investigate the roles of RecQ helicases in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the two genes that encode <italic>Pf</italic>BLM and <italic>Pf</italic>WRN were targeted for gene replacement via double homologous recombination. <italic>PfBLM</italic> was successfully knocked out, as shown by Southern blotting of the disrupted locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1007490.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).

The vast majority of SVs were restricted to hypervariable regions (subtelomeric or internal) which contain highly polymorphic genes such as <italic>var</italic> genes.

First, we calculated the average distance between mutation events and putative G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQSs&#x02014;the guanine rich motifs that have the potential to form G4s). We have previously reported that recombination events in wildtype parasites are highly associated with PQSs [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and this association held for recombination events leading to SVs in all three parasite lines analysed here (<xref rid="pgen.1007490.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

In the <italic>PfWRN</italic>-k/d line, however, the median PQS-to-breakpoint distance was 50% longer at 26.1kb.

We show that these helicases have far-reaching effects on genome stability and gene transcription, including particular effects on recombination and transcription of the important <italic>var</italic> family of virulence genes.</p><p>At the genomic level, we observed a marked difference between the two mutant lines: knockout of <italic>Pf</italic>BLM did not influence the mutation rate, while the knockdown of <italic>Pf</italic>WRN created a highly elevated number of micro-indels and SVs, plus a plethora of unusual recombination patterns never observed in previous clone trees that were generated from wildtype parasite strains [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Because the growth rate of the <italic>PfWRN-</italic>k/d parasites is reduced, the true mutation rate could be even higher than the current estimation. Hypermutation at the level detected here is probably deleterious in the wild: no natural mutant in <italic>PfWRN</italic> appears in any sequenced strain and this helicase also appears to be more important for parasite survival <italic>in vitro</italic> than <italic>Pf</italic>BLM, given our failure to obtain a complete <italic>PfWRN</italic> knockout. Indeed, the survival of our <italic>Pf</italic>BLM knockout contradicts a previous report that <italic>Pf</italic>BLM is essential: this was established by treating parasites with a dsRNA against <italic>PfBLM</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but no evidence was shown that the dsRNA actually affected the intended gene.</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first discovery of a gene directly involved in genome stability in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>: a mild mutator phenotype has previously been linked to the mismatch repair factor <italic>Pf</italic>MLH1 [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but this involved only an elevated SNP rate. By contrast, <italic>Pf</italic>WRN appears to functionally suppress all types of mutations, including small indels, SNPs and in particular, large structural variants. Its role in suppressing structural variants and indels is probably particularly crucial for a genome in which repetitive sequences, and thus risks of DNA polymerase slippage, are common. An increased SNP rate was not necessarily expected, since <italic>Pf</italic>WRN is reported to lack the proofreading exonuclease domain found in human WRN [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and importantly the SNP datasets were all very small, making changes in SNP rate only marginally significant. Nevertheless, it is possible that an unidentified, divergent exonuclease domain may exist in <italic>Pf</italic>WRN, or that other defects causing an excess of single-stranded DNA could lead to an elevated SNP rate. Otherwise, the phenotypes seen here are consistent with RecQ functions in other organisms: for example, the yeast helicase Sgs1 is required to prevent indels and fragility in triplet repeat regions [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while metazoan RecQ homologues in species from humans to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> are required to maintain chromosome integrity and suppress genome instability and aberrant recombination [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the result appears to be that a RecQ helicase has taken on a specific, and perhaps unique, role in modulating the evolution of a major virulence gene family (albeit with the caveat that any recombination events between other, essential genes, must go unrecorded due to their lethality). Importantly, our clone tree plus whole genome sequencing approach successfully identified RecQ-associated mutations at a resolution never described in other model organisms so far.</p><p>DNA features such as TRs, LCRs and G4s can all form secondary structures that impede the passage of polymerases, and many of the mutation events seen here correlate with such features: structural variants being particularly associated with PQSs, and to a lesser extent with TRs, while indels are strongly associated with TRs and LCRs. Mammalian RecQ homologs are known to act on stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the two RecQ homologs in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. presumably act similarly. Our evidence from DNA combing supports stalled replication forks as the mechanism underlying elevated rates of recombination in the <italic>Pf</italic>WRN mutant, but it is curious that only this mutant showed severe genome instability, given that both mutants showed strong replication defects on DNA fibres. In fact, stalled forks may be processed via at least two different routes: a recombinogenic route in the absence of <italic>Pf</italic>WRN and a less recombinogenic route in the absence of <italic>Pf</italic>BLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007490.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>Pf</italic>WRN mutant showed a specific change in the distance between recombination breakpoints and PQSs, suggesting that replication forks are processed differently when they encounter a G4 in this mutant, with longer lengths of DNA being unwound or resected before a recombination event can occur. This is commensurate with one of the reported roles of human WRN, suppressing resection of DNA breaks [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, the two RecQ helicases may preferentially target particular substrates, such as regressed replication forks, recombination intermediates, telomeric G4s or R-loops: such a &#x02018;division of labour&#x02019; occurs amongst the five-member RecQ family in mammals [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and all these roles must presumably be condensed into a two-member family in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Recombinant protein fragments of both <italic>Pf</italic>BLM and <italic>Pf</italic>WRN have been shown to unwind partial-duplex DNA structures [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] but their affinity for other substrates has not been determined and the two helicases are certainly not functionally interchangeable.</p><fig id="pgen.1007490.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1007490.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Schematic summarising the roles of RecQ helicases in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>.</title><p>The schematic shows proposed helicase roles at replication forks (A), transcribed genes (B) and telomeres (C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1007490.g006"/></fig><p>As expected, DNA replication was disrupted in wildtype parasites when they were treated with G4-binding drugs, showing that G4s are indeed replication-stalling structures. However, G4s are predicted to occur very rarely (only ~1 per 300kb [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), so every disrupted replication fork cannot be directly caused by a G4. Instead, a few DNA breaks may induce a wider checkpoint response, slowing down all active forks <italic>in trans</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Alternatively, the TMPyP4/2 drugs may bind to DNA at other locations besides G4s: TMPyP4 is known to be a strong but not highly specific binder of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> G4s [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, it is possible that the sequence-based prediction of PQSs severely underestimates the actual G4 density in the genome. However, the idea that replication stalling can induce a general checkpoint response <italic>in trans</italic> is further supported by the observation that in the RecQ mutants, existing disruption to replication dynamics was not further exacerbated by TMPyP4/2, suggesting that it is already at its maximal level in these mutants owing to a constantly active checkpoint response. Almost nothing is currently known about cell cycle checkpoints in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to this possible <italic>in trans</italic> effect, the effects observed at the transcriptional level are more likely to occur <italic>in cis</italic> on a gene-by-gene basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007490.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). They are probably attributable to impeded RNA transcription when helicase activity is lacking at common DNA features such as hairpins, because the genes deregulated in ring-stage mutant parasites tended to have high levels of repetitive and low-complexity sequence (TRs/LCRs), prone to form such secondary structures. In addition, specific changes were seen in <italic>var</italic> transcription and these may be primarily due to G4s, since <italic>var</italic> genes are enriched in PQSs but are not particularly rich in TRs/LCRs. Deregulated gene expression may be concentrated at the ring stage because other DNA processing proteins such as replicative helicases are not yet upregulated, making the RecQs at their least redundant in prereplicative parasites. Interestingly, a high TR/LCR content was linked primarily to up-regulation rather than down-regulation of transcripts, suggesting that the RecQ helicases normally slow down transcription when they process aberrant DNA structures, and that faster but potentially error-prone transcription can occur in their absence. Again, the effects of <italic>Pf</italic>WRN and <italic>Pf</italic>BLM mutations were largely non-overlapping, which is likewise seen in the transcriptomes of different RecQ mutants in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Although many of the <italic>PfWRN</italic> and <italic>PfBLM</italic> mutant phenotypes showed little overlap, both helicases probably contribute to G4 processing at <italic>var</italic>s because both mutant lines showed altered transcription of PQS-containing <italic>var</italic>s in ring-stage parasites. Notably, not only was the PQSs-encoding subset of <italic>var</italic> genes disproportionately affected, but those <italic>var</italic>s with a PQS on the antisense strand were specifically upregulated. This may be because a persistent antisense G4 can keep the corresponding sense-strand free and thus accessible for transcription. Importantly, this could have a direct impact on the virulence of parasites in human hosts: if the expression or activity of RecQ helicases can vary during human infections, the expression and antigenic variation of the parasite&#x02019;s primary virulence gene family could vary accordingly. Indeed, RecQ helicase expression can vary <italic>in vivo</italic>: it is higher in parasites from children than from pregnant women (and still lower in cultured 3D7) [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we propose that in addition to the roles of <italic>Pf</italic>BLM in modulating replication and transcription through DNA secondary structures, this helicase could have another role in telomere maintenance and in modulating subtelomeric chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007490.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This is evidenced by the lengthening of telomeres and the upregulation of overall <italic>var</italic> gene expression (regardless of PQS association) in the &#x00394;<italic>PfBLM</italic> mutant. Subtelomeric DNA that encodes <italic>var</italic> genes tends to be heterochromatinised [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and relaxation of this state is expected to boost <italic>var</italic> expression, so <italic>Pf</italic>BLM may have a specific effect in maintaining heterochromatin. This may well be linked to its effect upon telomere maintenance, because the heterochromatic state spreads inwards from the telomeres [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and telomere repeats are intrinsically G4-rich, with incorrect processing of telomeric G4s deregulating telomerase activity [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>The &#x00394;<italic>PfBLM</italic> phenotype is intriguingly similar to that of a mutant in another chromatin-maintenance protein, the histone deacetylase <italic>Pf</italic>Sir2a [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Both mutants show telomere lengthening together with overexpression of a fixed set of <italic>var</italic> genes, suggesting that both enzymes affect the integrity of subtelomeric chromatin&#x02014;possibly in direct collaboration. There is a precedent for this because the human sirtuin SIRT6 acts on telomeric chromatin and facilitates recruitment of human WRN to maintain telomere stability [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> the effect upon telomeres appears to be exerted primarily by <italic>Pf</italic>BLM, but it is important to note that the two <italic>Plasmodium</italic> helicases are not necessarily functional homologs of their mammalian namesakes [<xref rid="pgen.1007490.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Taking our data as a whole, we have detected several overlapping but distinct roles for the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> RecQ helicases, as summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1007490.g006">Fig 6</xref>. We divide these into four overall categories: an effect on common DNA secondary structures throughout the genome; a second effect specific to G4-containing variant gene sequences, a third effect on chromatin structure and a fourth on telomere maintenance. Together these effects give rise to complex changes in both genome replication and transcription when the helicases are lacking.
