<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the genome is relatively stable, with mutation rates similar to most eukaryotic species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, some regions are very unstable with high recombination rates, driving the generation of new immune evasion-associated var genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The molecular factors controlling the inconsistent stability of this genome are not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the roles of the two putative RecQ helicases in P. falciparum, PfBLM and PfWRN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When PfWRN was knocked down, recombination rates increased four-fold, generating chromosomal abnormalities, a high rate of chimeric var genes and many microindels, particularly in known ‘fragile sites’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This is the first identification of a gene involved in suppressing recombination and maintaining genome stability in Plasmodium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By contrast, no change in mutation rate appeared when the second RecQ helicase, PfBLM, was mutated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the transcriptional level, however, both helicases evidently modulate the transcription of large cohorts of genes, with several hundred genes—including a large proportion of vars—showing deregulated expression in each RecQ mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aberrant processing of stalled replication forks is a possible mechanism underlying elevated mutation rates and this was assessed by measuring DNA replication dynamics in the RecQ mutant lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Replication forks moved slowly and stalled at elevated rates in both mutants, confirming that RecQ helicases are required for efficient DNA replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall, this work identifies the Plasmodium RecQ helicases as major players in DNA replication, antigenic diversification and genome stability in the most lethal human malaria parasite, with important implications for genome evolution in this pathogen. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Protozoan Plasmodium parasites are the causative agents of human malaria, a disease responsible for widespread morbidity and almost half a million deaths each year [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most malaria deaths are caused by the species P. falciparum, although four other Plasmodium species also infect humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>P. falciparum has one of the most highly A/T-biased genomes ever sequenced, at ~81% A/T [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This is maintained by a high mutational bias towards G/C to A/T transitions [3] and the resultant genome contains a preponderance of A/T repeat tracts [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These are prone to form structures such as hairpins and slipped-strand pairing, and they can expand and contract readily, producing a genome that is very prone to micro-indels [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Simple A/T repeats can also promote the duplication of whole genes via homologous recombination (HR) between repeats—a mechanism that favours genome evolution via gene duplication followed by functional diversification and/or selection [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This is specifically implicated in the evolution of drug resistance (e.g. amplification of the multi-drug resistance gene PfMDR1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>As expected given the A/T bias, guanine-rich motifs are contrastingly very scarce. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Only ~80 putative G-quadruplex (G4) forming sequences (non-double-helical structures that require four closely-spaced tracts of at least three guanines to form [7]) are found outside the intrinsically guanine-rich telomeres in P. falciparum [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Both hairpins and G4s in DNA are implicated in stalling RNA and DNA polymerases, and in promoting recombination events via DNA breakage at stalled replication forks [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Plasmodium species repair DNA breaks primarily by homologous recombination because they lack a conventional non-homologous end joining pathway [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The Plasmodium genome is, however, haploid (except for a brief diploid stage during sexual reproduction in the mosquito vector), so templates for HR are limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The natural occurrence of HR during mitotic growth of haploid P. falciparum parasites in human erythrocytes has been quantified, showing that it occurs almost exclusively in subtelomeric regions and in chromosome-internal hypervariable regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Both these regions contain genes from multi-gene families that encode variant surface antigens, such as var genes [13, 14]. Var genes encode a virulence factor called P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1) that is expressed on the surface of parasite-infected erythrocytes [15–17], and P. falciparum can maintain chronic infections via antigenic switching of this factor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Var recombination events usually generate new, functional chimeric genes [13, 14]: in terms of genome evolution they are thus distinct from the gene duplications that can be selected under drug pressure. Var recombination appears to be selectively neutral in in vitro culture, but in vivo it could diversify the repertoire of antigens and enhance the parasite’s capacity for immune evasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The var recombination breakpoints that occur during in vitro culture are spatially associated with potential helix-disrupting structures including hairpins [18] and G4s [9], suggesting that HR is initiated when replication forks stall at such structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In fact, the observation that sequences with the potential to form G4s are strongly clustered around var genes [9] suggests that such rare sequences may actually be maintained for this purpose, conferring an evolutionary advantage in var gene diversification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In model systems, non-canonical DNA structures including G4s are targeted by ‘RecQ’ helicases, which suppress the stalling of replication forks and hence recombination events [19], as well as modulating transcription through non-canonical DNA structures [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether either recombination or transcription in the P. falciparum genome could be affected by the two putative RecQ helicases encoded by this parasite, PfWRN and PfBLM [8, 9, 21, 22]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>To investigate the roles of RecQ helicases in P. falciparum, the two genes that encode PfBLM and PfWRN were targeted for gene replacement via double homologous recombination. PfBLM was successfully knocked out, as shown by Southern blotting of the disrupted locus (S1A Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The absence of a full-length transcript in the mutant line was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig 1A) and RNA-Seq (S1B Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In the case of PfWRN, gene knockout did not occur as predicted; the endogenous locus was disrupted (S2A Fig) but Southern blotting suggested that a two-plasmid concatamer had integrated into this locus via a single recombination event at the 5’ gene-targeting sequence: this was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing (S2B Fig) and RNA-Seq (S2C Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The integration produced a promoter-less copy of the gene, truncated at the 5’ end, but the rest of the PfWRN transcript was still expressed at a low level (&lt;7% of wildtype, as detected by RT-PCR, Fig 1B), and this truncated transcript could potentially produce a protein with residual helicase function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This line, termed ‘PfWRN-k/d’, therefore represents a &gt;90% knockdown, at least at the RNA level, rather than a genuine knockout of PfWRN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Notably, several rounds of unsuccessful negative selection were conducted before this parasite line was obtained, perhaps because complete loss of the PfWRN helicase is lethal for blood-stage P. falciparum parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In keeping with this hypothesis, survival of the PfWRN-disruptant that was eventually obtained would require the thymidine kinase negative selection marker to be largely silenced (as supported by RNA-Seq data in S2C Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Overall, this complex genetic event implies a strong selection pressure against complete functional inactivation of PfWRN. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of SVs were restricted to hypervariable regions (subtelomeric or internal) which contain highly polymorphic genes such as var genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The recombination generally involves var domains of the same class and the breakpoint is located in a short region of higher homology, keeping the same gene architecture and keeping the sequence in frame [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, in PfWRN-k/d we identified two examples of a group A var gene recombining with a group B gene, leading to abnormal, presumably non-functional, chimeras (S1 Spreadsheet, Sheet4; S7 Fig). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>We present here the first report on the biological roles of RecQ helicases in P. falciparum at the genomic and transcriptomic levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>We show that these helicases have far-reaching effects on genome stability and gene transcription, including particular effects on recombination and transcription of the important var family of virulence genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>At the genomic level, we observed a marked difference between the two mutant lines: knockout of PfBLM did not influence the mutation rate, while the knockdown of PfWRN created a highly elevated number of micro-indels and SVs, plus a plethora of unusual recombination patterns never observed in previous clone trees that were generated from wildtype parasite strains [3, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>Because the growth rate of the PfWRN-k/d parasites is reduced, the true mutation rate could be even higher than the current estimation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Hypermutation at the level detected here is probably deleterious in the wild: no natural mutant in PfWRN appears in any sequenced strain and this helicase also appears to be more important for parasite survival in vitro than PfBLM, given our failure to obtain a complete PfWRN knockout. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the survival of our PfBLM knockout contradicts a previous report that PfBLM is essential: this was established by treating parasites with a dsRNA against PfBLM [30], but no evidence was shown that the dsRNA actually affected the intended gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge this is the first discovery of a gene directly involved in genome stability in P. falciparum: a mild mutator phenotype has previously been linked to the mismatch repair factor PfMLH1 [13, 31], but this involved only an elevated SNP rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>By contrast, PfWRN appears to functionally suppress all types of mutations, including small indels, SNPs and in particular, large structural variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Its role in suppressing structural variants and indels is probably particularly crucial for a genome in which repetitive sequences, and thus risks of DNA polymerase slippage, are common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>An increased SNP rate was not necessarily expected, since PfWRN is reported to lack the proofreading exonuclease domain found in human WRN [22], and importantly the SNP datasets were all very small, making changes in SNP rate only marginally significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is possible that an unidentified, divergent exonuclease domain may exist in PfWRN, or that other defects causing an excess of single-stranded DNA could lead to an elevated SNP rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the phenotypes seen here are consistent with RecQ functions in other organisms: for example, the yeast helicase Sgs1 is required to prevent indels and fragility in triplet repeat regions [32], while metazoan RecQ homologues in species from humans to C. elegans are required to maintain chromosome integrity and suppress genome instability and aberrant recombination [33–35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>In P. falciparum, the result appears to be that a RecQ helicase has taken on a specific, and perhaps unique, role in modulating the evolution of a major virulence gene family (albeit with the caveat that any recombination events between other, essential genes, must go unrecorded due to their lethality). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Importantly, our clone tree plus whole genome sequencing approach successfully identified RecQ-associated mutations at a resolution never described in other model organisms so far. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>DNA features such as TRs, LCRs and G4s can all form secondary structures that impede the passage of polymerases, and many of the mutation events seen here correlate with such features: structural variants being particularly associated with PQSs, and to a lesser extent with TRs, while indels are strongly associated with TRs and LCRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Mammalian RecQ homologs are known to act on stalled replication forks and recombination intermediates [36–38] and the two RecQ homologs in Plasmodium spp. presumably act similarly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Our evidence from DNA combing supports stalled replication forks as the mechanism underlying elevated rates of recombination in the PfWRN mutant, but it is curious that only this mutant showed severe genome instability, given that both mutants showed strong replication defects on DNA fibres. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>In fact, stalled forks may be processed via at least two different routes: a recombinogenic route in the absence of PfWRN and a less recombinogenic route in the absence of PfBLM (Fig 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the PfWRN mutant showed a specific change in the distance between recombination breakpoints and PQSs, suggesting that replication forks are processed differently when they encounter a G4 in this mutant, with longer lengths of DNA being unwound or resected before a recombination event can occur. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>This is commensurate with one of the reported roles of human WRN, suppressing resection of DNA breaks [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the two RecQ helicases may preferentially target particular substrates, such as regressed replication forks, recombination intermediates, telomeric G4s or R-loops: such a ‘division of labour’ occurs amongst the five-member RecQ family in mammals [19], and all these roles must presumably be condensed into a two-member family in Plasmodium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Recombinant protein fragments of both PfBLM and PfWRN have been shown to unwind partial-duplex DNA structures [21, 40] but their affinity for other substrates has not been determined and the two helicases are certainly not functionally interchangeable. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>However, G4s are predicted to occur very rarely (only ~1 per 300kb [9]), so every disrupted replication fork cannot be directly caused by a G4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>Instead, a few DNA breaks may induce a wider checkpoint response, slowing down all active forks in trans [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the TMPyP4/2 drugs may bind to DNA at other locations besides G4s: TMPyP4 is known to be a strong but not highly specific binder of Plasmodium G4s [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is possible that the sequence-based prediction of PQSs severely underestimates the actual G4 density in the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>However, the idea that replication stalling can induce a general checkpoint response in trans is further supported by the observation that in the RecQ mutants, existing disruption to replication dynamics was not further exacerbated by TMPyP4/2, suggesting that it is already at its maximal level in these mutants owing to a constantly active checkpoint response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Almost nothing is currently known about cell cycle checkpoints in Plasmodium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>In contrast to this possible in trans effect, the effects observed at the transcriptional level are more likely to occur in cis on a gene-by-gene basis (Fig 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>They are probably attributable to impeded RNA transcription when helicase activity is lacking at common DNA features such as hairpins, because the genes deregulated in ring-stage mutant parasites tended to have high levels of repetitive and low-complexity sequence (TRs/LCRs), prone to form such secondary structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>In addition, specific changes were seen in var transcription and these may be primarily due to G4s, since var genes are enriched in PQSs but are not particularly rich in TRs/LCRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Deregulated gene expression may be concentrated at the ring stage because other DNA processing proteins such as replicative helicases are not yet upregulated, making the RecQs at their least redundant in prereplicative parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a high TR/LCR content was linked primarily to up-regulation rather than down-regulation of transcripts, suggesting that the RecQ helicases normally slow down transcription when they process aberrant DNA structures, and that faster but potentially error-prone transcription can occur in their absence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Again, the effects of PfWRN and PfBLM mutations were largely non-overlapping, which is likewise seen in the transcriptomes of different RecQ mutants in mammalian cells [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Although many of the PfWRN and PfBLM mutant phenotypes showed little overlap, both helicases probably contribute to G4 processing at vars because both mutant lines showed altered transcription of PQS-containing vars in ring-stage parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Notably, not only was the PQSs-encoding subset of var genes disproportionately affected, but those vars with a PQS on the antisense strand were specifically upregulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>This may be because a persistent antisense G4 can keep the corresponding sense-strand free and thus accessible for transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Importantly, this could have a direct impact on the virulence of parasites in human hosts: if the expression or activity of RecQ helicases can vary during human infections, the expression and antigenic variation of the parasite’s primary virulence gene family could vary accordingly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Indeed, RecQ helicase expression can vary in vivo: it is higher in parasites from children than from pregnant women (and still lower in cultured 3D7) [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Finally, we propose that in addition to the roles of PfBLM in modulating replication and transcription through DNA secondary structures, this helicase could have another role in telomere maintenance and in modulating subtelomeric chromatin structure (Fig 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>This is evidenced by the lengthening of telomeres and the upregulation of overall var gene expression (regardless of PQS association) in the ΔPfBLM mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Subtelomeric DNA that encodes var genes tends to be heterochromatinised [44] and relaxation of this state is expected to boost var expression, so PfBLM may have a specific effect in maintaining heterochromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>This may well be linked to its effect upon telomere maintenance, because the heterochromatic state spreads inwards from the telomeres [45] and telomere repeats are intrinsically G4-rich, with incorrect processing of telomeric G4s deregulating telomerase activity [46–48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>The ΔPfBLM phenotype is intriguingly similar to that of a mutant in another chromatin-maintenance protein, the histone deacetylase PfSir2a [49–51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Both mutants show telomere lengthening together with overexpression of a fixed set of var genes, suggesting that both enzymes affect the integrity of subtelomeric chromatin—possibly in direct collaboration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>There is a precedent for this because the human sirtuin SIRT6 acts on telomeric chromatin and facilitates recruitment of human WRN to maintain telomere stability [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>In P. falciparum the effect upon telomeres appears to be exerted primarily by PfBLM, but it is important to note that the two Plasmodium helicases are not necessarily functional homologs of their mammalian namesakes [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>Taking our data as a whole, we have detected several overlapping but distinct roles for the P. falciparum RecQ helicases, as summarised in Fig 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>We divide these into four overall categories: an effect on common DNA secondary structures throughout the genome; a second effect specific to G4-containing variant gene sequences, a third effect on chromatin structure and a fourth on telomere maintenance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>Together these effects give rise to complex changes in both genome replication and transcription when the helicases are lacking. </plain></SENT>
