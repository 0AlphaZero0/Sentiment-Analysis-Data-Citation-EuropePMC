peritonitis virus. It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes of FCoV have been considered the
candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes
from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs
in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes with remainder
displaying a mutation in the <italic>S</italic> or <italic>3c</italic> gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the <italic>3c</italic> gene could be useful for studying the
horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>3c</italic> gene</kwd><kwd>feline coronavirus</kwd><kwd>multi-cat environment</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd><italic>S</italic> gene</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The genome of feline coronavirus (FCoV), a member of the <italic>Alphacoronavirus 1</italic> species of the genus <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, comprises single-stranded positive-sense RNA
[<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. FCoV infection is prevalent in cats worldwide and is divided into two biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). The former has low pathogenicity, causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection, and the latter is highly virulent and lethal. FIP is characterised by the accumulation of body
cavity effusions (effusive or wet form) and the formation of granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs (non-effusive or dry form) [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. FIPVs are
considered mutants of FECVs [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Although the viral genes responsible for biotype conversion have not been completely elucidated, the candidate genes have been identified. The <italic>S</italic> gene encodes spike protein on
the viral membrane. It was reported that 95.8% of 118 serotype I FIPVs displayed missense mutations in codon 1,058 or 1,060 of the <italic>S</italic> gene, whereas none of the sample of 183
FECVs exhibited these mutations [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The non-synonymous mutations in codons 1,058 and 1,060 substituted methionine to leucine (M1,058L) and serine to
alanine (S1,060A), respectively. The <italic>3c</italic> gene encoding an accessory viral protein was also reported to be mutated in 60&#x02013;100% of FIPVs, resulting in the loss or truncation of the
3c protein, whereas most FECVs carried an intact <italic>3c</italic> gene [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accordingly,
it was considered that mutation of the <italic>S</italic> gene, <italic>3c</italic> gene or both was involved in the acquisition or augmentation of lethal pathogenicity in the majorityof FIPV
field strains. In the present study, we analyzed the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes of FCoVs detected in faecal materials, effusion samples, and tissues that were obtained from
cats in Japan to determine the frequency and location of the mutations. An analysis of the <italic>3c</italic> gene suggested the horizontal infection of FCoVs, which were detected in effusions
and tissues, among several housemate cats in a multi-cat environment.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Collection of clinical samples</title><p>Clinical specimens were obtained from 93 cats referred to private veterinary hospitals in Japan for suspected FIP based on clinical symptoms, including pyrexia, vomiting, diarrhoea,
jaundice, emaciation, anaemia, ascites, pleural effusion, ophthalmologic abnormalities, neurological signs, and death. Some animals displayed an enlargement of abdominal organs that was
noticed on palpation, radiography, or ultrasound. The samples of abdominal and pleural effusions, whole blood, serum, rectal swabs, faeces and tissues were sent to our laboratory under
refrigeration. Tissues were obtained via autopsy of four cats that had been kept by the same owner and referred to a veterinary hospital. The analyzed tissues included kidneys, mesenteric
lymph nodes, a spleen, and an eye and its vitreous humor. Whole blood samples were treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as an anticoagulant.</p><p>Faecal samples were collected from an animal shelter wherein each cat was housed alone or with a few other cats per cage. To prevent the redundant analysis of a cat when &#x02265;2 cats were kept
in a single cage, only one faecal sample was taken.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleic acid extraction and complementary DNA synthesis</title><p>Total RNA samples were extracted from effusions, supernatants of phosphate-buffered saline-homogenised faecal and rectal swab samples, serum, plasma, and a vitreous humor sample from an eye
using a QIAamp<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) or ISOGEN-LS reagent (NIPPON GENE, Tokyo, Japan). RNA samples of whole blood were extracted using ISOGEN-LS reagent.
In some cases, erythrocytes were lysed using 0.2% sodium chloride to isolate leukocytes, and their RNA was extracted using an RNeasy<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Mini Kit (QIAGEN) in combination with a QIA
shredder (QIAGEN). Tissues were homogenised in ISOGEN reagent (NIPPON GENE) using a TissueRuptor with TissueRuptor disposable probes (QIAGEN). cDNAs were synthesised using a PrimeScript&#x02122; 1st
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). All reagents and kits were used according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Amplification of the S and 3c genes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to amplify the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes using GoTaq<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Green Master Mix (Promega,
Madison, WI, U.S.A.), previously reported primers [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and our designed
primers (<xref rid="pdf_001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). The primers were used at a final concentration of 0.5 <italic>&#x000b5;</italic>M. The
<italic>S</italic> gene fragments were amplified to determine the FCoV serotype (I or II) in each animal. Amplification of the <italic>3c</italic> and <italic>S</italic> genes, including
codons 1,058 and 1,060, via first-round PCR was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min; 50 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 50&#x000b0;C for 30 sec and 72&#x000b0;C for 45 sec; and final
extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. In some cases, the <italic>3c</italic> and <italic>S</italic> genes were amplified via nested RT-PCR, in which a second-round reaction was performed using the
same PCR cycle parameters. The <italic>S</italic> gene-based serotyping was carried out together with the <italic>3c</italic> gene amplification under the same reaction protocol or
separately via single or nested RT-PCR, wherein the reaction protocol was the same except for a shortened extension time of 20 sec. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel
and amplified DNA fragments were retrieved using the Wizard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The extracted product was directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit on a genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3130, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Some amplicons were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a
TOPO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> TA Cloning<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced using M13 primers or the primers used for RT-PCR. The obtained <italic>3c</italic> gene sequences were
analyzed to determine the types and locations of mutations via comparisons with type I FECV strains RM (FJ938051) and UU19 (HQ392470) and type II FIPV strain KUK-H/L (AB781789), none of
which carry mutations resulting in the production of truncated proteins. GENETYX 13 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and BioEdit 7.1.3.0 [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] software were
used for sequence analysis. All determined <italic>3c</italic> gene sequences were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan.

FCoV serotypes I and II were detected in 38 and 2 cats, respectively. The ages of 39 animals with FCoV positivity in any

nonsense mutation (15 samples [40.5%] from 11 cats). A missense mutation at the start codon was found in three samples (8.1%) from three cats, and an ATG codon next to the original start

Our present study revealed that type I FCoVs in ascites and pleural effusion samples had the M1,058L and S1,060A missense mutations at a rate of 80.0 and 13.3%,
respectively. Because histopathological examinations of the cats were not performed, the biotypes of FCoVs analyzed in this study could not be determined. Therefore, the relationship between
the biotypes and gene mutations was not analyzed. However, it is considered that approximately &#x02265;90% FCoVs in effusion samples have one of the <italic>S</italic> gene mutations. On the
contrary, neither M1,058L nor S1,060A mutations were found in FCoVs in any of the 19 faecal samples from shelter cats, some of which had soft stools, indicating enteritis. A previous report
indicated that none of the FECVs in rectal swabs carried a mutation at codon 1,058 or 1,060 [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Accordingly, it is suggested that majority FCoVs in
faeces of clinically healthy cats and cats with only mild enteritis carry the <italic>S</italic> genes without any of these mutations. The M1,058L mutation was also detected in faeces and
tissues of four young diseased cats that had died. The biotype of the viruses was unknown, but faecal FCoVs with the M1,058L or S1,060A mutation would require experimental infection for
pathogenicity determination, even when FIP was confirmed via histopathological examination.</p><p>Previous studies have identified truncating mutations of the <italic>3c</italic> gene in the genomes of &#x0003e;60% of FIPVs, whereas most FECVs carried intact <italic>3c</italic> genes. Although
the precise molecular function of the 3c protein is unknown, it has been reported to play an essential role in FECV replication in the intestines [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our present study determined that 87.5% FCoVs in body cavity effusions, which included type I and II viruses, and all type I FCoVs, in six tissues
collected from four cats, carried <italic>3c</italic> gene mutations resulting in the truncation or loss of 3c protein. However, such mutations were not detected in the majority of faecal
FCoVs of shelter cats that did not exhibit any clinical symptoms except for soft stools. This finding is similar to previously published data [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is considered that in addition to the M1,058L and S1,060A mutations in the <italic>S</italic> gene, a truncating mutation of the
<italic>3c</italic> gene is another genetic feature that is relatively characteristic of FCoVs in effusions and tissues. Molecular functional analysis of the 3c protein is required to
elucidate the influence of the <italic>3c</italic> gene mutation on the FCoVs.</p><p>The M1,058L or S1,060A mutations were found along with a <italic>3c</italic> gene truncating mutation in 80.0% type I FCoVs from 30 effusion samples, whereas the mutation of either the
<italic>S</italic> or <italic>3c</italic> gene was detected in 13.3 and 6.7% of the FCoVs in effusions, respectively. Because the <italic>S</italic> genes were not mutated and
<italic>3c</italic> genes were intact in the majority of faecal FCoVs, it is suggested that a mutation of either or both the genes are involved in the alteration of tissue tropism of
FCoVs.</p><p>A frameshift due to a deletion and a nonsense mutation is the most common truncating mutation of the <italic>3c</italic> gene. This result correlated with previous studies [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interestingly, 22.5% <italic>3c</italic> gene ORFs contained two or three deletions at different positions in
each sequence. For example, the <italic>3c</italic> sequence of an FCoV in ascites from cat 35 had a 25-base deletion and another downstream two-base deletion. Therefore, it is considered that
mutations often accumulate in the <italic>3c</italic> gene of an FCoV in effusions.</p><p>FIPV is not usually considered to transmit horizontally [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, in an outbreak of FIP in an animal shelter in Taiwan, an identical nonsense
mutation at codon 210 in the 714-base <italic>3c</italic> ORF was shared by serotype II FCoVs in the effusions of two cats that died from FIP within a 5-month interval [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our present research analyzed six housemate cats that were referred to a veterinary hospital. All cats died within 3 months with or without ascites and granulomatous
lesions in organs upon gross examination. Some identical mutations were shared in the <italic>3c</italic> gene sequences with &#x0003e;99% homology. Accordingly, it is considered that an analysis
of the <italic>3c</italic> genes is useful to determine whether a specific viral strain horizontally transmits among cats.</p><p>In the present study, it was shown that approximately 95% faecal FCoVs in an animal shelter had an intact <italic>3c</italic> gene and that the <italic>S</italic> gene that was not mutated at
codons 1,058 and 1,060. In contrast, all FCoVs in effusion samples carried a mutation in either or both of the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>3c</italic> genes. Determination of FCoV biotypes
is required to elucidate the correlation of pathogenicity of the virus to gene mutations. Further investigations also need the analysis of protein function alterations caused by the
mutations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pdf_001"><caption><title>Supplement Tables</title></caption><media xlink:href="jvms-80-1094-s001.pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e698" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We greatly appreciate the Fukuoka Veterinary Medical Association and all the veterinary practitioners and staff who kindly provided clinical samples.
