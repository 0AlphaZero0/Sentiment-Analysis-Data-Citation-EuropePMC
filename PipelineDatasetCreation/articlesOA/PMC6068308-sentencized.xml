<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The former has low pathogenicity, causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection, and the latter is highly virulent and lethal. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>A previous investigation had determined that 96.2% FIPVs causing wet form FIP had either an M1,058L (89.9%) or S1,060A (6.3%) mutation in the S gene [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our present study revealed that type I FCoVs in ascites and pleural effusion samples had the M1,058L and S1,060A missense mutations at a rate of 80.0 and 13.3%, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Because histopathological examinations of the cats were not performed, the biotypes of FCoVs analyzed in this study could not be determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the relationship between the biotypes and gene mutations was not analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>However, it is considered that approximately ≥90% FCoVs in effusion samples have one of the S gene mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, neither M1,058L nor S1,060A mutations were found in FCoVs in any of the 19 faecal samples from shelter cats, some of which had soft stools, indicating enteritis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A previous report indicated that none of the FECVs in rectal swabs carried a mutation at codon 1,058 or 1,060 [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it is suggested that majority FCoVs in faeces of clinically healthy cats and cats with only mild enteritis carry the S genes without any of these mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The M1,058L mutation was also detected in faeces and tissues of four young diseased cats that had died. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The biotype of the viruses was unknown, but faecal FCoVs with the M1,058L or S1,060A mutation would require experimental infection for pathogenicity determination, even when FIP was confirmed via histopathological examination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have identified truncating mutations of the 3c gene in the genomes of &gt;60% of FIPVs, whereas most FECVs carried intact 3c genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Although the precise molecular function of the 3c protein is unknown, it has been reported to play an essential role in FECV replication in the intestines [2, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Our present study determined that 87.5% FCoVs in body cavity effusions, which included type I and II viruses, and all type I FCoVs, in six tissues collected from four cats, carried 3c gene mutations resulting in the truncation or loss of 3c protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, such mutations were not detected in the majority of faecal FCoVs of shelter cats that did not exhibit any clinical symptoms except for soft stools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This finding is similar to previously published data [3, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is considered that in addition to the M1,058L and S1,060A mutations in the S gene, a truncating mutation of the 3c gene is another genetic feature that is relatively characteristic of FCoVs in effusions and tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Molecular functional analysis of the 3c protein is required to elucidate the influence of the 3c gene mutation on the FCoVs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>The M1,058L or S1,060A mutations were found along with a 3c gene truncating mutation in 80.0% type I FCoVs from 30 effusion samples, whereas the mutation of either the S or 3c gene was detected in 13.3 and 6.7% of the FCoVs in effusions, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Because the S genes were not mutated and 3c genes were intact in the majority of faecal FCoVs, it is suggested that a mutation of either or both the genes are involved in the alteration of tissue tropism of FCoVs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>A frameshift due to a deletion and a nonsense mutation is the most common truncating mutation of the 3c gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This result correlated with previous studies [3, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 22.5% 3c gene ORFs contained two or three deletions at different positions in each sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>For example, the 3c sequence of an FCoV in ascites from cat 35 had a 25-base deletion and another downstream two-base deletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is considered that mutations often accumulate in the 3c gene of an FCoV in effusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>FIPV is not usually considered to transmit horizontally [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, in an outbreak of FIP in an animal shelter in Taiwan, an identical nonsense mutation at codon 210 in the 714-base 3c ORF was shared by serotype II FCoVs in the effusions of two cats that died from FIP within a 5-month interval [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Our present research analyzed six housemate cats that were referred to a veterinary hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>All cats died within 3 months with or without ascites and granulomatous lesions in organs upon gross examination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Some identical mutations were shared in the 3c gene sequences with &gt;99% homology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it is considered that an analysis of the 3c genes is useful to determine whether a specific viral strain horizontally transmits among cats. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>In the present study, it was shown that approximately 95% faecal FCoVs in an animal shelter had an intact 3c gene and that the S gene that was not mutated at codons 1,058 and 1,060. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In contrast, all FCoVs in effusion samples carried a mutation in either or both of the S and 3c genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Determination of FCoV biotypes is required to elucidate the correlation of pathogenicity of the virus to gene mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Further investigations also need the analysis of protein function alterations caused by the mutations. </plain></SENT>
