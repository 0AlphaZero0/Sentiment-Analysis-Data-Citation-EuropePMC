<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clustered data, in the form of multiple trees sampled from multiple forest stands is commonly used to develop biomass allometric models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 102 reviewed papers published between 2012 and 2016 that reported biomass allometric models, 84 (82%) have used a clustered sampling design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in as many as 80% of these, the clustered data structure was ignored, potentially violating the independence assumption in ordinary least squares methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The consequences of ignoring clustered data structure were empirically validated using two clustered biomass datasets (of 110 and 220 trees, with the cluster size of 5 and 10 trees respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We showed that when Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) was higher than zero, ignoring the clustered data structure returned underestimated standard errors, affecting further the confidence interval and t-test results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The underestimation level depended on ICC (which shows the variance proportion that was caused by the forest stand) and on cluster size (the number of trees sampled from one forest stand). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also showed that using first-order autocorrelation tests, such as the traditional Durbin-Watson statistic, to detect the autocorrelation due to clustered structure could be misleading as the test may show lack of autocorrelation even though ICC is different from zero. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Estimating carbon accumulation in forests, with great accuracy and precision, represents one of the major challenges that the international scientific community is facing today, in the context of climate change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, regardless of how accurate and precise these estimations are, they have to be robust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Robustness does not imply low uncertainty, but assumes that all uncertainty is known and transparently presented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The uncertainty is an essential component that helps policy makers understand how much these estimations can be trusted in order to make correct decisions regarding effective policies concerning climate change mitigation [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Quantifying and reducing the uncertainty in GHG estimations in forestry sector is becoming increasingly important, especially in the context of result-based payments in REDD+ programme (i.e. a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), and of emission reduction commitments under Kyoto Protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Estimating and reporting uncertainty under IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) guidelines [2], is mandatory for assessing the performance in implementation of all these land related activities for emission reduction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite the recent advances in remote-sensing based carbon monitoring [3], biomass allometric models are widely used to estimate forest biomass [4,5] or to calibrate the remote-sensing based methods [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The allometric models use easy-to-measure characteristics (e.g. diameter, height) to predict tree biomass, and subsequently the carbon sequestered in biomass. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In forestry practice empirical allometric models are often used, since they offer more accurate biomass prediction compared to theoretical models [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The empirical models are developed based on destructive sampling of trees, which involves the measurement of biomass (including all vegetative organs of the tree, both above and below ground) and of dendrometric characteristics of the standing tree (e.g. diameter at breast height, root collar diameter, height, crown diameter). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most common method of data analysis consists of logarithmic transformation of the variables, followed by classic linear regression analysis (Ordinary Least Squares, OLS) and a back-transformation [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although logarithmic transformation has been criticized lately, the goodness of fit for the proposed alternative (i.e. non-linear approach) depends on the type of error distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A non-linear approach was shown to be better for additive, homoscedastic normal error distributions, whereas logarithmic transformation was shown to give better results for multiplicative lognormal errors, which occur more frequently in allometric models [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>To fully trust the results, several assumptions (i.e. independence, linearity, normality and homogeneity of variance) should be fulfilled by the OLS regression [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the independence of observations is one of the most important and one of the most widely-ignored regression assumptions [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The range of covariate (i.e. diameter or height) in allometric models is recommended to be large [13], with a suggested minimum range of one order of magnitude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, the range of covariate is often limited within relatively uniform forest stands, especially in even-aged, planted forests where the trees have relatively similar sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is often necessary to sample trees from more than one forest stand, resulting in clustered datasets (more generally called ‘nested’ datasets). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The issue with clustered data resides in the violation of the independence assumption [14], when OLS methods are used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Due to similarities in genotype, environmental conditions and stand competition, the trees from the same stand (especially from regular plantations) tend to be more similar to each other than trees from other forest stands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Thus, when the data is clustered, the variance is produced both by the variability of the trees within and between forest stands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>If the variance produced by forest stands (between-stands variance) is different from zero, the individual trees do not bring the full amount of information, as OLS regression assumes for fully independent observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Instead, the new information each observation (i.e. tree) brings to the model, becomes weaker as the proportion of between-stands variance gets larger. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>As a result, when OLS methods are used with clustered data the standard errors are biased [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="?"><plain>This work focuses on the following research questions: (i) How frequently is clustered data structure ignored in biomass data analysis? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="?"><plain>(ii) What are the consequences of ignoring the clustered data structure in allometric models? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="?"><plain>(iii) How effective is Durbin-Watson test in detecting autocorrelation resulting from clustering? </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Review of published research </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether using clustered data to develop allometric equations and whether ignoring the clustered data structure were common in published allometric models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A total of 102 papers published in the last five years (January 2012 to December 2016) that reported biomass allometric equations were reviewed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Using specific keywords, the papers were searched online in February 2017. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The sampling design of each paper was evaluated, to check whether the sampling design was clustered or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The dataset was considered clustered (or nested) if data was collected from more than one forest stand (or location) with more than one tree sampled in at least one location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The dataset was also considered not independent, if biomass data for different tree species was pooled together to develop a multispecies model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The sampling design was considered independent if there was no or unclear information about clustered sampling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Besides the sampling design, the use, or non-use, of statistical techniques that include the clustering (e.g. multilevel models) was checked, for those papers suspected of independence violation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Theoretical modelling framework </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Here we present the general modelling framework for the linear model (which ignores the clustered data structure) and the multilevel model (which addresses the clustered data structure). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the consequences of ignoring the clustered data structure (when using linear models) are derived from this framework. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec005"><title><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>2.2.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Ignoring the clustered data structure: Linear model (LM) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Ordinary least squares linear model (LM) assumes that all observations are independent: yi=α+βxi+εi(1) where y is the dependent variable (e.g. tree biomass); x is the independent variable (e.g. tree diameter or height); α is the intercept; β is the slope; ε is the error term. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the clustered data structure is ignored, as the model cannot incorporate the dependency within the data [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>2.2.2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Addressing the clustered data structure: Multilevel model (MLM) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The multilevel model, also called the hierarchical or mixed-effect model, can incorporate the variance produced by forest stand, producing adjusted standard errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It was also shown to produce also correct type I error rates [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In multilevel analysis, the trees are referred to as level 1, whereas the cluster (plantation or forest stand) is referred to as level 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The prediction is made at level 1 only (tree level). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>As the multilevel model provides different intercepts (one for each analysed forest stand), using them for biomass prediction in other forest stands makes little sense. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this case, the role of level 2 is to allow the quantification of the noise generated by the forest stand [17], called also ‘nuisance effect’ [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) is derived from all intercept values, the resulting multilevel model taking similar form to that of linear model, while accounting for correlation within the data structure: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Level 1: yij=α+uj+βxij+εij,fori=1,…,N,εij~N(0,σ2)(2) </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Level 2: uj~N(0,τ2),forj=1,…,J(3) Where α is the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of the intercept, based on restricted maximum likelihood method; uj is the random part of the intercept, which assumes a normal distribution, with mean zero and variance τ2; β is the fixed slope for the population; J is the number of groups (forest stands); N is the total number of trees; yij is the biomass of the tree i from forest stand j; xij is the diameter (or height) of the tree i from forest stand j; εij is the error of tree i from forest stand j. The error variance is assumed normal with mean zero and variance σ2; uj and εij are assumed to be mutually independent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></list-item></list><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In multilevel models, the standard errors are adjusted by square root of design effect (Deff) [14]: Deff=1+(n-1)×ICC(4) where n is the cluster size (number of trees sampled from one forest stand) and ICC is the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>ICC shows the proportion of variance that is due to differences between clusters (level 2), out of total residual variance (level 1 and level 2): ICC=τ2τ2+σ2(5) where: τ2 is the random variance that is attributed to between cluster variation (τ is random effect of the intercept); σ2 is the residual variance, caused by the difference between trees within forest stand (σ is residual random effect). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>ICC varies between 0 and 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>When ICC = 0, all variance is due to differences between individuals within clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>When ICC = 1, all individuals within clusters are perfectly correlated and therefore, all variance of the model results from differences between clusters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The design effect also shows the ratio between the actual number of observations and the effective number of observations [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The effective number of observations is a hypothetical value, which can be defined as the number of fully independent observations that would offer the same output as the non-independent observations (i.e. actual number of observations). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>If n = 1, the effective number of observations equals the actual number of observations, therefore the data is independent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The data is also considered independent when ICC = 0, regardless of cluster size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>However, when both ICC &gt; 0 and n &gt; 1, the independence assumption is violated, and the effective number of observations becomes lower than the actual number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>When ICC = 1, the effective number of observations equals the number of clusters, as all trees within one cluster will bring identical information to the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In contrast, even when ICC has reasonably low values, the effective number of observations can be very seriously affected, if n is large. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The consequences of ignoring the clustered data structure </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Because the trees are likely to be more similar inside a particular forest stand, the autocorrelation in allometric models is expected to be only positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, positive autocorrelation of residuals produces underestimation of standard errors [18], since the number of effective observations is lower than the actual number of observations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The underestimation of standard errors (SEu) was defined as: SEu=SEmlm-SElmSEmlm×100(6) where SEmlm is the standard error of the multilevel model parameters (intercept and slope), and SElm is the standard error of the linear model parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>If the standard errors are weighted by square root of design effect, Eq 6 can be written as a function of n and ICC: SEu=1+(n-1)×ICC-11+(n-1)×ICC×100(7) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>However, the standard errors are generally used to compute the confidence intervals and also the evidence against null hypothesis in t-test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>The confidence intervals in logarithmic scale are underestimated by the same rate as standard errors (Eq 7), due to the proportionality between confidence interval and standard error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Instead, in null hypothesis tests of the slope (t-test), the slope estimate is divided by its standard error to obtain t-score. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Recommendations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>It is highly recommended that residual autocorrelation is checked, using specific tests (e.g. Durbin-Watson), when there is no noticeable form of clustering (nesting) in the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>If the data is significantly auto-correlated, then ordinary least squares methods should not be used, due to increased risk of biased standard errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The scientist should look for the cause of that autocorrelation and identify it before proceeding further with data analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is advisable that hierarchical models or other models that can account for the clustered data structure (e.g. robust standard errors, generalized least squares, cluster bootstrap, Bayesian hierarchical models [39,40]) are used when any form of clustering can be identified, even if the autocorrelation is not significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This is because, even at very low ICC values (when Durbin-Watson test can indicate a lack of autocorrelation), the effect of clustering on standard errors can be substantial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In multilevel models, the relationship between the dependent variable (e.g. biomass) and the independent variables (e.g. diameter, height) should be treated as a fixed effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The random effect should be represented by the second (or higher) hierarchy within the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This hierarchy could be represented by the forest stand, geographic region, tree species, position within canopy, or any other clustering factor that could alter the relationship between biomass and diameter (or height). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Reporting the ICC value (or at least the random effects) with hierarchical allometric models is highly recommended. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>We recommend adopting a sampling design based on large number of forest stands (at least 10) and large number of trees sampled from each forest stand (at least 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>However, if the number of forest stands is extremely low (e.g. lower than 4) as well as the number of trees in each forest stand (e.g. lower than 3), the resulting ICC could be highly imprecise [27,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>In this case, for more accurate estimates, the standard errors resulting from LM may be manually adjusted by square root of design effect (Eq 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The ICC value needed in Eq 4 could be deduced from random effects reported in the literature for similar species, forest stand characteristics and model type. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>When deciding upon a cluster size, the key is to find the best compromise between the effort of measuring any additional tree within a forest stand, the ICC bias and the amount of genuine information that tree can bring to the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Additionally, since the literature so far shows large variance attributed to forest stands [4,29,30], avoiding large cluster sizes is recommended, because it is likely that the effort invested in measuring additional trees within a forest stand will not be rewarded accordingly. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The reviewed published research shows that hierarchical approach is rarely used in biomass allometric models when the data is clustered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that, when ICC is different from zero, ignoring the clustering yields underestimated standard errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Underestimation of standard errors has further consequences on model prediction and inference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The confidence intervals are also underestimated, resulting in overconfident tree biomass predictions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the information against null hypothesis in t-test is overestimated, resulted in an inflated type I error, which may lead to potentially incorrect research conclusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, using first-order autocorrelation tests, such as the traditional Durbin-Watson statistic to detect the harmful effect of clustering could be misleading as the test may show lack of autocorrelation even though ICC is different from zero. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Therefore, adopting a modelling approach that accounts for the hierarchical structure of the data is highly recommended when any form of clustering can be identified, even if the autocorrelation is not significant. </plain></SENT>
