<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A total of 3360 lncRNAs (2048 up-regulated and 1312 down-regulated) and 2685 mRNAs (1195 up-regulated and 1490 down-regulated) were found to be differentially expressed between the NAFLD and control groups. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Instances of obesity and related metabolic syndrome are increasing around the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>According to the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data from World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600 million adults, accounting for approximately 13% of the world’s adult, were obese in 2014; this number has more than doubled since 1980 (WHO, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Because of strong association with obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the most common chronic liver disease, worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that its prevalence is 20–30% in the general population and 70% in patients with type 2 diabetes and is strikingly increased to 90–95% in obese people (Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Study Group et al., 2015; Portillo-Sanchez et al., 2015; Younossi et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, NAFLD is regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NAFLD is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), accounting for up to 25% of the cases of HCC in the western countries, and has become one of the most important public health problems (Michelotti et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis (Anstee et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD has not yet been fully elucidated and, thus, there are no effective medical interventions to completely cure NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Currently, the treatment for NAFLD remains limited, and mainly includes lifestyle alteration and body weight control; however, such strategies have poor compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the pathogenesis of NAFLD and devising of effective prevention and treatment modalities are, therefore, urgently required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) refer to RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding capacity (Wilusz et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Recently, emerging evidence has proved that lncRNAs play remarkable roles in numerous biological processes (Mercer et al., 2009; Wang and Chang, 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Rinn and Chang, 2012; Li et al., 2015), including cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, immune response, and hepatic lipid metabolism through transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Currently, many lncRNAs are known to be involved in liver diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, H19, HULC, and HOTAIR are lncRNAs that are upregulated in the hepatocellular carcinomas and promote tumor growth through various mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in a recent study, we identified a new lncRNA, uc002mbe.2, which plays a critical role in trichostatin A-induced apoptosis of HCC cells (Yang et al., 2013; Chen T. et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that lncRNA may also play key roles in lipid metabolism. Li et al. (2015) identified a liver-enriched lncRNA, lncLSTR, which regulates apoC2 expression via FXR-mediated pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Depletion of lncLSTR increases apoC2 expression, initiating LPL activation and enhances serum triglycerides clearance (Li et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, the roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of NAFLD remain largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In this study, we performed a microarray analysis to compare the liver lncRNA and mRNA profiles in diabetic db/db mice and normal mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Using several approaches for validation and mechanistic elucidation, we demonstrate that an lncRNA, AK012226, plays a crucial role in lipid accumulation and, thereby, in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Long non-coding RNAs participate in various biological processes, and the aberrant lncRNA expression can cause diverse diseases, especially cancers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNAs can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor RNAs (Gibb et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>However, as of date, little is known about the roles of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we performed genome-wide lncRNA and mRNA microarray analyses of liver samples from diabetic NAFL mouse to identify novel lncRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, aimed at obtaining new insights for the development of new therapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Notably, we discovered a novel lncRNA, AK012226, which was up-regulated in the liver of the NAFL mouse and was observed to play a role in the lipid accumulation in vitro. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Thus far, only a few studies have explored the role of lncRNAs in NAFLD. Sun et al. (2015) performed microarray experiments to analyze the profile of mRNAs and lncRNAs in patients with NAFLD, and 1735 lncRNAs and 1485 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the NAFLD samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>A research from China (Chen Y. et al., 2017) involved microarrays in the high fat diet-induced NAFLD mice model and revealed several lncRNAs and mRNAs associated with lipogenesis through different pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Chen et al. (2016) reported that lncRNA SRA could decrease lipolysis by repressing the expression of ATGL, leading to hepatic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>However, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in our study were a bit different from those observed in the above-mentioned studies, which could be attributed to the different NAFLD model employed by us. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Unlike the dietary mouse model of NAFLD used in several studies to perform genome wide analysis (Chen et al., 2016; Chen Y. et al., 2017), we employed the diabetic db/db mouse to establish the NAFLD animal model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Insulin resistance, frequently found in obesity and type 2 diabetes, is considered to be the most important factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the animal model is a better for metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and NAFLD (Sanches et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>The db/db mouse, defective in the leptin receptor gene, is a classic diabetic rodent model, manifesting hyperphagia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis (Tesch and Lim, 2011; Kitada et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In the present study, our results indicated that the db/db mouse develop NAFL, which is consistent with the results obtained in other studies (Kim et al., 2015; Su et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Thus, the db/db mouse is a proper animal model that mimics the metabolic syndrome-associated NAFLD in humans and is a suitable model to examine the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Notably, we identified a novel lncRNA, AK012226, which plays a functional role in lipid accumulation in the mouse NAFLD cellular model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>AK012226, located on the sense strand on chromosome 14 of mouse, is an exon sense-overlapping lncRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Exon-sense overlapping lncRNA is an lncRNA category that can be considered as transcript variants of protein-coding mRNAs, as they overlap with a known annotated gene on the same genomic strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>The gene predicted to be associated with it is 1700112E06Rik. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>However, this gene is considered to be involved in melanocyte differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results indicated that the knockdown of AK012226 expression significantly reduced the in vitro lipid accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Hepatic steatosis has long been considered as a relatively benign state in NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have proven that fatty liver is more vulnerable to injury from various causes (Adams et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Hepatic lipid accumulation is also associated with the increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (Neuschwander-Tetri, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of lipid can further aggravate the existing hepatic insulin resistance by generation of lipid-derived second messengers, such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides (Jornayvaz and Shulman, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is considered as the “first hit” in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (Day and James, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Therefore, lipid overaccumulation within hepatocytes is crucial in NAFLD (Donnelly et al., 2005; Reccia et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Recently, several lncRNAs involved in lipid metabolism have been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>SPRY4-IT1, an lncRNA overexpressed in melanoma cells, negatively regulates triacylglycerol levels in melanoma cells and knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 can induce apoptosis via lipin 2-mediated alterations in lipid metabolism leading to cellular lipotoxicity (Mazar et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In addition, a recent study identified a novel human lncRNA, lncHR1, which can decrease lipid accumulation both in vitro and in vivo by repressing the expression of SREBP-1c gene (Li et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>According to the results of co-expression network of AK012226–mRNAs, and the subsequent KEGG pathway and GO analyses, we found some pathways and GO terms to be likely linked to the pathogenesis of NAFLD, such as PPAR signaling pathway, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, bile secretion, and chemokine secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanism of AK012226 in regulating lipid accumulation and in the pathogenesis of NAFLD has not yet been elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is needed to examine the role of AK012226 in the development of NAFLD. </plain></SENT>
