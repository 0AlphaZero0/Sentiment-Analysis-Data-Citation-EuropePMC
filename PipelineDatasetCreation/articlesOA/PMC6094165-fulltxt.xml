The risks targeted include smoking,
hazardous alcohol consumption, nutrition and insufficient physical activity.
Implementation of clinical health promotion, however, remains a major
challenge. While several processes, models and frameworks for strategic
implementation exist, very few have been tested in randomized designs.
Testing a strategic implementation process for clinical health promotion was
only recently attempted via a randomized clinical trial on the World Health
Organization Health Promotion Hospitals Recognition Process. The randomized
clinical trial showed that the process improved central parts of
implementation. To complement these findings, this nested qualitative study
aimed to explore experiences and perceptions of staff and managers, who had
completed the process, and generate hypotheses for improvements.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2050312118792394"><title>Methods:</title><p>We interviewed a purposeful sample of 45 key informants from four countries,
who worked at clinical departments and had undertaken the World Health
Organization Health Promotion Hospitals implementation process. The
informants included 14 managers, 14 medical doctors, 13 nurses and 4 other
clinical staff. Interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative
content analysis and an inductive approach to coding and categorization
supported by QSR NVivo.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2050312118792394"><title>Results:</title><p>The informants&#x02019; experiences and perceptions centered around four global
themes concerning (1) awareness, cultural re-orientation and integration;
(2) learnings; (3) normalization and legitimacy and (4) a more
evidence-based, structured and systematic approach to clinical health
promotion. Informants were positive toward the implementation process,
although it was sometimes challenging. The suggested improvements to
increase acceptability related to the patient survey, time consumption,
translation, tailoring to local circumstances and in-advance training.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2050312118792394"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Managers and staff were positive toward the World Health Organization Health
Promotion Hospitals process, which was perceived to bring about positive
changes and learnings. The findings also suggest that the implementation
process may be improved by minor adjustments to process elements and design.
It is our recommendation to use the process in clinical departments to
further implementation of clinical health promotion.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>clinical health promotion</kwd><kwd>health promoting hospitals</kwd><kwd>healthcare staff</kwd><kwd>quality improvement</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2050312118792394"><funding-source id="funding1-2050312118792394"><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerstvo Zdravotnictv&#x000ed; Cesk&#x000e9; Republiky</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003243</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award2-2050312118792394"><funding-source id="funding2-2050312118792394"><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Health of Taiwan</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-2050312118792394">R01 DA030386</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award3-2050312118792394"><funding-source id="funding3-2050312118792394"><institution-wrap><institution>Clinical Health Promotion Centre, WHO-CC ,

site-visits to the departments that had completed the 1-year intervention of the
RCT. Each RCT&#x02019;s intervention-group departments nominated three to four
informants from among their staff, namely, one manager, one doctor, one nurse
and one other staff member (such as a dietician or a physiotherapist) where
applicable for the department type or specialty. In total, 45 healthcare
professionals were interviewed (24 women and 21 men). The 45 informants included
14 managers, 14 medical doctors, 13 nurses and 4 other clinical staff
(dieticians, nutritionists and physiotherapists). The informants were from 14
hospitals in four countries: Taiwan, Czech Republic, Malaysia and Japan.</p><p>All but one informant had first-hand knowledge and experience with the WHO-HPH
Recognition Process implementation, having been directly involved. No informants
declined to participate and no informants dropped out. The characteristics of

departments in connection with the RCT&#x02019;s finalizing site-visit and audit.
Malaysian interviews were conducted online, remotely via Skype.</p><p>For the interviews with informants who did not speak English, a translator was
present in the room to provide simultaneous translation. For some interviews,
and owing to cultural concerns or situational reasons, the interviewer was
unable to obtain a closed-door interview environment, meaning that others than
the interviewer, informant and translator were present in the room. In most
cases, these non-participating additional individuals were the informant&#x02019;s
manager and/or the department head, a colleague of the informant and/or a
representative from the national/regional HPH Network.</p></sec><sec id="section11-2050312118792394"><title>Data collection, analysis and validation</title><p>The first author, J.K.S., conducted all interviews. As a PhD student on the

were medical doctors, 29% were nurses and 9% other clinical staff such as dieticians
or physiotherapists. About half (53%) of the informants were women. The informants
were from 14 hospitals in four countries: Taiwan, Czech Republic, Malaysia and
Japan. All worked at intervention-group clinical hospital departments, which had
undertaken the 1-year implementation of the WHO-HPH Recognition Process (<xref rid="table1-2050312118792394" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec id="section13-2050312118792394"><title>Informants&#x02019; perceptions of and experiences with the implementation
process</title><p>The informants&#x02019; perceptions of and experiences with the implementation of the
WHO-HPH Recognition Process revolved around four global themes. The first theme
concerned awareness, cultural re-orientation, integration of CHP into daily
practice as well as optimism related to CHP. This is presented below with the
title &#x0201c;It reminded us of health promotion.&#x0201d; The second theme concerned
learnings, competences and understanding of CHP. This is presented below with
the title &#x0201c;The whole process was educational.&#x0201d; The third theme concerned
normalization and legitimacy of CHP as well as benefits and barriers related to
the process. This is presented with the title &#x0201c;CHP has become the norm.&#x0201d; The
fourth theme concerned improvements in structure, documentation and working
practices as well as a more evidence-based and systematic approach to CHP. This
is presented with the title &#x0201c;Now we have data to show them.&#x0201d;</p><sec id="section14-2050312118792394"><title>Global theme 1: &#x0201c;it reminded us of health promotion.&#x0201d;</title><p>The first theme concerned awareness of CHP, cultural re-orientation toward
CHP and integration of CHP into daily practice. It also concerned a
re-kindled optimism regarding the potential results of CHP work.</p><p>The general raise in awareness of CHP importance, the cultural re-orientation
and the integration of CHP into daily practice is illustrated by these
quotes from informants:<disp-quote><p><italic>Before we came into contact with this (the WHO-HPH
process)&#x02014;we were just dealing with patients before - and after
we joined this, we found that actually we had abandoned
something here. It kind of reminded us a lot of health
promotion.</italic> (Manager, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>We were probably starting to forget that kind of view (the
view of CHP), but by working with this project, people were
reminded of what they have to do.</italic> (Manager, Japan)</p><p><italic>Over the months and gradually with a year now, I think almost
all of our staff have habitualized this (CHP) into the clinical
practice</italic>. (Doctor, Taiwan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Regarding the re-kindled optimism concerning CHP, informants talked about
increases in dialogue about CHP and about what they think could viably be
obtained through CHP in future:<disp-quote><p><italic>[&#x02026;] over the year, I think we have [&#x02026;] recognized that, uhm,
augmenting the health awareness of our patients and also our
staff does translate into better clinical outcomes. It may be
not that significant at first, but I think, at least we believe
now that if we continue to do this, we will actually make a
difference</italic>. (Doctor, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>We use this model, and I think, it is the same for any
hospital. But especially for this hospital, we know that, if we
do this, we can improve.</italic> (Manager, Japan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In summary, this theme shows that informants perceive the process to have
brought about greater awareness of CHP within their departments. Informants
felt the process had made CHP a more prominent part of, or habit in, their
daily clinical practice. This highlights a perceived cultural re-orientation
of the departments toward CHP. The theme also highlights a rekindled
optimism regarding the potential results of implementing patient-centered
CHP altogether.</p></sec><sec id="section15-2050312118792394"><title>Global theme 2: &#x0201c;The whole process was educational.&#x0201d;</title><p>The second theme concerned learnings on CHP. These learnings were perceived
to be both at a specific level, in terms of competences and skills related
to CHP, but also at a more overall level.</p><p>Regarding the specific learnings, informants often felt that they had
acquired specific new skills related to CHP practice; related to project
management, communication and execution in clinical settings; related to
role modeling and related to collaboration around CHP. This is illustrated
by the following quotes:<disp-quote><p><italic>We began to say, okay; when we do health promotion, there is
a process of data collection [&#x02026;] you look at the results, there
is a way to analyze, and you need to see, if there is room for
improvement. So I think, the whole process was
educational.</italic> (Doctor, Malaysia)</p><p><italic>(Personally, I) learned how to communicate with the patients
and make them listen</italic>. (Nurse, Czech Republic)</p><p><italic>We learned [&#x02026;] about the weight, ehm, weight control skills,
nutrition consultation among the patients, exercise program
[&#x02026;]</italic>. (Doctor, Taiwan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Regarding the more overall learnings on CHP, informants talked about how the
process increased understanding of CHP and its importance in a broader sense:<disp-quote><p><italic>I think, I have gained more understanding of HPH
[&#x02026;]</italic>. (Manager, Japan)</p><p><italic>(the process) is a more structured way to promoting health
than before, so that&#x02019;s what I learned</italic>. (Nurse,
Malaysia)</p><p><italic>Through this project, we learned that working with our
patients on their individual lifestyles was very important [&#x02026;]
so now we know, we have to do it&#x0201d;</italic>. (Nurse, Japan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In summary, this theme shows that informants felt that the process had
resulted in learnings related to CHP, both at individual and group levels
among staff in the departments. The learnings that took place were perceived
to be both specific, related to concrete skill and CHP competences, but also
more general in terms of greater understanding of CHP and the evidence to
support its integration in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="section16-2050312118792394"><title>Global theme 3: &#x0201c;CHP has become the norm.&#x0201d;</title><p>The third theme concerned normalization and legitimacy of CHP work as well as
benefits that resulted from the process and barriers to implementation
encountered along the way.</p><p>Regarding normalization and legitimacy, informants talked about how CHP
ceased being something extra or an add-on service and instead became
communicated and recognized broadly as a new &#x0201c;norm&#x0201d; and thus a natural,
legitimate part of clinical practice:<disp-quote><p><italic>[&#x02026;] we just continue (the WHO-HPH process), because it (CHP)
has become the norm, so we will continue.</italic> (Nurse,
Taiwan)</p><p><italic>[&#x02026;] We have tried for several years to find and open some
prevention programs, and it was very difficult [&#x02026;] (now we are)
supported from our management [&#x02026;] we have built up the (CHP)
program and it has helped us a lot</italic>. (Manager, Czech
Republic)</p><p><italic>Basically the model (the WHO-HPH process) has been built in,
so we just do it</italic>. (Doctor, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>I think that the habit will not change [&#x02026;] I will keep, keep
on this project, keep on this method [&#x02026;].</italic> (Manager,
Taiwan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Concerning the implementation of the process, informants talked about the
benefits that they perceived to have resulted from it:<disp-quote><p><italic>(Now) we have the ambulatory for smokers that want to stop
with the habit, so this is the one thing and the biggest
(change). That is what I think</italic>. (Manager, Czech
Republic)</p><p><italic>It is a bonus for the patients, because the hospital is now
paying attention to their issues in health, especially in the
Joint Centre [&#x02026;] overweight is a heavy burden on their (the
patients&#x02019;) joints. So for patients this is a good
development.</italic> (Nurse, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>Through these programs, I have seen that some of the staff
they have changed their lifestyles. Especially, I have seen
doctors climbing stairs, you know, during lunchtime</italic>.
(Nurse, Malaysia)</p><p><italic>[&#x02026;] the postoperative recovery actually improved [&#x02026;] the
number of days in bed and the exercise afterwards has been
improved [&#x02026;] this helps in their (the patients&#x02019;) post-operative
recovery</italic>. (Doctor, Taiwan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Informants also, but to a lesser degree, talked about the barriers to
implementation of the process, which they had encountered. These revolved
mainly around professional habits, patient compliance and availability of
time and personnel:<disp-quote><p><italic>At first it was not easy, because ehm, getting so many
doctors, especially those had been practicing for a long time,
to change their habits is not an easy thing</italic>. (Doctor,
Taiwan)</p><p><italic>(The) hard parts (of the WHO-HPH process were) to try to tell
our patients to do, what they promised. But sometimes they
promised something, but by the time &#x02026; the reality is
different</italic>. (Doctor, Czech Republic)</p><p><italic>It is difficult for us to find the time [&#x02026;] communicating
(about CHP) with the patients</italic>. (Manager, Japan)</p><p><italic>There was still some difficulties to the actually practice,
because we had no fixed personnel to work on this</italic>.
(Doctor, Taiwan)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In summary, this theme shows how the informants&#x02019; experienced normalization
and increased legitimacy of CHP work as a result of the process. CHP went
from being viewed as an extra add-on service to being regarded broadly in
the departments as a legitimate, core part of the clinical work&#x02014;the new
&#x0201c;norm.&#x0201d; The theme also shows, what informants perceived to be, the benefits
of and barriers to implementation of the process. The benefits included
structural improvements, more holistic care, patient and staff lifestyle
improvements and improvements to patient outcomes. The barriers included
changing old professional habits, assuring patient compliance and finding
the needed time and personnel resources.</p></sec><sec id="section17-2050312118792394"><title>Global theme 4: &#x0201c;Now we have data to show them.&#x0201d;</title><p>The fourth theme concerned how the WHO-HPH Recognition Process brought about
improvements in structure, documentation and working practices. It shows a
perceived shift toward a more evidence-based and systematic approach to CHP:<disp-quote><p><italic>We are not just giving testimony anymore. We&#x02019;ve got research
[&#x02026;] So with this kind of process, this way of doing things,
collecting data, it also gives us more power. Now we have data
to show them</italic>. (Manager, Malaysia)</p><p><italic>People [&#x02026;] work, and we have scientific data, and then moving
from it</italic>. (Manager, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>I think was meaningful [&#x02026;] through this HPH recognition
project, we found many challenges that we should work
on</italic>. (Manager, Japan)</p><p><italic>It (the WHO-HPH process) makes sense because [&#x02026;] it is
actually making us better, you know, uhm in a way, uhm of
documenting patients in a structured way [&#x02026;]</italic>. (Nurse,
Malaysia)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Practically, these changes and improvements often related to improved
documentation of lifestyle risks in the medical records and also to more
systematic delivery of services to the patients in need of them:<disp-quote><p><italic>Previously we did not have this kind of system, so maybe they
(the staff) asked (patients about lifestyle), but they did not
record it.</italic> (Manager, Taiwan)</p><p><italic>The change that I noticed, for instance, was the medical
records system. (after the process) there was a corner that I
should write in with health promotion</italic>. (Doctor,
Japan)</p><p><italic>(The department is) better now. (We have) automatic patient
education about smoking cessation</italic>. (Nurse, Czech
Republic)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In summary, this theme shows that the process was perceived to result in
better structure, more comprehensive documentation of lifestyle risks, more
systematic CHP service provision and better working practices. Generally,
the informants felt that their departments had moved toward a more
evidence-based and research-oriented approach to CHP&#x02014;a development which was
in turn seen as enabling, since it helped informants justify CHP work more
easily to top-management and others by way of more compelling data on the
effect of CHP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section18-2050312118792394"><title>Suggested improvements to the implementation process</title><p>Informants generally expressed positive attitudes to the WHO-HPH Recognition

to the patient survey, time consumption, translation, tailoring to fit local
circumstances and in-advance training. The surveying of patients was the most
challenging part of the data collection, and it could be improved by condensing
and shortening the questionnaire. While patient-centered CHP does take time, the
overall time consumption related to the process might be reduced by condensing
the data collection more, if at all possible. Enhanced tailoring to local
circumstance and improved translation processes would also help avoid possible
confusion and resulting extra time consumption. Finally, and even though a
number of staff from all departments had taken part in training activities
directly related to the process, establishment of more or better training
seminars in advance of the process, possibly involving even more staff, might
also help.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section23-2050312118792394"><title>Discussion</title><p>The WHO-HPH Recognition Process was well received by informants. Generally,
informants were positive toward the process, felt it was worthwhile and wanted to
continue working with it, or in the way it prescribed. Informants reported that the
process increased awareness and furthered integration of CHP; brought about
learnings, competences and understanding; normalized and legitimized practices and
also that it brought about a more evidence-based, structured and systematic
approach. Improvements suggested included changes to the patient survey, reduced
time consumption, translation, tailoring to local circumstances and more in-advance
training.</p><p>The experiences and perceptions of our informants contrast some previous findings in
the area of accreditation processes, which to some degree resemble parts of the
WHO-HPH process&#x02014;such as the collection of data, the external auditing/inspection and
the issuing of performance-based certificates. In contrast to our findings, studies
on accreditation have shown that accreditation processes may be poorly received by
staff, by, for instance, increasing their stress level,<sup><xref rid="bibr47-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> or have no effect on staff perception, for instance, in relation to job satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="bibr48-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Our findings, however, do correspond with other previous findings that showed
positive effects on staff perception of clinical quality.<sup><xref rid="bibr49-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Additionally, our results highlight staff appreciation of a structured
process, learning and added managerial focus on evidence-based practices. This
corresponds with other recent findings, highlighting the promise of implementation
strategies that incorporate these elements.<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup></p><p>The overall positive experiences and perceptions of staff, and their feeling that the
WHO-HPH process increased awareness and integration of CHP, also correspond with
data from their own patients, who in brief interviews during site-visits reported to
be aware of CHP, satisfied with CHP, to have been asked about lifestyle risks and
informed of CHP services (see <xref rid="table3-2050312118792394" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3-2050312118792394" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Answers from 43 patients (brief interviews) admitted to the 14

WHO-HPH process complements the results from the RCT, where no health effect was
found. It is possible that surveying the individual patients that actually received
the CHP services, instead of surveying those simply admitted to the department at
the time of measuring, would have been a better approach both in terms of capturing
a potential health effect,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and it is possible that this would in turn also have made the actual
surveying process easier and less time-consuming. However, it is interesting that
surveying/talking to the patients was perceived by staff to be among the more
challenging aspects of the process&#x02014;especially since patients so univocally wanted
the departments to support them by way of CHP (<xref rid="table3-2050312118792394" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section24-2050312118792394"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a number of limitations. All informants were from departments in HPH
member hospitals that had undertaken the WHO-HPH Recognition Process. In this way,
our informants may represent a motivated group, and results may be quite different
outside HPH hospital settings.</p><p>The first-hand experiences with the project, which informants generally had, increase
the trustworthiness of the study. The inclusion of informants from several countries
and cultures is a strength, as it may broaden representativeness, but it is also a
limitation, since it meant greater variability. In terms of validity, the year that
passed from process start to interviews may have promoted recall bias. This might
have caused under-reporting of problems and negative aspects of the process. Also,
the interview guide had not been validated in advance, which is a further
limitation.</p><p>The overall positive attitudes of informants may be connected to four general
limiting factors: power, situation, culture and language/translation. Regarding
power, the interviewer was part of the site-visit auditor group&#x02014;which came to the
hospital departments, validated their data and scored them with certificates.
Regarding situation, a closed-door interview situation was not always obtained, so
sometimes managers, HPH Network officials and others were in the room during
interviews. Regarding culture, it is well described that complex face-keeping
practices and politeness-related social codes exist, not least in Asian cultures,
and that these have important ramifications on all types of communication,<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> with research
interviews not likely to be any exception. And finally, regarding
language/translation, none of the informants were native English speakers and
field-notes ascertain that translation could at times be a challenge. These four
general limiting factors may have added to an asymmetrical power relationship
between interviewer and informants, have reduced the likelihood of negative
utterances, and they may altogether have impacted the free, honest and open
dialogue, which is often envisaged as the ideal interview situation.<sup><xref rid="bibr45-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> Realistically, however, a research interview is probably never power free,
given its nature as a purpose-built type of conversation set up to produce useful
data to answer, in the researcher&#x02019;s eyes, useful data to answer clear research objectives.<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> On this basis, the four general limiting factors in this study may be
regarded, simply, as what was possible. The four general limiting factors have been
presented to make resulting limitations transparent and to allow readers to evaluate
potential effects<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> on findings.</p><p>The large sample of informants interviewed in this study could also give rise to
ethical concerns, since it might be interpreted as excess data collection and thus
unnecessary use of informants&#x02019; time. Conversely, having a large sample could also be
regarded as legitimate safe-guarding against potential language/culture and ability
barriers to adequate communication, articulating, expressing and reflecting on
experiences and opinions,<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2050312118792394" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> especially since it would have been costly to have had to return back to
hospitals in other continents, in case of lacking data. Furthermore, the interviews
were very rarely regarded as an inconvenience by informants, who rather viewed the
interviews as a positive part of or de-briefing to the process itself, thus reducing
potential ethical concerns related to excess data collection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section25-2050312118792394"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Implementation of the WHO-HPH Recognition Process was well received by staff and
managers. The process was perceived to raise awareness, further integration and
foster cultural re-orientation toward CHP. It was also perceived to bring about
learnings, to normalize and legitimize CHP practices and facilitate a shift in
departments toward a more evidence-based, structured and systematic approach to CHP.
Our results provide new insight into how staff perceive and experience the WHO-HPH
Recognition Process, and they also provide qualified suggestions to how the
processes might be improved upon in future by way of minor adjustments to project
aspects and elements like the patient survey, time consumption, translation,
tailoring to local circumstances as well as additional in-advance training. We
recommend use of the process in clinical departments to help further implementation
of CHP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="section26-2050312118792394" specific-use="figshare"><title>Supplemental Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="suppl1-2050312118792394"><caption><title>Interview_Guide &#x02013; Supplemental material for Staff experiences with
