<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to centriole defects, flies lacking Gorab are uncoordinated due to defects in sensory cilia, which lose their 9-fold symmetry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of Drosophila Gorab in two ways: First, we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of gorab null flies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Second, we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype overcome by mutations preventing Golgi targeting. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Their malfunction is associated with diseases ranging from cancer to ciliopathies and microcephaly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Canonical centriole duplication pathway components were genetically identified in C.elegans1 and through RNAi screens in Drosophila2,3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Centriole duplication requires Polo-like kinase 4, which phosphorylates Ana2/STIL enabling its recruitment to the procentriole site4 to interact with Sas6 upon procentriole formation5,6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The resulting structure reflects the symmetry of 9 interacting dimers of Sas6in the centriole’s cartwheel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cep135 (Bld10) is also required for cartwheel formation in Chlamydomonas and Paramecium7,8 and human Cep135 links Sas6 to Sas4 (CPAP)9, associated with and required for polymerisation of centriolar microtubules (MTs)10–12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the centriole reaches its full length by the end of G2, it cannot duplicate or organize pericentriolar-material (PCM) until it passes through mitosis13,14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This requires Cep135 to recruit Ana1 in Drosophila (CEP295 in human cells), and in turn Asterless/Cep152and pericentrin-like protein15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This process of centriole to centrosome conversion enables the daughter centriole to recruit Plk4, as a partner of Asterless/Cep152, and PCM components that organise cytoplasmic MTs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In interphase, the centrosome is found in the vicinity of the Golgi, the heart of secretory pathways and key for vesicular trafficking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Golgi positioning and vesicle trafficking rely on cytoplasmic MTs organized by Golgi-associated AKAP450 (counterpart of pericentrin), the cis-Golgi protein GM130, the trans-Golgi CLASPs (cytoplasmic-linker-associated-proteins), and additional components of a multiprotein complex16–18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Interphase cells can also utilise the mother centriole to template cilia formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The Golgi participates in this process by providing membrane for the cilium and the ciliary pocket adjacent to the mother centriole19–21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In mammalian cells, this requires golgin GMAP-210, which interacts with the intraflagellar-transport complex protein, IFT-20, required for ciliogenesis22,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Such links between centrosome and Golgi are only beginning to be explored and require further study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although Sas6 adopts a 9-fold symmetrical structure in vitro, Sas6 alone cannot confer 9-fold symmetry on the centriole in vivo; mutations that disrupt Sas6’ssymmetry in vitro24 or that prevent its self-oligomerisation can still result in 9-fold symmetrical centrioles in vivo25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This suggests additional, yet unknown factors must help establish symmetry, raising the question of whether otherSas6-interacting proteins had been missed by earlier genome-wide screens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This led us to use proteomic approaches to search for additional Drosophila centriole components and the discovery of a new Sas6 partner, the fly counterpart of Golgi-associated Gorab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Human GORAB is mutated in gerodermia osteodysplastica, characterised by non-elastic skin and osteoporosis26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>GORAB localises to the trans-Golgi membranes and interacts with SCYL1, which participates in the Golgi-ER trafficking of COPI vesicles27–30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We now show Drosophila gorab null mutants fail to duplicate centrosomes in embryos and diploid larval tissues and have defects in the 9-fold symmetry of cilia in neurosensory organs resulting in loss of coordination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We have created mutants of Drosophila Gorab that cannot localise to the Golgi but can still rescue centriolar phenotypes of the gorab null. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We also generate a dominant negative Gorab with cytokinesis phenotypes that depend upon its Golgi localisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Together our findings indicate Drosophila Gorab has dual roles at the Golgi and centriole. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Aiming to identify proteins recruited to the site of procentriole formation, we affinity purified Sas6 complexes from syncytial Drosophila embryos expressing GFP-tagged Sas6 and from cultured cells following induction of Protein-A-tagged Sas6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, no other centriole proteins were enriched in Sas6 pull-downs from embryos but we consistently identified the CG33052 gene product (Table 1; Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This complex persisted following high salt treatment(440mM NaCl) and was not affected by inhibiting protein phosphatases with okadaic acid suggesting it is a stable complex, insensitive to the protein phosphorylation state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Similarly, mass spectrometry of Sas6 complexes from cultured cells consistently identified CG33052. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>BLAST searches identified CG33052 as counterpart of human GORAB, mutated in the inherited disease gerodermia osteodysplastica, leading us to name Drosophila CG33052 as Gorab. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To further confirm that Sas6 and Gorab copurify as a complex, we established flyand cell lines expressing GFP-tagged Gorab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>GFP-Gorab consistently co-purified with Sas6 as its sole centriole associated partner from syncytial embryos (Fig.1d; Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Sas6 also co-purified with Gorab from cultured cells, irrespective of whether GFP-Gorab was expressed constitutively or from the inducible metallothionein promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, in addition to Sas6, co-purified proteins also included the αCOP, β’COP and εCOP subunits of the cage-like COPI coatomer sub-complex and the γCOP and βCOP subunits of its adaptor subcomplex (Fig. 1d; Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We did not detect COPI complex proteins in purifications of Sas6 or of GFP expressed in cultured cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Nor did we detect COPI proteins associated with Gorab purified from syncytial embryos (Fig. 1d; Table S2), a stage prior to the onset of Golgi assembly31–33. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The centrosomal association of Gorab, suggested by its repeated copurification with Sas6, was confirmed in syncytial blastoderm embryos expressing a Ubq-GFP-gorab transgene, in which GFP-Gorab co-localised with the centriole protein, Asterless, in interphase (Fig. 1b) and mitosis (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As the Golgi is not assembled at this stage, we did not detect the trans-Golgi Golgin245. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Thus, at least in the absence of the Golgi, Gorab could be a bone fide centrosome component in partnership with Sas6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We then determined the sub-cellular localisation of Gorab in cultured D.Mel-2 cells that have well established Golgi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Using antibodies against Gorab (Material and Methods) and counterstaining for markers of the cis- (GM130) and trans-Golgi (Golgin245), we found the greater part of all Gorab was associated with the trans-Golgi,like its human counterpart30 (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>However, Gorab was also associated with dPLP punctae indicating its presence at the centrosome independent of Golgin245 (Fig. 1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Gorab persisted at the centrosome in mitosis, when Golgi components become dispersed throughout the cell(Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The co-purification of Gorab and Sas6 and their centrosomal colocalisation raised the question of whether they interact directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>To address this, we expressed and purified GST-tagged Gorab from E.coli on Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads, which we incubated with 35S-Met-labelled full-length Sas6, synthesised by coupled transcription-translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This revealed direct binding of Sas6 to immobilized Gorab (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To narrow down the interacting region, we made N- and C-terminally truncated S35-labelled Sas6 peptides for use in similar binding experiments (Fig. 2b; Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These experiments identified the 351 to 462 amino-acid segment of Sas6 as able to interact directly with Gorab. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Gorab’s direct binding to Sas6 and its centrosomal localization suggested it should be associated with the centriole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Indeed, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed Gorab co-localised with Sas6 in centriole zone I at the center of a ring of dPLP, which surrounds the mother centriole throughout the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>This dPLP ring is completed around the daughter centriole during mitosis in centriole to centrosome conversion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Gorab and Sas6 co-localised at mother and daughter centriole throughout the centrosome cycle and were recruited to the site of procentriole formation once mother and daughter disengaged in telophase (arrowheads in Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Thus Gorab and Sas6 associate at the core of the centriole from the very onset of its duplication. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The above findings suggested a possible new function for this Golgi-associated protein that we addressed by generating gorab null mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to simultaneously target the 5' and 3' ends and exon1 of the gorab gene (Online methods) and generated gorab1 (NT_037436.4:g.33_507del) and gorab2 (NT_037436.4:g.1_1097del), eliminating significant coding sequence and the ATG initiation codon (Fig.3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We were unable to detect any Gorab protein in Western blots of whole fly extracts (Fig. 3c) of homozygotes of either allele leading us to consider both mutant alleles to be nulls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, both homozygous gorab1 and gorab2 animals developed to adulthood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>However, flies emerging at 25°C moved slowly and were uncoordinated and when raised at 29°C, were unable to climb or fly (Fig. 3d, video S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, embryos derived from gorab mutant females raised at 25°C failed to develop even when homozygous mutant mothers were mated to wild-type males (Fig. 3e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In contrast, gorab1 males were fertile suggesting the mutation did not affect spermatogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>A similar extent of female sterility and uncoordination was observed in flies trans-heterozygous for the two alleles, or when heterozygous to a large chromosomal deficiency, suggesting the defects result from the loss of Gorab function (Fig.3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, female fertility and coordination were restored by ubiquitous expression of a wild-type gorab transgene in the gorab1 mutant background (Fig. 3d, e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Thus, the primary consequences of loss of Gorab are female sterility and uncoordination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Coordination defects have previously been attributed to defective neurosensory cilia of the femoral chordotonal organs (fChOs)34,35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we could rescue coordination defects but not the female sterility of gorab1 fliesby expressing UAS-gorab only in the nervous system using the pan-neural driver elav-GAL4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to recover coordinated adult females that generated sufficient embryos to analyse their development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Wild-type syncytial embryos undertake 13 rapid rounds of synchronous nuclear division cycles over a period of 2 hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 50% of gorab1-derived embryos showed any nuclear division but not beyond 5 or 6 rounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Centrosomes, revealed by anti- centrosomin (Cnn) or anti-Asterless (Asl) staining, were dramatically reduced in number in gorab1-derived embryos and were absent from the majority of mitotic spindle poles (Fig. 3f, g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The extensive disorganisation of gorab1-derived embryos accords with the known requirement for centrosomes in the syncytial cycles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Thus, maternally provided Gorab is required for centrosome duplication and thereby the nuclear division cycles of the embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>We also observed centrosome loss ingorab1 imaginal discs indicating Gorab is required for centrosome duplication in other diploid tissues (Fig. 3h). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>dPLP associated structures were also disorganized in gorab1 mutants but ciliary structures were still present in the scolopale rods (Fig. 4a, b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The two fChObasal bodies can be distinguished because only the proximal one (corresponding to a daughter centriole) has associated Centrobin36. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>This suggests a failure of centriole duplication prior to basal body formation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Gorab could be one such contributing molecule, at least in part. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>However, this cannot be universally true because centrioles and axonemes in the gonads of fully fertile gorab null males have correct9-fold symmetry (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This could be either because maternal Gorab protein perdures sufficiently in male germ cells to permit centriole duplication or because Gorab is substituted by another molecule in spermatogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>These possibilities, either of which could reflect the distinctive morphology of Drosophila’s spermatocyte centrioles, require further study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, Gorab’s association with COPI coatomer components in cultured cells suggests involvement in retrograde vesicle transport from Golgi to ER consistent with its resemblance to a golgin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The rod-like golgins, which bind Rab, Arf, or ADP-ribosylation family GTPases, are tethered to Golgi membranes by their C-termini and protrude outwards to capture vesicles at their N-termini39. </plain></SENT>
