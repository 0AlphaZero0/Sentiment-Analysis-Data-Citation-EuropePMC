</text></title><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Chronic pain is considered as a major physical and mental health problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Millions of people are affected by uncomfortable conditions such as back pain, headache, and arthritis [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Chronic pain is often difficult to treat [3, 4], and 60% of patients with chronic pain experience pain after 1 year of treatment [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although extensive research has been conducted on the genetics of chronic pain, the mechanism underlying chronic pain is largely unknown owing to the involvement of several genes [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For a better understanding of the etiology and treatment of chronic pain, it is imperative to further elucidate the key mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains many primary sensory neurons that are responsible for the transduction and modulation of sensory information and its transmission to the spinal cord, an active participant in the development of chronic neuropathic pain [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence has confirmed that DRG plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance of chronic pain [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>DRG is involved in the transduction of pain to the central nervous system and exhibits various pathophysiologic changes during chronic pain [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DRG stimulation in response to peripheral afferent fiber injury may induce multiple abnormal changes that occur within the DRG and stabilize or reduce the hyperexcitability of DRG neurons and consequently decrease chronic neuropathic pain [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, DRG stimulation is considered as a promising treatment strategy to offer relief from chronic pain, and DRG therapeutics have been implicated for the treatment of chronic pain [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>KCNQ channels are found expressed in nociceptive DRG neurons and their activation is effective in reducing chronic pain [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The differential expression of ATP-gated P2X receptors in DRG is shown to play important roles in the regulation of nociceptive mechanisms in chronic neuropathic pain and visceralgia rat models [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The transient receptor potential melastatin 8 in DRG plays a key role in chronic neuropathic pain [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis of DRG gene expression has been used for the identification of key cytokines involved in the regulation of chronic pain [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Despite these advances, the regulatory mechanisms mediating the development of chronic pain are largely unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Given that the spinal DRG is the primary center for the conduction and maintenance of pain, studies on DRG transcriptome may be helpful for the comprehensive and systematic elucidation of the key regulatory mechanisms underlying chronic pain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the present study, chronic pain was induced by inoculation of the complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) in sheep and goats, as animals injected with CFA are known to quickly develop hyperalgesia and have low latency times on their inflamed paws [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A clear advantage of using a large animal model such as sheep is the similarity in the body size, spine dimensions, and cardiac and pulmonary functional parameters to humans [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Another benefit of using sheep as a chronic pain model is the longer lifespan of sheep (approximately 20 years) than rats (about 2–4 years) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of sheep foot rot have revealed a chronic inflammatory pain condition [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Our previous observation on the differences in responses to pain between sheep and goats encouraged us to select sheep and goats as the animal models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>After CFA inoculation, we analyzed the pain response mechanism in goats and sheep through transcriptome sequencing using the DRG tissues and performed bioinformatic analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Our findings may improve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain and provide valuable information for the development of treatment strategy. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Six sheep and six goats weighing 30–40 kg and 2- to 3-year old were obtained from the key laboratory of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China) and housed in the central housing facility under a standard condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Food and water were available ad libitum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The CFA-induced arthritic rat model has been used to study chronic pain [23]; hence, chronic pain was induced by CFA inoculation in the sheep and goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>CFA (Sigma, USA) is a mixture of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis and paraffin oil at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Prior to experiments, CFA was diluted 1:1 in 0.9% sterile saline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Each sheep or goat was injected in the left footpad (hind paw) with 1 mL of CFA under isoflurane anesthesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This dose was chosen for the following reasons: After the injection of 1 mL of CFA, pain responses such as redness, swelling, and hyperalgesia were markedly observed at the injection site in both sheep and goats, indicating that the inflammatory pain was successfully induced by CFA; however, the induction effect was not satisfactory under or above this dose of CFA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Sheep or goats injected with 1 mL of saline served as controls. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This time point was selected for the following reasons: (1) From 6 to 72 h after the injection of CFA, the redness and swelling at the injection sites in the left footpads of goats and sheep gradually aggravated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The animals showed signs of severe pain with different degrees of functional abnormalities such as tiptoe, lameness, and inability to stand at 72 h of injection, and these symptoms began to ease after 96 h of injection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>(2) The time point of 72 h is long enough for the development of changes in the transcription/translation of proteins that are involved in the sensory neuron response to inflammation [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The lumbar spinal bone was placed on the ice and both sides of the muscles were removed under sterile conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The spinous process and transverse process of spines were fully exposed and cut-off for the isolation of the spinal cord. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>At the spinal canal of the posterior root of the spinal nerve, DRG was stripped-off and the L3-L5 DRG was collected. </plain></SENT>
