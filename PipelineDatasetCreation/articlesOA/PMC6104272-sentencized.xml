</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have improved, yet T2D and being overweight are still significant public health concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Blood sugar in patients with T2D can improve quickly when patients eat significantly fewer dietary carbohydrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, this demands careful medicine management by doctors, and patients need support and frequent contact with health providers to sustain this way of living. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a new care model with very low dietary carbohydrate intake and continuous supervision by a health coach and doctor could safely lower HbA1c, weight and need for medicines after 1 year in adults with T2D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>262 adults with T2D volunteered to participate in this continuous care intervention (CCI) along with 87 adults with T2D receiving usual care (UC) from their doctors and diabetes education program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, patients in the CCI, on average, lowered HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.3%, lost 12% of their body weight, and reduced diabetes medicine use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>94% of patients who were prescribed insulin reduced or stopped their insulin use, and sulfonylureas were eliminated in all patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Participants in the UC group had no changes to HbA1c, weight or diabetes medicine use over the year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These changes in CCI participants happened safely while dyslipidemia and markers of inflammation and liver function improved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This suggests the novel care model studied here using dietary carbohydrate restriction and continuous remote care can safely support adults with T2D to lower HbA1c, weight, and medicine use. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The number of people living with diabetes worldwide nearly quadrupled since 1980, estimated at 422 million in 2014 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control reports 30.3 million adults presently live with diabetes, and it is among the leading causes of death [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have demonstrated varying success. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Intensive lifestyle interventions are effective treatments for obese individuals with T2D when weight loss is achieved and sustained [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D prescribed glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) is increasing [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of patients undergoing bariatric surgery demonstrate substantial improvements in glycemic control after 1 year and many achieve T2D remission [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Despite advancements in treatment options, cost, side effects, adherence, and disease progression remain barriers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for T2D management recommend lifestyle change and weight loss [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>However, a fraction of individuals are successful at long-term weight loss maintenance and true disease remission is uncommon [3, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Mediterranean-style, DASH, and plant-based diets, sometimes with prescribed energy restriction, are recommended, but effectiveness data are limited [7] and low fat diets have not been shown to be superior for weight loss [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Commercially available weight loss programs have demonstrated short-term success in glycemic control, but continued success at 1 year is uncommon [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control can be achieved quickly with carbohydrate restriction via very low energy diets (400–800 kcal day−1; VLCD) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, VLCD are necessarily temporary and outcomes often revert when patients resume former dietary patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, nutritional ketosis, achieved by consuming moderate protein and greatly reduced carbohydrate, results in similarly increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations as observed during VLCD, which signifies a shift to using fat as the body’s primary fuel source [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This nutritional therapy may help patients achieve sustainable glycemic control without prescribed energy restriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Benefit may accrue from decreased circulating glucose and insulin [13], ketone signaling [14, 15], or eventual weight loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Studies utilizing carbohydrate restriction observed improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic markers, but were often short-term trials of small groups, excluded subjects prescribed insulin, or infrequently monitored or achieved ketosis [16–20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The chronic nature of diabetes care presents an additional challenge requiring sustained behavioral change that is difficult to support with traditional medical care including infrequent provider contact [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Adherence to lifestyle changes may be poor in the absence of support from providers and peers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that a comprehensive care model that supports patients to achieve sustained nutritional ketosis while eating to satiety may have robust benefits in T2D management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This intervention utilizes continuous care through intensive, digitally enabled support including telemedicine access to a medical provider (physician or nurse practitioner), health coaching, nutrition and behavior change education and individualized care plans, biometric feedback, and peer support via an online community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of a novel care model (Virta Clinic, Virta Health; San Francisco, CA, USA) for the management of T2D after 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Secondary aims were (1) to determine if a difference in primary outcomes existed between participants who self-selected on-site versus web-based education delivery and (2) explore the time course of biomarker change at 70 days and 1 year into the CCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoints to assess effectiveness of the intervention were change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and medication prescription after 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes, including clinical biomarkers of associated physiological systems and adverse events, were assessed to determine safety of the intervention. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Tight glycemic control can elicit symptomatic hypoglycemia [29] or weight gain [30], neither of which was observed in CCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is likely the treatment method by which glycemic control is achieved (e.g., pharmacological, surgery, lifestyle intervention) is important to health outcomes and risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par57"><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Most changes in HbA1c, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR occurred in the first 70 days with further improvement observed at 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>While the mechanism for improved insulin sensitivity in ketosis is not fully understood, early improvements in HbA1c and HOMA-IR indicate rapid restoration of liver and peripheral insulin sensitivity and are consistent with improvements observed within 2 weeks of ketosis when measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Utilization of blood BHB for self-monitoring with reinforcement by clinicians may have contributed to sustained HbA1c improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Further, BHB acts as a signaling molecule, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress [14, 15]; therefore, mild ketonemia may benefit multiple organs and systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>With appropriate dietary formulation, benefits of nutritional ketosis are observed in mouse models of longevity and health span [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Participant mean BHB levels are of similar magnitude to those observed with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment (~ 0.5 mmol L−1) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Recent trials [5, 34] demonstrate cardiovascular benefits to two SGLT-2 inhibitors; mild ketosis was postulated as a mechanism [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Nutritionally achieved ketosis may have long-term cardiovascular benefits without the pharmaceutical risk profile [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Further, presence of glucose and palmitate has been associated with beta cell apoptosis [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Given the reduced levels of glucose and palmitate observed during nutritional ketosis [36], it is plausible that ketosis might play a role in attenuating glucolipotoxicity-induced beta cell death. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par58"><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Beyond achieving improved glycemic control concurrent with medication and weight reductions, the CCI had broad positive impact on blood pressure, liver enzymes, hsCRP, triglycerides, and HDL-C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Elevated ALT, AST, and ALP are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [37]; these enzymes were significantly reduced with intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Rapid reduction in triglycerides and gradual rise in HDL-C observed following CCI are consistent with previously studied carbohydrate-restricted interventions and carbohydrates are well known to increase triglycerides [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Of the 108 CCI completers with elevated baseline triglycerides (≥ 1.69 mmol L−1), 54% were in normal range at 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Rise in LDL-C at 1 year, occurring with significant triglyceride decrease, was expected as there is less exchange via cholesteryl ester transfer protein [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, this exchange would not affect particle number and ApoB was unchanged, suggesting an overall neutral impact on LDL lipoprotein-associated cardiovascular risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In epidemiological studies, utilization of dietary saturated fat in place of carbohydrate was associated with beneficial impact on lipid profile, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality despite higher LDL-C [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Transiently increased total and LDL cholesterol were also associated with mobilization of adipose cholesterol stores during major weight loss [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par59"><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Consistent with population-level studies that observed very low rates of diabetes remission [43], the UC group had no change in HbA1c and other indicators of glycemic status and insulin resistance but a net increase in diabetes medication use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Laboratory tests were generally unremarkable with biomarkers not changing significantly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>The same facilities and methodologies were used for both the CCI and UC participants indicating that the changes observed in CCI participants not observed in the UC participants are unlikely to be due to methodological changes in clinical or laboratory data capture. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par60"><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Despite independent recruitment of the CCI and UC groups, most of their baseline characteristics including HbA1c and years since diabetes diagnosis were not significantly different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>To enable a comparison between the CCI and UC groups, covariate adjustment was utilized to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics including sex, age, baseline BMI, baseline insulin use (user vs. non-user), and African-American race. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>With or without baseline adjustment, the change over 1 year elicited in the CC and UC groups differ in all primary outcomes—HbA1c, medication use, and weight—and most secondary outcomes including lipid profile, inflammation, and liver function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In general, the favorable changes observed in the CCI were not observed in the UC cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>For example, of patients who obtained HbA1c measurements at 1 year, 60% of CCI participants achieved a HbA1c below 48 mmol mol−1 (&lt; 6.5%) while taking no diabetes medications or metformin only, whereas only 10% of UC participants achieved this status. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par61"><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>One interpretation of these results is that the differences in observed outcomes over the year are due to advantages of the CCI over usual care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This suggests a need to incorporate carbohydrate restriction and comprehensive, continuous remote care as options in current guidelines for patients with diabetes as evidence accumulates [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>However, alternative explanations are possible that may account for the large degree of difference observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>For instance, patients entering the CCI were recruited knowing that they were making a commitment to lifestyle change, while the UC participants were identified as recent referrals to local diabetes education programs and may not have had similar motivation or expectations of effort as the CCI participants. However, even when motivation is controlled for upon recruitment as an inclusion criterion for participation, additional factors may play a role in retention as evidenced by a recent study with randomization [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Also, the CCI and UC cohorts may also have differed in baseline characteristics that were not captured such as socioeconomic status. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par62"><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the treatment intensity of the two cohorts was not equal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The UC participants had one or more meetings with a registered dietitian and were under the medical supervision of their primary care provider or endocrinologist with periodic medical visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CCI participants received a comprehensive and individualized continuous remote care intervention (and in one subgroup, the addition of on-site group classes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>A more intensive intervention might have delivered somewhat better results than the investigation’s UC group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>For instance, a recent in-person group-based intervention for weight loss in T2D adults reduced HbA1c by 3 mmol mol−1 (0.3%) and weight by 4.0% after a year and medications were reduced in 26% of participants [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Future research might compare interventions of similar intensity with different treatment strategies to begin to understand the contribution of each component of the intervention to the overall effect. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par63"><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Eighty-three percent of CCI participants were retained through 1 year; patient perceived benefits of favorable health outcomes, individualized continuity of care, relationship with health coach, ongoing education, biometric feedback, and peer support may have aided retention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Most participants achieved nutritional ketosis during CCI and maintained elevated BHB at 1 year, indicating sustainability and was possibly enabled by the novel use of blood BHB as daily biofeedback for adherence. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par64"><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>No episodes of ketoacidosis, no hypo- or hyperglycemic events requiring assistance, and no adverse events were attributable to the CCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>With improvements or no change in liver, kidney, and thyroid function, safety of the intervention appears favorable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The absence of hypoglycemic events requiring assistance despite relatively tight glucose control may be due to the careful medical provider prescription management, especially rapid downward titration of insulin and sulfonylurea preventing hypoglycemia following dietary changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Additionally, elevated BHB may have offered protection against hypoglycemic events, as starvation-adapted humans with elevated BHB have demonstrated full preservation of central nervous system function despite profound hypoglycemia induced by exogenous insulin [47]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par65"><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Prior studies have demonstrated favorable improvements in T2D status following carefully managed ketogenic diets as case series [48] or in small short-term randomized trials [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>This study’s strengths include its prospective design, large cohort, high retention, duration, replication of findings between the CCI-onsite and CCI-web groups, and the collection of multiple time points in the intervention group allowing assessment of how biomarkers changed over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This study also included participants prescribed insulin and with long-standing T2D, which were often exclusion criteria for prior studies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par67"><text><SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that a T2D intervention combining technology-enabled continuous remote care with individualized care plans encouraging nutritional ketosis can significantly reduce HbA1c, medication use, and weight within 70 days [23], and that these outcomes can be maintained or improved through 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Most intervention participants with HbA1c reported at 1 year achieved glycemic control in the sub-diabetes range with either no medication or the use of metformin alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Related health parameters improved including blood pressure, lipid-lipoprotein profile, inflammation, and liver function. </plain></SENT>
