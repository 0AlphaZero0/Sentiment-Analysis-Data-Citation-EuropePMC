</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Developmental plasticity is the capacity of an organism to produce multiple stable phenotypes from a single genotype given differing environmental conditions1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Examples include changes in stress responses2 and caste differentiation3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Social experiences occurring early in development, such as maternal care, are particularly influential on the developing brain4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Variation in maternal care has been linked to variation in stress responses of offspring in rats;5 this effect is reversible by cross-fostering and is mediated by changes in epigenetic information, such as DNA methylation5,6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In bees, variation in the social environment during larval development also alters the expression of genes that regulate behavioral and endocrine responses to stress7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a recent comparison of vertebrate and honey bee responses to social challenge suggests that fundamental commonalities exist in the molecular mediation of variation in social responses across diverse animal taxa8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We were curious as to whether variation in parental care in insects results in long-term effects on offspring behavior, as in mammals, and whether common molecular mediators may exist for such behavioral convergence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The subsocial small carpenter bee Ceratina calcarata is an ideal system for addressing questions regarding the effect of developmental environment and parental care on behavior and gene regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Unlike its solitary relatives, C. calcarata exhibits maternal care behaviors that consist of mass provisioning prior to oviposition, offspring grooming, and nest defense9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Mothers of this species are long lived and nest loyal, producing only a single nest in their lifetime and surviving to interact with adult offspring10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Adult offspring are typically non-aggressive in the presence of mothers and exhibit mutual tolerance prior to overwintering11,12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>All of these behaviors take place in the isolated confines of a narrow, compartmentalized twig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Here, we explore the effects of maternal care on offspring development after the initial mass provisioning of brood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We compare phenotypic and gene regulatory differences between maternally cared for and orphaned individuals, assay aggression and avoidance behaviors, perform RNA-sequencing to measure changes in transcription, and perform bisulfite sequencing to quantify changes in DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Similar studies, performed in mammals, have shown that varying maternal care conditions can have effects on DNA methylation and gene expression that persist throughout the lives of offspring2,5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the gene regulatory consequences of DNA methylation are more poorly understood in insects than in mammals, and it is presently unknown whether DNA methylation mediates potential long-term effects of variation in parental care in C. calcarata or other subsocial insects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Previous work in C. calcarata has shown that its genome contains the requisite machinery to establish and maintain DNA methylation13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the patterning of DNA methylation is similar to what has been observed in many hymenopteran insects, with almost exclusively intragenic DNA methylation, biased to constitutively expressed genes14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Two primary mechanistic explanations have been proposed to link gene body DNA methylation to the regulation of environmental effects on development in insects15–17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The first is that DNA methylation is involved in mediating changes in gene expression levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The effects of DNA methylation on gene expression have been extensively studied in mammals since the 1970s18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has long been thought that methylation in promoter regions leads to suppression of gene expression18, though this idea has recently been challenged19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Despite its supposed suppressive role in the promoter region of genes, DNA methylation within the gene body is, overall, positively correlated with transcription in mammals20 as well as insects14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This positive correlation could be explained by preferential targeting of DNA methylation to actively transcribed genes rather than a direct effect of DNA methylation on transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the presence of gene body DNA methylation may actually reduce gene expression levels by impeding transcriptional elongation efficiency15,21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Thus, the relationship between gene body DNA methylation and the regulation of gene expression levels is complex and remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A second proposed mechanism by which gene body DNA methylation may affect gene function is through the regulation of alternative splicing22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It is known that DNA methylation affects transcription factor binding23, which in gene bodies affects RNA Polymerase II processivity and the recognition of variably utilized splice sites22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>While this phenomenon has not been well studied in invertebrates beyond genome-wide correlations, a few studies have supported a link between DNA methylation and alternative splicing in insects24–27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Either or both of these proposed mechanisms could feasibly link DNA methylation to the regulation of developmental plasticity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study is twofold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>First, we investigate the effects of variation in maternal care on offspring behavior and gene regulation, using the subsocial bee C. calcarata as a model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Second, we investigate whether stable differences in gene regulation observed between adults from distinct developmental environments are associated with, and potentially driven by, differences in DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that differences in maternal care may lead to changes in DNA methylation and consequently transcriptional differences in the form of differential gene expression or alternative splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We found significant changes in gene expression and splicing between individuals raised with a mother and those raised without, and comparatively small changes in DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we found very little overlap between the changes in DNA methylation and the changes in gene expression or splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the role of DNA methylation is more subtle and nuanced than previously appreciated and may work in concert with other factors to yield context-specific, non-global effects on gene regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>For each of our samples of pooled individuals, we observed similar patterns to those found in the previously generated C. calcarata methylome13 and methylomes from many other hymenopteran taxa14,30–32 (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In particular, all of the newly generated C. calcarata methylomes show a bias towards exons at the 5′ end of genes (Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>This pattern is reminiscent of patterns observed when maternal care varies in mammalian systems34 and is consistent with effects of colony disturbance in honey bees35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Adaptive and non-adaptive explanations exist for these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>For example, divergent behaviors observed between bees reared with and without maternal care may simply reflect non-adaptive effects of a suboptimal developmental environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>However, plasticity in aggression may also be influenced by natural selection if maternal death occurs regularly in the wild or variation in maternal care is prevalent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>It is possible that bees reared in the absence of adult kin may incur fitness benefits from increased aggression and avoidance behaviors relative to bees that benefit directly from cooperative defense and care by kin as adults12. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Many of the differentially expressed genes we identified had functions relating to various forms of carbohydrate metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>While this is a very general functional category, variation in behavior has previously been linked to variation in carbohydrate metabolic activity in the brains of insects36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In particular, variation in brain glucose metabolism is apparently linked to variation in aggressive behavior in both A. mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Sucrose metabolism has also been found to play a role in the regulation of aggressive behavior in the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that these fluctuations in aggression in response to metabolic changes could be mediated through variation in mitochondrial energetics in the brain36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The role of carbohydrate metabolism in mediating aggression has even been observed in vertebrate systems such as sticklebacks and mouse8 indicating the possibility of conserved or convergent gene networks underlying aggression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Genes relating to oxidation–reduction processes have also consistently been implicated in differential aggression in the honey bee A. mellifera35,41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Our size-matched C. calcarata offspring raised with and without a mother both received equivalent mass provisioning at the beginning of development, but nourishment may still be a confounding factor (prior experiments have demonstrated changes in aggression in response to diminished nutrient rations in C. calcarata42). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the differentially expressed genes we identified are affiliated with the ionotropic glutamate receptor (IGR) signaling pathway, roughly three times the number expected by chance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>The IGR pathway is involved in synaptic communication generally as well as odor perception in specific IGR subfamilies43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This class of genes offers a possible neurological explanation for the change in behavior observed in offspring raised without a mother. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations in IGR expression could be a sign of neural plasticity44, manipulating how bees respond to environmental stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>IGRs have even been linked to aggression phenotypes specifically in A. mellifera41. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>We further leveraged our RNA-sequencing data to search for alternatively spliced transcripts between care and no-care individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>We found hundreds of genes containing significantly differentially utilized exons, a simple marker of alternative splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Among these genes, we observed functional enrichment of oxidation–reduction processes as well as spermine biosynthesis and protein phosphorylation (Supplementary Data 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>These alternatively spliced genes may play important roles in the behavioral plasticity we observed in C. calcarata, as a role for alternative splicing in developmental plasticity has been documented in many species29. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with RNA-sequencing analysis, we utilized bisulfite sequencing to quantify changes in DNA methylation in response to the loss of maternal care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>We detected localized but significant changes in DNA methylation between the treatment groups, demonstrating that such differences can be detected among behaviorally distinct conspecific hymenopterans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>We also confirmed previous findings that genes containing DNA methylation are more likely to be alternatively spliced than genes lacking DNA methylation (Chi-square test, p = 4.95e-06; Supplementary Table 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, we did not detect a significant association between differential methylation and alternative splicing (Supplementary Table 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a dynamic relationship between DNA methylation and splicing may not exist in C. calcarata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>At minimum, it is clear from our data that changes in splicing corresponding to changes in DNA methylation are the exception rather than the rule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Changes in DNA methylation do not appear to consistently lead to changes in splicing, nor vice versa, at a level observable in our data set. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="150" pm="?"><plain>What explains the lack of global concordance between variation in DNA methylation and variation in transcription in our data? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>One factor may be that DNA methylation acts through intermediaries to affect transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In particular, methylation-sensitive transcription factors have been documented in mammalian systems23,45,46 and have been shown to influence both gene expression and splicing22,45–47. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In such instances, transcription factor expression profiles or splicing patterns could have a profound effect on when and in which cell types the effect of DNA methylation at a binding site would be observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Our study investigates these associations in a restricted subset of tissues at a single developmental time point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, many sites of DNA methylation may not bind transcription factors in any context, which would preclude gene regulation by transcription factor-mediated mechanisms at such loci. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>When we examined the spatial relationship between DMRs and alternative splicing events, we found that three of eight genes with both DMRs and differentially utilized exons exhibited spatial overlap between the DMRs and alternative exon usage (Fig. 4b–d, Supplementary Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>We found no genes in which a DMR directly overlapped any of the other splicing events we assessed (Supplementary Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Thus, our integrative approach to transcriptome and methylome analysis revealed three candidates for the potential interaction of DNA methylation and alternative splicing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>These particular genes encode proteins with putative roles in fructose metabolism (PFKFB148), apoptosis and stress (SLK49), and brain development (PHGDH50), each of which stands to influence organismal behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>One of these genes, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB1), was the sole gene to exhibit significant differential expression, alternative splicing, and differential methylation in response to removal of maternal care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>A second gene, sh2b adaptor protein 1-like (SH2B151), also exhibits significant differential expression, alternative splicing, and differential methylation in response to removal of maternal care but does not exhibit direct overlap between differential methylation and alternative splicing event locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>SH2B1 has a putative role in growth factor signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>These loci represent prime candidates for follow-up investigations of tissue-specific transcription and methylation over the course of C. calcarata development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, removal of the mother during early C. calcarata development culminates in offspring that exhibit increased aggression and avoidance behaviors, have over one thousand differentially expressed genes, have hundreds of alternatively spliced genes, and exhibit subtle changes in DNA methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We identified specific functional groups of genes that may play a role in developmental plasticity and aggression: carbohydrate metabolism genes, oxidation–reduction process genes, and IGR genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>We observed no genome-wide association between differential DNA methylation and differential gene expression or splicing, though we cannot rule out more complex, indirect relationships between these factors. </plain></SENT>
