</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>RSV infection is responsible for 50%–90% of pediatric hospitalizations for bronchiolitis and 5%–40% of hospitalizations for pneumonia.7,8 While all children are at risk for severe LRTI during their primary infection, healthy term infants 3 months of age and younger account for more RSV-associated hospitalizations than any other group.2 Severe illness during infancy has the potential to cause both acute and long-term pulmonary sequelae, including recurrent wheezing episodes throughout childhood.9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The health care burden associated with RSV is high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the United States, illness caused by the virus is responsible for an estimated 1 in 13 pediatric office visits, 1 in 38 emergency department visits and 1 in 334 hospitalizations among children less than 5 years in age.1 Among infants less than 12 months of age enrolled in a Medicaid program between 1995 and 2003, bronchiolitis was responsible for 13.3% of all outpatient visits, 6.2% of all emergency department visits and 5.5% of all hospitalizations or 23-hour hospital stays.10 In the United States, rates of outpatient RSV LRTIs are reported to range from 157.5 to 252.0 per 1000 for children less than 1 year of age, 183.3 to 245.7 per 1000 for late preterm infants (33–36 weeks gestational age) and 128.8 to 171.3 per 1000 for full-term infants.11 High rates of RSV-associated hospitalization, ranging from 10 to 60 per 1000, are reported for infants living in South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.12–15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The high burden of RSV infection among infants and young children highlights the need for safe and effective prevention strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Currently, the only approved prophylaxis for RSV disease is palivizumab (Synagis; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Palivizumab is an RSV fusion (F)-specific immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody indicated for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk, including preterm infants born at 35 weeks gestational age or less.16 Due in part to the high cost of palivizumab prophylaxis, the most recent guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend it for healthy preterm infants born at or after 29 weeks gestational age.17 RSV prophylaxis is not available for use in healthy term infants, and safe and effective active vaccines remain elusive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>MEDI8897 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody derived from D25 that targets the prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>MEDI8897 binds a highly conserved epitope on RSV F and neutralizes a diverse panel of RSV A and B strains with &gt;50-fold higher activity than palivizumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>At similar serum concentrations, prophylactic administration of MEDI8897 is 9-fold more potent than palivizumab at reducing pulmonary viral loads by &gt;3 logs in cotton rats infected with either RSV A or B subtypes.18 The MEDI8897 antibody is engineered with 3 amino acid changes (M257Y/S259T/T261E [YTE]) in the highly conserved fragment crystallizable region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This YTE modification extends the serum half-life (t1/2) of the antibody beyond the typical 21–28 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In a phase 1, placebo-controlled study of healthy adults, MEDI8897 had a favorable safety profile and an extended mean t1/2 of 85–117 days with increased levels of RSV-neutralizing antibodies detected in serum for more than 150 days.19 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>This report summarizes the first experience with administering an antibody with an extended t1/2 to infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>MEDI8897, a fully human anti-RSV prefusion F monoclonal antibody, has greater neutralizing activity and a notably longer serum t1/2 than that reported for palivizumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>As such, it is being developed to prevent RSV disease in term and preterm infants with a single fixed dose rather than a weight-based dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The t1/2 extension of MEDI8897 has the potential to provide protection for the duration of a typical 5-month RSV season. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Currently, there is no approved vaccine or effective treatment for RSV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The only approved prophylaxis is palivizumab, which must be administered monthly and is only indicated for use in high risk infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The most recent AAP guidance has reassessed the gestational age that determines “high-risk” and currently recommends routine use of palivizumab prophylaxis only for those preterm infants born before 29 weeks gestational age. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Data from this study confirm the extended t1/2 of MEDI8897 in healthy preterm infants and support protection against RSV through 150 days after dosing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The serum t1/2 of MEDI8897 in infants was estimated to be 63–73 days, which is considerably longer than that reported for palivizumab (mean t1/2 of 19–27 days).21 Most importantly, on day 151, target serum concentrations remained above the 90% effective concentration level of 6.8 μg/mL in 87% of infants who received a 50 mg dose of MEDI8897. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>A detailed population PK model incorporating growth, maturation and other covariates including ADA with additional PK data from a subsequent study will enable a better understanding of all the factors impacting PK in infants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>At day 8 after dosing, more than 95% of infants who received MEDI8897 had a ≥4-fold rise from baseline in RSV-neutralizing antibody levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This increase persisted at day 151 with 90% of infants who received the 50 mg dose continuing to have a ≥4-fold rise from baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In addition, MEDI8897 serum concentrations correlated with RSV-neutralizing antibody across all 3 dose groups, confirming its RSV-neutralizing activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>ADA, which was detected only transiently at 1 time point in 2 infants at day 50 after dosing, was detected late at day 361 but at no other time point in 18 infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The reason for the presence of ADA at day 361 is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Because MEDI8897 has an extended t1/2, subjects were followed for approximately 1 year after dosing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In general, other RSV monoclonal antibody studies have included a 1-month follow-up period from the administration of the last dose.22–25 One exception was a motavizumab treatment study designed to test efficacy in infants who were hospitalized for RSV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Infants enrolled in that treatment study had a 1-year follow-up period that included serum testing for the presence of ADA.26 At study day 360, 60% and 46% of subjects in the 30 and 100 mg/kg groups, respectively, were found to have detectable serum anti-motavizumab antibodies.26 In that study, there were no safety findings or impact on PK associated with the detection of ADA.26 In our current study, the presence of ADA was not associated with changes in MEDI8897 serum concentrations at day 151; however, by day 361, lower MEDI8897 serum concentrations were noted in subjects with detectable ADA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>There is no expected clinical significance of the lower serum concentrations at day 361 because target serum concentrations were maintained in the vast majority of infants for a 5-month period that would be representative of a typical RSV season. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>As in the previous study of motavizumab, there were no safety findings associated with the presence of ADA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The frequency and impact of ADA will be investigated in future studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In healthy preterm infants, MEDI8897 was well tolerated at all study doses tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>PK data demonstrate that a single 50 mg dose maintains antibody concentrations predictive of protection from RSV illness for at least 5 months in the majority of infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Typical AEs that infants experienced were reported at similar frequencies in both MEDI8897 and placebo groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Importantly, there were no treatment-emergent SAEs or hypersensitivity events related to MEDI8897. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In subjects with ADA detected, the presence of ADA had no effect on MEDI8897 serum concentrations over the first 150 days and no effect on any safety parameters through day 361. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study support further clinical development of MEDI8897 as a once-per-RSV-season prophylactic agent for the prevention of RSV-associated LRTI in all infants. </plain></SENT>
