Here, we show that the C-terminal CKK domain of CAMSAPs is widely present among eukaryotes and autonomously recognizes microtubule minus ends. Through a combination of structural approaches, we uncover how mammalian CKK binds between two tubulin dimers at the inter-protofilament interface on the outer microtubule surface. In vitro reconstitution assays combined with high resolution fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography suggest that CKK preferentially associates with the transition zone between curved protofilaments and the regular microtubule lattice. We propose that minus-end-specific features of the inter-protofilament interface at this site form the basis for CKK&#x02019;s minus-end preference. The steric clash between microtubule-bound CKK and kinesin motors explains how CKK protects microtubule minus ends against kinesin-13-induced depolymerization and thus controls the stability of free microtubule minus ends.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers, which assemble and disassemble from their two ends, the fast-growing plus end and the slow-growing minus end. While many data are available about the regulation of MT plus ends<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, much less is known about the proteins specifically regulating MT minus ends, despite the fact that MT minus end organization defines the architecture of cellular MT arrays<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The best-studied MT nucleating and minus-end binding factor is the &#x003b3;-tubulin ring complex (&#x003b3;-TuRC)<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Recently, the members of calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP) and Patronin family were shown to control non-centrosomal MT minus-end organization independently of &#x003b3;-TuRC in different systems, including the mitotic spindle in insect cells<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, cortically attached MT arrays in epithelial cells<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and MT bundles in neurons<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">CAMSAP1, CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 (in vertebrates) and Patronin (in invertebrates) recognize and track uncapped, growing MT minus ends<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In mammals, CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 are deposited on MT lattices formed by MT minus-end polymerization and in this way generate stable MT stretches that can serve as a source of non-centrosomal MT outgrowth<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In contrast, CAMSAP1 tracks growing MT minus ends but does not decorate them<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. CAMSAPs and Patronin contain a C-terminal CKK domain (C-terminal domain common to CAMSAP1, KIAA1078 and KIAA1543) as well as an N-terminal Calponin Homology (CH) domain and several coiled-coil regions<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In mammalian CAMSAPs, the minus-end recognition was shown to depend on the CKK domain, while the ability of CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 to stay attached to the MT lattice was associated with additional adjacent regions<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, in fly Patronin, the minus-end recognition was proposed to be mediated by the unstructured linker region in combination with the adjacent C-terminal coiled coil<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The deletion of the CKK domain in CAMSAP3 causes a loss-of-function phenotype in mice<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, and in worms, the CKK domain of Patronin (PTRN-1) was necessary and sufficient for supporting proper MT dynamics and axon regeneration<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, demonstrating the functional importance of this domain.</p><p id="P6">Here, we set out to investigate the nature of MT minus-end specificity of CAMSAPs. Structural analysis showed that the globular CKK domain binds to a unique site between two tubulin dimers at the inter-protofilament interface. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the high-affinity site for CKK binding is located a few tubulin dimers behind the outmost MT minus end. Cryo-electron tomography of MT minus ends revealed a heterogeneous array of gently curved protofilaments that retain lateral interactions. Based on these data, we propose that the CKK preferentially binds to the transition zone between the regular lattice and the curved sheet-like structure of the minus-end extremity, which presents a subtly altered inter-protofilament interface that is optimal for CKK binding. Finally, our structural and <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution data show that CKK sterically hinders the interaction of kinesin-13 with MT minus ends, explaining how CAMSAPs and Patronin protect MT minus ends against depolymerization by these factors.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Minus-end recognition by CAMSAPs depends on the CKK domain, which is conserved in eukaryotes</title><p id="P7">We have previously shown that the CKK domain in mammalian CAMSAPs could bind minus ends<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. To investigate whether other CAMSAP domains could also control minus-end recognition, we have tested the ability of different purified GFP-tagged CAMSAP1 and CAMSAP3 domains to bind to MT minus ends and lattices <italic>in vitro</italic>. None of the CAMSAP fragments which lacked the CKK domain showed any minus-end preference (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-f</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>). For CAMSAP1, we found that the predicted helical domain and the linker which precede the CKK had only very weak MT affinity, but increased MT binding, though not minus end selectivity of CAMSAP1 CKK <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">(Fig.1a-f)</xref>. An additional negatively charged linker region of CAMSAP1 (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), located upstream of its third coiled coil domain, suppressed MT lattice binding and enhanced minus end selectivity when present together with the CKK domain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a-e</xref>; this construct was termed CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub>). For CAMSAP3, we confirmed that the MT binding domain located between coiled coils 2 and 3 specifically binds to GMPCPP but not GDP MTs, as we have demonstrated previously<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>). The predicted helical domain of CAMSAP3 together with the adjacent linker could also specifically bind to GMPCPP MTs without showing end preference (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a-c</xref>). We conclude that the minus-end preference of CAMSAPs depends on the CKK domains, while additional domains modulate their end selectivity or the ability to decorate MT lattice.</p><p id="P8">To establish whether CKK-mediated minus-end binding defines an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, we screened a set of nearly a hundred eukaryotic genomes and found that homologs of the CKK domain are found in all eukaryotic supergroups, except for Amoebozoa, although they were absent in some well-studied lineages such as dikaryan fungi and land plants (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Parsimoniously interpreting the occurrences of CKK across eukaryotes, we conclude that this domain was likely already present in the genome of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), and did not emerge during early animal evolution, as suggested previously<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In particular, our discovery of genes encoding CKK-containing proteins in the genomes of various members of the Excavata, a group some consider to be sister to all other eukaryotes (discussed in <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>), strongly supports an ancient origin of CKK. While in vertebrates the array of CKK-containing proteins was expanded by gene duplications, leading to the three CAMSAP paralogs in mammals, this was not the case in many other genomes (see <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Sequence File</xref>), suggesting that in most eukaryotes a single copy of the domain fulfils CKK functions.</p><p id="P9">To test whether the sequence conservation of CKK translates into functional conservation, we next purified GFP-tagged CKK domains derived from fly and worm (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>), as well as from four more evolutionarily distant eukaryotes (<italic>Trichomonas vaginalis, Tetrahymena thermophila, Naegleria gruberi</italic> and <italic>Phytophthora infestans)</italic>. From these six CKK domains tested, four (<italic>D. melanogaster, C. elegans, T. vaginalis, T. thermophila)</italic> specifically tracked the growing minus ends of MTs assembled from pig brain tubulin in <italic>in vitro</italic> MT dynamics reconstitution experiments (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>), while the two others (<italic>N. gruberi</italic> and <italic>P. infestans)</italic> showed strong binding along the whole MT lattice (data not shown). These data demonstrate that CKK represents a protein module that recognizes MT minus ends, a property that is preserved over long evolutionary distances.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>CKK domains bind to an intra-dimer site between protofilaments</title><p id="P10">We crystallized and solved the core structure of the mouse CAMSAP3 CKK domain (residues 1121&#x02013;1239; denoted CKK3<sub>core</sub>) by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.4 &#x000c5; (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similar to a previously deposited but unpublished NMR structure (PDB ID 1UGJ), the CKK3<sub>core</sub> has a compact, globular structure composed of two N-terminal &#x003b1;-helices, which are connected by a disordered loop (loop1) and pack against a central, five-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p id="P11">Although CKK shows clear preference for MT minus ends, at high concentrations it can also decorate the whole MT lattice. We reasoned that a high-resolution structure of the lattice-bound CKK domain might shed light on the mechanism of its MT minus-end recognition. Therefore, we analyzed extended CKK domains of CAMSAP1 and 3 (residues 1474&#x02013;1613 and 1112&#x02013;1252, respectively) bound to 13 protofilament (pf) taxol-stabilized MTs by cryo-EM. Filtered images of these MTs showed extra density corresponding to CKK domains spaced by 8 nm (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) indicative of binding every tubulin dimer. A striking feature of these CKK-decorated MTs is the presence of a right-handed skew in the protofilaments. This is evident from both the filtered images and the alignment parameters of the MT segments used for reconstruction, and is specific to the CKK-MT data sets (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). This indicates that CKK binding modifies the MT lattice with which it interacts, consistent with the idea that the regular MT lattice conformation is not the most favored substrate for CKK domains.</p><p id="P12">Asymmetric 3D reconstructions (~12 and ~9&#x000c5; resolution of CAMSAP1 and CAMSAP3, respectively) show the CKK domains binding the MT lattice every 8 nm between protofilaments except at the seam (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Using the pseudo-symmetry of the MTs, we obtained averaged reconstructions with overall final resolutions that allowed &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin to be clearly distinguished (FSCtrue 0.143 criteria;<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> of 5.3&#x000c5; (CAMSAP3) and 8&#x000c5; CAMSAP1) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4c-e</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). From these data, we can conclude that CKK domains bind at the tubulin intra-dimer B-lattice interface where conserved differences between &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin explain this binding site selection (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The binding site of CKK is distinct from other proteins known to bind between protofilaments, EBs and Doublecortin (DCX), which bind at the vertex of four tubulin dimers and not at the intra-dimer interface (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4f-h</xref>). However, some overlap is found with the binding site of kinesin (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4i</xref>).</p><p id="P13">For ease of description, the four tubulin subunits contacting a single CKK domain are referred to as &#x003b2;1-, &#x003b2;2-, &#x003b1;1- and &#x003b1;2-tubulin (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d,e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). In general, the CKK wedges snugly between, and forms more extensive contacts with, the &#x003b2;-tubulins than with the &#x003b1;-tubulins (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Contacts between the CKK domain and its MT binding site are distributed across the domain and also involve the N- and C-termini (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>). To confirm and extend the cryo-EM data, we also analyzed the structure of the CKK domain of CAMSAP3 bound to MTs using solid-state NMR (ssNMR), which provides a sensitive means to study ligand and protein binding to MTs at the atomic level<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. To do this, we compared the solution NMR (PDB ID 1UGJ) and our X-ray crystallographic results of free CKK with 2D ssNMR data recorded on [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N] labelled CKK in complex with MTs. This allowed us to identify CKK residues that underwent significant chemical-shift/intensity changes on MT binding (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a-d</xref>, labelled red) and those that experienced no significant change (labelled blue). For example, in our EM density, helix-&#x003b1;1 of the CKK domain sits across the &#x003b2;1- and &#x003b2;2-tubulins, while beneath it, loop7 and adjacent regions of the beta barrel wedge in between the &#x003b2;-tubulin subunits (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5e,f</xref>). Consistent with this, residues from MT-bound CKK helix-&#x003b1;1 and adjacent loop7 display ssNMR chemical shifts relative to free CKK. Similarly, our cryo-EM and ssNMR data corroborate interactions between CKK loop1 and &#x003b2;1-tubulin, CKK loop7 and &#x003b2;2-tubulin, while CKK loop3 lies at the intra-dimer interface contacting both &#x003b2;1-tubulin and &#x003b1;1-tubulin. CKK loop8 is well positioned to form contacts with &#x003b1;2-tubulin, and our ssNMR data support the involvement of this loop in the MT interaction. However, loop8 is only visible at less conservative cryo-EM density thresholds (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5f</xref>) suggesting higher flexibility than the rest of the CKK domain in this region, consistent with its B-factor in the crystal structure (data not shown). Taken together, residues identified as undergoing changes in ssNMR signals were found to cluster on the CKK MT-facing surface. In contrast, residues displaying unaltered ssNMR signals were found to be predominantly solvent-exposed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b-d</xref>). The ssNMR data thus support the EM-derived binding mode at an atomic level.</p><p id="P14">Neither the CKK N- and C-termini are visible in the crystal structure and both are flexible in solution (PDB ID 1UGJ). However, our cryo-EM and ssNMR data also support the role of the CKK N- and C-termini in MT binding. Density corresponding to the final portion of the N-terminus leading into helix-&#x003b1;1 (starting at S1120) is visible in our cryo-EM reconstruction contacting &#x003b1;2-tubulin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3a,d</xref>), while additional cryo-EM density suggests that more N-terminal regions make additional contacts with &#x003b2;2-tubulin (red asterisks, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>; red dashed line in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>,). The CKK N-terminus is therefore partially stabilized in complex with the MT, consistent with N-terminal truncation construct having lower MT affinity (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Furthermore, although not readily modelled, cryo-EM density corresponding to the conserved, basic C-terminus of the CKK domain and/or the &#x003b2;-tubulin C-terminal tail is visible (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). ssNMR measurements in the CAMSAP3 CKK-MT complex suggest that the CKK C-terminus retains some conformational variability when interacting with MTs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The location of the CKK C-terminus suggests that it interacts with the flexible acidic C-terminal tail of &#x003b2;1-tubulin; this is supported by the observation that the interaction of GFP-tagged CAMSAP3-CKK domain with MTs was significantly reduced when the acidic C-terminal tails of tubulin had been cleaved (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p id="P15">We also used molecular dynamics (MD) based energy calculations, which can provide an estimate of the relative energetic contributions of individual residues to complex formation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, to analyse the CKK-MT interaction. This analysis also supports the involvement of the regions described above in the CKK-tubulin interface (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Overall analysis of the electrostatic potential of the contact surfaces shows complementary charges between the CKK domain and the MT (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b,c</xref>). This is consistent with the large electrostatic contribution to binding energy from MD and the established sensitivity of CAMSAP-MT interaction to ionic strength<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a,d</xref>). CKK residues at the interface with the MT - especially basic ones - are particularly conserved in CKK domains throughout evolution (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6c,e</xref>). In addition, these calculations also highlighted the greater energetic contribution of CKK binding to &#x003b2;-tubulin over &#x003b1;-tubulin (with a calculated &#x00394;G of &#x02212;25.1&#x000b1;5.2 kcal/mol for &#x003b2;-tubulin positions compared to &#x02212;3.6&#x000b1;5.0 kcal/mol for &#x003b1;-tubulin). Taken together, our cryo-EM, ssNMR and MD data show that CKK binds through multiple binding sites across two tubulin dimers at their intra-dimer interface between protofilaments, and associates more closely with &#x003b2;-tubulin.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Analysis of CKK mutants supports the identified CKK-MT interface</title><p id="P16">To further validate the identified CKK-MT binding mode, we made a series of CKK mutants in the context of a short version of CAMSAP1 (CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub>, residues 1227&#x02013;1613), which displays a more robust minus-end tracking activity than the CKK domain alone (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-e</xref>). Mutations of several conserved positively charged residues reduced the overall binding affinity of CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> to MTs and their minus ends (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c</xref>), although they did not affect the integrity and folding of the CKK domain, as determined by measuring circular dichroism (CD) spectra and thermal unfolding profiles in the CAMSAP3 CKK context (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>). Truncation of the N-terminal extension or mutations of positively charged residues in this sequence had a similar effect, as well as truncations of the positively charged C-terminal tail region (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These data support the validity of our CKK-MT lattice reconstruction and its relevance for CKK binding to the MT minus end.</p><p id="P17">Surprisingly, a mutation of a conserved asparagine residue (N1492 of CAMSAP1 and N1130 in CAMSAP3) to alanine, which did not affect the integrity of the domain (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7a</xref>), dramatically increased the ability of CKK to bind to the MT lattice and reduced, though did not abolish, its selectivity for minus ends (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 7b-f</xref>). The importance of CAMSAP1 N1492 residue was further emphasized by the observation that mutating it to bulky charged or uncharged amino acids reduced the affinity of CKK for both MT minus ends and lattices, while substituting it for either serine or threonine enhanced MT lattice binding and decreased minus end selectivity even further (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7d-f</xref>). CAMSAP1 N1492 is expected to contact the C-terminus of helix H4 of &#x003b2;2-tubulin (cyan in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), and our data suggest that the formation of the CKK-MT complex is very sensitive to both to the size and the chemical nature of the side chain in this position. For example, the potential hydrogen bond formation between this residue and &#x003b2;-tubulin could affect the affinity of the CKK-MT interaction.</p><p id="P18">We also mutated to alanine several residues close to N1492 in the CKK structure; several of these substitutions had no effect (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7g,h</xref>), while the D1572A mutation also enhanced CKK interaction with MT lattice and reduced its minus end selectivity (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Overall, these experiments identified two main classes of mutations: 1) mutations of positively charged CKK residues, which weakened the interaction between CKK and negatively charged surface of the MT ends and lattice, including less structurally ordered regions of both the CKK and MT; 2) mutations that specifically boosted lattice binding. Remarkably, these latter mutations were rather subtle, suggesting that the mechanism of minus end discrimination itself is also subtle.</p><p id="P19">We reasoned that understanding the mechanism underlying the improved affinity of the N1492A mutant for MTs would provide insight into CKK&#x02019;s minus-end specificity. Therefore, we obtained a 3D reconstruction of the CAMSAP1 CKK N1492A mutant using cryo-EM (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a-d</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As with the wild type CKK, the N1492A mutant also binds at the tubulin intra-dimer B-lattice interface with the same overall orientation as the wild type CKK (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8a,c,d</xref>). However, two distinct structural properties were observed for the mutant: i) less protofilament skew compared to wild type in CKK N1492A decorated MTs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.8e</xref>) and ii) CKK N1492A itself is subtly shifted towards the main MT body compared to wild type (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). This result suggests that very small changes in the CKK-MT interaction determine binding selectivity of CKK between the lattice and the minus end. It also suggests that the adjustment in the CKK-MT interaction by the N1492A mutant &#x02013; movement of the CKK domain deeper between protofilaments &#x02013; could reflect aspects of the mechanism of end selectivity by wild type CKK via selection of a tubulin conformation only present at MT minus ends.</p><p id="P20">We also attempted to polymerize tubulin in the presence of a high concentration of CKK. In the presence of the wild type CKK, only very few short microtubules formed, and instead a variety of tubulin oligomers were generated that formed clumps. In contrast, in the presence of saturating concentrations of the N1492A mutant, many longer, predominantly 13 protofilament microtubules formed (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8f</xref>). These data support the idea that the wild type CKK preferentially interacts with a polymeric conformation of tubulin that is distinct from the normal MT structure, while the binding of the N1492A mutant is more compatible with the regular MT lattice.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>The high affinity CKK binding site at MT minus ends is insensitive to the tubulin nucleotide state and lies a few tubulin dimers behind the outmost minus end</title><p id="P21">Having defined the CKK-MT binding mode, we set out to determine whether the state of MT minus ends affects CKK binding. We found that the binding of CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> to MT minus ends was insensitive to the nucleotide state of MTs, as the protein bound well to the minus ends of GMPCPP-stabilized (GTP like) or taxol-stabilized (GDP) MTs, as well as dynamic GTP or GTP&#x003b3;S (GDP-Pi like) MTs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). In contrast, we observed no accumulation of CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> at depolymerizing MT minus ends (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that their structure does not support CKK binding.</p><p id="P22">To determine the precise localization of CKK on MT minus ends, the model-convolution method<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> was implemented to determine the relative positions of the CKK and the MT minus end from their one dimensional intensity profiles along the MT axis <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 5d,e)</xref>. Our data showed that CKK accumulates ~16 nm &#x02013; equivalent to a few tubulin dimers - behind the outmost MT minus end (estimated measurement error: ~8 nm; see Methods). This result suggests that some structural features of MT minus ends at this specific location form a preferred CKK binding site.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Cryo-electron tomography shows that inter-protofilament contacts are preserved at MT ends</title><p id="P23">To get insight into the structure of this binding site, we analyzed individual ends of GMPCPP-stabilized MTs by cryo-electron tomography (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Because no averaging was imposed, the tomographic 3D reconstructions contain information about overall polymer configuration and thus directly visualises the conformation of tubulin that CKK recognises. The data quality readily allows discrimination of individual protofilaments and in many cases individual subunits (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>), and provides critical 3D information about the MT ends.</p><p id="P24">Individual protofilament 3D trajectories within five minus and five plus ends (identified using previously established approaches<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.9a,b</xref>) were analyzed. Overall the individual MT ends are very heterogeneous, and there are no significant differences between minus and plus ends. However, their structures are not blunt but are also distinct from those of a MT end model constructed using available high resolution structures of curved tubulin (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9c</xref>). First, plots of individual protofilament trajectories at both plus and minus ends show a range of curvatures and lengths of curved regions (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref> for an example of a minus end). Second, while there is a wide variation of protofilament curvature, protofilaments at each end are on average less curved than in the model (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i,j</xref>). The minus and plus end protofilaments are similar with respect to the length (18&#x000b1;15 nm and 11&#x000b1;8 nm at the minus and plus ends, respectively) and extent of longitudinal curvature, which is consistent with previous cryo-EM studies in 2D<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. This suggests that CKK minus-end preference does not depend on longitudinal curvature alone.</p><p id="P25">Intriguingly, adjacent protofilaments within a MT end retain connectivity with their neighbors (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9d</xref>), even while the protofilaments spread away from the MT axis and the total protofilament number reduces. This behavior is in contrast to the MT end model in which protofilament separation is an essential consequence of their curvature and is more consistent with the classical &#x0201c;rams horns&#x0201d; of depolymerizing MTs<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, to which CAMSAP does not bind (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In other words, in non-depolymerizing MTs, protofilaments curving outwards from the MT axis flatten from a cylinder into gently curving sheet-like structures, which retain lateral connectivity<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Given that the CKK domain binds at the inter-protofilament interface, the tomographic data suggest that potential CKK binding sites are retained in the end structures we have characterised. To check whether CKK binding perturbs these curved sheet-like structures, we examined MT minus ends in the presence of CKK but detected no differences compared to the control MTs (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9e-h</xref>). This analysis, when combined with our fluorescence-based localization of the CKK binding site, suggests the CKK prefers neither the extreme end nor the MT lattice but a transition region from the straight lattice to a curved and flattened polymer.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The CKK domain inhibits MCAK-induced MT minus-end depolymerization by blocking its interaction with minus ends</title><p id="P26">It has been shown that fly Patronin and three mammalian CAMSAPs can protect MT minus ends from the depolymerization by kinesin-136, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. By superimposing HsMCAK motor structure onto our CKK-MT cryo-EM reconstruction, we noticed that CKK and HsMCAK would strongly clash with each other at a number of positions (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). This suggests that CKK and MCAK would compete for the binding sites at MT minus ends. To test this hypothesis, we measured <italic>in vitro</italic> disassembly of GMPCPP stabilized MTs by 50 nM MCAK in the presence of different concentrations of CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> or the isolated CKK domain (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,c</xref>). CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> and CKK almost completely inhibited the minus-end binding and depolymerization of MCAK at 1.5 nM and 38 nM, respectively, while the activity of MCAK on plus ends was largely unaffected at these concentrations (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). Above 1 &#x000b5;M concentration, even though both CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub> and CKK fully decorated MT shaft with lattice intensities higher than those observed at the minus ends at low concentrations, this decoration did not lead to a complete inhibition of MT plus-end accumulation and depolymerization by MCAK (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d,e</xref>). This observation suggests that the CKK has the highest affinity for MT minus ends, followed by the MT lattice, and the lowest affinity for MT plus ends. The alternative mechanism - that displacement of MCAK from MT minus ends is due to CKK-mediated alteration of MT minus-end structure which would be less favorable for MCAK binding - is not supported by our cryo-EM images even at CKK concentration of &#x0003e;50 &#x000b5;M, which was much higher than the ones used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9e-h</xref>). This result indicates that the competition between CKK and MCAK on MT minus ends is primarily based on steric hindrance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P27">In this study, we have shown that the CKK is a highly conserved globular protein module that interacts with an inter-protofilament site between two tubulin dimers on the outer surface of MTs. Several lines of evidence suggest that an optimal site for CKK binding deviates from the inter-protofilament interface within a regular, straight MT structure. First, the decoration by CKK distorts the normal MT lattice generating a right-handed protofilament skew. Second, tubulin copolymerisation with CKK yields mainly non-MT, curved polymers. Third, the interaction between CKK and its binding site is intrinsically asymmetric, with the helical parts of CKK interacting more closely with the &#x003b2;-tubulin pairs, while its connectivity with the &#x003b1;-tubulin pair is less compact and could accommodate plasticity existing at minus ends. Fourth, the N1492A mutation increases affinity and subtly alters the CKK position relative to the MT, resulting in a deeper insertion between the protofilaments. The size and the chemical nature of the N1492 substituted side chain also affect CKK affinity for the MT lattice, suggesting that the optimal binding site for the wild type CKK domain might depend on specific but subtle conformational features of tubulin dimers at MT minus ends to allow a more buried fit between protofilaments. Fifth, high-resolution microscopy showed that the high-affinity CKK binding region is located, on average, two tubulin dimers behind the outmost MT end. This binding site fits very well with the average position of the transition zone between straight protofilaments in the MT shaft and mildly curved tubulin sheets identified at MT ends by cryo-electron tomography.</p><p id="P28">At this transition zone, pairs of &#x003b1;-tubulins would be more laterally flattened and more flexible than the more constrained lattice-like &#x003b2;-tubulin pairs (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). Consistent with this, our structures show that the lattice-bound CKK already has tight shape complementarity and a large contact surface with the &#x003b2;-tubulin pairs, whilst the &#x003b1;-tubulin pairs surround the CKK more loosely. Conversely, at the plus end, &#x003b2;-tubulin pairs are expected to acquire a more flattened and flexible arrangement than &#x003b1;-tubulins. This would disfavor the interaction of CKK with the plus end, explaining its inability to effectively compete with MCAK at this location. In summary, flattening of &#x003b2;-tubulin pairs at the plus end could squeeze CKK out of the tubulin groove to avoid steric clashes, whilst flattening of &#x003b1;-tubulin pairs at the minus end could tighten their multiple contacts around the CKK. This leads to a binding preference for the minus end, some capacity to bind the straight MT lattice and low affinity for MT plus end. The lack of CKK binding at rapidly depolymerizing MT minus ends, where the lateral contacts between protofilaments are expected to be lost due to their strong curling, is consistent with the requirement for maintenance of lateral protofilament connectivity and/or more gentle longitudinal curvature for CAMSAP binding.</p><p id="P29">It is important to note that although our analysis showed that CKK is the only CAMSAP part which can autonomously recognise MT minus ends, some longer CAMSAP fragments, such as CAMSAP1<sub>mini</sub>, had a higher affinity for the minus ends. These data indicate that CAMSAP regions outside of the CKK domain can contribute to the affinity and selectivity of the minus-end binding, and additional work will be needed to decipher the underlying mechanisms.</p><p id="P30">The MT minus-end binding mode of the CKK domain is distinct from those of other known MT tip-interacting proteins. The most conceptually simple mode of MT end recognition relies on the presence of unique epitopes of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-tubulin exposed on the outermost MT ends, as is the case for the &#x003b3;-TuRC at the minus end<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>, and which likely applies to the centriole protein CPAP at MT plus ends<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. However, the preference of most known MT regulators is based on recognition of certain MT lattice features that are different at MT ends compared to the MT shaft. For example, EB proteins bind at the corner of four tubulin dimers<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and sense a GTP hydrolysis transition state of tubulin within the MT lattice at both plus- and minus ends<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Doublecortin (DCX), which also binds at the corner of four tubulin dimers<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, can also act as a MT end-binding protein and is thought to be sensitive to the extent of protofilament longitudinal curvature<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. MT depolymerizing kinesin-13s can also accumulate at MT ends, likely due to preference for the more curved or flexible conformations of tubulin located outside the lattice<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Importantly, none of these mechanisms is specific for the plus or the minus end.</p><p id="P31">CAMSAPs are similar to most other MT end-binding proteins in that they bind on the outer surface of MTs.: in contrast to &#x003b3;-TuRC, which caps MTs, CAMSAP binding is compatible with further MT polymerization at the minus end<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. CAMSAPs and &#x003b3;-TuRCs thus do not directly compete for binding to MT minus ends; however, the restricted, lattice-like conformation of tubulin at &#x003b3;-TuRC-capped minus ends likely prevents formation of CAMSAP-preferred binding regions. Importantly, in contrast to EBs, CAMSAP-MT association is insensitive to the hydrolysis state of the tubulin-bound nucleotide. Whereas the tubulin inter-dimer interface to which EBs bind changes conformation in response to nucleotide, the intra-dimer interface to which CKKs bind does not<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. This accounts for the ability of CAMSAPs to recognize growing, GTP- as well as the GDP-bound minus ends generated by MT severing<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P32">CAMSAP interaction with MT minus ends can be expected to have several consequences. First, by preferentially binding between laterally connected but curved protofilaments, the CKK &#x02013; in the context of the full length protein - might inhibit formation of a regular lattice, explaining why CAMSAPs slow down MT minus-end polymerization<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Second, CKK binding at intra-dimer binding sites can also explain protection of MT minus ends from kinesin-13 driven depolymerization by direct steric inhibition (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Taken together, our data show that the unique MT-binding mode of the CKK domains enables CAMSAPs to combine the ability to recognize MT minus ends with the preservation of dynamic properties of these ends. This allows CAMSAPs to be rapidly recruited to MT minus ends generated by release from the site of MT nucleation, severing or breakage, protect them against disassembly by depolymerases and, by decorating polymerizing minus ends, form stretches of stabilized MT lattice. Future studies will show whether there are other proteins sharing the CKK&#x02019;s MT binding mode, or whether it is unique to this evolutionary ancient and widespread protein module.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p id="P34">For the detection of CKK homologs BLASTP/PSI-BLAST<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and phmmer/jackhmmer<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> searches were performed online across the nr and UniProt databases, respectively, taking different sequences as query.

Protofilaments retain lateral connectivity, and thus inter-protofilament CKK binding sites are preserved. Given the polar nature of MTs, these lattice-sheet transitions create unique conformations of B-lattice tubulin dimer-pairs at either end of the MT: at the minus end, &#x003b1;-tubulins in dimer-pairs are more flattened compared to &#x003b2;-tubulins, with the opposite being true at the plus end. In this way, we propose that the unique dimer-pair conformation at the minus end favors CKK binding when compared to dimer pair conformations in the lattice or at the plus end.</p><p id="P109">(<bold>b</bold>) Model of minus end (-end) specific protection from MCAK-induced depolymerization by the CKK domains. CKKs (green circles) bind specifically to a curved minus end region, preventing the association of MCAK motor domains (red triangles) to the same region via steric inhibition. As the CKKs do not bind to the corresponding region of the plus end (+end), MCAK is free to bind and depolymerise from the plus end.</p></caption><graphic
