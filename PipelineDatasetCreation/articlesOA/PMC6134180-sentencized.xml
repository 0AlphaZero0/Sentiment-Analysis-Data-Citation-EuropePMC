</text></title><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microtubules (MTs) are highly dynamic polymers, which assemble and disassemble from their two ends, the fast-growing plus end and the slow-growing minus end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>While many data are available about the regulation of MT plus ends1, 2, much less is known about the proteins specifically regulating MT minus ends, despite the fact that MT minus end organization defines the architecture of cellular MT arrays3, 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The best-studied MT nucleating and minus-end binding factor is the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC)5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recently, the members of calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein (CAMSAP) and Patronin family were shown to control non-centrosomal MT minus-end organization independently of γ-TuRC in different systems, including the mitotic spindle in insect cells6–8, cortically attached MT arrays in epithelial cells9–13 and MT bundles in neurons14–17. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CAMSAP1, CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 (in vertebrates) and Patronin (in invertebrates) recognize and track uncapped, growing MT minus ends18, 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In mammals, CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 are deposited on MT lattices formed by MT minus-end polymerization and in this way generate stable MT stretches that can serve as a source of non-centrosomal MT outgrowth18, 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In contrast, CAMSAP1 tracks growing MT minus ends but does not decorate them18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CAMSAPs and Patronin contain a C-terminal CKK domain (C-terminal domain common to CAMSAP1, KIAA1078 and KIAA1543) as well as an N-terminal Calponin Homology (CH) domain and several coiled-coil regions21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In mammalian CAMSAPs, the minus-end recognition was shown to depend on the CKK domain, while the ability of CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 to stay attached to the MT lattice was associated with additional adjacent regions18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, in fly Patronin, the minus-end recognition was proposed to be mediated by the unstructured linker region in combination with the adjacent C-terminal coiled coil19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The deletion of the CKK domain in CAMSAP3 causes a loss-of-function phenotype in mice10, and in worms, the CKK domain of Patronin (PTRN-1) was necessary and sufficient for supporting proper MT dynamics and axon regeneration17, demonstrating the functional importance of this domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Here, we set out to investigate the nature of MT minus-end specificity of CAMSAPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Structural analysis showed that the globular CKK domain binds to a unique site between two tubulin dimers at the inter-protofilament interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the high-affinity site for CKK binding is located a few tubulin dimers behind the outmost MT minus end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Cryo-electron tomography of MT minus ends revealed a heterogeneous array of gently curved protofilaments that retain lateral interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Based on these data, we propose that the CKK preferentially binds to the transition zone between the regular lattice and the curved sheet-like structure of the minus-end extremity, which presents a subtly altered inter-protofilament interface that is optimal for CKK binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Finally, our structural and in vitro reconstitution data show that CKK sterically hinders the interaction of kinesin-13 with MT minus ends, explaining how CAMSAPs and Patronin protect MT minus ends against depolymerization by these factors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the CKK domain in mammalian CAMSAPs could bind minus ends18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether other CAMSAP domains could also control minus-end recognition, we have tested the ability of different purified GFP-tagged CAMSAP1 and CAMSAP3 domains to bind to MT minus ends and lattices in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>None of the CAMSAP fragments which lacked the CKK domain showed any minus-end preference (Fig. 1a-f and Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>For CAMSAP1, we found that the predicted helical domain and the linker which precede the CKK had only very weak MT affinity, but increased MT binding, though not minus end selectivity of CAMSAP1 CKK (Fig.1a-f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>An additional negatively charged linker region of CAMSAP1 (Supplementary Fig. 1d), located upstream of its third coiled coil domain, suppressed MT lattice binding and enhanced minus end selectivity when present together with the CKK domain (Fig.1a-e; this construct was termed CAMSAP1mini). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For CAMSAP3, we confirmed that the MT binding domain located between coiled coils 2 and 3 specifically binds to GMPCPP but not GDP MTs, as we have demonstrated previously18 (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The predicted helical domain of CAMSAP3 together with the adjacent linker could also specifically bind to GMPCPP MTs without showing end preference (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the minus-end preference of CAMSAPs depends on the CKK domains, while additional domains modulate their end selectivity or the ability to decorate MT lattice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To establish whether CKK-mediated minus-end binding defines an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, we screened a set of nearly a hundred eukaryotic genomes and found that homologs of the CKK domain are found in all eukaryotic supergroups, except for Amoebozoa, although they were absent in some well-studied lineages such as dikaryan fungi and land plants (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Parsimoniously interpreting the occurrences of CKK across eukaryotes, we conclude that this domain was likely already present in the genome of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), and did not emerge during early animal evolution, as suggested previously21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In particular, our discovery of genes encoding CKK-containing proteins in the genomes of various members of the Excavata, a group some consider to be sister to all other eukaryotes (discussed in 22), strongly supports an ancient origin of CKK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>While in vertebrates the array of CKK-containing proteins was expanded by gene duplications, leading to the three CAMSAP paralogs in mammals, this was not the case in many other genomes (see Supplementary Sequence File), suggesting that in most eukaryotes a single copy of the domain fulfils CKK functions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To test whether the sequence conservation of CKK translates into functional conservation, we next purified GFP-tagged CKK domains derived from fly and worm (Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), as well as from four more evolutionarily distant eukaryotes (Trichomonas vaginalis, Tetrahymena thermophila, Naegleria gruberi and Phytophthora infestans). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>From these six CKK domains tested, four (D. melanogaster, C. elegans, T. vaginalis, T. thermophila) specifically tracked the growing minus ends of MTs assembled from pig brain tubulin in in vitro MT dynamics reconstitution experiments (Fig. 1g), while the two others (N. gruberi and P. infestans) showed strong binding along the whole MT lattice (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that CKK represents a protein module that recognizes MT minus ends, a property that is preserved over long evolutionary distances. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We crystallized and solved the core structure of the mouse CAMSAP3 CKK domain (residues 1121–1239; denoted CKK3core) by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.4 Å (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Similar to a previously deposited but unpublished NMR structure (PDB ID 1UGJ), the CKK3core has a compact, globular structure composed of two N-terminal α-helices, which are connected by a disordered loop (loop1) and pack against a central, five-stranded β-sheet (Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Although CKK shows clear preference for MT minus ends, at high concentrations it can also decorate the whole MT lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that a high-resolution structure of the lattice-bound CKK domain might shed light on the mechanism of its MT minus-end recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analyzed extended CKK domains of CAMSAP1 and 3 (residues 1474–1613 and 1112–1252, respectively) bound to 13 protofilament (pf) taxol-stabilized MTs by cryo-EM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Filtered images of these MTs showed extra density corresponding to CKK domains spaced by 8 nm (Fig. 2a) indicative of binding every tubulin dimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>A striking feature of these CKK-decorated MTs is the presence of a right-handed skew in the protofilaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This is evident from both the filtered images and the alignment parameters of the MT segments used for reconstruction, and is specific to the CKK-MT data sets (Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>This indicates that CKK binding modifies the MT lattice with which it interacts, consistent with the idea that the regular MT lattice conformation is not the most favored substrate for CKK domains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric 3D reconstructions (~12 and ~9Å resolution of CAMSAP1 and CAMSAP3, respectively) show the CKK domains binding the MT lattice every 8 nm between protofilaments except at the seam (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Using the pseudo-symmetry of the MTs, we obtained averaged reconstructions with overall final resolutions that allowed α- and β-tubulin to be clearly distinguished (FSCtrue 0.143 criteria;23 of 5.3Å (CAMSAP3) and 8Å CAMSAP1) (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 4c-e, Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>From these data, we can conclude that CKK domains bind at the tubulin intra-dimer B-lattice interface where conserved differences between α- and β-tubulin explain this binding site selection (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The binding site of CKK is distinct from other proteins known to bind between protofilaments, EBs and Doublecortin (DCX), which bind at the vertex of four tubulin dimers and not at the intra-dimer interface (Supplementary Fig. 4f-h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>However, some overlap is found with the binding site of kinesin (Supplementary Fig. 4i). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>For ease of description, the four tubulin subunits contacting a single CKK domain are referred to as β1-, β2-, α1- and α2-tubulin (see Fig. 2d,e and 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>In general, the CKK wedges snugly between, and forms more extensive contacts with, the β-tubulins than with the α-tubulins (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Contacts between the CKK domain and its MT binding site are distributed across the domain and also involve the N- and C-termini (Fig. 2d and 3a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>To confirm and extend the cryo-EM data, we also analyzed the structure of the CKK domain of CAMSAP3 bound to MTs using solid-state NMR (ssNMR), which provides a sensitive means to study ligand and protein binding to MTs at the atomic level24, 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>To do this, we compared the solution NMR (PDB ID 1UGJ) and our X-ray crystallographic results of free CKK with 2D ssNMR data recorded on [13C,15N] labelled CKK in complex with MTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This allowed us to identify CKK residues that underwent significant chemical-shift/intensity changes on MT binding (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5a-d, labelled red) and those that experienced no significant change (labelled blue). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>For example, in our EM density, helix-α1 of the CKK domain sits across the β1- and β2-tubulins, while beneath it, loop7 and adjacent regions of the beta barrel wedge in between the β-tubulin subunits (Fig. 3a-c and Supplementary Fig. 5e,f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, residues from MT-bound CKK helix-α1 and adjacent loop7 display ssNMR chemical shifts relative to free CKK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Similarly, our cryo-EM and ssNMR data corroborate interactions between CKK loop1 and β1-tubulin, CKK loop7 and β2-tubulin, while CKK loop3 lies at the intra-dimer interface contacting both β1-tubulin and α1-tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>CKK loop8 is well positioned to form contacts with α2-tubulin, and our ssNMR data support the involvement of this loop in the MT interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>However, loop8 is only visible at less conservative cryo-EM density thresholds (Supplementary Fig. 5f) suggesting higher flexibility than the rest of the CKK domain in this region, consistent with its B-factor in the crystal structure (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Taken together, residues identified as undergoing changes in ssNMR signals were found to cluster on the CKK MT-facing surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>In contrast, residues displaying unaltered ssNMR signals were found to be predominantly solvent-exposed (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5b-d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The ssNMR data thus support the EM-derived binding mode at an atomic level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Neither the CKK N- and C-termini are visible in the crystal structure and both are flexible in solution (PDB ID 1UGJ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>However, our cryo-EM and ssNMR data also support the role of the CKK N- and C-termini in MT binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Density corresponding to the final portion of the N-terminus leading into helix-α1 (starting at S1120) is visible in our cryo-EM reconstruction contacting α2-tubulin (Fig. 2d, 3a,d), while additional cryo-EM density suggests that more N-terminal regions make additional contacts with β2-tubulin (red asterisks, Fig. 3a; red dashed line in Fig. 3d,). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The CKK N-terminus is therefore partially stabilized in complex with the MT, consistent with N-terminal truncation construct having lower MT affinity (Fig. 3e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although not readily modelled, cryo-EM density corresponding to the conserved, basic C-terminus of the CKK domain and/or the β-tubulin C-terminal tail is visible (Fig. 3f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>ssNMR measurements in the CAMSAP3 CKK-MT complex suggest that the CKK C-terminus retains some conformational variability when interacting with MTs (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The location of the CKK C-terminus suggests that it interacts with the flexible acidic C-terminal tail of β1-tubulin; this is supported by the observation that the interaction of GFP-tagged CAMSAP3-CKK domain with MTs was significantly reduced when the acidic C-terminal tails of tubulin had been cleaved (Fig. 3g). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We also used molecular dynamics (MD) based energy calculations, which can provide an estimate of the relative energetic contributions of individual residues to complex formation26, to analyse the CKK-MT interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This analysis also supports the involvement of the regions described above in the CKK-tubulin interface (Supplementary Fig. 6a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Overall analysis of the electrostatic potential of the contact surfaces shows complementary charges between the CKK domain and the MT (Supplementary Fig. 6b,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the large electrostatic contribution to binding energy from MD and the established sensitivity of CAMSAP-MT interaction to ionic strength18, 19 (Supplementary Fig. 6a,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>CKK residues at the interface with the MT - especially basic ones - are particularly conserved in CKK domains throughout evolution (Supplementary Fig. 2b and 6c,e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In addition, these calculations also highlighted the greater energetic contribution of CKK binding to β-tubulin over α-tubulin (with a calculated ΔG of −25.1±5.2 kcal/mol for β-tubulin positions compared to −3.6±5.0 kcal/mol for α-tubulin). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our cryo-EM, ssNMR and MD data show that CKK binds through multiple binding sites across two tubulin dimers at their intra-dimer interface between protofilaments, and associates more closely with β-tubulin. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>To further validate the identified CKK-MT binding mode, we made a series of CKK mutants in the context of a short version of CAMSAP1 (CAMSAP1mini, residues 1227–1613), which displays a more robust minus-end tracking activity than the CKK domain alone (Fig. 1a-e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Mutations of several conserved positively charged residues reduced the overall binding affinity of CAMSAP1mini to MTs and their minus ends (Fig. 4a-c), although they did not affect the integrity and folding of the CKK domain, as determined by measuring circular dichroism (CD) spectra and thermal unfolding profiles in the CAMSAP3 CKK context (Supplementary Fig. 7a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Truncation of the N-terminal extension or mutations of positively charged residues in this sequence had a similar effect, as well as truncations of the positively charged C-terminal tail region (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>These data support the validity of our CKK-MT lattice reconstruction and its relevance for CKK binding to the MT minus end. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, a mutation of a conserved asparagine residue (N1492 of CAMSAP1 and N1130 in CAMSAP3) to alanine, which did not affect the integrity of the domain (Supplementary Fig. 7a), dramatically increased the ability of CKK to bind to the MT lattice and reduced, though did not abolish, its selectivity for minus ends (Fig. 4a-c, Supplementary Figure 7b-f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The importance of CAMSAP1 N1492 residue was further emphasized by the observation that mutating it to bulky charged or uncharged amino acids reduced the affinity of CKK for both MT minus ends and lattices, while substituting it for either serine or threonine enhanced MT lattice binding and decreased minus end selectivity even further (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 7d-f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>CAMSAP1 N1492 is expected to contact the C-terminus of helix H4 of β2-tubulin (cyan in Fig. 4b), and our data suggest that the formation of the CKK-MT complex is very sensitive to both to the size and the chemical nature of the side chain in this position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>For example, the potential hydrogen bond formation between this residue and β-tubulin could affect the affinity of the CKK-MT interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>We also mutated to alanine several residues close to N1492 in the CKK structure; several of these substitutions had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 7g,h), while the D1572A mutation also enhanced CKK interaction with MT lattice and reduced its minus end selectivity (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Overall, these experiments identified two main classes of mutations: 1) mutations of positively charged CKK residues, which weakened the interaction between CKK and negatively charged surface of the MT ends and lattice, including less structurally ordered regions of both the CKK and MT; 2) mutations that specifically boosted lattice binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, these latter mutations were rather subtle, suggesting that the mechanism of minus end discrimination itself is also subtle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that understanding the mechanism underlying the improved affinity of the N1492A mutant for MTs would provide insight into CKK’s minus-end specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we obtained a 3D reconstruction of the CAMSAP1 CKK N1492A mutant using cryo-EM (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 8a-d, Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>As with the wild type CKK, the N1492A mutant also binds at the tubulin intra-dimer B-lattice interface with the same overall orientation as the wild type CKK (Supplementary Fig. 8a,c,d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, two distinct structural properties were observed for the mutant: i) less protofilament skew compared to wild type in CKK N1492A decorated MTs (Supplementary Fig.8e) and ii) CKK N1492A itself is subtly shifted towards the main MT body compared to wild type (Fig. 4e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that very small changes in the CKK-MT interaction determine binding selectivity of CKK between the lattice and the minus end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that the adjustment in the CKK-MT interaction by the N1492A mutant – movement of the CKK domain deeper between protofilaments – could reflect aspects of the mechanism of end selectivity by wild type CKK via selection of a tubulin conformation only present at MT minus ends. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>We also attempted to polymerize tubulin in the presence of a high concentration of CKK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the presence of the wild type CKK, only very few short microtubules formed, and instead a variety of tubulin oligomers were generated that formed clumps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the presence of saturating concentrations of the N1492A mutant, many longer, predominantly 13 protofilament microtubules formed (Supplementary Figure 8f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>These data support the idea that the wild type CKK preferentially interacts with a polymeric conformation of tubulin that is distinct from the normal MT structure, while the binding of the N1492A mutant is more compatible with the regular MT lattice. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Overall the individual MT ends are very heterogeneous, and there are no significant differences between minus and plus ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>However, their structures are not blunt but are also distinct from those of a MT end model constructed using available high resolution structures of curved tubulin (Supplementary Fig. 9c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>First, plots of individual protofilament trajectories at both plus and minus ends show a range of curvatures and lengths of curved regions (see Fig. 5h for an example of a minus end). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Second, while there is a wide variation of protofilament curvature, protofilaments at each end are on average less curved than in the model (Fig. 5i,j). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The minus and plus end protofilaments are similar with respect to the length (18±15 nm and 11±8 nm at the minus and plus ends, respectively) and extent of longitudinal curvature, which is consistent with previous cryo-EM studies in 2D30, 31. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CKK minus-end preference does not depend on longitudinal curvature alone. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, adjacent protofilaments within a MT end retain connectivity with their neighbors (Fig. 5k, Supplementary Fig. 9d), even while the protofilaments spread away from the MT axis and the total protofilament number reduces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This behavior is in contrast to the MT end model in which protofilament separation is an essential consequence of their curvature and is more consistent with the classical “rams horns” of depolymerizing MTs31, to which CAMSAP does not bind (Fig. 5c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In other words, in non-depolymerizing MTs, protofilaments curving outwards from the MT axis flatten from a cylinder into gently curving sheet-like structures, which retain lateral connectivity30, 32, 33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Given that the CKK domain binds at the inter-protofilament interface, the tomographic data suggest that potential CKK binding sites are retained in the end structures we have characterised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>To check whether CKK binding perturbs these curved sheet-like structures, we examined MT minus ends in the presence of CKK but detected no differences compared to the control MTs (Supplementary Fig. 9e-h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>This analysis, when combined with our fluorescence-based localization of the CKK binding site, suggests the CKK prefers neither the extreme end nor the MT lattice but a transition region from the straight lattice to a curved and flattened polymer. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>By superimposing HsMCAK motor structure onto our CKK-MT cryo-EM reconstruction, we noticed that CKK and HsMCAK would strongly clash with each other at a number of positions (Fig. 6a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CKK and MCAK would compete for the binding sites at MT minus ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we measured in vitro disassembly of GMPCPP stabilized MTs by 50 nM MCAK in the presence of different concentrations of CAMSAP1mini or the isolated CKK domain (Fig. 6b,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>CAMSAP1mini and CKK almost completely inhibited the minus-end binding and depolymerization of MCAK at 1.5 nM and 38 nM, respectively, while the activity of MCAK on plus ends was largely unaffected at these concentrations (Fig. 6d,e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Above 1 µM concentration, even though both CAMSAP1mini and CKK fully decorated MT shaft with lattice intensities higher than those observed at the minus ends at low concentrations, this decoration did not lead to a complete inhibition of MT plus-end accumulation and depolymerization by MCAK (Fig. 6d,e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the CKK has the highest affinity for MT minus ends, followed by the MT lattice, and the lowest affinity for MT plus ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The alternative mechanism - that displacement of MCAK from MT minus ends is due to CKK-mediated alteration of MT minus-end structure which would be less favorable for MCAK binding - is not supported by our cryo-EM images even at CKK concentration of &gt;50 µM, which was much higher than the ones used in our in vitro assays (Supplementary Fig. 9e-h). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P27"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have shown that the CKK is a highly conserved globular protein module that interacts with an inter-protofilament site between two tubulin dimers on the outer surface of MTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that an optimal site for CKK binding deviates from the inter-protofilament interface within a regular, straight MT structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>First, the decoration by CKK distorts the normal MT lattice generating a right-handed protofilament skew. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Second, tubulin copolymerisation with CKK yields mainly non-MT, curved polymers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Third, the interaction between CKK and its binding site is intrinsically asymmetric, with the helical parts of CKK interacting more closely with the β-tubulin pairs, while its connectivity with the α-tubulin pair is less compact and could accommodate plasticity existing at minus ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Fourth, the N1492A mutation increases affinity and subtly alters the CKK position relative to the MT, resulting in a deeper insertion between the protofilaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The size and the chemical nature of the N1492 substituted side chain also affect CKK affinity for the MT lattice, suggesting that the optimal binding site for the wild type CKK domain might depend on specific but subtle conformational features of tubulin dimers at MT minus ends to allow a more buried fit between protofilaments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Fifth, high-resolution microscopy showed that the high-affinity CKK binding region is located, on average, two tubulin dimers behind the outmost MT end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This binding site fits very well with the average position of the transition zone between straight protofilaments in the MT shaft and mildly curved tubulin sheets identified at MT ends by cryo-electron tomography. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P28"><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>At this transition zone, pairs of α-tubulins would be more laterally flattened and more flexible than the more constrained lattice-like β-tubulin pairs (Fig. 7a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, our structures show that the lattice-bound CKK already has tight shape complementarity and a large contact surface with the β-tubulin pairs, whilst the α-tubulin pairs surround the CKK more loosely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Conversely, at the plus end, β-tubulin pairs are expected to acquire a more flattened and flexible arrangement than α-tubulins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This would disfavor the interaction of CKK with the plus end, explaining its inability to effectively compete with MCAK at this location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In summary, flattening of β-tubulin pairs at the plus end could squeeze CKK out of the tubulin groove to avoid steric clashes, whilst flattening of α-tubulin pairs at the minus end could tighten their multiple contacts around the CKK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>This leads to a binding preference for the minus end, some capacity to bind the straight MT lattice and low affinity for MT plus end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The lack of CKK binding at rapidly depolymerizing MT minus ends, where the lateral contacts between protofilaments are expected to be lost due to their strong curling, is consistent with the requirement for maintenance of lateral protofilament connectivity and/or more gentle longitudinal curvature for CAMSAP binding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P29"><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that although our analysis showed that CKK is the only CAMSAP part which can autonomously recognise MT minus ends, some longer CAMSAP fragments, such as CAMSAP1mini, had a higher affinity for the minus ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that CAMSAP regions outside of the CKK domain can contribute to the affinity and selectivity of the minus-end binding, and additional work will be needed to decipher the underlying mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P30"><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The MT minus-end binding mode of the CKK domain is distinct from those of other known MT tip-interacting proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The most conceptually simple mode of MT end recognition relies on the presence of unique epitopes of α- and β-tubulin exposed on the outermost MT ends, as is the case for the γ-TuRC at the minus end5, and which likely applies to the centriole protein CPAP at MT plus ends34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>However, the preference of most known MT regulators is based on recognition of certain MT lattice features that are different at MT ends compared to the MT shaft. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>For example, EB proteins bind at the corner of four tubulin dimers35, 36 and sense a GTP hydrolysis transition state of tubulin within the MT lattice at both plus- and minus ends37, 38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Doublecortin (DCX), which also binds at the corner of four tubulin dimers39, can also act as a MT end-binding protein and is thought to be sensitive to the extent of protofilament longitudinal curvature40, 41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>MT depolymerizing kinesin-13s can also accumulate at MT ends, likely due to preference for the more curved or flexible conformations of tubulin located outside the lattice42, 43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Importantly, none of these mechanisms is specific for the plus or the minus end. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P31"><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>CAMSAPs are similar to most other MT end-binding proteins in that they bind on the outer surface of MTs.: in contrast to γ-TuRC, which caps MTs, CAMSAP binding is compatible with further MT polymerization at the minus end18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>CAMSAPs and γ-TuRCs thus do not directly compete for binding to MT minus ends; however, the restricted, lattice-like conformation of tubulin at γ-TuRC-capped minus ends likely prevents formation of CAMSAP-preferred binding regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in contrast to EBs, CAMSAP-MT association is insensitive to the hydrolysis state of the tubulin-bound nucleotide. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>This accounts for the ability of CAMSAPs to recognize growing, GTP- as well as the GDP-bound minus ends generated by MT severing18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P32"><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>CAMSAP interaction with MT minus ends can be expected to have several consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>First, by preferentially binding between laterally connected but curved protofilaments, the CKK – in the context of the full length protein - might inhibit formation of a regular lattice, explaining why CAMSAPs slow down MT minus-end polymerization18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Second, CKK binding at intra-dimer binding sites can also explain protection of MT minus ends from kinesin-13 driven depolymerization by direct steric inhibition (Fig. 7b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P33"><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that the unique MT-binding mode of the CKK domains enables CAMSAPs to combine the ability to recognize MT minus ends with the preservation of dynamic properties of these ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>This allows CAMSAPs to be rapidly recruited to MT minus ends generated by release from the site of MT nucleation, severing or breakage, protect them against disassembly by depolymerases and, by decorating polymerizing minus ends, form stretches of stabilized MT lattice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Future studies will show whether there are other proteins sharing the CKK’s MT binding mode, or whether it is unique to this evolutionary ancient and widespread protein module. </plain></SENT>
