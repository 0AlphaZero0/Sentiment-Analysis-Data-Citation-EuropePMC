</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grain length is one of the determinants of yield in rice and auxin plays an important role in regulating it by mediating cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although several genes in the auxin pathway are involved in regulating grain length, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study we identify a RING-finger and wd40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) domain-containing protein, Gnp4/LAX2, with a hitherto unknown role in regulation of grain length by its influence on cell expansion. Gnp4/LAX2 is broadly expressed in the plant and subcellular localization analysis shows that it encodes a nuclear protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Gnp4/LAX2 can significantly increase grain length and thousand-kernel weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Gnp4/LAX2 physically interacts with OsIAA3 and consequently interferes with the OsIAA3–OsARF25 interaction in vitro and in vivo. OsIAA3 RNAi plants consistently exhibit longer grains, while the mutant osarf25 has small grains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, OsARF25 binds to the promoter of OsERF142/SMOS1, a regulator of organ size, and positively regulates its expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results reveal that Gnp4/LAX2 functions as a regulator of grain length through participation in the OsIAA3–OsARF25–OsERF142 pathway and that it has potential value for molecular breeding in rice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grain weight, grain number per panicle, and panicle number are major factors influencing yield in rice (Oryza sativa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Among them, grain weight is least affected by environmental factors (Sakamoto and Matsuoka, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, grain weight remains a complex quantitative trait that is affected by multiple genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Grain length, grain width, grain thickness, and grain filling rate are contributory factors that determine grain weight (Xing and Zhang, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies of each of these characters are essential for a complete understanding of their potential roles in yield improvement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>To date, many genes contributing to grain weight in rice have been isolated, such as GS3, GW5, GS5, GL3.1, GW7/GL7, GW8, GLW7, OsGRF4, Big Grain1, XIAO, SLG, OsLG3, and OsLG3b (Weng et al., 2008; Mao et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011b; Jiang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012, 2015; Zhang et al., 2012; Duan et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2016; Si et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017, 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>While they all ultimately affect cell expansion or proliferation, they can be classified into several groups according to the pathways involved, including the G-protein signaling pathway, the proteasomal degradation pathway, the transcriptional regulation-related pathway, and the plant hormone biosynthesis or signaling transduction pathways (Zuo and Li, 2014; Li and Li, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although these genes have been cloned and functionally characterized, knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms and genetic interaction networks remain elusive and fragmentary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Consequently, it is important to isolate novel grain size-associated regulators in order to understand the molecular mechanism behind grain weight in rice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The RING-finger and wd40-associated ubiquitin-like (RAWUL) domain is a new member of the ubiquitin superfamily and has been found in the same polypeptide chain as a the RING finger domain in the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) RING family, and in the same polypeptide domain as the WDR48-p80 protein family (Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, two families of RING-finger proteins have been characterized as RAWUL domain-containing proteins, namely AtRING1A/B and AtBMI1A/B/C (Xiao and Wagner, 2015), and play roles in developmental phase transitions, cell proliferation during organ growth, and water-stress responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about RAWUL domain-containing proteins in rice and other crop plants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Indole-3-acetic acid (auxin) plays an important role in growth and development of plants by regulating many biological processes (Gallavotti, 2013; Ljung, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms of auxin perception are relatively well understood in different plant species (Salehin et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The auxin signaling transduction pathway consists of four components, namely the auxin receptors, the AUX/IAA repressors, the auxin response factors (ARFs), and the downstream target genes (Salehin et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Signaling transduction is initiated by the perception of auxin by the TIR1/AFB receptors that encode F-box proteins and are components of an E3 SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>AUX/IAA co-receptors function as repressors of the pathway by directly binding to the ARF transcription factors, and together with the co-repressor protein TOPLESS they repress their activities (Szemenyei et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Auxin triggers the formation of the AUX/IAA-SCFTIR1/AFB co-receptor complex and the degradation of the AUX/IAA protein in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner, which in turns results in the de-repression of the ARFs and thus the transcriptional activation of their target genes (Salehin et al., 2015; Dezfulian et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There are 31 AUX/IAAs and 25 ARF protein genes in the rice genome (Jain et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To date, several rice AUX/IAAs have been associated with specific phenotypic effects, including root development, plant architecture, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. OsIAA3 (referred to as OsIAA31 by Jain et al., 2006) was the first functionally characterized AUX/IAAs protein in rice and its gain-of-function causes growth defects in leaf blades and crown roots (Nakamura et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Functional analysis of ARFs have been mainly based on studies of loss-of-function mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>For example, loss of function of OsARF16 and OsARF12 lead to iron-deficiency responses (Qi et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2013), while OsARF23-OsARF24 has been shown to promote cell growth and morphogenesis by regulating RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT (RMD) expression (Li et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These studies highlight many aspects of plant growth that are controlled by auxin-related pathways, but the underlying regulatory processes have only been identified in a few cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is still not clear how these AUX/IAA and ARF networks achieve target-specificity, and whether other factors or signaling proteins participate in this regulatory process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, a natural mutant with defective development of lateral spikelets on the secondary panicle branches and increased grain length was characterized and the candidate gene was designated as Gnp4 (Grain number per-panicle 4), which shares the LAX2 (LAX PANICLE2) locus (Tabuchi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Here, we report that Gnp4/LAX2 encodes a RAWUL domain-containing protein and has a hitherto unknown role in regulating grain length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Gnp4 functions as a regulator of grain length by participating in an OsAUX/IAA–OsARF25–OsERF142 pathway. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that Gnp4 functions as a regulator of grain size in rice, indicating that the Gnp4-L1 and Gnp4-L2 proteins may use different mechanisms to regulate plant growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Compared to Gnp4-L2, Gnp4-L1 proteins do not have a RING finger domain at the N terminus, which is required for the commonest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, suggesting that they lack this activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a PDZ (post-synaptic density protein PSD95, Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor Dlg1 and tight junction protein ZO-1) binding motif (KLGLEDSEV) has been found in the RAWUL domain of Gnp4 (Wardell, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>This motif usually functions as a regulator of protein–protein interactions or dimer formation (Fanning and Anderson, 1996; Short et al., 1998) (Fig.3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>We also found that 368 proteins in rice contained the core sequence ‘LGLE’ of the PDZ motif, including OsIAA3 (Supplementary Dataset S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Together, our results showed that Gnp4 forms a dimer and functions as a regulator of protein–protein interactions (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Gnp4 significantly increased the grain length and thousand-kernel weight of rice, indicating its potential value for breeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>However, we found that seed setting was decreased in Gnp4-overexpression plants (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>When we evaluated correlations of Gnp4 expression levels with seed setting and yield per plant in 17 japonica accessions, we found that accessions with 7–10-fold increases in Gnp4 expression levels relative to Nipponbare exhibited high yields, implying that there is an appropriate level of Gnp4 expression that might be required for yield improvement (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>Constitutive overexpression of CBP1 (CLUSTERED PRIMARY BRANCH 1) under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter has been shown to increase grain length but not yield per plant, a result of other unfavorable agronomic traits; however, optimized expression of CBP1 using a panicle-specific promoter did result in improved yield in rice (Wu et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>In a similar way, it would be interesting to test whether controlled expression of Gnp4 in specific tissues could be used to improve yields in rice. </plain></SENT>
