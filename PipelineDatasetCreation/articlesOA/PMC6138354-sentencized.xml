</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A hallmark pathological finding in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was the presence of plaques in the central nervous system that contained insoluble amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), resulting from proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) (Hardy &amp; Selkoe 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although a great deal is known about the regulation of APP expression in the central nervous system, less is known about the regulation of APP expression, processing, and function in peripheral tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In previous gene expression studies with GeneChip® microarrays, we have demonstrated that APP mRNA expression was higher in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)/adipocytes and preadipocytes from obese subjects (Lee et al. 2005; Nair et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>APP expression in adipocytes and SAT correlated with in vivo indices of insulin resistance, the expression of proinflammatory genes, and Aβ plasma levels (Lee et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that similar cellular mechanisms for production and effects of Aβ may exist between neuronal dysfunction in AD and adipose dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (Tharp et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In addition to these human studies, we have demonstrated that SAT APP mRNA expression levels were increased in diet-induced obese mice and correlated with indices of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance (Jeong et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>APP is alternatively spliced into several mRNA isoforms in a tissue-specific manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Each isoform can undergo processing to produce several peptide products in addition to Aβ, each with multiple possible functions (Ling et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The three major isoforms of APP (APP770, APP751, and APP695) are derived from alternative splicing that removes exon(s) 7 and/or 8; APP770 contains both, APP751 does not contain exon 8, and APP695 lacks exons 7 and 8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The APP751 and APP770 isoforms contain a 56-amino-acid Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain, whereas APP695 lacks this region (Zhao et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>APP695 has been described as the neuronally-predominant isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>APP770 is widely expressed in peripheral tissues, but minimally in CNS tissue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Several groups have documented variation in APP isoform expression in multiple regions of the brain affected by AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although APP695 is the abundant isoform in the human brain, KPI-containing APP (APP-KPI) mRNA levels correlated with Aβ levels and the ratio of APP-KPI protein levels to total APP protein increased in AD (Matsui et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Other data have also shown that the amount of APP-KPI increases in the brain of patients with AD and is related to amyloid fibril formation in AD (Barrachina et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that altered transcription of APP isoforms in AD is associated with Aβ peptides and contribute to Aβ deposition in AD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Relative quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) uses a standard curve in which unknown concentrations of RNA or cDNA are used as references for the curve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Since resulting values are arbitrary and unit-less, they can only be compared between samples for gene or isoform expression, but not for same-sample measurement of different genes or isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an absolute quantitative method was required for measuring transcript copy number for each APP isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Absolute quantitation was achieved by absolute quantitative real-time PCR (AQ-PCR), in which a standard curve was created for each gene, using known concentrations of reference cDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Once the exact transcript copy number of one isoform for one sample was obtained, it could then be compared to the copy number of another isoform in the same or another sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>By AQ-PCR in a previous human study, we developed a set of isoform-specific absolute quantitative standards that allow for the quantification of transcript copy numbers for human APP isoforms, and examined expression patterns in brain samples from 12 patients with AD and 10 control subjects (Tharp et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we developed a set of PCR primers to produce absolute quantitative standard curves for measuring the three major APP isoforms and GAPDH in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We also designed primers and probe sets for real-time PCR in conjunction with our isoform-specific standards to measure APP isoform transcript levels in mouse adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We measured transcript copy number for each APP isoform and analyzed whether the expression levels were altered by long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, and correlated these values with indices of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In this study, AQ-PCR was developed for measuring transcript copy numbers of three major APP isoforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>By using a standard curve sample in copy number/volume concentration for each APP isoform, the expression level of each of APP isoform in mouse SAT was quantified and normalized to that of GAPDH, and then presented as an absolute copy number per 1000 copies of GAPDH. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Although a great deal is known about neural APP and Aβ, APP is also widely expressed in peripheral tissues from skin, intestinal epithelia, and skeletal muscle, as well as leukocytes, platelets, pancreas, and adipose tissue (Joachim et al. 1989; Bush et al. 1990; Kuo et al. 2000; Hansel et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, the function and regulation of peripheral APP is not yet fully understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Several studies have demonstrated altered APP isoform ratios in platelets of AD patients and a correlation of platelet isoforms with the progression of clinical symptoms and severity of cognitive loss in AD patients, suggesting the possibility that abnormal APP processing in the brain may be reflected in the periphery, thus suggesting it could serve as a diagnostic marker (Bush &amp; Tanzi 1998; Di Luca et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Altered APP expression levels and aberrant processing was also observed in lymphoblastoid cells from subjects with familial AD, in parallel with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Matsumoto &amp; Fujiwara 1993). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>These data are similar to our previous observation that APP was increased in adipocytes/adipose tissue of obese individuals and mice and was correlated with gene expression profiles of proinflammatory cytokines (Lee et al. 2008; Jeong et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In the current study, using a refined method for absolute quantitative analysis of the three major APP isoforms, we found significantly increased expression for all of three major APP isoforms in SAT of HFD-induced obese mice compared to age-matched control mice fed a ND. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Expression levels of each isoform were correlated with adipokine expression and plasma levels of glucose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data suggest that peripheral changes in APP expression may be related to the progression of AD and inflammation and glucose metabolism in the periphery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Further examination of isoform expression showed increased expression of the neuronal type APP isoform (APP695) in SAT of older mice fed either a ND or HFD, resulting in a decreasing ratio of APP-KPI to APP695 with aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the ratio (APP-KPI/APP695) was the lowest in 77-week-old mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>As documented previously (Karambataki et al. 2014), APP alternative splicing can be influenced by both the aging process and/or environmental factors, such as a HFD or obesity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>By treating TZD to HFD-induced obese and insulin-resistant mice, we found that APP770 copy number was significantly decreased in SAT compared to control mice treated with vehicle only, whereas no differences were found in APP695 copy numbers between the two mice groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In addition, linear regression analysis showed that the ratios of transcript copy number of APP770 or APP-KPI to that of APP695 correlated with plasma glucose concentration, suggesting that altered ratios of APP isoforms were related to systemic glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that not only APP expression but also expression ratios of APP isoforms in peripheral tissues may be related to aging and glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the entire body and in the periphery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Enzyme secretases have been known to have important roles in APP processing to Aβ and in AD pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that secretases were expressed in adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Although most of secretase genes were not differentially expressed with obesity, those expression data imply that the adipocyte/adipose tissue is equipped with the requisite enzymatic machinery for processing APP to its pathogenic cleavage products, Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Lee et al. 2008; Tharp et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in this study, mRNA expression levels of β-secretase-1 (BACE1), a representative secretase, were measured by relative qPCR to see the effect of long-term HFD feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The results did not show a noteworthy feature and are consistent to our previous BACE1 expression data in human adipose tissue (supplemental Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The presence of cis-elements and the tissue-specific expression of trans-acting factors, such as the RNA-binding protein fork head box for APP (RBFox) (Alam et al. 2014), regulate overall alternative splicing patterns (Qian &amp; Liu 2014; Stilling et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>There is still little known about factors contributing to the alternative splicing of the APP gene in obesity and aging, and further research is needed to examine if RBFox proteins play a role in this process (Love et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that HFD feeding and obesity is likely to alter APP alternative splicing, which could be affected by trans-acting factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the mechanism of APP alternative splicing in adipose tissue with obesity and the exact role that alternative splicing events play in enhancing the production of Aβ could contribute to the development of new drug targets for preventing obese-related AD and other complications of obesity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study developed an absolute quantification method to measure absolute copy numbers of major APP isoforms, and demonstrated that APP isoforms were increased in mouse adipose tissue with obesity and the ratios of APP isoforms were altered with aging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In addition, isoform expressions were correlated with in vivo measures of glucose metabolism and a proinflammatory pattern of adipokine expression in adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that treatment of insulin sensitizer could reduce the increased expression of the APP770 isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study is the first to measure the absolute copy number of APP isoforms in adipose tissue by AQ-PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The method presented is simple, and accurately compares expression levels of each APP isoform from the same sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>It can be implemented in a standardized fashion, allowing APP isoform expression data to be compared between experiments and across studies conducted by independent research groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Understanding the biology and the potential importance of peripheral tissues of APP regulation and the expression of specific isoforms is critical to unraveling the pathology of APP-related abnormalities, such as AD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Finally, the relationship between adipose tissue expression of APP and Aβ peptides and risk for AD are not well known, and will require long-term studies to address. </plain></SENT>
