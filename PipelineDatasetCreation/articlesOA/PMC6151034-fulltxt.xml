Treatment strategies have evolved towards primary joint replacement, but the impact of different approaches remains a matter of debate. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the benefit of an anterior minimally-invasive (AMIS) compared to a lateral Hardinge (LAT) approach for hemiarthroplasty in these oftentimes frail patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Four hundred thirty-nine patients were screened during the 44-months trial, aiming at the evaluation of 150 patients &#x0003e;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;yrs. of age. Eligible patients were randomised using an online-tool with completely random assignment. As primary endpoint, early mobility, a predictor for long-term outcomes, was evaluated at 3&#x000a0;weeks via the &#x0201c;Timed up and go&#x0201d; test (TUG). Secondary endpoints included the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), pain, complications, one-year mobility and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">A total of 190 patients were randomised; both groups were comparable at baseline, with a predominance for frailty-associated factors in the AMIS-group. At 3&#x000a0;weeks, 146 patients were assessed for the primary outcome. There was a reduction in the median duration of TUG performance of 21.5% (CI [&#x02212;&#x02009;41.2,4.7], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.104) in the AMIS-arm (i.e., improved mobility). This reduction was more pronounced in patients with signs of frailty or cognitive impairment. FIM scores increased on average by 6.7 points (CI [0.5&#x02013;12.8], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.037), pain measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale decreased on average by 0.7 points (CI: [&#x02212;&#x02009;1.4,0.0], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.064). The requirement for blood transfusion was lower in the AMIS- group, the rate of complications comparable, with a higher rate of soft tissue complications in the LAT-group. The mortality was higher in the AMIS-group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">These results, similar to previous reports, support the concept that in elderly patients at risk of frailty, the AMIS approach for hemiarthroplasty can be beneficial, since early mobilisation and pain reduction potentially reduce deconditioning, morbidity and loss of independence. The results are, however, influenced by a plethora of factors. Only improvements in every aspect of the therapeutic chain can lead to optimisation of treatment and improve outcomes in this growing patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01408693">NCT01408693</ext-link> (registered August 3rd 2011).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12877-018-0898-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Femoral neck fracture</kwd><kwd>Orthogeriatrics</kwd><kwd>Gerontotraumatology</kwd><kwd>Fracture hemiarthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Minimal invasive hemiarthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Trauma surgery in geriatric patients</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial in the elderly</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par24">Femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are typically associated with old age and represent a major cause of morbidity, functional dependence and socio-economic burden. These fractures also represent a sign of frailty, associated with a one-year mortality of approximately 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] The affected patient population is very heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with pre-fracture characteristics like age, the number of independent activities of daily living (ADLs) or the presence of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] being prognostic factors for long-term outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The treatment of FNFs is a matter of debate and varies with age, fracture pattern and general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For elderly patients with FNFs, conservative treatment and osteosynthesis have mostly been abandoned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. At our institution, many elderly patients are treated with cemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] hemiarthroplasty (HA) due to better short-term results, avoidance of suffering, efficient restoration of functional capacities and preservation of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the institutional treatment algorithm).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Institutional treatment algorithm for femoral neck fractures.

The lateral transgluteal Hardinge (LAT) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] has been one of the standard approaches for joint replacement of the hip for decades. In the twenty-first century, the anterior minimally invasive Hueter (AMIS) approach regained popularity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This approach allows a muscle-sparing access to the hip joint using an inter-muscular and inter-nervous plane, while the transgluteal approach necessitates the transection of muscular tissue. The rationale for using the AMIS approach is a potential reduction of soft tissue damage, blood loss and postoperative pain, as well as an acceleration of postoperative mobilisation, with a consecutive reduction of length of stay (LOS) and duration of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] compared to other approaches.</p><p id="Par27">Despite several publications, there is no consensus on the optimal approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, the reported data after THA have typically been derived from a younger and healthier population of patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The &#x0201c;Timed up and go&#x0201d; test (TUG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] at 3&#x000a0;weeks was chosen as the primary endpoint due to its prognostic value for long-term mobility and independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A reduction of 20% in the TUG duration was assumed to be clinically relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Depending on their cognitive abilities (quantified using a mental status questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], MSQ), they were individually or in the presence of a designated proxy informed about the diagnosis, the proposed treatment and the randomised trial. The surgeon on call included patients only if they consented in writing or &#x02013; in case of relevant cognitive impairment &#x02013; gave their verbal assent with written consent by a designated proxy according to Swiss civil code (Art. 378) or a legal guardian. The trial was approved by the ethics committee (Ethikkommission beider Basel) EKBB Reference No. 68/11) and followed good clinical practice, as well as the Declaration of Helsinki. The trial has been registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>, and the complete protocol is available as additional files.</p><p id="Par31">After consent to surgery and trial participation, the surgeon on call randomised the patients using a web-based randomisation tool (randomizer.at) with the &#x0201c;Completely At Random&#x0201d; option. The randomised treatment was delivered as soon as possible (i.e., 31% of patients underwent operation on the day of randomisation, 48% the next day, and only 2% of the patients had to wait 2 or more days for surgery, including those waiting for medical reasons like oral anticoagulation, etc).</p><p id="Par32">At baseline, the following patient characteristics were recorded: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), residential status, use of a walking aid, diagnosis of dementia, number of medications (substances), Charlson Comorbidity Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Additionally, standard laboratory parameters were recorded. The pre-fracture Functional Independence Measure (pfFIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] status was assessed retrospectively.</p><p id="Par33">Surgery was performed after standard perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Both groups were operated on using a cemented AMIS&#x000a9; stem (Medacta International, Castel San Pietro, Switzerland) and a monopolar head (Mathys AG, Bettlach, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (including the use of monopolar heads by another manufacturer, since initially monopolar heads were not available in the shaft manufacturer&#x02019;s product range) and our standard operating procedures.</p><p id="Par34">For the LAT approach, an incision of 8&#x02013;14&#x000a0;cm is centred on the trochanter major to expose the fascia latae. After splitting this structure, the vasto-gluteal sling is exposed (the complex of the gluteus medius muscle proximally, the trochanter major and the vastus lateralis muscle distally). For the preparation of the capsule, the muscles are split in line with their fibres in the anterior third of the muscular body forming a musculo-tendineous flap.</p><p id="Par35">For the AMIS approach, a 7- to 10-cm incision is made 2&#x000a0;cm latero-distally to the antero-superior iliac spine towards the fibular head. The interval between the sartorius muscle medially and the tensor fascia latae laterally is developed. The capsule is exposed between the rectus femoris muscle medially and the vastus intermedius muscle laterally.</p><p id="Par36">All patients underwent the same postoperative aftercare with thrombo-embolic prophylaxis as well as mobilisation with full weight bearing under physiotherapeutic guidance from day one, using standard analgesia. As part of orthogeriatric care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], patients were followed-up and treated for osteoporosis, fall prophylaxis, malnutrition and delirium. The latter was assessed by the nursing staff using a modified Delirium Observation Screening scale (DOS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and &#x02013; in case of pathology &#x02013; the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Intraoperative data, such as the duration of surgery or intraoperative blood loss, were recorded. The latter was assessed via the number of erythrocyte concentrates ordered perioperatively up to 72&#x000a0;h post-surgery. Perioperative in-hospital complications were assessed as secondary outcome variables using the Clavien-Dindo classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] to differentiate general and surgery-related complications. After hospitalisation, only the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAE), surgery-related complications and implant-related infections were recorded. LOS was documented, as was the discharge destination (in-patient rehabilitation, nursing home, etc.). After discharge, follow-up was scheduled for 3 (only functional assessment), 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks and one year postoperatively for clinical examination, functional assessment and X-rays as per the institutional standard.</p><p id="Par38">The first assessment of functional recovery was performed in-hospital on day 5. At every follow-up TUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and pain scores were recorded by an independent study nurse blinded to the treatment allocation. TUG is an assessment of physical mobility validated in elderly patients with high discriminative potential at early time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and a predictive value for the long-term functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The test measures the time needed by an individual to get up from a chair (seat height 45&#x000a0;cm, arm height 65&#x000a0;cm), walk a distance of 3&#x000a0;m with habitual shoes and a walking aid, and sit down again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The FIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] is an assessment of ADL that evaluates 13 motor and 5 cognitive faculties. Pain was assessed using a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS).</p><p id="Par39">The literature describes unfavourable outcomes in patients affected by frailty. The definition of frailty remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Frailty often is described as a multidimensional dynamic state of increased vulnerability and loss of resistance to external stressors, resulting in an increased risk of adverse outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The protocol envisaged a subgroup analysis based on the MSQ scores as a surrogate marker for frailty. This was complemented by visualising treatment effects in dependence on pfFIM status, given the inverse relationship between the baseline FIM and frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">At the time of submission, the authors became aware of a publication by Arjunan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which described a frailty index based on the FIM, medication count and comorbidities, aspects that had all been assessed during the present trial. Therefore, an additional post hoc subgroup analysis based on the described frailty index was performed. The computation of this frailty index is outlined in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par41">The sample size calculation used the original description of the test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to obtain information on the distribution to be expected for the primary outcome. This resulted in a sample size of 150 patients to be included in the analysis in order to demonstrate a percentage difference in medians of 20% (corresponding to 6&#x000a0;s) with 80% power. Assuming a drop-out rate of 20% after experience from trials in the same patient population, an inclusion of 190 patients was planned. A recent investigation on the minimum clinical important difference (MCID) of the TUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] identified an MCID of 6&#x000a0;s when using quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D as an anchor and the minimum detectable change approach, and even smaller differences when using other anchors and approaches.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par42">The distribution of continuous variables is described by mean/SD or selected percentiles as appropriate. The distribution of ordinal and binary variables is described by absolute and relative frequencies. The significance of differences between the groups was assessed with the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous and ordinal variables and with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for binary variables.</p><p id="Par43">The outcome &#x0201c;duration of TUG performance&#x0201d; was compared between the two treatment arms using a regression model for the log-transformed values with adjustment for pfFIM status and age, allowing us to estimate a percentage difference in medians (details are given in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S1). Other continuous outcomes including VAS scores were analysed with a linear regression model, such that effects (delta) correspond to mean differences. Binary outcomes were analysed with a generalised linear model with log link and binomial outcome distribution reporting effects as relative risks. The one-year mortality is presented as percentages derived from a Kaplan-Meier-estimate, but effects are described as hazard ratios based on a Cox regression model. Treatment arms were defined according to randomisation, and adjustments were performed using the same covariates as in analysing the primary endpoint. The distribution of continuous outcomes was visualised in relation to treatment arm and pre-fracture FIM status by scatter plots mimicking the adjustment for this factor in the analyses. Boxplots were used in subgroup analyses, and the distribution of ordinal outcomes was visualised by pie charts.</p><p id="Par44">Patients who declined to perform the TUG were excluded from the analysis; those who could not start or failed to complete the test were included in the analysis with a value of 300&#x000a0;s, which lies distinctly above the maximally observed value. To increase the rate of follow-up, patients who declined follow-up at our institution were offered an assessment at their location of residence.</p><p id="Par45">TUG at 3&#x000a0;weeks postoperation was defined as the primary outcome in the protocol, with a list of secondary outcomes like LOS, intraoperative aspects, the performance of activities of daily living (FIM), mortality, etc. We added pain, implant-related infections and the return to pre-fracture ambulatory status (with or without a walking aid) after 3 and 12&#x000a0;months. The protocol furthermore suggested a subgroup analysis within the patient groups defined by MSQ scores &#x02264;7 and MSQ scores &#x02265;8 corresponding to abnormal vs normal values, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">All computations were performed using Stata 14.2 (StataCorp. 2015.

Five patients in the LAT-arm developed an implant-related infection. Seven patients from the AMIS-arm had implant-related infections. All of these cases were associated with soft tissue complications like haematoma or wound healing disturbance. In the AMIS-arm, no other patients with soft tissue complications were noted. All infections were diagnosed during the first 6 postoperative weeks. Treatment followed standard practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Severe complications during hospitalisation were more frequent in the AMIS-arm, but considering complications related to surgery, no difference was observed, with 35% of LAT and 39% of AMIS patients suffering no surgery-related complications. Low-grade complications treatable with common medications, like antiemetics, analgesics, etc., were experienced by 52% and 47% of patients, respectively. Six percent of patients from each group needed transfusions or antibiotics, while 7% from the LAT-arm and 8% from the AMIS-arm needed surgical treatment for surgery-associated complications, mainly infection.

This corresponds to the results after THA, both considering the perceived benefit as well as the persistent lack of scientific evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The dominance of differences at early time points between AMIS and traditional approaches might have a more significant impact in elderly patients with potentially reduced physical reserve because, unlike after THA, differences persisted over the first postoperative year in the population in our dataset. Renken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported similar results after HA for FNFs in 60 randomised elderly patients with better mobility and functioning in ADL at early time points after an AMIS approach compared to a Watson Jones approach, while other authors did not find differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and concluded that there is an influence of surgeon proficiency, rather than the actual approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">We observed a persistent influence of the treatment on function and ADL. This effect decreased over time, but this may be due to ceiling/floor effects, as many patients reach normal values for TUG performance or FIM scores. It might be assumed that the rather early occurrence and &#x02013; in our dataset &#x02013; persistence of outcome differences was related to the impact of hardly reversible perioperative deconditioning due to persistent pain or immobilisation, which has been associated with the traditional approaches. This tendency could also be an explanation for the more pronounced benefit of AMIS in patients with a higher risk of frailty, i.e. more frailty associated characteristics and potentially less reserve, to compensate for postoperative muscular hypotrophy.</p><p id="Par68">This association points towards a methodological dilemma and might explain the current lack of high-level evidence for the superiority of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of FNFs. There are few recently published RCTs analysing the benefit of minimally invasive surgery in patients with FNFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The analysed patient populations tend to be relatively small, and most trials exclude cognitively impaired patients, who make up a large proportion of the affected elderly population. The heterogeneity of the population in principle complicates the generation of valid generalisable data.</p><p id="Par69">In addition, the aspects of old age and cognitive impairment present a conceptual difficulty in RCTs. Cognitively impaired patients or patients diagnosed with dementia are typically excluded from interventional trials given the complexity of legitimate inclusion as well as the potential difficulty of meaningful data acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In our institution, approximately one-third of patients presenting with an FNF suffer from dementia. The rate of more subtle cognitive impairment is significantly higher. In these patients, an early return to their previous residential status and function is especially important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Our data show a strong correlation between surrogate markers for frailty like FIM and MSQ as measure of cognitive impairment. There is also a marked correlation with the calculated frailty index comprising FIM, medication and comorbidities that has been reported as predictor of mortality, 30-day residence and length of inpatient stay. All of these measures predicted a benefit of AMIS over LAT as an approach for HA, which was specifically pronounced in patients with MSQ scores &#x02264;7, i.e., in the presence of cognitive impairment.</p><p id="Par70">In a literature review on minimally invasive THA, Jung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] reported consistently lower levels of pain and use of analgesics. The same effect has been documented after HA for FNFs in retrospective and prospective analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and this effect was also present in our data set, with patients in the AMIS-arm on average suffering lower levels of pain. However, the effect did not reach significance, unlike in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and must be interpreted with caution since the agreement between formal ratings and verbal expressions of pain or discomfort seems to decrease with advancing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and the reliability with cognitive impairment might be additionally limited.</p><p id="Par71">Another aspect reported as an advantage after minimally invasive surgery is lower blood loss. We documented intraoperative blood loss as well as haemoglobin levels at different postoperative time points. We found, however, that these parameters were not reliable (or consistent) in our data set due to lack of standardised documentation of the intraoperative blood loss and individualised fluid management, as reported by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As a surrogate marker, the need for transfusion was evaluated, which is handled uniformly at our institution. We observed a higher need for transfusion within the first 72&#x000a0;h for patients treated with LAT compared to patients after AMIS as reported after HA via the AMIS approach. This is an important aspect in a comorbid patient population, since patients are not only at high risk of fluid overload and cardiac complications as a consequence of blood transfusion but also at a high risk of complications from anaemia such as delirium, fatigue and prolonged immobilisation. The above-mentioned RCTs on the subject report conflicting results in this aspect.</p><p id="Par72">We should finally note that we observed a non-significant increase in mortality under AMIS, corresponding to 8 more deaths in 100 patients, without being able to give a clear explanation for the result. Further investigations in larger populations are necessary to clarify the question of a true difference in mortality.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p id="Par73">The strength of the current trial is its RCT design with a relatively high number of patients, including patients with cognitive deficits, which reduces the potential for selection bias. The early assessment of TUG as a functional parameter for the primary outcome makes the current results predictive for performance in ADLs and for preservation of independence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which are highly patient-relevant endpoints. However, we did not include instruments sensitive enough to catch such long-term differences. An additional strength is the large number of participating surgeons and their allocation by independent administrative procedures, resulting in a highly balanced allocation and avoiding a bias in treatment effect estimation due to experience-based selection of surgeons. A uniform level of surgical quality could be ascertained by the presence of a senior expert.</p><p id="Par74">We included in the analysis of the primary outcome 144 patients, nearly reaching the intended sample size of 150 as planned by the power analysis. We also observed a difference in median duration of TUG performance of 6&#x000a0;s (LAT: 41&#x000a0;s, AMIS: 35&#x000a0;s), corresponding to the assumed effect in the sample size calculation and hitting the MCID reported for the TUG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The failure to reach significance may be due to our decision to include in the analysis patients who failed to perform the TUG successfully with a duration of 300&#x000a0;s, which is in contrast to other studies ignoring these patients. In this way, we reduced the potential for bias, but we also increased the variability and hence reduced the power. Indeed, exclusion of these patients leads to a smaller treatment effect estimate of &#x02212;&#x02009;16.8%, with a smaller <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.089.</p><p id="Par75">The current trial is limited by the high rate of screening failures, which is typical in prospective RCTs in elderly patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, a certain loss to follow-up and failure to perform the TUG is problematic. However, sensitivity analyses suggest that the main findings are robust against different ways of handling missing values. The patient numbers in the two treatment arms show a distinct &#x02013; but insignificant &#x02013; difference, reflecting the lack of block randomisation. We also have to note that the FIM is constructed as an observational tool for nursing home staff with close contact to patients, but it was used in our trial by study nurses relying on patient or proxy narratives. We did not perform a specific assessment of the pre-fracture frailty in this trial, and hence we were forced to use surrogate measures to investigate a dependence of the treatment effect on frailty.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par76">FNFs in elderly patients are frequent, and given demographic developments, their socio-economic impact will increase in coming decades. Every step contributing to a better outcome in these patients is beneficial for the individual patient and for society. In this regard, the present trial &#x02013; despite failing to reach a significant difference in the primary outcome &#x02013; adds to a growing body of evidence. These results support the implementation of a specifically designed treatment regimen for fragility fractures, taking into account the complexity of the heterogeneous patient population known as &#x0201c;the elderly&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>
