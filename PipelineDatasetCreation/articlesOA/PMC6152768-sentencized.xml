</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Human peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) regulates cellular homeostasis by catalyzing cis-trans isomerization, specifically to a phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline (pS/pT-P) motif in signaling proteins [1,2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pin1 is a conformational modifier that switches the functions and the fates of pS/pT-P motif-containing proteins that play diverse cellular processes, including the cell cycle and cell growth [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pin1 dysfunction is linked to an increasing number of human diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease [5,6,7,8,9,10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pin1 consists of two domains: a N-terminal phosphor-peptide binding domain (WW domain) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (PPIase domain) (Figure 1A) [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pin1 functions rely on interdomain communication; an isolated PPIase domain construct retains isomerase activity comparable to or greater than that of full-length Pin1, but full-length Pin1 shows different substrate binding affinity and isomerase activity [12,13,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In particular, cells require full-length Pin1 for viability even though the isolated PPIase domain maintains significant isomerase activity [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Interdomain communication between the domains in Pin1 is, therefore, functionally essential in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that physical contact of the WW domain to the PPIase domain changes the conformational dynamics in the catalytic site distant from the contact interface and this change in dynamics modulates enzyme activity (Figure 1A) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on the observation, the function of Pin1 is proposed to be controlled by ‘dynamic allostery’ induced by the interdomain contact, where an allosteric effect occurs through a change in structural dynamics without conformational changes to the catalytic site [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Crystal structures of Pin1 show that the WW and the PPIase domains contact at specific sites, which include residues H27-I28-T29 (“HIT-loop”) in the WW domain and residues in α4 and β3 of the PPIase domain (Figure 1A) [11,20,21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments demonstrated that the same interdomain contact occurs transiently in solution [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Substrate binding to the WW domain changes the interdomain contact: some substrates strengthen the contact, whereas others diminish it to alter interdomain mobility in a substrate-dependent manner [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Change in the interdomain contact by substrate binding to the WW domain is functionally relevant [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Weakening the interdomain contact by mutation changes substrate binding affinity and isomerase activity, and also alters the conformational flexibility of the PPIase catalytic loop (residues 65–80) distal from the contact site (Figure 1A), which suggests that functional dynamic allostery arises through the interdomain contact [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The interdomain communication tunes the mode of dynamic allostery according to the substrate chemical structure [24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Peng and coworkers showed that substrate binding to the WW domain suppresses the side chain flexibility in the sub-nanosecond time scale along a ‘conduit’ (Figure 1B) consisting of the conserved hydrophobic residues in the PPIase domain (Figure 1C) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The conformational dynamics change along the conduit is shown to be stereospecific; cis- and trans-locked substrates cause different conduit responses [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This observation consolidates the concept for the functional linkage between the interdomain contact and the conformational dynamics in the catalytic site of the PPIase domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrated that three catalytic loops in the PPIase domain rigidify to stay in the closed form upon contact with the WW domain, which may explain the enhanced ligand affinity [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The simulation results advanced atomic insights into how dynamic allostery affects the catalytic site in the PPIase domain, which is composed of residues in a hydrogen bonding network, connecting residues C113–H59–H157–T152, and the basic triad (K63, R68 and R69) engaged in capturing the phosphor-moiety in the substrate [11,13,27] (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the simulation showed that the conformational dynamics of Pin1 significantly depend on the chemical structure of the substrate bound to the WW domain as found in the above NMR experiments, but the results could not clearly describe how the changes modulate function [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The discussion of the entropy gain associated with reduced conformational dynamics and the selection of a conformation of the catalytic loops among the pre-organized forms seems reasonable but remains qualitative [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, more atomic details concerning how dynamic allostery modulates the catalytic action of Pin1 are required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Pin1 is phosphorylated at S138 by mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) (Figure 1B) [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation of S138 increases isomerase activity [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation mimicking mutant S138E showed a fourfold increase in catalytic activity relative to that of the wild-type Pin1, whereas the S138A mutant diminished this activity by about two-fold [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>As seen from the structure of the PPIase domain, S138 locates beneath α4 in the interdomain interface (Figure 1B) [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The observed catalytic changes caused by altering the residue type at S138 prompted us to think that the mutations to S138 may mimic the allosteric impact to the catalytic site as that by the interdomain contact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In other words, structural characterization of the S138 mutant could aid our understanding of the dynamic allostery occurring in the catalytic domain in Pin1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In an effort to understand the allosteric functional changes caused by S138, we initiated a structural characterization of the isolated S138A PPIase domain of Pin1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The S138A mutant showed enhanced motion for residues W73–Q75 in the catalytic loop, whilst rigidified the α2-α3 region that contacts W73 (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The reduced dynamics in the α2-α3 region stabilized the hydrogen-bonding between C113 and H59 over the corresponding bond in the wild-type, which was evidenced by the reduced H/D exchange rate for the imidazole 1H at Nε2 in H59. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The isomerization is thought to start by disrupting the hydrogen bond between C113–H59, the stabilized hydrogen bonding at the site explains the reduced isomerization rate of the S138A mutant PPIase domain [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This work provides substantial details at the atomic level of the dynamic allostery that couples the interdomain interfacial site and the catalytic site, which complements previous studies exploring the roles of the interdomain contact to accomplish the elaborate interdomain communication present in Pin1 [17]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This loop faces toward residue S138 in α4 (Figure S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Thus, the changes in the β2-α4 loop are readily ascribed to the different side chain moiety at residue 138 of the mutant. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The thermal denaturation temperature for the S138A mutant increased by 6.4 °C relative to the wild-type (Table 1), as monitored by the change in CD molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The H/D exchange experiments demonstrated that residues near the mutation site, including S126, G128, D136 and A140, had reduced H/D exchange rates when compared to the corresponding values in the wild-type, implying that residues in the mutant were more buried and thus more protected from solvent exchange (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The structural change of the β2-α4 loop explains the change in the H/D exchange rates (Figure S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Mutation of S138 to alanine loses one oxygen atom to make the residue less bulky with an increase in hydrophobicity, which should facilitate side chains of the neighboring residues of A138 to pack more tightly thereby reducing solvent exchange. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The results in Figure 2B show clearly that the S138A mutation significantly rearranges the contacts among the residues near the interdomain interfacial part in the PPIase domain (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Besides the residues spatially neighboring to S138, T81 in α1 also significantly reduced H/D exchange rate; which residue is allosterically changed to be buried (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>It is intriguing to note that most residues reduced their H/D exchange rates in the S138A mutant relative to the wild-type (Figure 2B): the residues may help to thermally stabilize the S138A mutant (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>We determined the substrate binding affinities for the wild-type and the S138A mutant with phosphor-peptide Cdc25C (EQPLpTPVTDL, where pT represents a phosphorylated threonine) using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>In calculating the KD, the stoichiometry was fixed to 1.0 because of the limited affinities to the substrate: the site numbers (n) recalculated with the ΔH and ΔS values gained by the above fitting procedure were n = 1.000 ± 0.001 (wild) and n = 1.021 ± 0.036 (S138A), respectively [31,32]. KD values for the wild-type and the S138A mutant were 1.81 ± 0.29 mM and 1.22 ± 0.88 mM, respectively (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The isomerization rates were directly determined by NMR with Exchange Spectroscopy (EXSY) experiments for the S138A mutant using Cdc25C as the substrate (Figure 3) [13,23,33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The isomerization rates for the S138A mutant are compared with the values for the wild-type and other mutants in Table 1 [13,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Despite the less significant difference in the substrate binding affinities between the proteins, the S138A mutant had reduced isomerization rates by ~20% in the net exchange rate kEX (kEX = kCT + kTC). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The S138A mutant retains the same catalytic site structure as the wild-type protein (Figure S1A), which is also supported by the marginal chemical shift changes to key residues in the basic triad (K63, R68 and R69) and the hydrogen-bonding network (C113–H59–H157–T152) (Figure S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>This observation differs from the result on the C113D mutant PPIase domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Here, the C113D mutant altered the catalytic β1-α1 loop structure to have shown the reduced affinity towards the substrate and the diminished isomerization rates (Table 1) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Since no clear structural changes to the catalytic site of the S138A mutant were observed and thus the mutant retained the comparable substrate binding ability to the wild-type, as evident in the ITC experiments, the moderate reduction in its isomerization activity should be ascribed to the change in the structure dynamics in the catalytic site. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>In this report, the functional role of dynamic allostery in the PPIase domain of Pin1 was examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The S138A mutation rearranged residue-residue contacts near the mutation site, which changed the conformational dynamics of the catalytic β1-α2 and α2-α3 loops that are both distal from the mutation site (Figure 9A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Despite the significant change in the dynamics of the catalytic loops, their structures remained unchanged, indicative of dynamic allostery at play [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The S138A mutation facilitated dynamic allostery in the PPIase domain in a similar way as envisaged by the interdomain contact in the full-length Pin1 [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Thus, the S138A mutation mimics the interdomain contact by replacing the link between the catalytic site and the interdomain contact interface where S138 functions in a dynamic allosteric manner, as found in the full-length Pin1 [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The S138A mutation caused the α2-α3 loop to be more rigid than the wild-type domain to stabilize the hydrogen bond between C113 and H59 in the hydrogen bond network (Figure 9B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Protonation of the thiolate of C113 initiates substrate isomerization bound to the catalytic site in the PPIase domain [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Stabilization of the hydrogen bond formed between the thiolate Sγ in C113 and the Nε2 in H59 (Figure 9B), therefore, retards the isomerization process; the S138A mutation reduced the isomerization rate by ~20% when compared with that of the wild-type PPIase domain (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In summary, using the S138A mutant, we revealed that dynamic allostery affects the catalytic reaction through rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network within the catalytic site (Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Previous research has shown that the interdomain contact reduces the conformation dynamics of the PPIase domain by dynamic allostery between the interdomain interface and the catalytic site [17,26,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Based on previous observations, researchers have proposed that the reduced conformation dynamics in the catalytic site compensates for the entropy cost upon substrate binding to the PPIase domain and thus improves isomerization activity [17,26,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Our results provide further data that describe how the dynamic allostery mechanism affects the reaction steps to isomerize the Pro peptide bond in the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Although the S138A mutant caused functionally negative dynamic allostery, the mechanism presented in this work will advance our understanding of how the interdomain contact uses dynamic allostery to enhance the catalytic activity of Pin1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In this sense, it is intriguing to note that S138E mutation destabilized the PPIase domain structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>This observation may suggest that positive dynamic allostery may destabilize the hydrogen bonding network, especially at the bond formed at C113–H59, to facilitate the rearrangement in the hydrogen bonds in the network (Figure 9B). </plain></SENT>
