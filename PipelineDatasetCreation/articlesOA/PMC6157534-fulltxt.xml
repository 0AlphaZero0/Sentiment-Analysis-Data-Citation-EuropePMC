There remains a knowledge gap regarding the optimal resuscitation fluid to improve clinical outcomes, and the underlying mechanism by which fluids exert their effect. Shock-induced endotheliopathy (SHINE) is thought to be a shared pathophysiologic mechanism associated with worsened outcomes in critically ill trauma and sepsis patients. SHINE is characterized by breakdown of the glycocalyx&#x02014;a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins that covers the endothelium. This has been associated with capillary leakage and microvascular thrombosis, organ dysfunction, and mortality. Biomarkers of SHINE have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock. Interventions to mitigate SHINE may improve outcomes in patients with septic shock. In surgical/trauma patients with septic shock, initial plasma resuscitation as compared with balanced crystalloid (BC) resuscitation will mitigate biomarkers of SHINE and improve clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A pilot, single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare initial plasma to BC resuscitation in surgical and trauma patients with septic shock. Patients will be enrolled based on a Sepsis Screening Score of &#x02265;4 with a suspected source of infection. Patient randomization only occurs if they meet the criteria: (1) hypotension with mean arterial pressure &#x0003c;65&#x02009;mm Hg, and (2) evidence of hypoperfusion including lactic acid &#x0003e;4&#x02009;mmol/L, altered mental status or decreased urine output of &#x0003c;0.5&#x02009;mL/kg in the past hour.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary outcome is a reduction in serum biomarkers at 6&#x02009;hours.

Although implementation of the evidence-based Surviving Sepsis Guidelines has resulted in improvement in sepsis-related deaths, in-hospital mortality continues to range from 12% to 40%, with an estimated 5.3 million global deaths annually,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and an estimated healthcare cost of US$14 to $24 billion per year in the USA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Septic shock survivors often suffer from diminished cognitive function, psychological problems, increased malignancy risk, increased hospitalization rates and long-term damage to organ systems.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The guidelines provide strong recommendations for initial resuscitation with crystalloids&#x02014;30 mL/kg within the first 3 hours.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the guidelines state that there is &#x02018;little available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) to support its practice; this is an area in which research is urgently needed.&#x02019;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, balanced crystalloids (BC) appear to be safer than normal saline, and albumin yields similar outcomes as crystalloids, thus the optimal fluid type is unknown.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>Shock-induced endotheliopathy (SHINE) has been proposed as a mechanism associated with worsened outcomes in patients with critical illness including sepsis.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Activation of the sympathoadrenal system and release of catecholamines (ie, sepsis or trauma) leads to glycocalyx injury. The glycocalyx consists of a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins that covers the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> This is associated with capillary leakage and microvascular thrombosis, ultimately resulting in organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Research suggests that endotheliopathy is both a marker and driver of worsened outcome.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interventions to prevent, mitigate or treat SHINE may improve outcomes in patients with shock. SHINE biomarkers, such as syndecan-1,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFLT-1),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual model of how septic shock leads to sympathoadrenal activation, inflammation and ischemia, which affects the endothelial glycocalyx, endothelial permeability and hemostatic balance, resulting in edema and microcirculatory disturbances that cause organ dysfunction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="tsaco-2018-000220f01"/></fig><p>Resuscitation of patients with shock using plasma shows promise as a novel resuscitative strategy. Specifically, plasma may improve outcomes by modulating SHINE as measured by biomarkers of glycocalyx damage (ie, syndecan-1)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and endothelial injury (ie, sFLT-1, sTM).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 11</xref> Resuscitation with plasma as the primary volume expander in trauma patients has been associated with a reduction in serum biomarkers of endotheliopathy,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> improved survival and decreased morbidity associated with inflammatory and edema-related complications such as acute lung injury and abdominal compartment syndrome.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</p><p>We hypothesize that among surgical patients with septic shock, initial resuscitation with plasma versus BCs will attenuate rise in serum biomarkers of endotheliopathy, improve patient outcomes (such as decreased number of intensive care unit (ICU)-free days, decreased morbidity associated with end-organ damage) and reduce in-hospital all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The trial is a pilot, efficacy, single-center RCT comparing initial plasma with BC resuscitation in surgical patients with septic shock.

Biomarkers will be drawn at 0 and 2 hours at study fluid administration completion, 6, 12 and 24 hours to evaluate their trend in response to plasma versus crystalloid resuscitation. Lactic acid will be drawn per standard of care to guide resuscitation. Standard labs for patients with critical illness will be obtained per ICU protocol.</p><p>Secondary outcomes include additional volume of fluid required for resuscitation after initial bolus of study fluid within the first 24 hours of resuscitation, time on vasopressors, time until lactate normalization, ventilator days, ICU-free days and hospital length of stay. Organ dysfunction will be measured including acute lung injury and acute renal failure. Standardized definitions will be used as outlined in the method of operation used in previously conducted trials by our group.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Potential harms of plasma administration will be assessed. Risk/safety evaluation will be performed at half recruitment by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board, which consists of a general surgeon, pulmonary critical care physician and a statistician. The trial will be terminated early if a series of adverse events attributable to plasma transfusions were to occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis plan</title><p>We will enroll 26 patients to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effect. We chose 26 patients based on the annual average number of patients with septic shock treated in the STICU assuming a 75% enrollment and randomization rate, and the goal of completing enrollment in 1 year. We will calculate estimates of treatment effect and 95% CIs for all measures. We will perform both a per-protocol and an intention-to-treat analysis, and employ both frequentist and Bayesian methods. For the primary outcome and all continuous outcomes, we will use mixed models that include group and time period as covariates with a random subject effect. We will report group differences and 95% CIs from these models. For binary outcomes, a log binomial will be used to estimate relative risks and 95% CIs. HRs and 95% CIs will be reported for time-to-event comparisons. For the Bayesian analysis, neutral conservative priors will be used to estimate the probability of both benefits and harms, as defined by our primary and secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although there is biological rationale to support a restorative effect of plasma on the vascular endothelium and on SHINE, there have been no randomized trials in humans to date comparing plasma with BC in fluid resuscitation for septic shock. This pilot trial will be the first to test the hypothesis that plasma can modulate SHINE, as evidenced by a decrease in biomarkers of glycocalyx breakdown and endothelial injury, and improve outcomes in trauma and surgical patients with septic shock. Although the trial is underpowered to identify a reduction in mortality, it will provide the least biased estimate of treatment effect on which to plan further multicenter trials. Furthermore, this study will provide insights regarding the mechanism by which fluids can influence outcomes in septic shock.</p><p>Animal models of sepsis and a prospective substudy of an RCT have shown that resuscitation with plasma is associated with decreased levels of syndecan-1, which may reflect restoration of endothelial integrity.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> Plasma resuscitation in a rat model of sepsis demonstrated attenuation of inflammatory markers (IL-6), endothelial injury biomarkers (syndecan-1) and catecholamines (norepinephrine); significantly reduced pulmonary edema as measured by wet-to-dry weight ratios; and improved 48 hours of survival as compared with normal saline.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although the results of plasma resuscitation in animal models of septic shock appear promising, an RCT is needed to establish whether plasma resuscitation for septic shock is safe and confers similar benefits in humans.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study, with the first being the small sample size. Given that there have been no prior studies on which to base a power calculation. Use of Bayesian analyses to complement traditional frequentist analyses will allow estimates of the probability of benefit of plasma. A second limitation is that the primary outcome is based on SHINE biomarkers, which are a surrogate endpoint. The promising effects of plasma on SHINE biomarkers seen in vitro and in animal models may not be replicable in humans. Moreover, changes in biomarkers may not correlate with clinical outcomes. Larger pragmatic trials are planned if the results of the pilot trial suggest potential benefit with plasma. A third limitation of the study is the heterogeneity of patients. ED patients are likely to have community-acquired sepsis whereas STICU patients have hospital-acquired sepsis, which prior studies have shown to have different clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We chose to incorporate both STICU and ED patients to capture a greater number of eligible patients. Despite community-acquired and hospital-acquired sepsis being different clinical entities, the current treatment standard for both populations remains the same. To account for this heterogeneity, we will stratify by enrollment location. By not limiting our patient population, the study&#x02019;s outcome will be more generalizable to the surgical and trauma septic shock populations.</p><p>In summary, this study will be the first pilot RCT that compares plasma versus BC in the initial fluid resuscitation of surgical or trauma patients with septic shock. Results from this study will be hypothesis generating, and may be used to inform future, multicenter RCTs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors included in the article contributed to the conception, design, implementation of the trial and drafting of the article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> SW is supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01GM085232.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Disclaimer:</bold> The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences or the National Institutes of Health.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Patient consent:</bold> Not required.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> This study has been approved by our institutional review board.
