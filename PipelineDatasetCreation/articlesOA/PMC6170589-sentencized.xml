</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Food production fuelled population growth and the emergence of social complexity in pre-Columbian South America, from the Andes to lowland regions of the continent [1–3], leaving a longstanding legacy in regional biodiversity, cultural landscapes and traditional knowledge [4–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the nature, time and place of early plant cultivation and the development of independent centres of food production in the tropics are still matters of debate [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The narrow coastal strip of the Atlantic Forest, one of the world's most diverse tropical biomes [9], has supported human societies since the Middle Holocene, but their interaction with plant resources is still poorly understood [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As a result, this region has only been given cursory consideration, and it is viewed as peripheral to early centres of plant management and cultivation [3,12,13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Shellmounds and middens, also known as sambaquis [14], are distinctive archaeological features of the Atlantic Forest formed by pre-ceramic coastal populations between ca 8000 and 1000 years ago [14,15], making them contemporaneous with the establishment of mixed economies and sedentary villages in the Andes and along major river basins of the continent [2,8,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The high frequency and large volume of some sambaquis on the southern coast of what is today Brazil, containing hundreds of human burials, have been taken as evidence for high population density, monumental architecture and social complexity during the Middle to Late Holocene [14,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These populations would have maintained economies founded primarily on the exploitation of rich marine ecosystems [18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increasing archaeobotanical studies, nevertheless, have provided a much greater appreciation of the dietary diversity among sambaqui builders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Remains of root crops, herbaceous plants and fruits with unknown domestication stages, consistent with yam (Dioscorea sp.), palms (Arecaceae), myrtle (Myrtaceae) and Annonaceae, have been found in several sites [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Similarly, starch grains and phytoliths compatible with maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), palms (Arecaceae), yam (Dioscorea sp.) and Araceae have been detected in dental calculus of Middle and Late Holocene sambaqui individuals along the southeastern coast of Brazil [21,22], who were often affected by relatively higher frequencies of oral pathologies [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Moreover, grinding stones and mortars presumably used for processing plant resources are commonly reported at sambaqui sites, indirectly reflecting investments in plant exploitation [11,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These independent lines of evidence indicate that plant resources were important components in sambaqui societies, and support the hypothesis that low-level food production [24] took place among these coastal groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We performed oral health and stable isotope analyses on human individuals from the sambaquis of Morro do Ouro (MO) and Rio Comprido (RC) in Babitonga Bay, southern Brazil, to unveil the dietary behaviour of human individuals during the Middle–Late Holocene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Our analyses revealed high levels of dental caries and evidence of carbohydrate-rich diets in individuals at MO and, to a lesser extent, at RC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The results support the emerging view that food production through plant cultivation was practised along the Atlantic Forest coast contemporaneously to the emergence of farming villages in the Andes [16] and Amazonia [8,25], and early plant cultivation in the La Plata Basin [1]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The archaeological information contained within some of these sites, such as MO and RC (figure 1b), has survived thanks to preventive archaeological investigations and private collections [30–32], along with previous scientific studies [21,23,33] and curation at the Museu Arqueológico de Sambaqui de Joinville.

<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Preventive archaeological excavations from the second half of the twentieth century report great amounts of terrestrial and marine faunal remains, artefacts, domestic structures and human burials [30–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Faunal remains include molluscs (e.g. Anomalocardia flexuosa, Ostreidae, Mytilidae), fish (e.g. Mugil sp., Micropogonias furnieri, Centropomidae, Tetraodontidae, Sciaenidae, Ariidae), and terrestrial mammals (e.g. Cuniculus paca, Tayassu pecari [31]; J. Ferreira 2018, personal communication), but detailed taxonomic and quantitative information is lacking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Polished stone tools have been found, and charred plant remains (palm fruit) have also been reported in some archaeological deposits [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>A total of 116 human burials were recovered at MO [30,31,33] and new radiocarbon measurements on human individuals (electronic supplementary material, table S1) reveal that the site was occupied between ca 4824–4527 and ca 4510–4101 cal BP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Analyses of micro-remains from dental calculus identified starch grains compatible with sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), yam (Dioscorea sp.) and Araceae among others as yet unidentified [21]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The consumption of marine resources had a measurable impact on the absolute 14C dates (electronic supplementary material, table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The Bayesian model (see below; electronic supplementary material, tables S6 and S7) estimated that carbon from marine organisms (e.g. fish) contributed from approximately 73.2 ± 3.6% (MO13) to approximately 3.7 ± 2.7% (MO59) to the carbon collagen of dated individuals, resulting in calibrated dates (2σ) older by up to approximately 377 years (MO13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The vertical distribution of 14C dates from RC confirms the sedimentary and archaeological evidence for at least two main phases of occupation, RCI (5642–5438 to 4800–4374 cal BP) and RCII (4051–3712 to 3608–3380 cal BP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>These phases are separated by a stratigraphic deposit with no human burials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>A possible much later phase of occupation may have occurred, as indicated by the date provided by burial RC4A which was recovered at a depth of 0–1 m but dated to 925–699 cal BP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>However, this needs to be clarified with further studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Contrary to RC, the 14C dates from Morro do Ouro (4824–4527 to 4510–4101 cal BP) show no relation to their depth in the deposit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>This could be related to several, not mutually exclusive factors such as spatial variability of site formation processes [38], post-depositional deformation [39] and secondary burials [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, considering that most of the dates overlap each other, it is possible that the funerary deposit at MO was formed relatively quickly. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Age and sex determinations were possible for approximately 75% of all analysed individuals (electronic supplementary material, table S2), with the majority of these determined to be male. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>As the sample size did not allow for statistical comparison by age and sex within sites, only between-site comparisons were made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Similar age distributions were seen at MO and RCII, represented primarily by middle adults (MA; 30–49 years) and young adults (YA; 20–29 years). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>A higher relative frequency of YA was found at RCI, followed by MA; however, these differences were not statistically significant (see electronic supplementary material, Methods for an expanded explanation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>As such, the differences in oral pathology seen across the sites most likely reflect variability in diet and nutrition, rather than between-population differences in age or sex distribution [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The frequency of caries (electronic supplementary material, table S3) ranged from 7.6% (RCI) to 13.2% (MO), with statistically significant differences seen only between MO and RCI (p = 0.0052; differences between RCI and RC2, and between RC2 and MO were not significant). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of caries were higher than expected for most hunter-gatherers or fishermen [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>By contrast, ante-mortem tooth loss (AMTL) reaches 6.2% (RCI), 2.4% (MO) and 1.1% (RCII), with statistically significant differences seen between RCI and RCII (p = 0.001) and RCI and MO (p = 0.0004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Some differences were observed in caries depth between sites, but these were all statistically indistinguishable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Enamel caries ranged from 55% (RCII) to 80% (RCI), while the frequency of dentin caries, a ‘robust’ marker of cariogenicity [42], was higher in MO (23.1%) and RCII (20%), compared to RCI (15%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Pulp caries, which correspond to lesions reaching the pulp chamber producing necrosis, ranged from 5% (RCI) to 13.2% (MO) and 25% (RCII). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Similarly, caries type varied considerably between sites, but statistical differences were only observed for cervical (extra-occlusal) lesions (electronic supplementary material, table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The frequency of occlusal caries was generally high in all groups, ranging from 53.7% (MO) to 70% (RCI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The higher frequency in RCI, which has mainly enamel caries, confirms the chronicity of carious lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>By contrast, MO had the highest frequency of extra-occlusal caries (including approximal, smooth surface and cervical lesions), and this was statistically significant when compared with RCII (p = 0.0123). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Carious lesions have been associated with diets rich in fermentable carbohydrates [43–45] and free sugar including honey and syrups [46], with the frequency of deep caries increasing in retentive and non-retentive surfaces with exposure to cariogenic foods [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Diets higher in cariogenic foods typically have an increased frequency of extra-occlusal caries [42] and cavities on smooth or non-retentive tooth surfaces [48,49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that people at MO had a more cariogenic and refined (by mechanical fractionation and/or cooking by gelatinization) diet compared to those at RCII [40,50], as further corroborated by a significantly higher frequency of cervical lesions at MO (p = 0.0230) (figure 2a–d). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency and patterns of caries reveal distinct dietary behaviours and potentially also food preparation techniques between groups from RC and MO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of chronic or static caries at RCI suggests a less cariogenic diet compared to RCII and MO, and it is possibly associated with a more alkaline salivary pH, and/or phosphate and calcium content in marine-based diets [55,56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the higher frequency of deep and extra-occlusal caries at RCII, and notably at MO, points toward the pervasive and persistent consumption of cariogenic and processed carbohydrates [45,57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Cervical caries are the most common type of extra-occlusal caries in MO (29%) and have been associated with frequent consumption of sucrose and solid fermentable starches [45,57], high concentrations of salivary lactobacilli [49,58], age and deposition of cervical calculus with gingival recession [57,59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of cervical caries around 16.0% were reported in Pleistocene hunter-gatherers from North Africa, and interpreted as the first signs of systematic harvesting and storage of wild plant foods rich in carbohydrates [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In Andean agriculturalists, cervical caries (up to 30%) were attributed to the consumption of fermentable beverages prepared with manioc, maize and other starch-rich foods [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that sucrose, starch with sucrose, fructose and dextrose, in decreasing order, stimulate the production of smooth surface caries and cervical caries, while high amounts of maltose and starches led preferentially to cervical caries [43,57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, diets at MO were probably richer in fermentable carbohydrates than those at RC, as well as in relation to diets of ancient occupants of other sambaquis [41,61], and comparable with diets of some agriculturalists [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Dental wear indexes in RC and MO were, by contrast, the lowest among several sambaqui groups studied elsewhere [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, diet in RCII seems to have been more abrasive than that at MO, which was the site with the lowest sand/grit content in dental calculus among four pre-ceramic and ceramic sites [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the quantity of sand/grit in dental calculus, its presence suggests direct roasting of processed food over charcoal or cooking in earth ovens [33], and this seems to be confirmed by the presence of stone vessels and grindstones at MO, possibly used in flour making [21,31,32], although we cannot rule out the effect of taphonomic agents [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The oral pathologies observed in MO thus far suggest a highly cariogenic and more processed diet, compared to RCI and RCII. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Dietary inferences from oral pathologies are broadly supported by stable isotope data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Bayesian estimations indicate that plants, marine–estuarine fish and terrestrial mammals contributed to different extents to individual diets, but a higher dependence on plant resources took place at MO between ca 4824–4527 and 4510–4101 cal BP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Although more accurate dietary reconstructions would benefit from the development of isotopic baselines for each site, our comparative analysis across distinct coastal populations shows that plant consumption at MO was substantially higher, and above the values expected for hunter-gatherers [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Some individuals from MO (e.g. MO59) who relied fundamentally on plant resources since childhood could be interpreted as non-locals [63,64], perhaps absorbed in the context of post-marital residence practices [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Population exchange between coastal fishing people and groups engaged in plant cultivation may have facilitated the spread of ideas, transferred ecological knowledge, biological materials and economic strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>As such, differential interpopulation interactions could explain the distinct degree of plant dependence among sambaqui groups in this region (figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Results from MO are directly supported by the presence of starches and phytoliths consistent with tuber crops, such as yams (Dioscorea sp.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and Araceae, in dental calculus of the same individuals [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Artefactual evidence such as stone tools for plant processing also indirectly confirms the investment in plant exploitation and preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Such a level of plant dependence would probably require some kind of plant management, possibly through cultivation, to guarantee long-term and predictable returns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, other root crops such as manioc (Manihot sp.), which has been associated with slash-and-burn cultivation [13], and fruits reported in South American tropical forests from the Early Holocene could have featured on the menu of this group [3,66,67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, abrupt increases in carbonized particles associated with extensive palaeofires have been detected in sediments from the Atlantic Forest coast and the southern Brazilian highlands dated from 10 400 until 3600 cal. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>These fires took place in the context of a wetter climate and some are believed to be anthropogenic in origin, potentially signalling the onset of slash-and-burn cultivation in the region from the Middle Holocene [70]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>South America is a polycentric cradle of early food production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>However, the nature, time and space of early plant cultivation are still being mapped. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The dietary evidence discussed in this paper suggest that food production may have taken place in this region during the Middle Holocene, contemporaneous with the shift to horticulture in Amazonia [8,13,25] and the earliest evidence for plant cultivation in La Plata Basin [1,71,72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Plant cultivation has been postulated for other groups along the Atlantic Forest coast during the Middle Holocene [10,26–28], reinforcing the contribution of sambaqui archaeological evidence for documenting early food production in the Americas. </plain></SENT>
