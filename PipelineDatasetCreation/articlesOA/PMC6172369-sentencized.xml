</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignant gynecologic cancer (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than 70% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to a lack of early-stage symptoms, and the overall 5-year survival rates are less than 30% (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even after receiving primary cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, 60–70% of EOC patients eventually undergo relapse, which is largely due to chemotherapy resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the specific mechanism of chemoresistance remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Dicer belongs to the RNase III family of enzymes whose function is central to the processing of miRNA precursors into mature miRNAs in the cytoplasm (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Dicer directly affects the levels and activity of miRNAs (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Numerous recent studies have revealed the importance of Dicer in cancer development, chemoresistance and progression, but its expression levels are not consistent in different types of tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There are tissue-specific effects associated with the aberrant expression of Dicer (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recent research has shown that Dicer is associated with chemoresistance in colon cancer cells (6), breast cancer (7) and lung cancer cells (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In ovarian cancer, it was reported that the deletion of Dicer could promote epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression by increasing PDIA3 expression levels (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In addition, several studies indicated that low levels of Dicer expression were significantly associated with high-grade histologic features and poor responses to chemotherapy (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although these findings support the hypothesis that Dicer plays an essential role in ovarian cancer chemoresistance, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to demonstrate whether downregulating Dicer can mediate cell apoptosis and regulate cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells in vitro. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that Dicer knockdown could protect ovarian cancer cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, including P73, P63, P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>These findings provide novel insight into the mechanism of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In our study, we found a dramatic decrease in Dicer protein level 1 h after cisplatin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Previous study reported that cisplatin-induced proteasome degradation cause rapid down-regulation of hCTR1 (human copper transporter 1) expression in human ovarian carcinoma cells (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In addition, another research indicated that cisplatin could induce EGFR phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation in head and neck cancer (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Whether the instant downregulation of Dicer after exposure to cisplatin is caused by cisplatin-induced protein degradation or not need to be further explored. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>A previous study revealed that reduced expression levels of Dicer in ovarian cancer were associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, enhanced migration ability and increased cisplatin resistance (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In our previous study, we found that downregulation of Dicer could promote proliferation, colony formation, and migration ability of A2780, CAOV3, and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Besides, proteomic profiling assay showed that Dicer knockdown promoted ovarian cancer progression by elevating PDIA3 expression (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Our study further revealed that the downregulation of Dicer could increase cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells through inhibiting cisplatin-induced apoptosis and decreasing the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Similarly, several recent reports have proven that decreased Dicer levels play an important role in drug resistance in different cancer types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In cervical cancer, a study showed that EZH2 inhibition could effectively increase the cisplatin sensitivity of HeLa/DDP cells by upregulating Dicer expression (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In addition, the knockdown of Dicer resulted in resistance to 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy and a poor prognosis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In addition, the upregulation of miR-18a decreased Dicer expression levels and conferred paclitaxel resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>However, some studies have obtained the opposite results regarding the relationship between Dicer expression and drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In breast cancer, Bu et al reported that the suppression of Dicer could result in G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells and increase their sensitivity to cisplatin (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported that downregulating Dicer could increase gefitinib sensitivity in human lung cancer cells (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>These opposite results may be attributed to the complicated structure and function of Dicer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that Dicer might promote cell apoptosis through regulating apoptosis-related genes (19,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that P53 superfamily proteins including P53, P63 and P73 function in mediating apoptosis in the presence of many stress stimuli, including activation of oncogenes and DNA damage (21,22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>As is known, p53 plays a central role in tumor suppression, while which is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and over half of human cancers contain p53 mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Although the critical role of wild-type p53 in tumor suppression has been firmly established, mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins not only lose the tumor-suppressive function of wild-type p53 but also gain new activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild-type p53, termed gain-of-function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Mutant p53 protein often accumulates to very high levels in tumors, contributing to malignant progression (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>In addition, caspase-9 and caspase-3 can be activated in response to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the expression levels of proteins involved in apoptosis signaling pathways, including P73, P63, P53, caspase-9 and caspase-3, were decreased in ovarian cancer cells after Dicer knockdown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results indicate that Dicer might play a specific role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Besides, we found that the p21 protein expression was not affected by Dicer down-regulation in A2780 and CAOV3 cells, while it was decreased under cisplatin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The cisplatin induced reduction of P21 was similar in the A2780 cells with or without Dicer depletion, but more intensive in the CAOV3 cells with Dicer depletion compared with control, which may be due to the presence of P53 mutations in CAOV3, but not in A2780 (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that tumor-associated mutant p53 promoted cancer cell survival upon glutamine deprivation through p21 induction (25), which is consistent with our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>As is known, Dicer plays an important role in the maturation of miRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence has indicated that low levels of some miRNAs are associated with drug resistance in cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>For example, low miRNA-107 and low miRNA-204 were linked to chemo-resistance in non-small cell lung cancers and prostate cancers, respectively, because they target the mRNAs of antiapoptotic factors Bcl-w and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) (26,27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the potential roles of microRNAs in regulating Dicer-mediated chemotherapy responses in tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, whether the role of Dicer in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer is mediated by corresponding microRNAs needs to be further studied. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that low expression levels of Dicer can inhibit cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, which in turn resulted in resistance to cisplatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>However, the present study also has several limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>First, Dicer upregulation in the cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells was not performed because of technical difficulty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Second, only one cisplatin-resistant cell line was used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Third, the mechanisms through which Dicer regulates cell apoptosis remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Given that Dicer functions as an enzyme that catalyzes miRNA maturation and that several miRNAs have been identified as regulators of cell apoptosis, multiple miRNAs might be involved in Dicer-mediated cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our results suggest that the upregulation of Dicer might be a promising strategy for treating recurrent, cisplatin-resistant EOC. </plain></SENT>
