</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules transcribed from the genome and subsequently processed by Drosha and Dicer nucleases (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Generally, when miRNA complementary binds to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of mRNAs, it can cleave the target mRNAs or inhibits the mRNA translation, thus, down-regulating the corresponding gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, it has been reported that the miRNAs can also bind to the 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) (2) or even within the coding sequence of mRNAs (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, miRNA's function involves the regulation of various biological processes including the host-virus interaction upon viral infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>During virus infection, viral miRNAs downregulate specific viral and cellular mRNAs to establish a host environment conducive to the completion of viral life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the host miRNAs modulate both cellular and viral transcripts exerting influence over immune responses (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In crustaceans, there are many reports showing that the host miRNAs can regulate the expression of the host and viral genes and vice versa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In 2012, the first large-scale miRNA characterization in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)-infected Marsupenaeus japonicas lymphoid organ has been reported (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Several cellular WSSV-responsive miRNAs play important roles in shrimp immunity including apoptosis pathway (6, 7), phagocytosis (8), NF-kB pathway (9), and JAK/STAT pathway (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the WSSV miRNAs were also identified and probably could target either the host or viral genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the WSSV-infected M. japonicas, the viral miRNAs could target virus transcripts and further promote virus infection (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In the meantime, a viral miRNA, WSSV-miR-N24, could target the shrimp apoptotic gene, caspase 8, and further represses the apoptosis of shrimp hemocytes (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the study on the host miRNAs-virus relationship in shrimp is still very limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In Penaeus monodon, the 60 known miRNA homologs that are expressed in the hemocytes of WSSV-challenged shrimp at the early and late phases of infection have been identified (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Their immune-related gene targets in apoptosis pathway, antimicrobial peptide, prophenoloxidase system, signal transduction, proteinase and proteinase inhibitor, blood clotting system, and heat shock protein have also been predicted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Among them, the pmo-miR-315 was found to be a highly up-regulated miRNA in response to WSSV challenge and its target gene was predicted to be a novel prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme, called PmPPAE3 (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>According to the previous reports, the miR-315 was also up-regulated after WSSV infection in lymphoid organ of M. japonicas (5) and hepatopancreas of F. chinensis (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the function of miR-315 in shrimp immunity against WSSV infection is still unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In this research, the cellular mRNA target of pmo-miR-315 was confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the role of pmo-miR-315 in WSSV-infected shrimp was investigated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>In 2007, the miR-315 from Drosophila was found to act as a potent activator of Wingless (Wg) signaling, a conserved pathway that regulates growth and tissue specification (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Previously, the miR-315s from M. japonicas, L. vannamei, P. monodon, and F. chinensis have been identified as a viral responsive miRNA in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes(5, 13, 14, 25, 26) suggesting that the shrimp miR-315 might be involved in antiviral immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pmo-miR-315 function was further characterized in this research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The expression of pmo-miR-315 was detected in various shrimp tissues including hemocytes, gill, lymphoid organ, and stomach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression level of pmo-miR-315 in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated, more than 30 times at 48 h post-WSSV infection, implying the specific role of pmo-miR-315 in shrimp antiviral response in hemocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Although the target gene of pmo-miR-315 was predicted as putative prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme PmPPAE3 and serine/threonine protein kinase (13), in this research we focused on confirming the regulatory role of pmo-miR-315 on the expression of PmPPAE3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Generally, the miRNA binds to the 3′-UTR of its target gene to regulate the translational repression and mRNA destabilization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the binding site of miRNA can also be located at the 5′-UTR and coding sequence (CDS), albeit the regulatory activity may be different (27, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>According to our prediction, the pmo-miR-315 can bind to CDS of PmPPAE3 gene (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The luciferase reporter assay revealed that the pmo-miR-315 mimic could interact with the specific binding site on PmPPAE3 CDS, which was indicated by almost 36% reduction in luciferase activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Melanization activated by the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system is a principal innate immune response in shrimp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Upon pathogen invasion, the binding of Pattern Recognition Proteins (PRPs) to the microbial cell wall components activates the serine proteinase cascade that finally activates the final proteinases, called proPO-activating enzymes (PPAEs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The PPAEs, then, cleave the inactive proPOs to active POs leading to the initiation of melanin formation (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In P. monodon, the active PmPPAE1 and PmPPAE2 cleaves PmproPO1 and PmproPO2 generating the active PO1 and PO2, respectively (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The PmPPAE3 whose mRNA is the target of pmo-miR-315 is a novel isoform of PmPPAE characterized herein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>It was mainly expressed in shrimp hemocytes and significantly suppressed after 24 and 48 h post-WSSV infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>As expected, the negative correlation of pmo-miR-315 expression and PmPPAE3 gene expression was observed in hemocytes after WSSV infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The full-length gene of PmPPAE3 was identified in this study and its deduced amino acid sequence was compared with other PmPPAEs from various species as well as the PmPPAE1 and PmPPAE2 (22, 23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>The multiple alignment of different PPAE amino acid sequences revealed that the PmPPAE3 was closely related to FcPPAE, LvPPAE, and PmPPAE1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The phylogenetic analysis showed that the shrimp PPAEs and a crayfish PPAE belonged to the crustaceans cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Besides, the PmPPAE3 gene was hemocyte specific like PmPPAE1 and PmPPAE2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The function of PmPPAE3 in proPO system was confirmed using the RNA interference technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the PmPPAE3 was considered as a novel clips serine proteinase that function in the proPO system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, the melanization reaction is activated through the proPO cascade after pathogen infection and unavoidably generates highly toxic molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>These toxic intermediates are not only involved in pathogen killing but also cause the damage of the host cells (30, 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the activation cascade is needed to be tightly regulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>To date, several proteinase inhibitors of melanization cascade have been reported in shrimp, including the melanization inhibition protein (MIP), serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and pacifastin (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the small RNAs can also regulate the proPO system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The shrimp miR-100, which was up-regulated after WSSV or V. alginolyticus infection, can regulate several shrimp immune reactions including proPO activity, SOD activity and phagocytosis (32). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>The involvement of proPO system upon WSSV infection has been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>The PO activity is strongly decreased after WSSV-infection in shrimp (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Later, it is found that the WSSV453 binds to and interferes with the proPmPPAE2 activation to active PmPPAE2 resulting in the suppression of shrimp melanization (18, 33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In our research, the role of pmo-miR-315 and PmPPAE3 in proPO system during WSSV infection in shrimp was explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Injection of pmo-miR-315 mimic into the shrimp resulted in a reduction of PmPPAE3 gene expression and the PO activity as expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, inhibition of pmo-miR-315 by AMO-miR-315 increased the PmPPAE3 gene expression leading to the increase in PO activity in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can conclude that the pmo-miR-315 regulates the proPO system via PmPPAE3 post-transcriptional repression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Upon WSSV infection, the shrimp proPO system takes part in shrimp antiviral immunity by producing melanin and cytotoxic intermediate for viral sequestration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>However, the WSSV can overcome shrimp antiviral immunity partly by proPO system suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Several crustacean miRNAs have been reported to promote WSSV propagation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>In M. rosenbergii, the host miR-s9041 and miR-9850 play positive roles in WSSV replication by targeting the STAT gene (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In crabs, E. sinensis, the miR-217 leads to a decrease in the transcript level of Tube gene resulting in the enhancement of WSSV copies (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the survival rate of miR-100 silenced shrimp after WSSV infection is increased as the PO activity (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>According to our research, an increase in the viral copy number in WSSV-infected shrimp after pmo-miR-315 mimic injection indicated that the pmo-miR-315 functioned in enhancing viral replication by regulating the proPO system through the inhibition of PmPPAE3 gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the viral copy number of AMO-miR-315 challenged shrimp was lower than that of WSSV-infected shrimp challenged with exogenous pmo-miR-315 but was not lower than the control groups as expected (Figure 5D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>This might be because the pmo-miR-315 was not totally silenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Since the whole genome sequence of P. monodon has not been reported yet, it was possible that the AMO-miR-315 could also target other unknown genes that might affect the WSSV propagation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our research offer a new mechanism on how WSSV inhibits proPO system by triggering host miRNA, as illustrated in Figure 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The WSSV infection causes the pmo-miR-315 over-expression and subsequently inhibits the PmPPAE3 expression leading to a decrease in PO activity and increase in WSSV copy number in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the pmo-miR-315 regulates the proPO system through the suppression of PPAE3 gene expression which leads to the promotion of viral propagation in shrimp hemocytes during WSSV infection. </plain></SENT>
