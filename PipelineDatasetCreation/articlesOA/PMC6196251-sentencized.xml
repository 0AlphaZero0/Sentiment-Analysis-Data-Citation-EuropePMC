</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder endemic to Panay island in the Philippines, with recessive inheritance and a genetic founder effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Molecular genetic studies suggest reduced expression of a neural isoform of TAF1 in the striatum of patients (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The disease initially manifests with focal dystonia, which then progresses to generalized dystonia and overlaps with symptoms of parkinsonism about 5–10 years after onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Parkinsonism predominates after about 10 years of disease (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Some XDP patients have may have predominantly parkinsonian symptoms initially (3), causing diagnostic confusion with idiopathic Parkinson Disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Among inherited forms of isolated dystonia, XDP stands out with its overlapping parkinsonian features and X-linked mode of inheritance (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The disease was brought to the attention of the international scientific community in 1975 when it was presented in the Second Dystonia Meeting held in New York City (5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A population-based prevalence study was initiated in 2016 in order to do a complete enumeration of all XDP cases in Panay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The first phase involved the development of a 4-item screening questionnaire that can be used by community health workers (CHWs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The second phase involved screening by the CHWs of all the households in the island using this questionnaire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Individuals who were screened in were then evaluated by neurologists and movement disorder specialists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>All consenting patients deemed to have probable XDP underwent genetic testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Only Capiz province in Panay island has undergone all four phases of the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The first phase of the prevalence study was accomplished in 2015. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire with four items was validated to be highly sensitive and specific for screening patients with possible XDP in a general population where XDP is endemic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The questions screened for sustained twisting, repetitive jaw opening and closing, slowness in movement, and feet shuffling (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Since the questionnaire was designed for screening at-risk individuals in a healthy population, the validity of this tool is unknown in patients with symptoms similar to XDP, such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and cerebral palsy (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire that can distinguish genetically confirmed XDP from its clinical mimics is therefore lacking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>New diagnostic criteria for another genetic movement disorder, Huntington Disease, have recently been established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The criteria are based on motor scoring systems, genetic testing and historical findings that classify the patients into six strata (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a questionnaire for another neurologic condition, myotonic dystrophy (MD), identified 5 questions predictive of MD among healthy controls and diseases that mimic MD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The study emphasized the importance of such questionnaires especially in neurologic conditions such as MD that may be missed by non-neurologists (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Common neurologic diseases, such as stroke, migraine, dementia and Parkinson disease also have screening tools used by non-specialists that lead to more definitive investigations (9–12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The main objective of our study is to develop a weighted questionnaire that will differentiate XDP from other neurological diseases with similar symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Many patients reside in remote areas of Panay, accessible only by long treks on foot and boat rides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>General health professionals who are first to see patients with possible XDP will need to know which ones will need specialist assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The present questionnaire, if validated, can help direct meager community resources toward diagnosing and treating patients most likely to have XDP. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 2 months, data was gathered from all the 16 towns and 1 city of Capiz province. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The CHWs screened the entire province of about 440,000 adults1 using the previously validated 4-item questionnaire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In brief, the questionnaire was adapted from existing screening tools and tested on a random sample of 64 genetically confirmed and 64 normal healthy individuals (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Responses to the questionnaire, the clinical diagnoses made by the movement disease specialists and the results of genetic testing provided data for the current study. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To be included in the dataset, subjects needed to be patients of the ongoing Population Based Prevalence Study of XDP in Panay, screened in by the CHWs in the second phase of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The subjects had a “yes” answer to at least one question in the 4-item questionnaire and a final disposition which is either a diagnosis of XDP or an alternative diagnosis, based on results of clinical and genetic testing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Anonymity was maintained by ensuring that only the codes were used in data gathering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The collected data was randomly partitioned into two: a training set and a test set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The training set (248 subjects: 88 cases and 160 controls) was used to develop a predictive model through multivariable logistic regression analysis, which was appropriate to model the data because the output variable (whether or not a subject has XDP) was based on a set of predictor variables (responses to the screening questions) Each of the four questions in the screening tool was assigned a score based on the raw coefficients of the logistic regression model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A simulated dataset consisting of a list of all the possible combinations of answers to the four questions was used to determine the total score cut-off value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The resulting model was then run on the test set (58 subjects: 26 cases and 32 controls) to estimate its prediction abilities (diagnostic accuracy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The predicted probability cut-off value used in the estimation of the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was chosen as the point on the ROC curve that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>To allow for the predictive model to be used at the point of clinical encounter, a scoring system for the 4-item questionnaire was developed based on the model coefficients of the logistic regression model. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In this study we attempted to validate a four-item questionnaire originally for use by lay workers to screen a population endemic for XDP, in a group of individuals with signs and symptoms that may be misdiagnosed as XDP by non-specialists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We found that though highly sensitive and specific in the general population, it was fairly accurate in this subset of XDP mimics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Experience from the Population-Based Prevalence Study reveals that many patients who were suspected to have XDP could not even be brought to the municipal health centers for screening because of time and financial constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This emphasizes the great resources that need to be mobilized to get expert opinion for XDP suspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Once this study ends, evaluation by a movement disorder specialist and genetic testing will become even more elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire we developed can be used to screen for patients most likely to have XDP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Identifying this subset of patients will enable a more focused use of resources for those most likely to benefit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire can be used by both lay workers and general health professionals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Up to a quarter to one half of patients with dystonia may be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Even among neurologists the correct diagnosis of movement disorders may be difficult to make. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>The rate of accurate diagnosis correlates with the physician's experience—with movement disorder specialists arriving at the right diagnosis more consistentl (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, in the Philippines, for a population of 100,981,437 (17), there are only about 10 movement disorder specialists with formal training. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This questionnaire can be used to assist general health professionals and CHWs in Panay in selecting patients who are most likely to benefit from subspecialty consult and genetic testing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The developed questionnaire has a fair ability to distinguish XDP from its common mimics with an accuracy of 71% (0.57-0.82, 95% CI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>It has a relatively high negative predictive value of 83% (0.61-0.95, 95% CI), which makes it useful for first line health workers in selecting patients that need to be triaged for further work-up and evaluation in tertiary institutions with neurologists and movement disorder specialists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A patient with a score of 6 or more would likely benefit from further evaluation by a movement disorder specialist and subsequent genetic testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>While a score of less than 6 would identify patients who probably have an alternate diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The earlier validation study that distinguished XDP patients from the healthy general population only required that any one of the 4 identified questions be positive for the screened individual to move to the next phase of the study (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the main differential diagnosis for XDP is idiopathic parkinsonism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression analysis reveals that the question on feet shuffling and taking smaller steps has the biggest weight for determining XDP in this population but is not by itself able to distinguish between genetically positive XDP and its mimics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>A previous review on the phenomenology of XDP revealed that only 5.7% of XDP patients begin with parkinsonian symptoms, including shuffling of gait, and that only 18.6% are predominantly parkinsonism throughout the course of the illness (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that shuffling of feet and parkinsonism may be more important than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the original validation study for the 4-item questionnaire gave constant jaw opening and closing the largest weight for distinguishing XDP from the general population (6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>A screening questionnaire for Parkinsonism found the following questions most predictive: stiffness and rigidity in legs, tremor and shaking, troublesome arm swing and feet stuck to floor (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that two of these items relate to lower extremity mobility as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This fact emphasizes the need for the other 3 components not found in the PD questionnaire to come up with a scoring system that can distinguish XDP from PD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The original version of the 4-item questionnaire found the question on “shuffling of feet” to have excellent positive and negative clinical utility in differentiating XDP from the normal population (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It is not surprising then that the same symptom is found to be most important in differentiating XDP from its mimics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The most interesting aspect of the results perhaps is the 31 clinically diagnosed XDP patients who had a negative genetic test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In this study we used a PCR-based test that detected the presence of the SVA retrotransposon insertion in intron 32 of the TATA binding protein factor 1 (TAF1) in the XDP critical region in Xq13.1 (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This retrotransposon insertion however, is not the only variant associated with XDP in the XDP haplotype on the X chromosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Six other variants have been identified: single-nucleotide changes (DSC1, DSC2, DSC3, DSC10, DSC12) and one 48-bp deletion (19), although previous data has shown that all these genetic variants are in tight linkage disequilibrium (i.e., no variant has been described in patients in isolation from the rest). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, each of the 31 patients with clinical features consistent with XDP but a negative genetic test could have any of the other 6 genetic variants apart from the SVA retrotransposon insertion; however, a previous study that investigated the genetic features in 166 clinically diagnosed XDP patients found that all 7 disease-associated genetic variants always occurred together with each other in all but 5 individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>These 5 patients, clinically diagnosed to have XDP, had none of the 7 genetic variants, and were classified as phenocopies (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The 31 clinically diagnosed XDP patients that were negative for the XDP haplotype on genetic testing may harbor a yet unidentified genetic variation that may be common to the 5 phenocopies in the previous study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, details on the individual phenomenology of the XDP in these 31 patients apart from their answers to the questionnaire were not documented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>We recommend that further clinical evaluation be done for these subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Features such as age of onset of the disease and initial neurologic manifestations may determine if this subset of patients has a phenotype that is unique from genetically confirmed XDP patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Further modifications to the questionnaire can be made that can utilize other questions from an expanded list of screening questions (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>The test-retest reliability of the questionnaire can also be explored in future studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>New questions can be added from focused group discussions involving movement disorder specialists, health workers and patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire with better diagnostic performance (i.e., higher sensitivity and specificity) can thus be produced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Involvement of stakeholders will also improve the acceptability of the questionnaire later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>All these can help produce a more accurate and acceptable questionnaire. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In addition, a convenient electronic application can also be developed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Similar to developments in Parkinson Disease research, the principles of objectification, multi-purpose design and simplification should be applied to future assessment tools for XDP (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Further modification of the tool can include an objective assessment of the pathologic movements of XDP by clinical observation or the use of wearable movement analysis devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Doing so would make the evaluation adhere to an objective multipurpose design that gathers data for XDP phenomenology research (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>There are several limitations of this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The prevalence study only screened those able to understand and respond to a “yes or no” questionnaire-type interview. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The new scoring tool was developed using subjects who had already been screened-in using the 4-item XDP screening questionnaire developed in phase 1 of the Prevalence Study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Only the same 4 questions were used to develop the new scoring tool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire by itself cannot be used to decide which patients merit genetic testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>A careful evaluation by a movement disorder specialist is needed to elicit clinical clues that cannot be provided by the questionnaire. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>All data was only collected through review of the database of an ongoing study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Because not all controls were genetically tested, some patients, especially those thought to have PD, may be XDP patients with predominant parkinsonian symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Besides answers to the four questions no other clues to the patients' clinical features were found; hence, correlations between signs and symptoms to the genetic variant tested for could not be done. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, XDP patients without any of the currently known 7 mutations may not have been selected by the questionnaire. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire is intended for use by local health workers and general practitioners to determine which patients need specialty evaluation and genetic testing to ascertain or dispute the diagnosis of XDP. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of all subjects classified as cases should be more completely characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Doing so would contribute greatly to data regarding the phenomenology of XDP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Further genetic profiling should be done on the 31 clinically diagnosed XDP patients with negative genetic testing, as they could be harboring a yet to be discovered genetic mutation associated with XDP. </plain></SENT>
