<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From a phylogenetic standpoint, Perostrongylus is grouped with high support together with the genera Filaroides van Beneden, 1858 and Parafilaroides Dougherty, 1946 and includes probably two species: Perostrongylus falciformis (Schlegel, 1933), a parasite of Meles meles in Europe and P. pridhami (Anderson, 1962), a parasite of Neovison vison in North America.

</text></title><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A century of debates on the taxonomy of members of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea Lane, 1917 led to many reclassifications of these nematodes within a variety of families, subfamilies, genera and species [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The genus Aelurostrongylus Cameron, 1927 was erected to accommodate Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Railliet, 1898) [3] which was originally described by Mueller in 1890 [4] as Strongylus pusillus and renamed to Strongylus abstrusus by Railliet [5], because S. pusillus was preoccupied [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Later, the genus Protostrongylus Kamensky, 1905 was erected [7] and Strongylus abstrusus transferred to this new genus (as Protostrongylus pusillus), containing two other species, i.e. Protostrongylus rufescens (Leuckart, 1865), the type-species, and Protostrongylus commutatus (Diesing, 1851) [as Protostrongylus terminalis (Passerini, 1884)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Kamensky used the early specific name as originally named by Mueller in 1890. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The definition of Aelurostrongylus as a new genus [3] was based mainly on the absence of cuticular bursal supports and the absence of “supporting fingers” of the spicular sheaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Cameron [3] included only the type-species A. abstrusus in the newly erected genus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Perostrongylus falciformis (Schlegel, 1933) was described from European badgers, Meles meles in Germany as Strongylus falciformis Schlegel, 1933 [8] due to the sickle-shaped spicules and one year later, transferred to the genus Filaroides van Beneden, 1858 as Filaroides falciformis [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the same year, Schlegel [10] erected a new genus, Perostrongylus Schlegel, 1934 in order to include this nematode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The main characteristics to support the new genus were the reduced, truncated copulatory bursa of the males, and the presence of larvated eggs in the uterus of the females [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A few years later, Wetzel [11] suggested that P. falciformis should be transferred to the genus Aelurostrongylus, considering the genus Perostrongylus as a synonym, based on the morphology of the bursa and gubernaculum in males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In two subsequent reviews on this group of nematodes [12, 13], the genus Perostrongylus is listed as a synonym of Aelurostrongylus, based on Wetzel’s suggestions, without further comments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In his taxonomic review, Dougherty [12] listed four species in the genus Aelurostrongylus: Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Railliet, 1898); Aelurostrongylus brauni (von Linstow, 1897); Aelurostrongylus. falciformis (Schlegel, 1933); and Aelurostrongylus fengi (Hsü, 1935). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The latter has been initially described as the type-species of Pulmostrongylus Hsü, 1935 [14], but Dougherty [12] considered this genus as a synonym of Aelurostrongylus while Anderson [15] and Lesage [16] as a subgenus of Protostrongylus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, Seneviratna [13] as well as the authors of later keys and reviews [17, 18] maintained the validity of Pulmostrongylus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The generic allocation of A. brauni was also questioned [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Asakawa et al. [20] redescribed this species and assigned it to the newly established genus Viverrostrongylus Asakawa, 1986. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A new species belonging to genus Aelurostrongylus, A. pridhami was described by Anderson [21] in Neovison vison from Canada. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Previously, the species was erroneously identified as A. falciformis [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The same author [19] highlighted that some species of the genus Aelurostrongylus (A. abstrusus and A. fengi) are oviparous, while others (A. falciformis and A. pridhami) are ovoviviparous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Moreover, A. falciformis and A. pridhami differ from A. abstrusus with regard to the morphology of the bursa and spicules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on these differences, Anderson [19] suggested that the genus Perostrongylus should be reinstated, but later placed it as a subgenus of Aelurostrongylus [15, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Subsequent publications continued to use the genus name Aelurostrongylus (synonymy of the genus [23]; A. falciformis [24–29], A. pridhami [27, 30–33]), while others accepted and used Perostrongylus (P. pridhami [34–42], P. falciformis [37, 43]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is evident, that most European studies maintained the validity of Aelurostrongylus while the American studies predominantly used Perostrongylus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>However, based on the data from Anderson [19], the two species are congeneric, sharing the same features. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The life-cycles of both species of Perostrongylus have been described in detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Wetzel [11] studied the development of P. falciformis in several snail and slug species, and described the L1-L3 larval stages, but illustrated only L1 and L3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>He also established the prepatent period in experimentally infected European badgers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The development of P. pridhami was described in slugs as well as in various terrestrial and aquatic snails, with detailed description and illustrations for L1-L3 larval stages [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The development of P. pridhami in American minks has also been described in detail [21, 37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Anderson [21] demonstrated the infectivity to minks of L3 of P. pridhami from paratenic hosts (rodents, birds, amphibians and fish). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Similarly to most metastrongyloid nematodes, P. falciformis has an indirect life-cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Females are ovoviviparous and deposit in the alveoli thin-shelled eggs with larvae which subsequently hatch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Larvae and mature adult parasites are found in the alveoli, alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>L1 are coughed-up, swallowed and shed through the faeces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Prepatency in experimental infections was shown to be 18–19 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Larvae enter different species of land snails and moult twice to infective L3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>European badgers become infected by eating snails or paratenic hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The development of L3 to adults in European badgers is not known [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of infected European badgers vary from less severe to death, depending on lungworm infection rate and secondary bacterial infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The associated lung lesions and different stages of verminous pneumonia in European badgers with minor to massive lungworm infections were lobular bronchopneumonia, diffuse bronchitis and widespread emphysema [8, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In minor infections, European badgers in good nutritional status often completely recovered after coughing out the worms, leading to the regression of inflammatory process and encapsulation and calcification of degraded worms and eggs in the form of small, cheesy calcareous nodules in the subpleura and parenchyma of lung lobes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The lungworm invasion affected predominantly young animals [8, 10, 11, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Considering the rather inconstant genus assignation and lack of molecular data, the main aim of this study was to provide information to support the validity of the genus Perostrongylus based on new molecular phylogenetic data and to understand its evolutionary relationships with other lungworms of carnivores. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This study provides the first molecular evidence for the validity of the genus Perostrongylus, which was previously synonymized with or considered a subgenus of Aelurostrongylus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>With the exception of A. abstrusus, other species previously assigned to genus Aelurostrongylus, namely A. brauni and A. fengi were subsequently transferred to different genera. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Due to the extremely poor description of A. brauni (a parasite originally described as Strongylus brauni from the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha), its classification as species inquirenda has already been suggested [19] and is now designated as Viverrostrongylus brauni [20]. Aelurostrongylus fengi was described from Crab-eating mongoose, Herpestes urva, as Pulmostrongylus fengi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The taxonomic status of Pulmostrongylus (which includes already several species) is under debate, and currently it is considered a valid genus [18] or a subgenus of Protostrongylus [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Our molecular data provide evidence that P. falciformis and A. abstrusus are not congeneric. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The conclusion drawn from this is the validity of the full genus status of Perostrongylus and the species name P. falciformis for the European badger lungworm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Hence, the genus Aelurostrongylus becomes monotypic and includes only the type-species A. abstrusus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Considering the rigorous rules of taxonomy, an interesting fact arises regarding A. abstrusus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>As the first description of the species used the specific name pusillus [4], the valid name for this species should be Aelurostrongylus pusillus (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>However, due its veterinary importance and worldwide use since more than a century under the name A. abstrusus, we suggest the latter name to be used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>From a phylogenetic standpoint, Perostrongylus is a valid genus and most probably includes two species: P. falciformis, a parasite of M. meles and possibly M. erminea in Europe, and P. pridhami [21], a parasite of N. vison and Mustela erminea in North America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Our view is strongly supported by molecular phylogenetic data currently available only for P. falciformis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Further molecular studies are needed also for P. pridhami in North America, to conclude its phylogenetic position and relationships to P. falciformis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of the relationships of P. falciformis with species of other metastrongyloid genera clearly assigned Perostrongylus and Aelurostrongylus to different clades. Perostrongylus falciformis was grouped with high support together with the genera Filaroides and Parafilaroides (family Filaroididae), whereas A. abstrusus represented a single branch with no sister groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Alignments of the internal transcribed spacer sequences (ITS1, ITS2) for different genera of the Metastrongyloidea are difficult because of the high variability in comparison to ribosomal RNA genes (18S, 28S). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We therefore performed the ITS2 multiple sequence alignment using a method of the program MAFFT which also considers secondary structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>However, the obtained correspondence between the analyses of ITS2 and the 28S rDNA D2-D3 region corroborate the inferred phylogenetic position of P. falciformis close to the two genera of the Filaroididae within the superfamily Metastrongyloidea. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The close relationship of Perostrongylus, Filaroides and Parafilaroides in the molecular phylogeny is in good agreement with morphological characters and forms of reproduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Males of species in all three genera have short, stout and arcuate spicules, a single-element gubernaculum and females are ovoviviparous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In contrast, males of A. abstrusus have slender (half the width of P. falciformis) and straight spicules, a gubernaculum of two joined equal elements and the females are oviparous [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The present paper also provides a very detailed morphological description of the adult stages of P. falciformis which was previously relatively brief [8, 10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par43"><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Both species of genus Perostrongylus are parasites of the Mustelidae. Perostrongylus falciformis has been reported so far only in European badgers from various countries in the western Palaearctic, including Germany [8, 11], Ukraine [56], Russia [57], Italy [58], UK [26], Norway [27], Poland [28], and Bosnia and Herzegovina [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Here we report for the first time the presence of P. falciformis in Romania. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In a study from UK on stoats, unidentified nematodes were shown in a histological section of a lung [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Later, Simpson et al. [60], hypothesized, based on the morphology of the female in these histological sections that the nematodes could be P. falciformis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>However, without morphological or genetic data, this remains only a presumption and we do not list stoats as confirmed hosts for P. falciformis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Torres et al. [32] mentioned P. pridhami in European badgers in Spain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>However, this is highly unlikely, as it probably represents a misidentification of P. falciformis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, one study on invasive American minks in Spain [33] reported a specimen identified as Aelurostrongylus spp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>As the specimen was not identified to the species level, it is not known if this represents P. pridhami, a natural parasite of this host in North America, but in an invasive population, or P. falciformis, which could suggest an adaptation from European badgers to invasive American minks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Lungworms of genus Perostrongylus seem to occur with variable prevalence in mustelids across their distribution range (Table 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, a low prevalence or total absence of these parasites in studies with a reasonably large number of samples are likely the result of a rather superficial examination; probably P. falciformis is present in European badgers across their distribution range.Table 6Reported prevalence for Perostrongylus spp.SpeciesHostCountryPrevalence (%) (infected/examined)Reference P. falciformis  Meles meles Germany50.0 (6/12)[10] P. falciformis  Meles meles Poland22.2 (2/9)[28] P. falciformis  Meles meles Norway33.3 (3/9)[27] P. falciformis  Meles meles UK0.8 (1/118)[26] P. falciformis  Meles meles Italy52.6 (10/19)[58] P. falciformis  Meles meles Spain3.5 (3/85)[32] P. falciformis  Mustela erminea UK13.5 (5/37)[59] P. pridhami  Neovison vison Canada8.6 (13/152)[42] P. pridhami  Neovison vison Canada2.1 (1/48)[30] P. pridhami  Mustela erminea Canada12.5 (8/40)[30]Perostrongylus sp.
