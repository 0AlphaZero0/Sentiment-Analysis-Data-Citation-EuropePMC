</text></title><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cilia and their homologous structures, flagella, are evolutionarily conserved organelles that convert the chemical energy released during ATP hydrolysis into a mechanical force to power cell motility or generate fluid flows at the epithelial cell surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The canonical motile cilium (this term will be used hereafter for both cilia and flagella) consists of a 9 + 2 microtubular core, called the axoneme, and multi-subunit complexes, such as the outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs), radial spokes (RSs), the nexin–dynein regulatory complex (N–DRC) and the modifier of inner dynein arms (MIA) complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These complexes are periodically distributed along the outer doublet microtubules and form a characteristic pattern repeating every 96 nm, called the 96-nm axonemal repeat unit [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Each 96-nm repeat contains four outer and seven inner dynein arms (a–g) attached to the A-tubule of the outer doublet and extending their motor domains towards the B-tubule of the preceding doublet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast to two-headed (or, in some organisms, three-headed) ODAs, which are periodically distributed every 24 nm and share similar architecture and protein composition, the IDAs are heterogeneous in their structure and subunit composition, and most likely also in their functions [2, 4–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Among IDAs, only the most proximal arm of the 96-nm ciliary unit has a two-headed heterodimeric structure (IDA f or I1), while the remaining six IDAs are single-headed [2, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The two-headed IDA I1 forms a trilobed structure consisting of two dynein heavy chains that differ in their function and distance from the surface of the A-tubule [6, 10, 11] and three intermediate and five light chains (ICLC) that form the third lobe [for review, 12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Cryo-electron tomography and 3D reconstruction analyses revealed that IDA I1 is highly connected with other axonemal structures [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the existence of linker structures between outer and inner dynein arms suggests a possible cross-talk between these structures [2, 8, 14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism that regulates cilia and flagella beating is still an intriguing and challenging puzzle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>At the ultrastructural level, cilia beating is generated by the spatiotemporally coordinated, ATP-dependent motor activity of the dynein heavy chains of the inner and outer dynein arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, a phenotypic analysis of numerous IDA and ODA mutants revealed that inner and outer dynein arms perform different functions and that their activities are regulated differently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is assumed that the inner dynein arms control the size and waveform of the cilia bend and that their activity is regulated by the mechano-chemical signals initiated at the central pair complex and transmitted to IDAs by the radial spokes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The two-headed IDA I1 is suggested to contribute to the formation of the waveform through the modulation of flagellar bending [9], possibly through changes in the level of phosphorylation of intermediate chain IC138, a subunit of the ICLC structure [4, 15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mutations in IDA I1 can rescue the immotility caused by defects in the cilia central pair complex [5, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In contrast to IDAs, ODAs control the cilia beat frequency and are downstream of IDAs in the signal transduction cascade [4, 7, 16, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The detailed molecular mechanism(s) that regulate(s) cilia beating is/are not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Among other reasons, this is due to the incomplete identification of the proteins involved in this process and the factors that regulate their interactions, such as second messengers or posttranslational modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The assembly and proper function of cilia require several hundred proteins [20, 21], but the roles and precise localization (at the ultrastructural level) of a substantial fraction of putative ciliary proteins remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>At the same time, 3D reconstructions using cryo-electron tomography revealed that each axonemal unit contains, in addition to established macromolecular complexes, numerous minor structures of unknown protein composition and function [2, 13, 22–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>These minor complexes may function as links between the major complexes and/or as their regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Some of these minor complexes may even play a role in the regulation of dynein arm activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate cilia motility requires the identification of all proteins involved in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Despite the substantial progress in localizing and deciphering the roles of new ciliary proteins involved in regulation of cilia beating, such as the recent discoveries of the CSC [27–30] and MIA complexes [3], we are still far from decoding the molecular mechanisms that govern cilia motility. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here, we present evidence that two highly evolutionarily conserved proteins, Fap43p and Fap44p, localize exclusively to cilia and are indispensable for proper cilia motility in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Deletion of either Fap43p or Fap44p results in abnormal cilia beating and reduced cell swimming velocity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In cilia, both proteins localize in close proximity to each other and to Fap57p, a large ciliary protein of unknown function, and most likely to IDA I1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Fap44p is missing from FAP43-KO mutant cilia, and likewise, Fap43p is absent from cilia lacking Fap44p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Thus, Fap43p and Fap44p are most likely subunits of a minor protein complex that is positioned in close proximity to IDA I1 and may regulate its activity. </plain></SENT>
