<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Median survival has improved to 45 years, in part because of improvement in care quality 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>An important quality improvement initiative is benchmarking, which involves identifying high-performing centres and the practices associated with outstanding performance 3– 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Since forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) is an important CF prognostic marker 6– 9, it is often used as an outcome measure for benchmarking 3– 5, 10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Different statistical methods of analysing FEV 1 data can yield different results 11, but there is scant attention paid to the methods of processing FEV 1 data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a statistically significant reduction in year-to-year %FEV 1 fall for our CF centre from 2013–2016 12. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Regulatory approval for the analysis was obtained from NHS Health Research Authority (IRAS number 210313). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>All adults with CF diagnosed according to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/the-work-we-do/clinical-care/consensus-documents">UK CF Trust criteria</ext-link> aged ≥16 years were included, except those with lung transplantation or on ivacaftor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These treatments have transformative effects on %FEV 1 13– 15, thus may affect the interpretation of year-to-year variation in %FEV 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Demographic data (age, gender, genotype, pancreatic status, CF related diabetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa status), body mass index (BMI) and FEV 1 data were collected by two investigators (HZH and RC / HZH and MEG) independently reviewing paper notes and electronic records. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Where data from the two investigators differ, the original data from paper notes or electronic records were reviewed to by both investigators to ensure the accuracy of abstracted data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This process ensures the accuracy of abstracted data and helps avoid potential bias from inaccurate or inconsistent data collection 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>FEV 1 data were processed with three different methods prior to analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>First, %FEV 1 readings (calculated with Knudson equation 17 and available in whole numbers) were directly extracted from spirometer machines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Second, FEV 1 volumes (in litres, to two decimal places) were extracted and clean height data were used to calculate %FEV 1 (as whole numbers) with Knudson equation 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Third, FEV 1 volumes (in litres, to two decimal places) were extracted and clean height data were used to calculate %FEV 1 with GLI equation 18 using an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ers-education.org/guidelines/global-lung-function-initiative/spirometry-tools/excel-sheet-calculator.aspx">Excel Macro</ext-link> (Microsoft Excel 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Best %FEV 1, i.e. the highest %FEV 1 reading in a calendar year for each study subject was used for analysis since it is most reflective of the true baseline %FEV 1 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Year-to-year %FEV 1 change was calculated by subtracting best %FEV 1 at Year 1 from Year 2 (i.e. negative values indicate fall in %FEV 1 and positive values indicate increase in %FEV 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition to calculating year-to-year %FEV 1 change using three different FEV 1 data processing methods, %FEV 1 change calculated with GLI equation was also adjusted for baseline %FEV 1 using reference values from Epidemiologic Study of CF (ESCF) 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The ESCF study found median %FEV 1 change of –3%/year, –2%/year and –0.5%/year for baseline %FEV1 ≥100%, 40–99.9% and &lt;40% respectively 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Adjusted %FEV 1 change was calculated by subtracting median ESCF %FEV 1 change from actual %FEV 1 change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Thus, an adjusted %FEV 1 change &gt;0 meant the subject’s year-to-year change in %FEV1 was less than expected (indicating better health outcome) whilst an adjusted %FEV 1 change &lt;0 meant the subject’s year-to-year change in %FEV 1 was more than expected (indicating worse health outcome). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that different centre-level year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 results were obtained using different FEV 1 data processing methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In particular, year-to-year fall in %FEV 1 was smaller in magnitude when %FEV 1 was calculated using GLI equation 18 instead of Knudson equation 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This is in part due to the demographic of our centre which has a relatively young adult population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>A previous study found a near-linear %FEV 1 decline from childhood to adulthood with GLI equation, whereas there was accelerated %FEV 1 decline during adolescence and young adulthood when %FEV 1 was calculated with Knudson equation 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>One advantage of using the GLI equation, which is seamless across all ages, is that it improves the interpretation of %FEV 1 decline 24, 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Another advantage is that %FEV 1 decline can be adjusted for baseline %FEV 1 using ESCF reference values (since the ESCF values for %FEV 1 decline were calculated using the GLI equation 20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The limitation for all single-centre analysis is the potential lack of generalisability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Another limitation of our analysis is that the ESCF reference values used to adjust year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 were derived using a cohort from around 15 years ago 20, and may not represent the current population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Our results nonetheless highlighted that year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 can be extremely sensitive to the FEV 1 data processing methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>This is one of the challenges of using year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 to infer quality of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Another challenge is that %FEV 1 lacks sensitivity as an outcome measure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>A recent sample size estimation using the UK CF registry data suggests that 273 adults per centre are needed to detect a 5% FEV 1 difference at the 95% significance level 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of measures used to detect variations in care quality is particularly pertinent to CF because a relatively small population is spread across many centres. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Indeed, only 6/28 (21.4%) of all <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cysticfibrosis.org.uk/the-work-we-do/uk-cf-registry/reporting-and-resources">UK adult CF centres</ext-link> have ≥273 adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>That means process measures, e.g. medication adherence, is important to detect variations in quality of CF care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Mant &amp; Hicks previous demonstrated that measuring processes of care proven in randomised controlled trials to reduce death allows detection of meaningful differences in care quality for myocardial infarction with just 75 cases, whereas 8179 cases would be needed if mortality was used as the quality indicator 27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Given the limitations of FEV 1 as an outcome measure in CF, results of centre comparisons based on FEV 1 data should be carefully interpreted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Observational studies with year-to-year variation in %FEV 1 as an outcome measure should carefully consider and clearly specify the data processing methods used. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normally the tendency would be for such errors to obscure, rather than generate, associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>This now-known, high error rate makes it less interesting to explore this section of the results.What does a Friedman test measure? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It’s a non-parametric version of a repeated measures one-way analysis of variance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two issues are worth considering.It requires a complete table, so only those subjects with all four years of data may be included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondly it produces a three degree of freedom test, which is not very well directed to address the most likely question of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We might be most interested in detecting a smooth, linear trend over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However just as much weight is being given to detect non-linear patterns such as curvature {low, high, high, low} and saw-tooth {low, high, low, high}. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>I don’t know how centres are compared officially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison of neighbouring years’ data would be unstable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, using these non-linear components could be very misleading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>I hope that the linear trend is used.Are there any alternative analyses that would address these two issues?Certainly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To begin with, let’s use the original data for FEV1% and not worry about their normality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>You could fit a mixed model to these data once you stack them in long format (“varstocases” in SPSS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This would enable you to use all data, not just data for those with a complete set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It would also enable you to extract a one degree of freedom test for trend across the four years.This should be a more powerful approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="?"><plain>I now see that the other referees refer to this as well, though I don’t agree that you need to have at least three observations per subject.  If you are worried about the normality (though the published quartiles are not that alarming) then two alternatives would be (1) to find a normalising transformation that would apply to the stacked column of FEV1% values, or (2) to use a rank-based transformation (“Fisher-Yates”) available in SPSS as “rank y /normal into z.”What might be the mathematics underlying any difference in slope obtained by the Knudson and GLI methods? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>I have tried to abstract the formulae used by Knudson and by GLIin deriving the predicted FEV1 that is used in the calculation of FEV1%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For a specific example I have chosen males (slightly more common in this study) aged 25 to 28 years (somewhere near the median age) with height of 175cm (just below mean UK adult height).   The Knudson equation has a functional form </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>FEV1 predicted = 5.1228 – 0.0292.age. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>FEV1% = FEV1/(FEV1 predicted) can then be differentiated to see how it varies with changes in age and FEV1 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However the GLI equivalent is given as point estimates from a Cole-Green LMS fitting procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The penalised cubic splines are not given, so no functional form is available. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They examined FEV1 decline from year to year by calculating variation in best FEV1 during two consecutive years and examined the impact of using data obtained using Knudson equation (directly extracted from the spirometer or recalculated with the appropriate height) vs. GLI equation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They also performed an adjustment using ESCF data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors concluded that trends in FEV1 decline were robust among methods, although the results were somewhat different using different methods/equations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study has some interest in highlighting problems associated with these type of calculations, especially when used for benchmarking (as in the UK). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I have the following comments for improvement:  An important drawback of Knusdon equation is related to the change of FEV1 in the transition from pediactric to adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is why the GLI is nowadays often used in mixed pediatric/adult population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="?"><plain>The authors used the UK definition of adults (over 16 years) and suggested that some of the difference in their results between Knudson and GLI data are due to the younger patients in this cohorts. I would be happier if the authors could perform a sensitivity analysis using only patients 18 years an over? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This would miniminze the Knusdon/GLI age bias and would make these results more relevant to the adult centres outside of UK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Looking at Table 1, it seems that only a minority of patients were below 18 years. I think the word FEV1 decline is inappropriate in this manuscript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A year to year variation (even over 3 years) is not a decline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For calculating a decline, you would need multiple data points (at the very least 3 data points) and perform more complicated analyses (e.g., mixed model analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>I would suggest to remove the word decline from the manuscript as the main goal of the authors did not appear to be FEV1 decline but mostly year to year FEV1 variation which is used for benchmarking in the UK. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although year to year subtraction is a method of looking at longitudinal changes, regression methodology is preferable to analyse these changes, especially, as in this case, where you have 3 time points. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We concur the GLI has been recently accepted as the standard for most CF registries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We concur that regression analyses is preferable to determine FEV1 decline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As recommended by Prof Burgel, we will replace the term "FEV1 decline" with "year-to-year FEV1 variation" in the revised manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We concur that the method used to adjust year-to-year FEV1 variation for baseline FEV1 is crude. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The displayed data from the ESCF paper is only presented according to the four FEV1 categories, hence our choice of adjustment method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Given the limited number of subjects within the Sheffield dataset, we felt is it is more appropriate to use reference values for suitably large datasets instead of simply calculating the predicted %FEV1 change using the Sheffield dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>There are more recent reference values for FEV1 from the ECFSPR (Boëlle et al, 2012) and Canadian registry (Kim et al, 2018); however those papers do not provide reference values for year-to-year FEV1 variation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Our statistical method account for repeated FEV1 measures since: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>1. by using best FEV1, there is only x1 FEV1 reading per person per year </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>2. only x1 FEV1 reading per person was used to calculate the year-to-year FEV1 variation  </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As mentioned in the discussion section, we concur that a single-centre study may not be generalisable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, inaccurate data recording within routine datasets (e.g. CF registries) is unlikely to be an isolated problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, the letter by Hartley et al (2016) in JCF revealed that 6% of the adults with CF at the Manchester Adult CF Centre had incorrect genotype data recorded in the UK CF registry. </plain></SENT>
