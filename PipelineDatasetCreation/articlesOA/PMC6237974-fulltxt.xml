For example, proteolysis is an irreversible, post-translational signalling cascade that modulates cell physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, whereas protein phosphorylation catalysed by receptor kinases is reversible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Although, the regulatory mechanisms of these two kinds of cellular signalling pathways have been extensively investigated, the cross-regulation between them is not fully understood. Recent studies in eukaryotes revealed that the proteolysis of receptor kinases is critical for regulating development, apoptosis and tumour genesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, in prokaryotic cells, how proteolysis modifies receptor kinases and controls their regulatory functions are incompletely understood.</p><p id="Par4">In gram-negative bacteria, regulated proteolysis catalysed by PDZ-domain-containing proteases, such as the HtrA-family proteases (high temperature requirement A) and tail-specific proteases (Tsp), modulates multiple physiological pathways, including virulence, stress response, quorum-sensing, protein quality control and antibiotic resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, these proteases are potential molecular targets for the development of novel antibacterial agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These proteases contain multiple domains, including one or more PDZ domains, and they are mostly located in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. PDZ domain-containing proteases regulate physiological processes by binding or cleaving their protein substrates in cells. For example, under stress conditions, the DegS protease of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cleaves anti-&#x003c3; factor RseA to release &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> from the membrane and then activates the transcription of various stress-response genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, a Tsp protease cleaves TcpP to initiate the subsequent proteolysis and inactivation of the membrane-bound transcription factor (TF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In addition to anti-&#x003c3; factors and TFs, studies revealed that PDZ domain-containing proteases also process misfolded proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, outer-membrane proteins, phosphatases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, haemagglutinin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and autotransporters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, identification of the physiological substrates of proteases remains technically challenging, and thus, the regulatory functions of most proteases are unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The majority of bacterial species belonging to the genus <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> are plant pathogens. Among them, <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> is the causative agent of rice bacterial blight disease, and <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> causes the black rot disease of crucifers. Both bacterial species encode at least six PDZ domain-containing proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The inactivation of one orthologous gene, <italic>prc</italic> (also named <italic>tsp</italic>), results in the attenuation of virulence and hypersensitivities to multiple environmental stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Prc of <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> is a periplasmic protein, and its cleavage substrate remains to be discovered. When the bacterium is grown under osmolarity stress (osmostress), Prc binds to a virulence-associated dipeptidyl peptidase (DppP). Rather than cleaving DppP, Prc stabilizes DppP, suggesting it has a chaperone activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, DppP is not a proteolytic substrate of Prc. More direct and effective approaches are necessary to identify the physiological substrates of this protease, which will allow the regulatory role of Prc to be determined.</p><p id="Par6">In the present study, we aim at identify the physiological substrates of Prc and investigate the role of Prc-catalysed proteolysis in controlling the environmental adaptation of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic>, which is more genetically amenable than <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Under osmostress, Prc directly binds and cleaves the N-terminal sensor region of VgrS, a canonical histidine kinase (HK) that controls bacterial virulence and stress responses. Cleavage of the VgrS sensor inhibits its autokinase activity, which then modulates the TF activity of the cognate VgrR in binding the promoters of downstream genes. This process significantly promotes bacterial resistance to osmostress. Our study reveal that the proteolytic processing of the sensor region of HK by protease is a molecular mechanism to control the TCS signalling of gram-negative bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Prc regulates virulence and bacterial stress resistance</title><p id="Par7">In <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> 8004, XC_0714 is the orthologue of Prc (PXO_04290) in <italic>X. oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> PXO99<sup>A</sup> (BlastP search, e-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0, identities&#x02009;=&#x02009;94%).

The bacterial cells of the &#x00394;prc-prc<sup>S475A</sup>-HA-FLAG strain were treated with osmostress consisting of 1.0&#x02009;M sorbitol before being lysed by freeze grinding, which prevented the dissociation of Prc&#x02013;protein interactions as much as possible. With or without osmostress treatment, the affinity proteomic screening, through two independent rounds of immunoprecipitation, obtained 20 and 36 proteins, respectively, with 12 being present under both conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

Because both mature Prc and the sensor region of VgrS are located in the periplasm, we hypothesized that Prc bound to the VgrS sensor. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> (lower left panel), a gel filtration analysis, together with analytical ultracentrifugation, revealed that Prc was present as a trimer (molecular weight&#x02009;=&#x02009;272.43&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;24.21&#x02009;kDa) and monomer (molecular weight&#x02009;=&#x02009;75.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.17&#x02009;kDa) in vitro. We purified a VgrS sensor peptide (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, lower right panel) and then used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the possible binding events between the VgrS sensor and different forms of Prc.

However, the VgrS sensor did not bind to the Prc trimer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). A microscale thermophoresis assay (MST) also confirmed direct binding between the Prc monomer and VgrS sensor in solution (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.090&#x02009;&#x003bc;M; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>).

However, SPR analyses showed that none of these proteins bound the VgrS sensor (data not shown). A subsequent analysis revealed that the VgrS sensor bound a recombinant Prc<sup>S475A</sup> containing peptidase and DUF regions with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of 22.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;M (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>).

Thus, the VgrS sensor bound the peptidase&#x02013;DUF region of the Prc monomer rather than the PDZ domain that usually acts as a docking site in protein&#x02013;protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Prc cleaves the VgrS sensor to inhibit autokinase activity</title><p id="Par13">VgrS is an HK with autokinase activity that is controlled by its periplasmic sensor region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The Prc binding to the VgrS sensor region suggests that Prc regulates the latter&#x02019;s autophosphorylation. Thus, an in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed to measure the VgrS autophosphorylation level in the presence of Prc. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, the addition of mature Prc to the reaction mixture decreased the autophosphorylation level of the full-length VgrS embedded in the inverted membrane vesicle (IMV) in less than 30&#x02009;s (Lanes 5&#x02013;8), while the addition of the inactive Prc<sup>S475A</sup> did not cause a similar effect (Lanes 9&#x02013;12). This demonstrated that the protease activity of Prc is important in inhibiting the autophosphorylation of VgrS. In addition, neither mature Prc nor inactive Prc<sup>S475A</sup> affected the autokinase activity of the truncated, soluble VgrS that contained the transmitter domain (MBP-VgrS<sup>cyto</sup>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Lanes 1&#x02013;6 and Lanes 10&#x02013;14, respectively), suggesting that Prc did not interact with the cytoplasmic region of VgrS. Because VgrS transfers the phosphoryl group onto the cognate response regulator (RR) VgrR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we also observed that the addition of Prc not only decreased the autophosphorylation of VgrS but also decreased the phosphorylation level of VgrR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Lane 6). Inactive Prc<sup>S475A</sup> did not have a similar impact (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Lane 8). Thus, Prc may inhibit the autophosphorylation of full-length VgrS, and the sensor region of VgrS appears to be indispensable for inhibition.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Prc cleaves the sensor region of VgrS to inhibit its autokinase activity. <bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold> Prc inhibited full-length VgrS autophosphorylation in a protease activity-dependent manner. <bold>a</bold> Full-length VgrS embedded in the inverted membrane vesicles (IMV, 10&#x02009;&#x003bc;M) was phosphorylated by [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP.

As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, within 60&#x02009;min, Prc cleaved the VgrS sensor into two parts and then completely degraded the sensor in vitro.

Furthermore, to determine whether this proteolytic process took place in vivo, recombinant strains in the &#x00394;vgrS mutant and the &#x00394;prc&#x00394;vgrS double-mutant genetic backgrounds were constructed (&#x00394;vgrS-vgrS<sup>HA</sup> and &#x00394;prc&#x00394;vgrS-vgrS<sup>HA</sup>, respectively; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Chloramphenicol was added to the bacterial cultures of the two strains to eliminate interference by de novo protein synthesis. Then, the bacterial cells were separately challenged with osmostress (1.0&#x02009;M sorbitol). As revealed by western blotting analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), after 5&#x02009;min of osmostress stimulation, the amount of the N-terminal HA-tag, which was detected by the HA monoclonal antibody, gradually decreased as osmostress treatment progressed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>, upper panel, Lanes 6&#x02013;10).

A peptide with a mass-to-charge ratio of 2771.5 was obtained (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, upper panel), and subsequent MS/MS analysis revealed that Prc cleaved the VgrS sensor at the site between Ala<sup>9</sup> and Gln<sup>10</sup> after 10&#x02009;min of co-incubation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, c, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>).

All of these regulatory modes are reversible in controlling HK phosphorylation. However, irreversible proteolytic modifications of HKs are less well-studied. In the present work, we demonstrated that under osmostress, a Prc protease of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> specifically cleaved the periplasmic sensor region of an HK, VgrS, and inhibited its autokinase activity.

The results of our study indicated that the cleavage of HK sensors by proteases localized in periplasmic space, including Prc/Tsp-family (MEROPS S41A-family) and HtrA-family proteases (MEROPS S1-family)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, is important for regulating bacterial adaptation because, in gram-negative bacteria, a majority of the HKs contain periplasmic sensors to detect environmental signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Compared with reversible dephosphorylation, proteolysis of the HK sensor holds advantages in regulating TCS signalling: cleavage takes place in the periplasm, rather than the cytoplasm, which is more efficient because it shortens the distance travelled by TM signals. In particular, irreversible proteolysis avoids the continuing phosphorylation of existing HKs, which is more effective if reversible phosphorylation is extremely detrimental to bacterial survival in certain circumstances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, more experimental studies are needed for the following reasons: (1) there is no consensus recognition or processing sequence for the Prc/Tsp-family and HtrA-family proteases, which makes it difficult to predict the physiological substrates of these proteases. (2) as our results revealed, proteolytic processing of the VgrS sensor by the Prc protease is specific and adaptive to the osmostress response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), suggesting that protease&#x02013;HK interactions are highly specific to environmental signals.</p><p id="Par27">VgrS&#x02013;VgrR is a pleiotropic TCS of <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic>.

The VgrS sensor contains an EPQE motif to directly bind ferric iron. In iron-depleted environments, VgrS maintains a high level of autophosphorylation and then phosphorylates VgrR to regulate the expression of virulence factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Substitutions of the conserved phosphorylation sites in VgrS (His<sup>186</sup>) or VgrR (Asp<sup>51</sup>) caused decreases in virulence against host cabbage. However, here, in a <italic>prc</italic> mutant that exhibited a growth deficiency under osmostress, various mutations of <italic>vgrS</italic>, including deletion of the N-terminal sequence that mimics cleavage by Prc, effectively suppressed the growth deficiency caused by the null mutation of <italic>prc</italic> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>).

Thus, a low level of VgrS phosphorylation may promote bacterial resistance to osmostress, and the inhibition of VgrS autokinase activity by Prc proteolysis is an effective mechanism. In bacteria, a number of RRs are degraded by proteases in the cytosol, such as CtrA of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and DegU of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Compared with the proteolysis of RRs, the cleavage of HKs by proteases may be more flexible in TCS regulation because of the following: (1) HK is a receptor, rather than an effector, in cell signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Thus, degradation of the HK only impacts the phosphorylation level of the cognate RR (effector). This does not cause complete inactivation of the TCS because the dephosphorylated RR can continue to regulate physiological processes. (2) Bacteria usually encode paralogous TCSs that are generated by operon duplication during evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. These TCSs form regulatory networks, and the proteolysis of an HK reinforces the signalling of the existing compensatory pathways of these paralogous TCS. This is probably important for the VgrS&#x02013;VgrR system because there are two functionally unknown, paralogous TCSs in <italic>X. campestris</italic> pv. <italic>campestris</italic> (XC_3126-XC_3125 and XC_3452-XC_3451)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. (3) The phosphatase activity of HK is essential for maintaining high levels of specificity between cognate HKs and RRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. The proteolysis of an HK releases the inhibition on the illegitimate phosphorylation of the RR and then provides an opportunity for cross-talk among different TCSs.

The presence of NlpI enhances Prc protease activity by 50-fold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our TAP analysis provided information on Prc-binding proteins, but it is difficult to predict which one is the Prc adaptor used during processing of the VgrS sensor because adaptors are diverse in structure and include lipoproteins, RRs and arginine kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, how the Prc protease is activated to cleave the VgrS sensor remains unclear. Our preliminary experiment showed that a high concentration of sorbitol (200&#x02009;mM to 1.0&#x02009;M) did not affect the enzymatic activity of Prc, indicating that Prc itself is not a sensor that directly detects osmostress. As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> revealed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, Prc exists as a monomer or trimer in vitro, and only monomeric Prc bound and degraded the VgrS sensor (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, e</xref>). This implied that alteration of the quaternary structure of Prc might act as a molecular mechanism to activate its protease activity in vivo.</p><p id="Par29">In addition, the regulatory functions of the proteolytic products of VgrS are unknown. In eukaryotes, fragments of receptor kinases generated by proteases are usually stably maintained in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. These fragments serve as dominant negative factors, decoy receptors or even cellular signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. As Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> show, Prc proteolysis produced a short N-terminal peptide and a truncated VgrS. The two fragments were detected by western blotting and MS analysis, and they were relatively stable. In TCS regulation, the majority of HKs constitutively form homodimers that are autophosphorylated in a <italic>trans</italic> manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The presence of a truncated, &#x0201c;decoy&#x0201d; VgrS may disturb this process. Furthermore, if VgrS and its paralogous HKs (XC_3125 and XC_3451) constitute regulatory heterodimers, VgrS proteolysis could affect the signalling of other TCSs. The biological roles and fates of the two fragments remain unclear. Future investigations are needed to study the activating mechanism of Prc under osmostress and the regulatory roles of HK fragments. The results will provide insights into the cross-talk between TCS signalling and regulation through proteolysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p id="Par30">Strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was used to express recombinant proteins, and <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH5&#x003b1; (Lab collection) was used for molecular cloning.
