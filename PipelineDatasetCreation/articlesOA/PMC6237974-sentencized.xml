</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, signalling pathways can be generally divided into two major modes according to the persistence of protein participants: reversible and irreversible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For example, proteolysis is an irreversible, post-translational signalling cascade that modulates cell physiology1,2, whereas protein phosphorylation catalysed by receptor kinases is reversible3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although, the regulatory mechanisms of these two kinds of cellular signalling pathways have been extensively investigated, the cross-regulation between them is not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Recent studies in eukaryotes revealed that the proteolysis of receptor kinases is critical for regulating development, apoptosis and tumour genesis4–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in prokaryotic cells, how proteolysis modifies receptor kinases and controls their regulatory functions are incompletely understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In gram-negative bacteria, regulated proteolysis catalysed by PDZ-domain-containing proteases, such as the HtrA-family proteases (high temperature requirement A) and tail-specific proteases (Tsp), modulates multiple physiological pathways, including virulence, stress response, quorum-sensing, protein quality control and antibiotic resistance7,8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, these proteases are potential molecular targets for the development of novel antibacterial agents9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These proteases contain multiple domains, including one or more PDZ domains, and they are mostly located in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>PDZ domain-containing proteases regulate physiological processes by binding or cleaving their protein substrates in cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>For example, under stress conditions, the DegS protease of Escherichia coli cleaves anti-σ factor RseA to release σE from the membrane and then activates the transcription of various stress-response genes11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In Vibrio cholerae, a Tsp protease cleaves TcpP to initiate the subsequent proteolysis and inactivation of the membrane-bound transcription factor (TF)12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition to anti-σ factors and TFs, studies revealed that PDZ domain-containing proteases also process misfolded proteins13, outer-membrane proteins, phosphatases14, haemagglutinin15 and autotransporters16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, identification of the physiological substrates of proteases remains technically challenging, and thus, the regulatory functions of most proteases are unclear17. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The majority of bacterial species belonging to the genus Xanthomonas are plant pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Among them, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is the causative agent of rice bacterial blight disease, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris causes the black rot disease of crucifers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Both bacterial species encode at least six PDZ domain-containing proteases18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The inactivation of one orthologous gene, prc (also named tsp), results in the attenuation of virulence and hypersensitivities to multiple environmental stresses18,19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Prc of X. oryzae pv. oryzae is a periplasmic protein, and its cleavage substrate remains to be discovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>When the bacterium is grown under osmolarity stress (osmostress), Prc binds to a virulence-associated dipeptidyl peptidase (DppP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Rather than cleaving DppP, Prc stabilizes DppP, suggesting it has a chaperone activity18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DppP is not a proteolytic substrate of Prc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>More direct and effective approaches are necessary to identify the physiological substrates of this protease, which will allow the regulatory role of Prc to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we aim at identify the physiological substrates of Prc and investigate the role of Prc-catalysed proteolysis in controlling the environmental adaptation of X. campestris pv. campestris, which is more genetically amenable than X. oryzae pv. oryzae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Under osmostress, Prc directly binds and cleaves the N-terminal sensor region of VgrS, a canonical histidine kinase (HK) that controls bacterial virulence and stress responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Cleavage of the VgrS sensor inhibits its autokinase activity, which then modulates the TF activity of the cognate VgrR in binding the promoters of downstream genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This process significantly promotes bacterial resistance to osmostress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our study reveal that the proteolytic processing of the sensor region of HK by protease is a molecular mechanism to control the TCS signalling of gram-negative bacteria. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we demonstrated that under osmostress, a Prc protease of X. campestris pv. campestris specifically cleaved the periplasmic sensor region of an HK, VgrS, and inhibited its autokinase activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Although studies investigating the relationship between proteases and HKs are lacking in bacteria, the proteolysis of Thr/Ser/Tyr receptor kinases to modulate their activities has been extensively studied in eukaryotic cells5,34,35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>In Proteobacteria, Prc/Tsp-family proteases are widely distributed. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>For example, the Prc of E. coli controls cell wall synthesis and antibiotic resistance by degrading peptidoglycan hydrolases or outer-membrane lipoproteins38,39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>The results of our study indicated that the cleavage of HK sensors by proteases localized in periplasmic space, including Prc/Tsp-family (MEROPS S41A-family) and HtrA-family proteases (MEROPS S1-family)40, is important for regulating bacterial adaptation because, in gram-negative bacteria, a majority of the HKs contain periplasmic sensors to detect environmental signals33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Compared with reversible dephosphorylation, proteolysis of the HK sensor holds advantages in regulating TCS signalling: cleavage takes place in the periplasm, rather than the cytoplasm, which is more efficient because it shortens the distance travelled by TM signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In particular, irreversible proteolysis avoids the continuing phosphorylation of existing HKs, which is more effective if reversible phosphorylation is extremely detrimental to bacterial survival in certain circumstances1,17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>However, more experimental studies are needed for the following reasons: (1) there is no consensus recognition or processing sequence for the Prc/Tsp-family and HtrA-family proteases, which makes it difficult to predict the physiological substrates of these proteases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>(2) as our results revealed, proteolytic processing of the VgrS sensor by the Prc protease is specific and adaptive to the osmostress response (Fig. 6), suggesting that protease–HK interactions are highly specific to environmental signals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The VgrS sensor contains an EPQE motif to directly bind ferric iron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>In iron-depleted environments, VgrS maintains a high level of autophosphorylation and then phosphorylates VgrR to regulate the expression of virulence factors25. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Compared with the proteolysis of RRs, the cleavage of HKs by proteases may be more flexible in TCS regulation because of the following: (1) HK is a receptor, rather than an effector, in cell signalling43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Thus, degradation of the HK only impacts the phosphorylation level of the cognate RR (effector). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This does not cause complete inactivation of the TCS because the dephosphorylated RR can continue to regulate physiological processes. </plain></SENT>
