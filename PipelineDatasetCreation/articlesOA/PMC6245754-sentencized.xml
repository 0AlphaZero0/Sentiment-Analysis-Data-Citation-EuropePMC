</text></title><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Plant development is a complex process scarcely studied in woody plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>After seed germination, the seedling grows to become a sapling that later makes phase transitions from the juvenile stage to become an adult tree, which has acquired competence for reproduction, completing the life cycle in the reproductive phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Despite its relevance, the genetic control of the early steps of tree development has received little attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In practical terms, the study of the genetic changes in normal olive-tree development is relevant to breeders seeking to shorten the unproductive juvenile period [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular basis of these characteristics and improving the efficiency of such breeding programs require the development of genomic information and tools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In previous work, we generated cDNA sequences from Sanger-sequencing and pyrosequencing 454 Roche technology to identify the whole transcriptome of olive by sequencing different juvenile and adult tissues from several olive-tree cultivars [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Their assembly and functional annotation facilitated the generation of an EST Olive Array to enable the first study of the juvenile-to-adult transition genetic control in Olea europaea [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In that study, the transcriptional changes that took place during development of trees 6 to 33 months old were analyzed by microarray hybridization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The study revealed that transcriptomic changes preceded the juvenile-to-adult phase transition and occurred when the tree trunk had developed between 30 and 45 nodes and at least 18 months prior to the first flowering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, the main genetic changes at the juvenile-to-adult phase transition are controlled by a complementary expression pattern of the miRNAs, miR156 and miR172 [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These miRNAs also control the vegetative phase change in trees [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Also, miR156 and miR172 have been found in olive [7], and target genes such as the AP2-like transcription-factor family appear to be regulated in the same way as in Arabidopsis [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, before reaching the juvenile-to-adult transition, the seedling should have developed nearly 45 nodes, but studies are lacking on this period of olive-tree development and in woody plants in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>New olive transcriptomes have been published recently, regarding to a developmental process as it is the plant architecture [8], or in response to a biotic stress [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Here, we report a transcriptional study of monthly samples from a number of seedlings from open pollinated olive trees cv. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Arbequina over the first six months after germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at developing a quite complete transcriptome dataset for olive development using RNAseq by Illumina and at studying the dynamic regulation of the transcriptomic response during the early-juvenile period by time-series-expression analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Tree development is a poorly studied process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Phase change in woody perennials is associated with the plant reaching a certain size [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In olive trees, the size to change from juvenile to adult tree is around 30–45 nodes [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>However, prior to this phase transition the germinating seedling must develop into a juvenile tree, and this is the developmental process analyzed by a transcriptomic approach in this work. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The results of expression analysis of genes coding for transcription factors identified as likely being involved in plant development, indicated a change in gene expression two months after induction of germination (IG), which coincided with the transplanting of the seedlings to pots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Probably more significant was the change in gene expression after the first three months of growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>In fact, the analysis of the RNAseq data by time series showed that in the first three months there are major changes in expression of genes involved in plant development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, after this three-month period, the gene expression of many plant development related genes became substantially more stable, indicating that the development of the juvenile tree from the seed was completed and that the juvenile entered a growth period that would eventually transition to the adult phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The three-month-old plants averaged 7.2 nodes per plant, most having 6 or more nodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 6–7 nodes appear to mark the size at which the seedling becomes a juvenile tree. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Due to the high complexity of the changes of gene expression in GO terms related to plant development, a model of the main changes was built (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In fact, the model is separated into two classes, genes involved directly in plant development (Fig. 6a) and genes involved in hormone biosynthesis or genes regulated by hormones (Fig. 6b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>There are genes that increase their expression during the six-month follow-up, as is the case of genes involved in DNA methylation, first increasing de novo DNA methylation and then its maintenance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the fact that one-month-old samples had embryonic structures; in fact, the distinction between shoots and roots was not very clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In the samples two-month-old and older, structures became more defined and cell differentiation increased, so that DNA methylation must take place as cells differentiate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Thus it is consistent with the other type of genes that increase their expression with the same pattern, as genes for leaf pavement cell development and epidermal cell differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In addition, in this same pattern the genes involved in release of dormancy increased as do the lignin biosynthesis genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>At the second month, the genes for xylem and phloem pattern formation were downregulated while the xylem and phloem histogenesis genes were induced and maintained high throughout the follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, genes for cell fate specification, tissue development, and specification of plant organ identity are also repressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the main structures were established and the cells were committed to their fate by this time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>At the second and third month of development, key changes of gene expression were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Thus, a set of genes regulating plant development were induced, but one month later a different set of genes of the same GO term were repressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Also at the second month after germination, leaf senescence genes were up-regulated and at the third month programmed cell death genes were upregulated, too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The programmed cell death is considered as the end point of leaf senescence but can also be involved in leaf maturation, so these results indicate that by this time the final stages in the development of certain major plant structures were complete.Fig. 6A model for gene expression of GO terms related to hormone regulation and plant development during the germination to the juvenile tree developmental process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Plant development (a); plant-hormone biosynthesis and regulated genes (b) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The model for hormone-related genes is quite complex because most hormones are involved in different processes (Fig. 6b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a key observation was that sets of genes under hormonal control or genes for hormone biosynthesis or degradation themselves were up- or downregulated during the first three months to finally reach a more stable state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>This finding agrees with the observations made for the genes directly involved in plant development in Fig. 6a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Therefore, all the findings in this transcriptomic study point towards the conclusion of that embryonic development finishes when the seedling reaches a size of 6–7 nodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>At this time, all the plant structures and the cell and organ differentiation of a juvenile tree have developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In addition to this finding, we detected sets of genes activated by gibberellin or abscisic acid (GA and ABA, respectively) in the transcriptome of germinating olives that are switched off after two or three months from IG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>GA and ABA are involved in the germination of cereals by controlling in an opposing way the expression of a number of genes, for instance, starch degradation and the function of the endosperm after germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Several hormones, such as GA, auxin (IAA), cytokinins, ethylene, and brassinosteroids, promote stem and/or leaf growth by stimulating cell elongation and/or division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that sets of genes regulated by different hormones are induced after the first two months, when the germinating process appears to finish and the plant begins a phase of vegetative growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>In addition to the general examination of gene changes during the early stages of plant development, we focused special attention on two genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>First, an AGL-gene (contig_11,388) from the transcriptome described in [2] was found to be expressed only in seeds (Fig. 3a, b) and rapidly downregulated during the induction of the germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>The repression of this gene is very strong, and expression levels remain low throughout plant development from seedling emergence to the adult tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this gene might be involved in seed dormancy and could be a repressor of germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Further work is required to confirm this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Finally, another gene (contig_34,438) described in an earlier transcriptome [2], according to its annotation and expression profile is likely the APL1-like gene of olive, a gene exhibiting type-A function during flower development (Fig. 3c, d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>This gene is over-expressed during flowering, but we found that it was also expressed during the cold incubation in the activation of embryo germination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This expression declines at two months after IG, just when the results of this work indicate that the embryo cells were committed to their fate and the seedlings had determined the main structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that the APL1-like gene in olive may play a role during the embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
