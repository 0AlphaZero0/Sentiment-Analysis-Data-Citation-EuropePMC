</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tears are the most common pathology to afflict the knee meniscus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their direct symptoms include pain, mechanical deficiency and increased risk of osteoarthritis [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Meniscus tears can also cause serious secondary harm, as the most straightforward treatment for a tear—partial or total meniscectomy—further increases the risk of osteoarthritis [5–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, repair of a torn meniscus, especially when the tear is in the inner avascular region, is not always feasible [1,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Some in vivo meniscus tears occur suddenly, suggestive of immediate rupture from a single overload event [11–17], whereas others grow over time [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although short (less than 5–10 mm) tears often do not merit immediate clinical concern [15,20–22], they have the potential to grow and become more serious with time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To aid efforts to prevent and to repair meniscus tears, it is important to understand the mechanics of how they form and grow. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A meniscus tear, viewed from an engineering perspective, is a macroscopic crack-like defect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In this work, ‘meniscus tear’ will be used to refer to the clinical pathology, and ‘meniscus crack’ will be used in the engineering sense to mean a macroscopic crack-like defect in the meniscus, regardless of whether it is a natural meniscus tear or an artificial crack-like defect such as a cut. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A crack typically creates a stress concentration at its tip, which often, but not always, causes crack growth and reduces ultimate stress (maximum engineering stress prior to rupture) [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Study of this type of failure comprises the field of fracture mechanics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="?"><plain>The central question concerning meniscus cracks is: do cracks reduce the stress-bearing capacity of meniscus tissue, or is meniscus tissue insensitive to them? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The effect of a crack depends on the material’s fracture toughness and the severity of the crack-induced stress concentration (figure 1) [23,24,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>If the stress concentration is large relative to the material’s fracture toughness, it causes local rupture at the crack tip, crack growth and a reduction in ultimate stress (fracture mechanics region, figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this case, a fracture mechanics approach should be used to quantify rupture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>If the stress concentration is small relative to the material’s fracture toughness, the crack has negligible effect, and the ultimate stress is equal to the ultimate tensile strength (limit stress analysis region, figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this case, limit stress analysis (comparison of applied stress to material properties, such as ultimate tensile strength) should be used to quantify rupture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of limit stress analysis-dominant rupture would not necessarily mean that defects such as microcracks are uninvolved in failure, but it would indicate that the primary impetus of rupture was not macroscale crack growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>To permit accurate failure analysis of meniscus bearing a short tear, it is crucial to determine if meniscus tissue containing a short crack ruptures by fracture mechanics-dominant processes or limit stress analysis-dominant processes. Figure 1.Schematic of ultimate stress variation with fracture toughness and stress concentration severity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Fracture mechanics governs failure when the material's fracture toughness is small relative to a local stress concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Limit stress analysis governs failure when the material is sufficiently tough to tolerate any stress concentrations that are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In the fracture mechanics case, σu&lt;σUTS; in the limit stress case, σu = σUTS [23,24,26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The idea that the meniscus ruptures by fracture mechanics-dominant processes has some experimental support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Meniscus tears grow in vivo [18,19], suggesting that crack growth in the fracture mechanics sense may have a role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Superficial zone articular cartilage, which is similar to meniscus, has been observed to rupture by fracture mechanics-dominant processes [26,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, cracks in tendon, which like meniscus contains highly aligned collagen fascicles, tend to become blunt instead of growing [28–33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that limit stress analysis is more appropriate for cracked tendon, and by extension possibly also for meniscus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>It remains uncertain which rupture process is relevant for meniscus, and mechanical tests are needed to resolve this uncertainty. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To determine if cracked meniscus fails by fracture mechanics-dominant processes, we chose to compare the ultimate stress of cracked meniscus specimens to identically tested intact control specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This test has been specifically recommended for application to fibrous soft tissues for which the dominant failure process is not known [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Cracked specimens were prepared with crack length much longer than any pre-existing defects that may have been present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Because stress concentration severity increases with crack length, cracked specimens will lie to the left of the control specimens on figure 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>If the cracked specimens lie in the fracture mechanics region, they will have ultimate stress less than controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>If the cracked specimens instead lie in the limit stress analysis region, they will have ultimate stress equal to the controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Observation of either outcome is valuable; either the results provide a necessary foundation to support subsequent fracture toughness measurements, or they rule out risk of crack-induced weakness for the tested crack geometry and loading conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Independent of which process governs rupture, the potential for cracks to alter stress and strain fields within the meniscus is also of interest—specifically, the potential for near-tip stress concentrations and unloaded regions on either side of the crack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>A stress and strain concentration may cause stress to locally exceed the elastic limit and hence cause local tissue or cell damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Conversely, unloaded regions may cause long-term cell-mediated degeneration by abolishing mechanical signals necessary for homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The idea that a near-tip stress concentration produces local damage is supported by the observation that tissue near the tip of a naturally occurring meniscus tear takes less energy to rupture than tissue in a crack-free contralateral control meniscus [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Concerning unloaded regions, a crack in a meniscus-mimicking synthetic scaffold has been observed to reduce strain in the regions that include material cut by the crack [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Quantification of any crack-induced stress–strain concentrations and unloaded regions is needed to determine if these mechanical phenomena may have a role in meniscus tear pathology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The particular objectives of this study were, for meniscus tissue with a short crack: (a) to determine whether fracture mechanics or limit stress analysis is appropriate for failure analysis; (b) to quantify strain concentrations in the region near the crack tip and (c) to quantify the degree of unloading in the cut material to either side of a crack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Meniscus specimens with and without artificially introduced cracks were tested in both circumferential and radial uniaxial tension so as to examine both fibre and matrix rupture phenomena, and because tensile load support is a key aspect of meniscus function [36–41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that meniscus cracks reduce ultimate stress and cause rupture by fracture mechanics-dominant processes (objective a), ultimate stress was compared between cracked and crack-free specimens as recommended by Taylor et al. [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that near-tip strain concentrations are present and to measure their magnitude (objective b), strain fields were measured using digital image correlation (DIC) and strain in cracked specimens was compared between their near-tip and away-from-tip regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Similarly, to test the hypothesis that the regions to either side of a crack, which contain cut material, are unloaded (objective c), strain in cracked specimens was compared between their cut and intact regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Results are discussed in terms of their significance with respect to whole-meniscus damage and failure. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Specimens were prepared for three test groups—circumferential tension with a 90° edge crack, circumferential tension with a 45° centre crack and radial tension with a 90° edge crack—with corresponding circumferential and radial tension crack-free control groups (figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>These test groups were chosen based on prior simulation results [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>As established by prior work [43], circumferential specimens were made with expanded grip regions to facilitate fibre loading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Bovine menisci (age &gt; 30 months and skeletally mature, mixed lateral and medial, mixed sex) were purchased fresh-frozen from Animal Technologies, Inc. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Medial and lateral menisci were pooled because previous work has found only slight or no differences in mechanical properties between medial and lateral menisci [52,53,55,56], so there was no reason to arbitrarily exclude either group.

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>One specimen per meniscus was prepared using a Leica SM2400 sledge microtome, with a freezing stage, to plane the meniscus to a target thickness of 1.0–1.5 mm, with the specimen plane normal to the proximal-distal axis [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Including the microtomy, each specimen underwent 3–4 freeze–thaw cycles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The specimen was then trimmed to its final in-plane dimensions, its cross-sectional area measured by scanning across its width with a laser displacement sensor [58,59], and its surface airbrushed with Verhoeff’s stain to facilitate DIC from test video. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>From a clinical perspective, the 3 mm crack length was chosen because it is representative of ‘short’ tears (less than 5–10 mm long) that have not yet grown to cause definite clinical concern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>From an engineering perspective, the 3 mm length is a compromise—long cracks are useful in that they produce larger stress concentrations, but the crack must be short enough so that the crack tip-associated failure zone has sufficient space to develop fully and produce crack propagation in the fracture mechanics sense. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Tensile testing was done following standard procedures [43,45,47,48,50,52,57,60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The tensile test protocol consisted of (a) 20 kPa preload, which was used to establish the specimen’s undeformed reference length, (b) 10 cycles of preconditioning to 4% grip-to-grip engineering strain and (c) stretch to failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The displacement rate was 0.5 mm s−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Video of the test was recorded at 15 fps and 1392 × 1000 px. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The image scale was approximately 40 px mm−1 for circumferential specimens and approximately 60 px mm−1 for radial specimens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Ruptures of tested specimens were classified according to published definitions [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Briefly, midsubstance rupture means the rupture zone touched neither grip line, mixed rupture means the rupture zone was in the midsubstance but touched at least one grip line, and grip line rupture means the rupture was entirely within 1 mm of a grip line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Tests with rupture or slip inside the grips (longitudinal split, gripped region failure or no rupture) were excluded from analysis because mean stress in the failure region cannot be accurately calculated for these failure types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The counts of each type of rupture are presented in table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The counts of tests used for analysis are given by group in figure 2b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In prior work, grip line failures were often excluded from analysis as a precautionary measure [45,57,61,62], although quantitative comparison of at-grip and midsubstance failures in fibrous soft tissue has shown no difference [43,63,64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In this study, midsubstance, mixed and grip line failures were all used for this analysis because, specifically under the present test protocol, they are known to not differ in their stress–strain responses [43].

<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>(These points are visually marked in the results; figure 4.) Strain was calculated using the current grip-to-grip length l and the reference grip-to-grip length l0 and reported as stretch ratio (λ = l/l0) or Lagrange strain (ɛ = 1/2[λ2 − 1]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The yield point was identified as the inflection point in the stress–strain curve as done previously [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Note that for tissue tests the yield point is not customarily equated with the elastic limit, in part, because the role of plasticity with respect to tissue remains ambiguous [43,65–71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>For cracked specimens, the uncut transverse cross-sectional area (thickness × (total width − transverse axis component of crack length)) was used for stress calculations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Lagrange strain fields were computed across the specimen surface from the video recordings using two-dimensional DIC (Vic-2D 2009; Correlated Solutions, Columbia, SC) [31,43,72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Three DIC strain components were analysed: longitudinal strain (grip-to-grip direction; Exx), transverse strain (Eyy) and shear strain magnitude (|Exy|). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The correlation window (subset size) was 0.7 × 0.7 mm, and incremental correlation, exhaustive search and low-pass filtering were enabled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Strain accumulation error from incremental correlation was negligible; for this test, apparatus and the number of frames analysed, strain error for each pixel is less than or equal to 0.001. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Post-processing used a 15 px exponential decay filter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Trial runs during study development showed that only the subset size setting had a strong influence on the calculated strain field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The choice of 0.7 × 0.7 mm subset size was a compromise between the needs of (a) minimizing spurious correlations, which favours a large correlation window, and (b) retaining spatial resolution to identify strain concentrations and inter-fascicle sliding, which favours a small correlation window. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of strain fields was done by comparison of strain statistics between regions of interest (ROIs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>To test for the existence of strain concentrations near the crack tip, the DIC strain field was partitioned into near-tip and away-from-tip ROIs (figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The ROI size was chosen to be of similar size to the strain concentrations visible in the strain field images. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The near-tip ROIs for analysis of Exx extended, relative to the crack tip, +0.7 mm in the crack pointing direction and ±0.7 mm in the loading direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The near-tip ROI size was set to approximately the subset window size because this is the smallest size that is reasonable for analysing spatial variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The near-tip ROIs for analysis of Eyy and Exy were similarly defined to extend +0.7 mm in the crack pointing direction and, because features in the Eyy and Exy strain fields were elongated in the loading direction, ±1.05 mm in the loading direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>To test for differences in strain between tissue cut and not cut by a crack, ‘cut’ and ‘intact’ ROIs were also defined (figure 7a). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This study’s objectives were to determine whether a short crack in meniscus tissue reduces the meniscus’ ultimate stress in tension and hence requires failure analysis by fracture mechanics methods and, furthermore, to determine whether a crack alters the strain field by creating a near-tip strain concentration and an unloaded region in the cut material on either side of the crack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>No reduction in ultimate stress in cracked specimens was detected relative to controls (figure 3), indicating that limit stress analysis is appropriate for failure analysis, and that fracture mechanics analysis is not required, in the tested conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Since the study was adequately powered to detect a meaningful (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>1 s.d.) decrease in ultimate stress, these results are robust evidence for preservation of ultimate stress in the presence of a short crack. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Regarding strain concentrations, greater tissue strain was observed near the crack tip (figure 5), implying the existence of a corresponding near-tip stress concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the presence of near-tip strain concentrations, the region containing material cut by the crack (the cut ROI) had reduced strain, implying that it was partially unloaded (figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Although the alterations in the strain field did not measurably influence the meniscus’ rupture in terms of the overall stress–strain curve, the near-tip stress concentration does pose a risk of sub-rupture local tissue damage. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The preservation of ultimate stress in cracked specimens and the tendency for ruptures to occur simultaneously through the entire cross-section implies a high degree of resistance to crack growth (fracture toughness). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Although half of radial specimens exhibited crack growth, this occurred at or past the ultimate stress point, by which time rupture was well underway by other mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of unstable crack growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This crack growth may, therefore, be considered incidental, similar to the final fracture of a highly tough and ductile test piece [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>High fracture toughness is desirable for meniscus because the maintenance of strength, despite the presence of a crack, lessens the risk of further failure and loss of function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Note that a crack will still reduce the cross-sectional area and, in proportion, the total force that the meniscus can support. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>However, the present study’s results indicate that short (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>3 mm) tears in single-cycle loading are unlikely to accelerate failure by crack growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Longer cracks, in principle, produce stronger stress concentrations. In vivo meniscus tears that are considered to definitely require clinical treatment are 5 to 25 mm long [15,20–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>These tears may exceed the critical crack length for fracture mechanics-dominant rupture (i.e. fracture) [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>However, the apparently low risk associated with a short (natural) tear is still beneficial because it should delay the growth of the tear to a critical size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Attempts to replace meniscus tissue with engineered materials should consider replication of the meniscus’ fracture toughness as a design requirement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This assessment of low risk for a short meniscus tear has caveats, as it is based on excised tissue tests with test conditions that were, by necessity, artificial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Specimen size and hence crack length was small, only edge and centre cracks were examined, specimens were cut only from the centre of the meniscus, specimens were loaded only in circumferential and radial uniaxial tension, cutting specimens may cause loss of fibre integrity, the loading rate was relatively slow (0.5 mm s−1), and unlike the natural enthesis tensile grips work by compression and friction rather than by individually anchoring each fibre. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Use of dead and previously frozen tissue could also in principle have affected the results, although prior work indicates that freezing has a small (approx. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>10%) or no effect on fibrous soft tissue properties, and it has not been shown to alter their fundamental mechanical behaviour [74–83]. In vivo, tears come in a wide variety of geometries and the meniscus is subjected to surface contact and multiaxial, heterogeneous stress [36,37,41,55,84–87]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Considerable work remains to develop laboratory test methods that reproduce the wide variety of loading conditions under which the meniscus must function in vivo, and to quantify damage and failure in those conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Pending development of more advanced methods, however, the present results support a low risk of total rupture due to short tears. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>These strain concentrations were substantial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Depending on the test scenario and stress level, mean longitudinal strain was increased by 20% to 50% and mean shear strain magnitude was increased by 20% to 80% (figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Groups with more complete unloading of the cut ROI (circumferential and radial edge crack specimens) also had greater near-tip Exx concentrations, consistent with load redistribution around the crack being the cause of the strain concentrations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This near-tip overstrain has potential to cause local damage and failure under normal load levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Damage is generally reported to begin at 0.05–0.08 strain in tendon and ligament [88–91], with one study showing a damage threshold of approximately 0.02 strain [92], but thresholds for damage or permanent deformation are not known for meniscus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>If the meniscus is similar to tendon and ligament, the stress threshold at which a crack makes meniscus tissue vulnerable to damage would be 25–50% of its tensile strength; that is, 9–17 MPa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>At these stress levels, crack blunting via inter-fascicle shear was prevalent in circumferential edge and centre crack specimens and rupture from the crack tip along fascicle boundaries was prevalent in circumferential edge crack specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the near-tip shear concentrations facilitated sliding and rupture at the fascicle interfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the existence of zones of weakness near the tips of natural meniscus tears suggests that damage due to strain concentrations also occurs in vivo [21]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Fracture toughness represents the energy required for crack growth. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The observed near-tip zone of local overstrain and probable damage may function as a dissipative zone, with the function of increasing toughness and limiting crack growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Inter-fascicle shear, which was especially strong in circumferential specimens, may increase the meniscus’ toughness by absorbing energy through fascicle sliding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Inter-fascicle sliding also deflects the path of rupture along fascicle boundaries (e.g. figure 8d), which due to the circumferential specimens’ geometry promotes rupture by processes other than mode I crack opening and crack growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In radial specimens, the parallel alignment of the fascicles and the crack prevented fascicle sliding from acting as a crack deflection mechanism, which is probably why half of radial specimens exhibited crack growth, albeit still without measurable impact on ultimate stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The roles of local damage, plasticity and crack deflection as toughening mechanisms in the meniscus warrant further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Strain concentrations near the tip of a meniscus tear, when subjected to long-term repeated loading, may cause incremental accumulation of damage and failure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In the circumferential tests, shear strain concentrations extended 5–10 mm from the crack tip along fascicle boundaries and were halted by the grip line. In vivo they would not be restricted in this manner and hence could provide a path for progressive growth of circumferential, bucket handle, vertical, or horizontal tears [55,85,93,94]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>A portion of the inner margin’s fascicles were therefore discontinuous with the gripped region and were loaded indirectly by inter-fascicle shear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The fascicle interfaces are apparently compliant and shear readily (figures 6 and 8b), so load transfer to the discontinuous fascicles is likely to be slight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>This effect has been quantified in annulus fibrosus and tendon [33,103]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The inner margin’s fascicles may, therefore, be relatively unloaded, contributing little to the stiffness of the specimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Unloading of inner margin fascicles would artificially decrease the average modulus in circumferential control and centre crack specimens, which have an intact inner edge, but not in edge crack specimens because the crack eliminates these inner margin fascicles from the load-bearing cross-sectional area. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The potential for fascicle unloading due to the mismatch between straight sides of conventional tensile test specimens and their arced fascicle geometry deserves further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Interactions between specimen geometry and fibre continuity have been previously shown to alter the meniscus’ apparent tensile properties [43], prompting the use of expanded grip regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>However, the present tangent modulus and yield stress results suggest that the meniscus’ arced fascicle architecture remains a challenge. In vivo, the meniscus’ entheses probably provide much more efficacious fibre loading than is currently possible in laboratory tests. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The general lack of crack growth observed in this study, especially in the circumferential tension tests, leaves the mechanisms by which meniscus tears grow in vivo uncertain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In particular, it would be very useful to resolve uncertainty regarding the duration for which a short in vivo meniscus tear can be expected to remain short and hence low-risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>The observation of crack growth along fascicle boundaries in half of the radial specimens suggests that meniscus microstructure is important, although many in vivo tears do cross fascicles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Age and pre-existing degeneration may also contribute to tear formation and growth [104]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Age &gt; 60 years is a moderate risk factor (OR = 1.8 − 3.0) for meniscus tears, although they afflict patients of all ages [105–108]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>High cycle loading, as has recently been undertaken for crack-free meniscus [44], is an especially promising approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Loading rate is another potentially important factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>With greater strain rates, the meniscus is known to stiffen in compression [109,110] and possibly also in tension [111]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Meniscus tears often occur in the context of sports, implying involvement of high-rate loading [7,108], and ex vivo impact testing of rabbit knees has produced meniscus tears [112,113]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a high-rate loading cycle (as would be expected from an impact) can produce a long (5–25 mm) tear of clinical concern immediately, without slow growth from a low-risk short tear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Although the focus of this study was on tensile loading, examining the behaviour of meniscus cracks under shear is also a promising direction for soft tissue [26,71,114]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The central task for future experiments is to produce physiologic growth of cracks under controlled laboratory conditions so that the mechanisms and time course of this pathology can be quantified. </plain></SENT>
