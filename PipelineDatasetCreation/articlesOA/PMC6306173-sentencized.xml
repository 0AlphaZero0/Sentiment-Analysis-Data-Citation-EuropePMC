</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Depression is a widespread disease and causes severe impairments, a high degree of personal suffering [1] and high direct and indirect costs [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Detailed estimations predict that the depression-related disease burden will increase in the next 20 years and that depression will represent the most important factor for impairment in high income countries [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>With a 1-year prevalence of 7.7%, unipolar depression is one of the most widespread mental diseases in the European population [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In order to provide effective care for depression, guidelines for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of unipolar depression have been developed worldwide [5–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Recommendations include–among others–screening high-risk groups for depression, distinguishing between different severity levels, providing active monitoring, acute and maintenance therapy as well as carefully assessing self-harm or suicide risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Some of the recommendations are specific to the disease course or certain patient groups (e.g. chronic course, patients with somatic comorbidities), while most of the treatment recommendations are related to depression severity [5, 6, 9]: For first episodes of mild depression, guidelines recommend active monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Other guideline-adherent treatments for mild depression comprise low-intensity treatments like bibliotherapy, individual guided self-help based on cognitive-behavioral principles, computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy, and structured physical activity programs, as well as psychotherapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Treatment with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is recommended for moderately depressed patients, while a combination of psycho- and pharmacotherapy should be provided for severe depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Next to the criterion of depression severity, guidelines recommend the explicit consideration of patient preferences regarding a shared decision. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>While the development of guidelines represents an important improvement, the implementation of their evidence-based recommendations is still insufficient [10–21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Depression often remains undetected and is diagnosed with delay [22–25], and diagnoses are often unspecific: For instance, analyses of German health insurance data show that 50% of all depression diagnoses do not specify severity degrees according to the “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems—10”-Classification System (ICD-10) [26]; the majority of these diagnoses were made by general practitioners (GPs) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Partly as a consequence of unspecific diagnostics, treatment selection is often also not specific and thus not in accordance with the guideline: For instance, according to a British primary care study, GPs prescribe antidepressants to 49% of patients with mild depression [27], although guidelines recommend not using antidepressants routinely to treat mild depression due to their poor risk-benefit ratio [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A general challenge is to actually apply and initiate adequate interventions [28, 29]: A European study shows that only 23% of patients with depression or anxiety disorders were provided an adequate treatment [11, 25] while in a Canadian survey only 30% of patients with mood disorders received any treatment at all [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Finally, only 50% of patients with moderate to severe depression or dysthymia received guideline-adherent interventions (antidepressants, psychotherapy, or the combination of both) for a sufficiently long duration, indicating high rates of undersupply [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Stepped care models as recommended by guidelines may optimize treatment decisions and the provision of evidence-based treatments [31, 32] by allocating as many patients as possible to low-intensity treatments, thus reserving more intensive interventions for patients in greater need [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In fixed stepped care, all patients begin with low-intensity interventions and step up if they do not benefit sufficiently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In stratified stepped care, patients are assigned to treatments of different intensities from the start, taking into consideration patient characteristics as well as initial symptom severity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Their treatment course is monitored regularly [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Studies addressing the implementation of stepped care vary strongly regarding study population, care model, and comparison groups [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Common optional elements are guided self-help, psychoeducation, antidepressant medication and psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (low- or high-intensity), brief psychotherapy, interpersonal therapy, motivational interviewing and problem-solving therapy [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A guideline-based stepped and collaborative care model (SCM) was implemented in routine care within the research project “Health Network Depression” as part of psychenet–the Hamburg Network for Mental Health [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Its aim was the improvement of health care for patients with depression by providing integrated and evidence-based health care according to the German National Clinical Practice Guideline “Unipolar Depression” [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A specially trained multi-professional network of GPs, psychotherapists, psychiatrists and in-patient facilities was established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The aim of this network was to optimize diagnostic procedures, to improve treatment selection interventions and thus enable an early detection of depression followed by a prompt, professional and effective and efficient treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The SCM integrated various evidence-based treatment options of different intensities, including innovative low-intensity interventions based on cognitive-behavioral methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This is the first evaluation of the systematic application of these interventions within a SCM in German routine care [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Against the background of insufficient guideline implementation [11, 12, 14, 15, 28] and lack of knowledge about the reasons for this shortcoming, it is important to analyze which treatments were selected at first place and whether they were actually initialized [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We defined initially selected treatments as treatment recommendations given by the GP under consideration of the preference and motivation of the patient, while we defined actually initialized treatments as the first treatment a patient received in the SCM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This is also highly relevant taking into consideration that the first intervention in a patient’s treatment pathway plays a decisive role in the further care process [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate selection and initialization of first treatments patients receive in a guideline-based SCM for depression in primary care. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>This study is part of a larger project evaluating the SCM’s effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in a randomized controlled intervention trial of a consecutive sample of depressed patients from primary care, with assessments at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Through cluster-randomization on the level of the participating primary care units, GPs were divided into two groups: GPs in the intervention group treated patients within the SCM, whereas GPs in the control group carried out treatment as usual (for details and results concerning the main study see [36, 37]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The analyses provided here refer solely to the intervention group, i.e. to the GPs applying SCM and the patients receiving SCM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>A comparable analysis between IG and CG referring to the research described above was not possible to perform, as there is no data available on the CG patients’ diagnoses nor on the treatments selected and initialized by the GPs in the CG which is explained by the study design and main research question of the overall study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Within a cross-sectional approach, we analyzed data documented by health care providers regarding diagnostic procedures, treatment decisions and monitoring routines as well as data from questionnaires completed by patients at baseline and 3 months after baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Patient enrollment took place from October 2012 to March 2014. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The study was approved by the responsible local Ethics Committee of the Chamber of Psychotherapists in Hamburg and conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Patient recruitment was carried out by the participating GPs and comprised three guideline-recommended assessment steps supported by checklists [38]: First, the GP systematically screened patients with particular risk factors for depression (presence of diffuse somatic symptoms and/or chronic somatic conditions [32, 39]) by applying a 2-item checklist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>If screened positively, the GP assessed the main depression criteria (persistent low mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure) with the 2-item depression screener [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>If at least one of two criteria was fulfilled, the patient was assessed with the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, [41]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The study’s inclusion criteria were a score of five or more points on the PHQ-9, informed consent and a minimum age of 18 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Patients with insufficient knowledge of German or a health situation that did not allow study inclusion were excluded, as well as patients already receiving psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for a mental disorder on the day of entering the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Neither use of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy in the past during a prior episode nor somatic or mental comorbidities were exclusion criteria. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The stepped and collaborative care intervention implemented in our study is a complex intervention consisting of several guideline-based components such as a multiprofessional network trained in guideline-based diagnostics and treatment of depression, optimized diagnostic procedures, improved indication, specific evidence-based treatment options of different intensities (including innovative low-intensity interventions based on cognitive-behavioral methods), standardized monitoring procedures, regular quality circles and an online platform[36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>A necessary framework to promote collaborative treatment in the SCM is a network consisting of the relevant care providers involved in treating depressive patients, i.e. GPs, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, day care and inpatient care facilities [38, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>One of the network’s main aims was to enhance cooperation and communication between network members to increase quality of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Another important aim was the prompt referral from the GP to secondary care, i.e. to a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Both aims were supported by an online platform specifically developed for the needs of the network in order to book available treatment capacities in secondary care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To ensure that defined quality standards were met and to promote cooperation and information exchange between participating care providers, quarter-yearly quality circles took place [40, 43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Additionally a network booklet with personal contact data for use within the network was made available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Personal contact with another network care provider in order to refer a jointly treated patient by phone or mail was rewarded by incentives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Previous to the implementation of the SCM, participating care providers obtained training regarding guideline recommendations for diagnostics and treatment [32], rationale and concept of the SCM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Further incentives were given to the care providers for every diagnostic and treatment activity that was not covered by routine care. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>After screening patients, GPs continued the diagnostic process by determining depression type and severity with a checklist of ICD-10 depression criteria (“ICD-10-checklist”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Patients were informed about depression and treatment options. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Treatment decisions were made following principles of shared decision-making and documented on the “treatment decision checklist”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Treatments were allocated following a stratified approach considering depression severity and patient preferences as recommended by guidelines [5, 32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Treatment options and guideline adherence </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Patients were offered one of several treatment options of different treatment intensities [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The definition which treatment option was guideline adherent for which type of depression is based on national and international depression guidelines following the criteria of severity degree [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The German guideline for depression is similar to the NICE guideline for depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>One difference is that the German guideline refers to depression definitions according to ICD-10 whereas the NICE guideline and the Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression refer to the definitions according to the DSM-IV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>As opposed to the NICE guideline, the German and Australian and New Zealand did not explicitly recommend low-intensity treatments like bibliotherapy, internet-based self-help or self-help groups in the short form of their recommendations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In this study, a treatment was defined as guideline-adherent as follows [5, 6]: for mildly depressed patients, active monitoring, all low-intensity interventions like bibliotherapy [44] or internet-based self-help [45] guided by the GP and telephone-based psychotherapy [46] provided by a licensed psychotherapist, and psychotherapy were considered adequate treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>For moderate depression, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, telephone-based psychotherapy and a combination of a low-intensity treatment combined with either pharmaco- or psychotherapy were considered guideline-adherent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>For severely depressed patients, the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in an in- or outpatient setting was defined as guideline-adherent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>If the selected treatment was bibliotherapy the patient was given a self-help book to work with [44]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>We described results regarding guideline-adherent treatment selection and initialization for a sample of n = 569 patients within a stepped and collaborative care model (SCM) in routine care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>The SCM aimed to optimize diagnostic procedures, treatment decision processes and implementation of guideline-based interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether this sample is representative for the German population of persons suffering from depression two studies are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>The distribution of gender in the sample seems to be comparable with twice as many female than male depression patients [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>Regarding marital status we found comparable data with 54% currently living in a relationship in our study in comparison to 60% in another large epidemiological health care study and for chronic somatic conditions (41% vs. 47%) in the same study [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>Concerning the distribution of severity degrees in depression a comparison is difficult, as one of the studies [14] revealed that in routine care 50% of the depression diagnoses are unspecific and thus do not allow a statement about the degree of severity of the depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>In our study almost every patient (98.9%) received a specific ICD-10 diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>As we did not collect data of the diagnostic process and the specific diagnoses in the control group we cannot draw a direct comparison between CG and IG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>However, we know from a big external administrative study that only half of the registered depression diagnoses are specific, while 50% remain unspecific [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that procedures such as training as well as symptom checklists can substantially increase the specificity of GP diagnoses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec017"><title><text><SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>Guideline adherence regarding initial treatment selections </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>The results regarding treatment selection mostly show a high guideline adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>This promising result may be attributed to the specific training in guideline recommendations and shared decision-making processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>The implementation of supporting tools such as the treatment decision checklists for GPs probably contributed as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no other studies report data on treatment selection or differentiate between selected and initialized treatments as we did. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>One partially comparable study analyzed the management of depression in UK general practices in relation to severity degree and reported lower rates of guideline-adherent treatment decisions [27]: 49% of mildly depressed patients were prescribed an antidepressant and only few patients with moderate to severe depression were referred to psychological or psychiatric services (1.6% resp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>5.6%)–results which are not in accordance with the guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>In our study, the rate of guideline-adherent treatment selection was highest for patients with mild depression, where antidepressant prescriptions were almost nonexistent and low-intensity treatments were selected frequently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>Bibliotherapy was selected and initialized approximately twice as frequently as internet-based self-help and four times as often as telephone-based therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="444" pm="."><plain>One reason for this finding could be, that the book for the bibliotherapy could be handed out immediately while the access to the internet-based self-help (lock-in with a license code) or to the telephone-based therapy (calling the telephone psychotherapist) was less immediate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="445" pm="."><plain>Another reason could be, that working with a book or a companion is more known and intimate than working with internet-based self-help or telephone based therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>Treatment selection was less guideline-adherent for moderate and severe depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>For moderately depressed patients, psychotherapy was selected almost three times as often as pharmacotherapy, even though the guideline recommends offering the patient psychotherapy and antidepressants as equivalent treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the results of an American primary care survey finding that two thirds of patients preferred counseling over antidepressant treatment [48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>Patient preferences may have been one cause for selecting treatments that were not guideline-adherent: While guidelines place great importance on severity degree, they also explicitly state that patient preferences and characteristics should be taken into consideration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title><text><SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>Guideline adherence regarding applied first treatments </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>The overall proportion of 47% of guideline-adherent initialized treatments in this SCM is twice as high as in primary care, according to a European study reporting that only 23% of patients with anxiety and depression received an adequate treatment [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>This shows the potential of specific SCMs; however, there is still room for further improvement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>With approximately 11%, the proportion of patients receiving a further GP-consultation as first treatment was similar in each of the three severity groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="454" pm="."><plain>For some of these patients, active monitoring had actually been scheduled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="455" pm="."><plain>The others may have consulted their GP due to failed initialization of the originally selected treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>The rate of patients who dropped out in the sense of not returning to the GP or any other care provider of the network and not answering any follow-up questionnaire was also comparable over all severity groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="457" pm="."><plain>For these approximately 10% of patients, it is also likely that the initialization of the selected treatment failed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="458" pm="."><plain>However, in routine care attrition rates are usually much higher than those found in our study [14] and even in comparison to other SCMs this rate of probably untreated patients is low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="459" pm="."><plain>Another implementation study of four SCMs in routine care found attrition rates of about 30% [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="460" pm="."><plain>For mildly depressed patients, guideline adherence in treatment initialization was high: there was a very low rate of misapplication of antidepressants in comparison to routine care [14, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="461" pm="."><plain>Even compared to other stepped-care models, only 5% oversupply with antidepressants is remarkably low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="462" pm="."><plain>Gidding and colleagues [50] reported almost 30% of non-severely depressed patients being treated with antidepressants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="463" pm="."><plain>Additionally, only 16% of non-severely depressed patients received minimal interventions (comparable to low-intensity treatments in our SCM), compared to 73% of mildly depressed patients in our study [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="464" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the SCM’s concept of referring patients with mild depression into low-intensity interventions as a first step and thus reserving more intensive treatments for patients with more severe disorders was successfully implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="465" pm="."><plain>It also reflects substantial acceptance of these interventions, as well as their high and prompt availability and practicality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="466" pm="."><plain>These results are confirmed by another study showing a high acceptance of all three low-intensity interventions from the perspective of the care providers [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>Moderately depressed patients received less guideline-adherent interventions than mildly depressed patients, but almost three times higher rates of adequate treatments than severely depressed patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>A considerable proportion of moderately depressed patients were not supplied with psychotherapy as planned, indicating that this may be a crucial aspect of impeded treatment initializations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>Possible reasons for this finding will be discussed in paragraph “Potential barriers and resources for guideline-adherent care”. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>For severely depressed patients, the guideline adherence of initialized treatments was low, the majority of patients received a first treatment of insufficient intensity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>However, all patients received some form of active treatment, while 18% of severely depressed patients received no treatment at all in a routine care study [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>A comparable SCM study [51] reported that 57% of severely depressed patients received adequate treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>But these different results are difficult to interpret as the group of severely depressed patients in this study consists of moderately and severely depressed patients opposed to severely depressed patients only in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>Further on there are different definitions of “adequate treatment”: In our study, severe depression was supposed to be treated with a combination of psycho- and pharmacotherapy in line with NICE guideline [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in Franx and colleagues’ [51] SCM, either psycho- or pharmacotherapy was considered to be a sufficient treatment to start with for severely depressed patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>If we had defined stand-alone psycho- and pharmacotherapy as adequate treatments for severe depression, our SCM would have achieved a rate of 66% of adequately treated severely depressed patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the lower the severity degree is, the higher the probability to receive adequate treatment is. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>This is also underlined by the result that confirms the significant difference between guideline-adherent treatment selection and initialization for different severity degrees. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>This finding corresponds to Franx and colleagues’ [51] stepped care study, in which care provision was found to improve for non-severely depressed patients, but not to the same degree as in patients with severe depression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first study which differentiates between treatment selection and actual treatment initialization in depression care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the gap which exists between treatment selection and actual implementation as well as the interaction between “treatment selection/treatment initialization” and “severity degree of depression”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>We found that it is by far not enough to improve care providers’ awareness of guideline recommendations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, even when treatments are correctly selected, they are often not implemented afterwards, especially in cases of severe depression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title><text><SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>Potential barriers and resources for guideline-adherent care </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>Failure to initialize a treatment may be caused by different barriers impeding the delivery of adequate interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>Limited access to adequate care for depression is described as a major barrier by different authors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>These can be care provider-related barriers such as insufficient knowledge regarding diagnostics and mental disorders in a primary care setting; factors related to the health care system in general such as insufficiently available and integrated resources or long waiting times for therapy; and patient-related aspects such as fear of stigmatization, time constraints or cultural factors [28, 52, 53]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>In the SCM, the barrier of insufficient care provider knowledge regarding diagnostics and psychological disorders was addressed by training providers and enhancing professional exchange between psychotherapists, psychiatrists and GPs in regular quality circles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>The fact that a greater amount of specific depression diagnoses were made in our study than in routine care shows that we were successful at improving care providers’ knowledge about depression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the knowledge about evidence-based and adequate interventions improved, as indicated by the relatively high rate of guideline-adherent treatment selections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>In order to overcome barriers related to the health care system in general, we established a care provider network to provide sufficient treatment capacities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>We also developed and implemented an online platform to enhance the referral process (cp. section Multi-professional network). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>This online platform was used frequently and appreciated by the care providers [42]; however, these measures may still have been insufficient to pave the way from GP to secondary care provider in a relevant proportion of cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>Especially initializing a combination of psycho- and pharmacotherapy for patients with severe depression may have been encumbered by an interface problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>Two or even three care providers may be involved in this complex intervention and there may have been difficulties in the referral processes or the patient’s transition from one care provider to another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>Another reason may have been a lack of available psychotherapy resources despite their generally higher availability within the SCM compared to routine care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>This could be an explanation for the gap between selected and applied stand-alone psychotherapy in moderately depressed patients as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>A further reason for the insufficient initialization of combined psycho- and pharmacotherapy for patients with severe depression might have been that their higher symptom burden affected treatment implementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="500" pm="."><plain>For example, for a severely depressed patient, the challenge to call a psychotherapist for an appointment may be higher than for a mildly depressed patient whose symptoms of social withdrawal and hopelessness are lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="501" pm="."><plain>Patients in severe crises might also be more ambivalent towards treatments and decide against a selected treatment before even beginning it, duo to doubts and negative emotions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="502" pm="."><plain>To address patient-related constraints like these, GPs were supported by psycho-educational materials explaining the nature of depression, symptoms and treatment options, amongst others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>For patients with time constraints, interventions with high availability, flexibility and practicality were offered, which were meant to be easy to integrate into daily life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Low-intensity treatments can be applied independently of specific appointments and mobility aspects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>One limitation of this study is the lack of validation of the ICD-diagnoses made by the GPs, as no “gold standard” (e.g. structured diagnostic interviews) was additionally applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>This was not possible in the present study due to organizational limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>The specificity of the diagnoses may have been partially “forced” by the structure of the symptom checklist used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>However, GPs perceived the checklist to be a helpful tool for the diagnostic process [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="509" pm="."><plain>Criteria for defining selection and initialization of an intervention as guideline-adherent were based only on the criterion of severity degree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="510" pm="."><plain>Although severity is one central criterion for guideline-based treatment decisions in depression, the guideline stresses patient preferences as a further important criterion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="511" pm="."><plain>As data about patients’ preferences (and about the interaction between patient and GP during the treatment decision process) were not collected, we do not know which treatment decisions and initializations were based on this latter criterion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="512" pm="."><plain>Strengths of this study are the large sample size of primary care patients and its assessment of information about the crucial phase of treatment initialization, differentiated into treatment selection and actual treatment initialization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="513" pm="."><plain>We investigated this under routine care conditions and for different subgroups of depressed patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>Several important conclusions can be drawn from this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>First of all, SCMs are feasible and capable of improving diagnostic processes, treatment selection, adequate treatment of mildly depressed patients and application of low-intensity interventions in depression care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study described the important difference of treatment selection and treatment initialization regarding guideline-adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>Rates of guideline-adherent treatments varied between patient groups of different depression severities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>The low rate of guideline-adherent first treatments in severely depressed patients was not primarily a problem of inadequate treatment selection or lack of knowledge, but rather a matter of failed implementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>Further studies should examine which elements of the treatment initialization and implementation process cause difficulties, such as a lack of treatment availability or problems during referral from one care provider to another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="521" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it will be important to further investigate which barriers and enablers on the level of care provider, health care system and patient characteristics are related to successful implementation, such as patients’ disease course or physical and mental health condition. </plain></SENT>
