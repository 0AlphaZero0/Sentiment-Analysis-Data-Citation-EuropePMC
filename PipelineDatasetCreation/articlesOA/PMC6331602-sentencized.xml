<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since then, a series of plant natural products have been successfully heterologously produced in microbial cell factories3,4, highlighting the potential for metabolic engineering of microbial chassis to provide reliable approaches for obtaining natural plant products on a large scale, especially rare natural products. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Ginsenoside Rh2, derived from Panax species, is a promising candidate for cancer prevention and therapy5–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the ginsenoside Rh2 accounts for less than 0.01% of dried Panax ginseng roots8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Commercially available ginsenoside Rh2 is currently produced mainly via the deglycosylation of major protopanaxadiol (PPD)-type ginsenosides isolated from Panax spp. using chemical or biotransformation approaches9–11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, such approaches rely heavily on the cultivation of Panax plants and the successive cultivation of Panax plants is unsustainable, resulting in low productivity and vulnerability to disease outbreaks12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A synthetic biology strategy to artificially produce ginsenoside Rh2 from glucose in a metabolically engineered microbial cell factory is expected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>PPD is the common precursor of all dammarane-type ginsenosides, including ginsenoside Rh2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A key enzyme to glycosylate PPD to produce ginsenoside Rh2 is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A Korean research group reported the isolation of two glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes involved in the biosynthesis of the ginsenosides Rh2 and Rg313. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nearly concurrently, we also characterized two UGTs (UGTPg45 and UGTPg29) taking parts in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides Rh2 and Rg3 independently14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In this previous work, we constructed the strain D20RH18 for de novo production of ginsenoside Rh2 from glucose based on the PPD-producing chassis strain ZW-PPD-B (chassis 1.0, with a PPD titer of 75.3 mg/L in shake flasks)14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, the ginsenoside Rh2 production of D20RH18 was relatively low (16.95 mg/L in shake flasks), and the yield of total dammarane-type triterpenoids (dammarenediol II [DM], PPD, and ginsenoside Rh2) was also low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of the biopart UGTPg45 to produce ginsenoside Rh2 revealed a low catalytic efficiency, only 1/2500 of that of UGTPg29, which further catalyzes ginsenoside Rh2 into Rg3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we reasoned that the limited supply of the precursor for dammarane-type triterpenoid synthesis and poor performance of the key UGT biopart were the two key factors hindering the high-efficiency production of ginsenoside Rh2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Since the first two reports of the ginsenoside Rh2 biosynthetic pathway, several studies have attempted to optimize this glycosylation step by identifying UGT bioparts from microbial sources or by engineering UGTs to catalyze ginsenoside Rh2 formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>UGTs from bacteria often show substrate flexibility and are potential candidates for ginsenoside Rh2 synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>UGT109A1 from Bacillus subtilis could catalyze the C3–OH and C12–OH glycosylation of DM, PPD, and protopanaxatriol (PPT)15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Another UGT from B. subtilis, Bs-YjiC, which shares 94% identity with UGT109A1, could also catalyze the C3–OH and C12–OH glycosylation of PPD to yield ginsenoside Rh2 and an unnatural ginsenoside F12 (3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-12-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol)16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Coupling this enzyme with a UDP-glucose regeneration system powered by sucrose synthase, an in vitro one-pot ginsenoside synthesis platform was established to produce 0.2 g/L of ginsenoside Rh2 and 3.98 g/L of F12 using PPD as the substrate16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Another group built an efficient ginsenoside Rh2 biosynthetic cell factory by repurposing an inherently promiscuous UDP-glycosyltransferase UGT51 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Based on a structure-guided semi-rational engineering approach, the catalytic efficiency of UGT51 to convert PPD into ginsenoside Rh2 increased by more than 1800-fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The yeast cell factory with this engineered glycosyltransferase could produce ~300 mg/L of ginsenoside Rh2 in a 5L fed-batch fermentation system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, there are still many disadvantages of the use of UGT from bacteria or yeast, such as its poor substrate specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For example, the engineered UGT51 can also catalyze the C3–OH glycosylation of many native yeast sterols (e.g., ergosterol), and thus produce diverse by-products and waste UGT enzyme activity17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, Bs-YjiC exhibits poor site specificity to C3–OH, resulting in lower ginsenoside Rh2 yield (0.2 g/L) compared with the high F12 yield (3.98 g/L)16. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Besides, optimization of the PPD-producing chassis may also improve ginsenoside Rh2 yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In the past several years, much progress has been made in engineering microbes for high-level production of PPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For example, by integrating the PPD biosynthesis pathway into a yeast chromosome and overexpressing the rate-limiting gene tHMG1 (truncated HMG-CoA reductase gene) and three key precursor genes, the resulting PPD-producing strain could produce 148.1 mg/L PPD in shake flasks, and the titer reached more than 1 g/L in fed-batch fermentation18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Recently, to overcome the poor coupling between P. ginseng cytochrome P450 and the Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome P450 reductase ATR1, as well as the high DM accumulation in PPD-producing yeast recombinants, the fusion of PPDS and ATR1 encoding genes was introduced and the PPD production increased significantly, reaching 265.7 mg/L PPD in shake flasks and 4.25 g/L in 5 L fed-batch fermentation, which is the highest PPD production ever reported19,20. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In this study, we constructed a new PPD-producing chassis strain to improve the conversion of glucose into PPD by overexpressing all mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway genes and optimizing the expression levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes in yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, we employed several strategies to optimize the cell factories to produce ginsenoside Rh2 by improving UGTPg45 expression level and activity, including: (1) increasing UGTPg45 expression by increasing its copy number and engineering its promoter and (2) increasing the in vivo activity of UGTPg45 in yeast via protein engineering based on in vivo directed evolution and searching for novel UGTs with higher C3–OH glycosylation efficiencies from other plant species. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Ten enzymes are required to synthesize the triterpenoid precursor 2, 3-oxidosqualene from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the MVA pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Then three heterologous genes from P. ginseng, which encode three enzymes that convert 2, 3-oxidosqualene into PPD, namely PgDDS, CYP716A47, and PgCPR1, are also required for PPD biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we aimed to overexpress these 13 genes (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The 13 genes were divided into two groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The first group, designated as the upstream-module, included seven upstream genes (ERG10, ERG13, ERG12, ERG8, ERG19, IDI, and tHMG1) that converted acetyl-CoA into the isoprenoid building blocks isopentenyl phosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl phosphate (DMAPP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The second group, designated as the downstream-module, contained the remaining six downstream genes (ERG1, ERG20, ERG9, synPgDDS, synPgPPDS, and synPgCPR1), which converted IPP and DMAPP into the target product PPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The three heterologous genes PgDDS, CYP716A47, and PgCPR1 were codon-optimized for expression in yeast and renamed synPgDDS, synPgPPDS, and synPgCPR1, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Because HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the MVA pathway, multi-copy overexpression of tHMG1 benefits the production of different terpenoids1,21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we added an additional copy of tHMG1 to the second group (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Schematic biosynthesis pathway of ginsenoside Rh2 in engineered yeast.Blue-colored genes form the upstream-module, red-colored genes form the downstream-module, and the green-colored gene is the UDP-glycosyltransferase biopart. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>This demonstrated that our design should be feasible, because only a single-step integration was required to increase the PPD titer by more than threefold compared with that of ZW-PPD-B (i.e., chassis 1.0). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In the next step, the upstream-module was integrated into the Yprc-delta15 site of ZW03BY, yielding strain ZW04BY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Its PPD titer further increased to 329.7 mg/L in shake flasks. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This indicated that introducing the upstream module boosted the metabolic flux toward the MVA pathway, although additional efforts were required to convert the accumulated DM into PPD.Fig. 2Construction of the protopanaxadiol (PPD)-producing chassis 2.0 strain.a High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of dammarenediol II (DM) and PPD produced by ZW03BY, ZW04BY, and ZW04BY-RS. b Quantification of DM and PPD produced by ZW03BY, ZW04BY, and ZW04BY-RS. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In addition, DM production decreased to 72.6 mg/L, representing only 12.1% of the total triterpenoid (PPD + DM) production (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increasing expression of key P450 genes could enhance the efficient conversion of DM into PPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the PPD titer of ZW04BY-RS was sixfold that of strain ZW-PPD-B and 1.99-fold that of W3a, the highest PPD production strain constructed in the previous report19, representing the highest reported production of PPD in a shake flask system. </plain></SENT>
