</text></title><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive genetic disorder characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and a strong predisposition to cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>FA is a multigenic disease, with at least 22 complementation genes (FANCA-FANCV) having been identified thus far, which, together with other partner proteins, constitute the FA pathway of DNA damage sensing and repair (Nalepa and Clapp, 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The FA core complex harbors the ubiquitin E3 ligase FANCL and catalyzes the monoubiquitination of the FANCI-FANCD2 (ID2) heterodimer complex during S phase and upon occurrence of interstrand DNA crosslinkings (ICLs) and replicative stress (Huang et al., 2014; Rajendra et al., 2014; van Twest et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The monoubiquitinated ID2 complex stably associates with damaged DNA, where it is thought to nucleate the formation of repair centers that harbor a number of other FA proteins involved in ICL removal and subsequent DNA repair including SLX4/FANCP, BRCA1/FANCS, BRCA2/FANCD1, BACH1/FANCJ, and PALB2/FANCN (Cantor et al., 2001; Godthelp et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Importantly, mutation of the ubiquitin acceptor site in FANCD2 impairs the assembly of DNA repair foci comprising the aforementioned FA proteins (Chen et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2004; Yamamoto et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, ID2 monoubiquitination represents a pivotal event in the activation of the FA pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that in vitro monoubiquitination of purified FANCI and ID2 by FANCL-UBE2T is greatly stimulated upon DNA binding (Longerich et al., 2009, 2014; Sato et al., 2012), which can cause a conformational change of ID2 revealing the concealed monouniquition sites (Joo et al., 2011; Liang et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition, ID2 exhibits binding preference for DNA substrates that mimic intermediates of a stalled replication fork underlying the physiological relevance of ID2 DNA binding in ICL repair. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>To further characterize the FA pathway in mitigating conflict of DNA replication and RNA transcription upon DNA damage, recent studies have revealed roles of several FA factors including FANCD2, FANCA, BRCA1/FANCS, and BRCA2/FANCD1 in the metabolism of R-loops, which contain RNA:DNA hybrids that can interfere with DNA replication and can result in DNA double-strand breaks and genome instability (Bhatia et al., 2014; García-Rubio et al., 2015; Hatchi et al., 2015; Schwab et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this study, we confirm the presence of increased R-loops in FA mutant cells, as previously reported (García-Rubio et al., 2015; Schwab et al., 2015), show that FANCD2 monoubiquitination is required to prevent their accumulation and demonstrate that FANCD2 colocalizes with R-loops in an actively transcribed genomic region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that purified recombinant human ID2 can directly bind RNA with a predilection for single-stranded and high-guanine-content RNA, as well as R-loop structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these same RNA and R-loop species are able to stimulate robust monoubiquitination of ID2 complex in a reconstituted system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results provide direct evidence for RNA-mediated ID2 monoubiquitination in the avoidance of genome instability that is induced by the accumulation of pathogenic R-loops. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recent work has demonstrated that the FA pathway has a role in preventing R-loop accumulation upon replication and transcription stress (García-Rubio et al., 2015; Schwab et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In order to confirm these data, we compared FA-D2 mutant cells with absent FANCD2 expression transduced with different FANCD2 expression constructs and found that cells expressing FANCD2 monoubiquitination-dead FANCD2-K561R mutant (FA-D2+K561R) or vector alone had elevated background level of R-loops as visualized by S9.6 immunofluorescence microscopy, which further accumulated over the time-course of DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC) treatment (Figures S1A and S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Conversely, expression of RNA:DNA endonuclease RNase H1 markedly reduced S9.6 signal and partially rescued the survival of FA-D2 mutant cells in MMC (Figures S1C–S1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Nondenaturating bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated increased R-loops at the highly transcribed GAPDH gene in cells defective in FANCD2 monoubiquitination (Figure S1F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our results demonstrate that ID2 and its monoubiquitination facilitate R-loop avoidance upon replication stress, confirming previously published results (García-Rubio et al., 2015; Schwab et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To understand how transcription influences recruitment and activation of ID2 to prevent co-transcriptional R-loops, we deployed the DNA Damage At RNA Transcription (DART) system to examine the association of FANCD2 (and by implication, ID2) with transcription upon DNA damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>DART utilizes the light-inducible chromophore-modified KillerRed (KR) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a genome-integrated tet response element (TRE) locus to induce focal DNA damage (Lan et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional status of the TRE locus can be modulated by fusion of KR with either transcription activator (TA) or repressor (tetR) (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We first tested FANCD2 recruitment to the TRE locus in four combinations of transcription status and DNA damage by expressing different effector proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>FANCD2 became highly enriched at the TRE locus when constitutively active transcription was stalled by ROS-induced DNA damage (TA-KR) but not in cells with only active transcription (TA-Cherry), only DNA damage (tetR-KR), or no transcription and DNA damage (tetR-Cherry) (Figures 1B and 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This result clearly supports the idea that both transcription and DNA damage are required to recruit FANCD2 (ID2) to chromatin for its subsequent monoubiquitination to form foci, consistent with a similar observation reported recently that endogenous FANCD2 colocalizes with large transcription units in response to aphidicolin-induced replication stress (Okamoto et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that perturbation of active transcription by ROS damage in TA-KR cells would lead to R-loop accumulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we observed that the TA-KR site was an R-loop hotspot as indicated by the formation of S9.6 foci in a transcription and DNA damage dependent fashion (Teng et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Importantly, enriched foci of FANCD2 and S9.6 colocalized in ~75% of the TA-KR positive cells tested, and ~96% of the cells with distinct S9.6 foci at the TRE locus were positive for colocalized FANCD2 foci (Figures 1D and 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type RNase H1, but not the nuclease-dead RNase H1-D210N mutant, in TA-KR positive cells drastically diminished FANCD2 foci intensity at the TRE locus (Figures 1F and 1G), indicating that FANCD2 enriches at DNA-damaged, transcriptionally active genomic sites in a manner that depends on R-loops. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of endogenous FANCD2 significantly increased S9.6 foci intensity at the TRE locus in TA-KR positive cells to a similar extent as the depletion of RNA helicase Aquarius (AQR) (Figures 1H and 1I), which is known to resolve R-loops (Sollier et al., 2014), demonstrating the utility of the DART system to study R-loop metabolism. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Given that FANCD2 colocalizes with R-loops in cells, we asked whether ID2 complex possesses RNA binding activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>We first tested several biotinylated oligomers for their ability to pull down FANCD2 from FA-D2 mutant cells transduced with either wild-type FANCD2 or FANCD2-K561R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Both FANCD2 and FANCI from cell extracts associated with RNA similarly as with DNA, and FANCD2 monoubiquitination is dispensable for RNA interaction as the K561R mutant can be pulled down also (Figures S2A and S2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The majority of FANCD2 that was pulled down is not ubiquitinated even after MMC treatment, confirming that ubiquitination is indeed not required for RNA interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether FANCD2 association with RNA could have nucleotide sequence preference, we tested RNA homopolymers for pull-down of FANCD2 and found that poly-rG has the highest pull-down efficiency (Figure S2C), suggesting RNA binding of FANCD2 may have a preference for guanine-rich sequences, which are often present in co-transcriptional R-loops. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In order to directly test RNA interaction of ID2 with RNA, we purified the human ID2 complex from insect cells (Figure 2A) and tested for RNA binding activity using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We first examined a set of DNA and RNA substrates with the same nucleotide sequence in both single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) forms (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We observed that ID2 had significantly higher affinity for the tested ssRNA over ssDNA (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, despite the fact that human ID2 bound ssRNA avidly, it had the lowest binding affinity for duplex substrates containing at least one RNA strand, such as dsRNA and RNA:DNA hybrids, while it bound dsDNA with a similar affinity as ssDNA (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the order of human ID2 binding affinity from high to low in our experiments was ssRNA &gt; ssDNAz≈dsDNA &gt; dsRNAz≈RNA:DNA hybrids (Figure 2D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that FANCI DNA binding mutants in complex with wild-type FANCD2 can impede the DNA binding activity of ID2 (Longerich et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To test whether ID2 shares the same dependence on FANCI in binding RNA, we tested the FANCI (KKEE)/D2 and FANCI (R1285X)/D2 mutants (Figure S2D), which are both impaired for DNA binding, for the ability to bind RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that both ID2 mutant complexes were also defective in binding RNA (Figures S2E and S2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>To investigate the contribution of each subunit of the ID2 complex toward RNA binding activity, we first tested purified human FANCI and found it binds ssRNA, dsRNA, and RNA:DNA hybrids (Figures S3A and S3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We were not able to test human FANCD2 protein alone, because, in the absence of FANCI, FANCD2 forms high-molecular-weight aggregates during purification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Instead, we took advantage of chicken FANCI and FANCD2 proteins, which can be purified in a non-aggregated form either alone or as a heterodimer, and found that ID2, FANCI, and FANCD2 all have strong binding activity toward ssRNA, dsRNA, and RNA:DNA hybrids (Figures S3C–S3H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the findings of a recent study showing that purified chicken FANCI, FANCD2, and ID2 complex can bind RNA:DNA hybrids with high affinity (Okamoto et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that while FANCI and FANCD2 both have strong affinity for RNA, the RNA binding activity of ID2 depends on the FANCI nucleic acid binding motif. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We noted that FANCD2 preferentially interacted with RNA poly-rG in the pull-down assay (Figure S2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>To quantify the effect of the guanine content of nucleic acids on their binding by ID2, we compared three 60-mer ssDNA and ssRNA substrates with varying percentages of guanine content (see Table S1 for sequence information). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>These substrates are termed here as G8, G28, and G48 based on their guanine content. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>G28 is the same sequence used in Figure 2B, while G8 is derived from G28 by converting some G bases to A or T and G48 is derived from G28 by converting some A or T bases to G. As predicted, increasing the guanine content of both DNA and RNA enhanced their binding by ID2, and ID2 showed stronger affinity for ssRNA as compared to ssDNA of the same sequence among these tested substrates (Figures 2E–2H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also observed similar effect of guanine content on human ID2 binding of dsDNA and dsRNA, despite dsRNA binding was weaker, as expected (Figures S3I–S3L). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>To test ID2 for the ability to recognize R-loops, we first prepared a synthetic R-loop structure by hybridizing a guanine-rich RNA strand to a DNA bubble scaffold and compared ID2 binding to it versus a D-loop substrate of the same sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the R-loop substrate was bound by ID2 to the same extent as the D-loop (Figures S4A and S4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Replacing the RNA:DNA hybrid portion of the R-loop to a A:T-rich sequence that has almost no binding affinity to ID2 based on our previous observations (Longerich et al., 2014) actually slightly increased the overall binding affinity (Figures S4C and S4D), suggesting that human ID2 R-loop binding occurs not via recognition of the RNA:DNA hybrids, consistent with our finding that human ID2 complex has poor binding affinity to RNA:DNA hybrids (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>R-loop binding of ID2 could be dependent on the displaced ssDNA strand and influenced by its guanine content and secondary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>To address these questions, we constructed a series of R-loop substrates with different guanine contents in the displaced DNA strand and found that the R-loop binding affinity of ID2 positively correlates with the guanine content of the displaced ssDNA (Figures 3A and 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We also tested an R-loop substrate with the potential to form G-quadruplex, a frequent secondary structure found in the displaced ssDNA strand of R-loops and observed slight enhancement of binding affinity over the control R-loop with the same guanine content but without the G-quadruplex forming sequence (Figures 3B and 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Because ID2 robustly bound ssRNA, we hypothesized that another binding site of ID2 to an R-loop could be the ssRNA tail from a dysregulated mRNA transcript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To test this possibility, we synthesized additional R-loop substrates that harbor a 40-nt ssRNAtail at the 5′ end and observed that the additional ssRNA tail markedly increased R-loop ID2 binding affinity (Figures 3C and 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, comparison of G-rich ssRNA and R-loop in a series of competition EMSA assays showed ID2 associating with both substrates robustly, with slightly higher affinity in ssRNA over R-loop for the substrates we tested (Figures S4E–S4H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results demonstrated that both the ssRNA and ssDNA moieties of a synthetic R-loop are critical components for recognition by ID2, thus implicating them in the recruitment and/or retention of ID2 at pathological R-loops in cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We found that ssRNA with a random sequence stimulated FANCD2 monoubiquitination to the same extent as the equivalent ssDNA counterpart, whereas poly-U (RNA) and poly-T (DNA) had little or no effect (Figure 4A), consistent with their weak binding affinity to ID2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>As expected, ID2 complex containing FANCI DNA and RNA binding mutations failed to support ID2 monoubiquitination (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the same set of DNA, RNA substrates used in EMSA all stimulated the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in a manner consistent with their individual binding affinity (Figures 4C and 4D). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>While the FA pathway has a well-known role in sensing and orchestrating the repair of DNA crosslinks, its recently described role in suppression or resolution of R-loops remains to be defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report findings of RNA and R-loop binding by ID2 and provide mechanistic insights of FA pathway activation in response to transcription stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>First, we show FANCD2 colocalizes with R-loops in cells and is able to bind ssRNA with G-rich sequence and R-loop structures with high affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data provide experimental support that ID2 binds R-loops via recognition of the inherent single-stranded nucleic acid species, including the displaced DNA and unhybridized RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we have shown that RNA and R-loop binding can stimulate robust ID2 monoubiquitination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings and current knowledge, we propose a model in which ID2 is recruited not only to sites of DNA damage such as the ICL, but also to transcription perturbed sites with accentuated R-loops (Figure 4G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>We speculate that ID2 recruitment to R-loop, like to ICL, is dependent on the activity of the FA core complex proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>This notion is supported by recent findings that showed assembly of the majority of FANCD2 foci requires R-loops (García-Rubio et al., 2015) and FANCD2 foci diminish upon depletion of FANCA (Okamoto et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we suggest that ID2 monoubiquitination facilitates R-loop resolution via the recruitment of downstream factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>These factors could include nucleases, helicases, topoisomerases, RNA binding proteins, and DNA repair factors that have been implicated in either preventing the accumulation of pathological R-loops or in the resolution of these structures (Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>For example, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 has been shown to interact with the putative RNA helicase Senataxin (SETX), and the resulting complex localizes to R-loops (Hatchi et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>BRCA2 and its binding partner TREX also colocalize to R-loops (Bhatia et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Finally, FANCM has been proposed to eliminate R-loops via its RNA:DNA helicase activity (Hodson et al., 2018; Schwab et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>We note that chromatin recruitment of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 upon replication stress depends monoubiquitination of ID2 (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001; Taniguchi et al., 2002; Tripathi et al., 2016), which emphasizes a likely pivotal role of ID2 monoubiquitination in the recruitment and/or activation of factors that function in R-loop metabolism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>One unexpected finding of our study is that human ID2 has only weak affinity for RNA:DNA hybrids without any single-stranded characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>We speculate this may avoid inappropriate activation of the FA pathway in human cells where R-loops serve an important function in gene expression regulation (Skourti-Stathaki and Proudfoot, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>While the exact mechanism of such substrate recognition of human ID2 warrants further investigation, differences in primary protein sequences of FANCI and FANCD2 among vertebrates (Joo et al., 2011) support the notion that human ID2 might have evolved additional layers of nucleic acid recognition modules that are absent in ID2 homologs of lower vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>The preference of ID2 for guanine-rich DNA and RNA species likely reflects the higher propensity for such sequences to form secondary structures, which hints at the possibility that ID2 has specific affinity for these structures in its nucleic acid targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Indeed, FANCD2 has been shown to associate with fragile genomic regions with strong and large transcriptional units (Madireddy et al., 2016; Okamoto et al., 2018), where genomic secondary structures stemming from aberrant DNA replication and transcription intermediates accentuate (Wilson et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>We also speculate that both FANCI and FANCD2 subunits contribute to the recognition of guanine-rich sequences based on the observation of similar binding activity using chicken proteins (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Our data add credence to the premise that any failure to prevent the formation of pathological R-loops or in the resolution of these structures contributes to the genomic instability seen in FA cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Based on the phenotypic similarities shared by FA and other genetic diseases marked by aberrant RNA metabolism such as dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) (Dokal and Vulliamy, 2010), it is possible that R-loop formation leads to genomic instability seen in other cancer predisposition syndromes as well. </plain></SENT>
