Butyrate in particular is important for maintaining health via regulation of the immune system (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), maintenance of the epithelial barrier (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and promotion of satiety following meals (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). It may be protective against several diseases, including colorectal cancer (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), inflammatory bowel disease (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), graft-versus-host disease (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), diabetes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and obesity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, stimulating butyrate production by the colonic microbiome could be useful for sustaining health and treating diseases.</p><p>One strategy for stimulating butyrate production is to supplement the diet with carbohydrates that are resistant to degradation by human enzymes but can be metabolized by select bacteria in the colon. We previously demonstrated that one such resistant starch (RS) prepared from potatoes (RPS) could increase average fecal butyrate in healthy, young adults (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Others have reported increased butyrate in response to inulin in humans and resistant starch from maize (RMS) in mice (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A critical challenge to these potential therapies is the variable responses between individuals, likely influenced by differences in the composition of their gut microbiota. To capture this variability, large numbers of subjects are required. We analyzed samples from 174 university students who consented to participate in and then successfully completed this short-term interventional study. This young cohort provided a wide diversity of gut communities without the additional complications of chronic health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular disease that are related to altered microbiome structure and function (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We did not ask the participants to make changes to their diets other than taking the supplements provided, even though we recognize different diets also have a profound impact on microbiome structure and function. Our objective was to determine how these different resistant polysaccharides affected the concentrations of SCFAs when added to &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; diets, not just under one dietary regimen. With this number of participants, we were able to evaluate three different resistant polysaccharides and an amylase-sensitive polysaccharide as a negative control.</p><p>Understanding the butyrogenic effect of these supplements and specific gut bacteria is important for designing more broadly effective therapies and predicting which individuals are likely to benefit from them. More generally, defining metabolic interactions among gut microbes enhances our understanding of the assembly, maintenance, and outputs from the gut microbiome.</p><p>Identifying butyrogenic configurations of the microbiome is challenging because several different bacteria (or combinations of bacteria) may be involved in the multistep process. Many bacteria in the colon are involved in the degradation of dietary fiber, the complex mixture of plant polysaccharides that is not susceptible to host enzymes (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, many of these bacteria are specialists, attacking specific bonds in specific types of polymers (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Only a limited number of gut bacteria may be able to degrade any given resistant polysaccharide that is used as a dietary supplement. Primary degraders depolymerize specific polysaccharides to mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides that they can take up and ferment themselves to acidic end products such as acetate or lactate (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Their selective growth on the dietary supplement should result in a higher relative abundance in fecal communities. However, most resistant starch degraders are not among known butyrate producers (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Thus, for these supplements to stimulate butyrate production, the activities of additional organisms would be required. These secondary fermenters capture degradation and fermentation products from primary degraders and metabolize them into new molecules, including butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). However, if primary degraders use the supplements efficiently, only a fraction of the carbon and energy they contain may become available to the secondary fermenters. Therefore, increases in the relative abundance of butyrate producers may be more difficult to detect, but their metabolic activity could still be evidenced by an increase in fecal butyrate.</p><fig id="fig1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Proposed model of metabolites and microbes that catalyze the flow of carbon from resistant polysaccharides to butyrate.

<italic>in vivo</italic> have already been identified by their metabolic capabilities <italic>in vitro</italic>. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ruminococcus bromii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bifidobacterium adolescentis</named-content> have been shown to degrade resistant starches (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There have been claims that other species degrade resistant starches, but they are less compelling because they either involved starch preparations that could include sensitive as well as resistant fractions (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) or because the evidence was indirect (e.g., binding to starch granules [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) or the presence of DNA sequences encoding amylase-like GH13 domains (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The ability to degrade inulin <italic>in vitro</italic> has been demonstrated for some species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> (though not all strains) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and by several members of the <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcaceae</italic> families in the phylum <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These two families include most of the known butyrate producers (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The most abundant of the butyrate producers in the human gut are <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium rectale</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</named-content>, both of which are capable of degrading inulin and producing butyrate from it (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. rectale</named-content> has been shown incapable of degrading resistant starches unless they are heat treated to denature some of the crystal structure (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Such rigorous tests have not been reported to our knowledge for <named-content content-type="genus-species">F. prausnitzii</named-content>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have also demonstrated that combinations of primary degraders and secondary bacteria can produce butyrate from resistant polysaccharides by cross feeding. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium rectale</named-content> can grow on degradation products of RS released by <named-content content-type="genus-species">R. bromii</named-content>, and several species of <italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> have been cross-fed by <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Bifidobacteria also promote butyrate production by another select group of bacteria because they produce both acetate and lactate via a unique fermentation pathway known as the Bifid shunt (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This combination of end products can be converted into butyrate by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium hallii</named-content>, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anaerostipes caccae</named-content>, or <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anaerostipes hadrus</named-content> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>These known degraders and butyrate producers were targeted for evaluation in this dietary intervention, but we also analyzed the entire community of fecal bacteria to identify any organisms that had not previously been associated with the metabolism of these fermentable fibers.

We chose not to cluster sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) after discovering that several taxa of interest, with very different responses to the dietary supplements, would be clustered into a single OTU even at 99% identity. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bifidobacterium longum</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Bifidobacterium faecale</named-content> have different abilities to degrade RS, but the V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes in these species are 99.6% identical.

The three supplements we studied include fractions that are resistant to degradation by host enzymes and therefore pass through the small intestine to the colon. There, they can be metabolized by specialized bacteria (which distinguishes them from &#x0201c;bulking fibers&#x0201d; that promote regularity but pass through both the small and large intestines without degradation). Two of the supplements we tested were type 2 resistant starches: unmodified starches extracted from potato tubers (RPS) or high-amylose maize seeds (RMS). However, they had not been pretreated with &#x003b1;-amylase so they included some accessible starch. Only 50% to 70% of such flours is in the crystalline form that is resistant to mammalian &#x003b1;-amylase (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); the rest is &#x0201c;sensitive&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;accessible&#x0201d; to host enzymes. For a negative control, we therefore included a maize starch that is completely digestible by human &#x003b1;-amylase so it should be broken down in the small intestine and not affect colonic communities. It was added at a low dose (equivalent to the sensitive portion of the RMS) or a high dose (equivalent to all the glucose monomers in that resistant supplement). In neither case did this placebo produce any statistically significant changes in the microbiota composition or SCFA production during consumption. The third supplement was the fructose polymer inulin that is entirely resistant to digestion in the small intestine.</p><p>Consuming RPS led to an increase in the average concentration of fecal butyrate (<xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Neither inulin nor RMS produced a significant change in butyrate. An important caveat is that the amount of amylose-resistant polysaccharide consumed was not equal across treatment groups. The inulin and Hi-Maize groups consumed approximately 20 and 20 to 24 g, respectively, while the RPS group consumed approximately 28 to 34 g. However, based on preliminary data, the discrepancy is not sufficient to explain the lack of a butyrogenic effect from inulin and Hi-Maize. In a pilot study, we observed a significant increase in fecal butyrate in individuals consuming half the dose of RPS (24&#x02009;g total, 14 to 17&#x02009;g resistant; data not shown). The butyrogenic response to RPS appears to be due to the nature of the supplement, not just the amount of RS it contains. So the answer to our first research question is that the fiber supplements are not equally effective at stimulating levels of this health-promoting metabolite.</p><p>All the fermentable fiber supplements had some effect on the fecal community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). In individuals consuming RPS, the largest and most common change in V4 sequences was an increase in sequences attributed to <italic>B. faecale/adolescentis/stercoris</italic>. This contrasts with an earlier study of dietary supplementation with resistant starch type 3, where <italic>R. bromii</italic> was the dominant responder (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and was therefore proposed to be a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The different responses in our study could be due to differences in the supplements, as has been observed previously when type 2 or type 4 resistant starches are consumed (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The higher abundance of bifidobacteria in our study is consistent with the known ability of <italic>B. adolescentis</italic> to degrade and ferment RPS <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), but the increase was not associated with a change in fecal butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>), suggesting that these organisms are not effectively cross-feeding butyrate producers <italic>in vivo</italic>&#x02014;even though they can <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is conceivable that <italic>in vivo</italic> production of butyrate from such cross-feeding requires additional time for interactions to be established in the gut microbiome. Longer-term studies are under way to assess this possibility. The microbiomes in a subset of individuals consuming RPS did respond with an increase in <italic>R. bromii</italic>-associated sequences. In this group, there was an associated increase in fecal concentrations of butyrate, so <italic>R. bromii</italic> may be considered a keystone degrader with regard to butyrate production in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>). The major fermentation products of <italic>R. bromii</italic> are acetate, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, but not butyrate (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), so there must be cross-feeding of a butyrogenic microbe. The most likely candidate is <named-content content-type="genus-species">Eubacterium rectale</named-content> because its abundance increased most consistently with that of <italic>R. bromii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>). Two less well-characterized bacterial populations also increased in relative abundance in a few individuals consuming RPS. The increase in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium leptum</named-content>-related Seq100 was not associated with an increase in butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>), suggesting that it too may be a degrader but not a cross-feeder. The Seq176 increase was associated with a butyrate increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.&#x000a0;3B</xref>), which may be because it is both a degrader and a butyrate producer. The activity of its cultured relative <named-content content-type="genus-species">Clostridium chartatabidum</named-content> against RPS is not documented, but it is a ruminal bacterium capable of degrading a variety of plant fibers and it produces butyrate (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Attempts to culture the human strain are under way.</p><p>Individuals consuming RMS did not respond with an increase in the abundance of <italic>B. faecale/adolescentis/stercoris</italic> sequences. With this supplement, like previous studies (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), an increase in <italic>R. bromii</italic>-associated sequences was the most common response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Unlike the RPS-induced <italic>R. bromii</italic> increase, the increase in <italic>R. bromii</italic> on RMS was not associated with a significant increase in fecal butyrate. The lack of a butyrogenic response to RMS was unexpected because the supplement has led to increased fecal butyrate in animal models, though over 4 weeks (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We speculate that the crystal structures of the resistant starches from the two plants are different because the RPS is phosphorylated (once every 200 glycosyl residues [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). They may therefore be degraded with different efficiency or by different strains. Consequently, more time may be required to develop cross-feeding interactions from RMS that generate measurable differences in fecal butyrate.</p><p>Inulin increased the relative abundance of four species of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, consistent with the widespread occurrence of this degradative capability within the genus (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). There were also increases in the abundance of the butyrate producers <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anaerostipes hadrus</named-content> and <italic>E. rectale</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), but they did not result in increased fecal butyrate. The <italic>A. hadrus</italic> may be feeding on the lactate and acetate produced by the more abundant bifidobacteria feeding on this supplement (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) or it may be able to metabolize inulin itself. We note that the low pKa of lactic acid (pKa = 3.86) produced by the Bifid shunt (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) could reduce fecal pH and inhibit butyrogenic microbes that are sensitive to the lower pH. Subsequent utilization of lactic acid would restore pH but may extend the time required to see an effect. Alternatively, it could alter the distribution of microbial populations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such that the balance of butyrate consumption by the host and excretion in feces is affected (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). It may also be that lactate produced by <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species was converted to fermentation products other than butyrate. Notably, propionate increased by 27% on average with inulin consumption, though the change was not statistically significant due to high variability. Other than <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. and <italic>A. hadrus</italic>, there were no significant increases in any other sequences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table&#x000a0;S1C</xref> in the supplemental material), surprisingly including <italic>F. prausnitzii</italic> (which has the metabolic capacity to ferment inulin to butyrate [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]).</p><p>Thus, we observed that all the fermentable fiber supplements we tested increased the relative abundances of some members of the fecal microbiota. Most of the affected sequences are associated with known degraders of resistant polysaccharides or producers of butyrate, but we did uncover two <italic>Firmicutes</italic> not previously associated with fiber supplements. The organisms responding depended both on the individual and the supplement (research question 2).</p><p>Together, our observations on SCFA and community composition changes suggest that the working model for stimulating butyrate production with fiber supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) is an oversimplification, in that fiber degradation does not always lead to butyrate production. The requirement for fiber breakdown by specialized primary degraders appears to hold, with lack of an appropriate degrader preventing butyrate increase. However, not all degraders lead to a butyrogenic response. The lack of enhanced butyrate production in <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>-responding microbiomes suggests that while bifidobacteria are particularly effective at using some fiber supplements, they do not establish cross-feeding reactions with butyrogenic populations as readily as <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>-responsive microbiomes. Furthermore, the concept of a wide variety of butyrate-producing organisms having ready access to the products of degradation and fermentation is not supported. Even though many of these organisms can be cross-fed by primary degraders <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), the <italic>in vivo</italic> scenario seems much more restricted. The only butyrate producer whose abundance increased with a primary degrader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>) and was associated with higher fecal butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>) is <italic>E. rectale</italic>. This organism has a multiprotein system that is attached to the cell wall for degrading sensitive starch (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). It includes carbohydrate binding domains that enable it to attach to RS granules (but not degrade them), as well as ABC transporter proteins that capture oligosaccharide degradation products of the same size as those preferred for growth of <italic>R. bromii</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It has been shown to colocalize with <italic>R. bromii</italic> on starch granules (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and to grow on the products of RS degradation by <italic>R. bromii in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). It thus has the characteristics of a preferred partner in converting RPS to butyrate (research question 3). A single organism, such as <italic>C. chartatabidum</italic>, may be an alternative route, but it occurs in fewer individuals. If the <italic>C. chartatabidum</italic>-related organism from this cohort is indeed a primary degrader of RPS that produces butyrate, it would be an appealing probiotic to give in combination with RPS to enhance butyrate production in a larger percentage of individuals.</p><p>To improve the efficacy of dietary supplements like these, it may be necessary to personalize them according to an individual&#x02019;s gut microbiota (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The presence of <italic>R. bromii</italic> or the <italic>C. chartatabidum</italic>-related organism suggests whether a gut microbiome would yield increased butyrate concentrations following short-term (2-week) supplementation with RPS (research question 4). Individuals without <italic>R. bromii</italic> in their gut microbiome may benefit from a probiotic supplementation with <italic>R. bromii</italic> to increase the likelihood of a butyrogenic response to RPS. There may also be a synergistic effect of combining RPS with both <italic>R. bromii</italic> and <italic>E. rectale</italic> to maximize the butyrogenic effect of the supplement. In contrast, microbiomes with high levels of bifidobacteria are less likely to increase butyrate production in response to RPS (or inulin), at least in the short term. In these microbiomes, a different supplement or combination of supplements may be needed, or a longer period of time may be required for the microbiome to respond to the supplement. Such considerations are necessary when attempting to effect a particular change in the highly variable structures of human gut communities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Study participants.</title><p>Study participants were recruited through the Authentic Research Sections of the introductory biology laboratory course at the University of Michigan (BIO173).

Preliminary studies suggested that 40 to 48&#x02009;g of supplement could be comfortably consumed per day. This amount was therefore used for the studies with RPS and RMS.

Aside from the supplement, participants maintained their normal diet throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4.4"><title>Fecal collection.</title><p>Fecal samples were collected by participants as described previously (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Participants collected approximately half a gram of fecal material into an OMNIgene-Gut (DNA Genotek) collection kit, following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Collection tubes were transferred to a &#x02212;20&#x002da;C freezer within 24 h of collection and stored at &#x02212;20&#x002da;C until thawed for DNA and metabolite extractions. Collection tubes were weighed before and after fecal collection to determine the weight of the fecal material collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4.5"><title>SCFA quantification.</title><p>To extract SCFAs, 1&#x02009;ml of fecal suspension was transferred into a 2-ml 96-well V-bottom collection plate and centrifuged at 4,500 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4&#x002da;C. Portions (200&#x02009;&#x000b5;l) of supernatant fractions were successively filtered through 1.20-, 0.65-, and 0.22-&#x000b5;m 96-well filter plates at 4&#x002da;C. Filtrates were transferred into 1.5-ml screw cap vials containing 100-&#x000b5;l inserts in preparation for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Samples were analyzed in a randomized order. Quantification of SCFAs was performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) that included an LC-10AD vp pump A, LC-10AD vp pump B, degasser DGU-14A, CBM-20A, autosampler SIL-10AD HT, column heater CTO-10A(C) vp, UV detector SPD-10A(V) vp, and an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). We used a mobile phase of 0.01&#x02009;N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at a total flow rate of 0.6&#x02009;ml per min with the column oven temperature at 50&#x002da;C. The sample injection volume was 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;l, and each sample eluted for 40 min. The concentrations were calculated using a cocktail of short-chain organic acid standards at concentrations of 20, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1&#x02009;mM. After correcting the baseline of chromatographs, the quality of peaks was assessed using peak width, relative retention time, and 5% width. Peaks that fell outside predetermined cutoffs for relative retention time and peak width were removed. The concentrations in experimental samples were normalized to the wet weight of the fecal material.</p></sec><sec id="s4.6"><title>16S rRNA gene sequencing.</title><p>DNA was extracted from 250&#x02009;&#x000b5;l of fecal suspension using the 96-well MagAttract PowerMicrobiome DNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and EpMotion liquid handling systems (Eppendorf). The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced as described previously using 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;250-bp paired-end kits on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The samples were assigned randomly to different runs each semester, with eight separate DNA sequencing runs in total. Sequences were curated using the mothur software package as described previously (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Briefly, paired-end reads were merged into contigs, screened for sequencing errors, and aligned to the SILVA bacterial SSU reference database. Aligned sequences were screened for chimeras and classified using the Ribosomal Database Project database. Sequences classified as mitochondria, chloroplasts, or archaea were removed. Sequences of interest were further identified using BLAST to align against the 16S rRNA gene sequences database. Unless stated otherwise, species designations indicate 100% identity to a single species in the database. The number of sequences per sample was rarified to 3,000 to prevent biases from uneven sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s4.7"><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.2.4) via RStudio (version 1.0.136). To determine whether there was a significant change in SCFA concentration from before to during fiber supplementation, we performed repeated measures ANOVAs on SCFA concentrations in all fecal samples from individuals consuming each supplement. For other analyses, we used the median SCFA concentration for each individual at each time point. Changes in the overall community structure in response to supplements were assessed using a within-subject PERMANOVA on Bray-Curtis distances. Diversity was compared using repeated measures ANOVA on the inverse Simpson index for each sample. For other comparisons of the relative abundance of microbiota, we used the average relative abundance for each individual at each time point, yielding a single average community structure for each individual before and during supplementation. Organisms that increased the most in response to each supplement were identified using one-tailed paired Wilcoxon tests on the average abundances in each subject before and during supplementation with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).
