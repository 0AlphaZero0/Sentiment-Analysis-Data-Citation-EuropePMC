<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The term ‘precision medicine’ has therefore attracted wide attention worldwide, and one of its emerging applications is in the care of individuals with diabetes mellitus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concept of ‘personalized medicine’ is not new; clinicians have been tailoring treatment to individual patient characteristics from time immemorial1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood grouping and cross-matching before blood transfusion is also an example of precision or personalized medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, today the term ‘precision medicine’ refers to a narrower aspect of personalized medicine that is backed up by robust scientific evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Advances in several wide-ranging fields such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and the understanding of the gut microbiome have enabled the wider application of precision medicine to several diseases, particularly cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In diabetes care, the scope of precision diabetes applies both to the more common forms of diabetes such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as the relatively rare subtypes of diabetes such as monogenic diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Precision diabetes also finds practical applications in the context of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Table summarizes the current concepts of precision diabetes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="TABLE"></SecTag><sec id="sec1-2"><title><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Precision medicine in type 2 diabetes (T2D) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>T2D is a heterogeneous disease, and all patients with T2D do not respond equally to commonly used therapeutic modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recent advances have helped to postulate the reasons for this differential response to treatment in various subgroups of patients with T2D. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>While T2D has a polygenic inheritance, the TCF7L2 gene has been shown to confer the greatest susceptibility to T2D in a wide variety of populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>It has now been shown that this gene may also, at least partially, determine the response of patients to various oral antidiabetic agents (OADs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For instance, the rs7903146T allele of the TCF7L2 gene was more frequent in patients with T2D who failed to respond to sulphonylureas (SU)2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similarly, carriers of the risk allele rs12255372 T/T were less likely to respond to SU than carriers of G/G3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Differences were also observed in the response to some dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 i)4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Variants in the SLCO1B1 (encoding the hepatic cationic transporter OATP1B1) and CYP2C8 genes (encoding the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP450 C8) have been shown to have an impact on the therapeutic response to the thiazolidinedione OAD, rosiglitazone (but not to pioglitazone)5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Genomic markers are not the only predictors of response to OADs; in a study from the UK database, the presence of markers of insulin resistance such as higher fasting C-peptide, HOMA2 insulin resistance and higher triglycerides were shown to be associated with attenuated response to DPP-4 inhibitor therapy6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Precision medicine can also help predict side-effects of medications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The CYP2C9 * 2 allele was found to increase the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with SU7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The gastrointestinal side effects of metformin have been linked to the interaction between the genes encoding the organic cation transporter 1 and the serotonin reuptake transporter8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A recent study from Scandinavia has divided patients with T2D into five novel ‘clusters’ based on the age of onset, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity, β cell function and body mass index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These clusters consist of some ‘mild’, and some ‘severe’, phenotypes of diabetes9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Preliminary analyses indicate that individuals in the severe insulin-deficient diabetes cluster are more prone to retinopathy, and those in the severe insulin-resistant diabetes cluster, to nephropathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, these clusters may vary in different populations; for example, South Asians have an increased susceptibility to T2D despite being relatively leaner and also get T2D at a much younger age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Hence, their T2D clustering may well be different. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The role of precision medicine in T1D is not well-defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>While patients with T1D vary with respect to their pancreatic autoantibody profile and the rate of β cell destruction, there have, thus far, been no studies linking these differences to implications in diagnosis and treatment of T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is well known that there are some individuals (and families) where complications set in early, even with short duration of diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Conversely, there are others who despite poor control of diabetes for decades, seem to be protected from the complications of diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This is another field in precision diabetes research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title><text><SENT sid="50" pm="!"><plain>Precision medicine in monogenic diabetes: Now a reality! </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The term ‘Monogenic diabetes’ refers to types of diabetes which are due to a single gene mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The monogenic forms of diabetes can be termed the ‘poster child’ of precision diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>While there are several phenotypes of monogenic diabetes, three in particular have demonstrated the utility of a precision approach to diagnosis and management. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>These are maturity-onset diabetes of the young, neonatal diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>While there are at least 14 known forms of MODY, HNF 1α and 4 α mutations (MODY 3 and MODY 1) are the most common forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Patients with these subtypes of MODY are usually diagnosed before the age of 25 yr, they are lean and do not have any features of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>They are therefore, often misdiagnosed as T1D and initiated on life-long insulin therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>However, they have a strong family history of diabetes (across three or more generations) and exhibit preservation of β cell function beyond the honeymoon phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the precise mutation by genetic testing enables transitioning of these patients to SU, as they have been found to have good response to even low doses of these drugs10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Individuals with glucokinase mutations (MODY 2) exhibit stable fasting hyperglycaemia from birth, with minimal increment in glucose levels after a meal, and relatively low HbA1c levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These patients are at very low risk of diabetes complications and treatment of the mildly elevated glucose levels is neither warranted nor beneficial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of this mutation can enable the cessation of treatment in these patients, many of whom might have been misclassified as T1D or T2D10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>There are at least a dozen types of MODY each with its own characteristic phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We have recently described the profile of MODY in south India and also a novel mutation in NKX6-1 gene which could be a novel form of MODY11. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>NDM has been defined as autoantibody negative, insulin sensitive hyperglycaemia that is diagnosed within the first six months of life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>NDM is predominantly monogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>There are two types of NDM: transient NDM (TNDM) and permanent NDM (PNDM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In the TNDM variety, the diabetes disappears before the first birthday but may reappear in some in adulthood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In PNDM variety, the diabetes persists throughout life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Therapy of patients with neonatal diabetes offers the most dramatic example of the benefits of precision medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Children with NDM have mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel on the cell membrane of the β cell, which is one of the key players in insulin secretion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>These children are typically diagnosed as T1D and initiated on insulin therapy, but the response is often suboptimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Many of these children with mutations in genes encoding the Kir 6.2 and SUR subunits of the K-ATP channel can be successfully weaned off insulin and transitioned to SU12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>While the doses of SU used are often higher (on a per kg basis) than those used in HNF mutations or T2D, the response is excellent and has now been shown, in a large multinational cohort, to be maintained over a period of 10 years13. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycaemia is, in a sense, the opposite of neonatal diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Here, neonates present with features of persistent hypoglycaemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>While some respond to diazoxide, some may need a subtotal pancreatectomy14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing helps to accurately diagnose and treat these children. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Precision diabetes: Its role in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The use of CGM systems has been advocated as a useful tool for studying day-to-day glucose variability, thereby providing a personalized snapshot of the patient's glycaemic profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>CGM is perhaps one of the best examples of personalized medicine available today as it enables detection of the patient's blood glucose patterns at a glance and helps the patient and clinician come to a shared decision based on the information obtained15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) has become very popular in India16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The physicians are now able to make adjustments based on the AGP readings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In summary, current guidelines for the management of diabetes emphasize an ‘individualized approach’ to choosing therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>While these guidelines suggest using patient characteristics such as age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c levels and presence of comorbidities and drug characteristics such as efficacy, side effects and cost to guide therapy, application of the precision approach can help provide a robust scientific basis for such choices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, many of the tools used in precision medicine are still very expensive and unavailable in many parts of the world including India. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>It is to be hoped that with advances in technology, these modalities will increasingly be made available and affordable to clinicians and patients so that the dream of personalized diabetes care can come to fruition in the near future. </plain></SENT>
