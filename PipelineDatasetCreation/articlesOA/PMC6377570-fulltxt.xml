Of these, more than one-third will present with critical CHD, most broadly defined as forms of CHD requiring surgical or catheter interventions or resulting in death in the first year of life.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3</xref> Advances in prenatal diagnosis as well as medical and surgical care have reduced mortality rates for all forms of CHD. However, evidence of central nervous system damage, including delayed brain maturation in utero and abnormal brain metabolism and microstructure associated with hypoxic-ischaemic injury, has been reported by a wealth of studies of critical CHD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> A dramatic increase in the population of survivors of infant heart surgery has been accompanied by the increased recognition of their long-term postoperative morbidities. Neurodevelopmental disabilities, particularly executive function (EF) impairments, are currently the most prevalent long-term morbidity in the population with CHD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> EF refers to a set of higher order neurocognitive abilities that serve to coordinate and organise actions towards a goal, allowing the individual to adapt to new or complex situations.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Impairments in EF manifest as behavioural dysregulation and attention problems, impaired working memory (ie, the ability to keep information in mind and manipulate it over a short period of time) and problems with organisation and planning abilities. EF is more strongly associated with school readiness than is IQ, predicts both mathematics and reading competence throughout the school years<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> and is strongly associated with social cognition (ie, decoding other people&#x02019;s mental and emotional states and responding to rapid-paced social interactions).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
</p><p>Executive dysfunction can profoundly impact all dimensions of a child&#x02019;s development<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;14</xref> and is a core feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and autism spectrum symptoms.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> If untreated, deficits in EF may also predispose individuals to later addiction,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> eating disorders and obesity,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and risk-taking behaviours.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These adverse sequelae may carry profound implications for the educational achievement, future employment and quality of life of individuals with CHD.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><sec id="s1a"><title>EF in critical CHD</title><p>Impairments in EF are at the heart of the neurodevelopmental phenotype associated with critical CHD after open-heart surgery.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;34</xref> EF deficits in children with CHD were first reported in school-aged children with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGAs).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Standardised neuropsychological testing showed that patients with d-TGA had substantial difficulty planning and alternating between tasks, which suggested impairments in cognitive flexibility and working memory as well as deficits in planning and sustained attention. On the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), parents and teachers of adolescents with CHD reported significant difficulties, particularly with regard to working memory.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Compared with normative values, parents&#x02019; ratings were worse by ~0.5 SD and those of teachers by ~1&#x02009;SD, suggesting statistically significant and clinically meaningful impairments. More recent findings also reported specific EF impairments in preschool and school-aged children with d-TGA.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23 24</xref> In particular, children had important difficulties in behavioural regulation and cognitive control of attention, and they had worse performances on verbal and visual working memory tasks. Consistent findings have been reported by studies that included children with other types of critical CHD such as tetralogy of Fallot<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> or single ventricle physiology requiring the Fontan operation.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Finally, EF impairments have been associated with worse psychosocial health status and worse quality of life in youth with critical CHD,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> highlighting the potential impact of long-term executive dysfunction on mental health in CHD.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Working memory intervention for children with CHD</title><p>The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends routine neurodevelopmental screening of all CHD survivors.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A burgeoning literature documents the prevalence and importance of impaired EF and ADHD in CHD survivors,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;40</xref> and brain imaging studies have provided key information on the underlying disturbances in brain structure and microstructure in patients with CHD.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Yet, to date, no trials have been undertaken to test interventions targeting EF and attention deficits in the CHD population.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>Cogmed Working Memory Training (Cogmed) is the most widely used computerised evidence-based intervention that targets EF, specifically providing intensive structured training of working memory.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;54</xref> It has been shown to improve executive performance in several clinical and non-clinical paediatric populations, including children with ADHD,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42 46 47</xref> low working memory and low achievement<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 44</xref> and children who were born preterm or extremely low birth weight.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53 54</xref> Unlike hospital-based or laboratory-based interventions, Cogmed can be implemented as a home-based intervention for children. Studies using Cogmed have shown that subjects demonstrate the ability to transfer skills to non-trained tests of working memory as well as to tasks that involve similar processes, including attention, inhibition and non-verbal reasoning.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51&#x02013;53</xref> The positive effect of training has been observed on parental ratings of inattention, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Parent Rating Scale, ADHD Rating Scale, Fourth Edition, BRIEF and Conners&#x02019; Parent Rating Scale. Sustained improvements in behaviour as measured by rating scales have also been observed in ADHD,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> brain injury<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49 50</xref> and non-clinical groups.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51 52</xref>
</p><p>In summary, several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of Cogmed in healthy children<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 51 52</xref> and in children with various conditions<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42 47 53 54</xref> have demonstrated that this neurocognitive intervention produces significant generalised and sustained enhancement on measures of EF and also on everyday life learning and behavioural skills. It is proposed that training working memory using Cogmed is a promising intervention for school-aged children with critical CHD because: (1) it addresses the most frequent neurodevelopmental morbidities that strongly impact the ability to succeed in academic and social environments; (2) it allows for intensive and structured practice of targeted skills, with possible transfer to other neurodevelopmental domains; (3) it is individually adapted to each child&#x02019;s own EF levels, which ensures an optimal level of performance throughout the sessions; (4) it is closely monitored, and various parameters of the child&#x02019;s performance are systematically recorded (eg, correct answers and speed at which tasks are completed); (5) it is child-friendly and rewarding, which facilitates children&#x02019;s compliance; and, finally, but importantly (6) as a home-based intervention, it reduces the need for hospital/clinic-based visits and multiple costs of individual therapy, potentially reducing the burden for families of children with chronic health conditions such as critical CHD.</p><p>In this project, we conduct a RCT to provide the first proof of concept that Cogmed intervention improves neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD and that the improvements persist to 3 months. We will enrol children with CHD who underwent infant open-heart surgery as this population corresponds to the highest risk category for developmental disorders and disabilities as per the AHA guidelines (Class I; Level of Evidence A).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We propose to determine immediate and 3-month post-treatment effects on both laboratory-based tests and ecological measures of children&#x02019;s EF, ADHD and social difficulties in everyday life. Our study will also provide insight into factors that are associated with response to treatment, identifying children who may be most likely to benefit from the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>Specific aim 1: to evaluate the immediate efficacy of home-based Cogmed intervention for neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD. We hypothesise that children who receive the Cogmed intervention, compared with controls receiving standard of care, will display greater improvement from baseline to post-treatment assessment in EF and social development, and greater reduction in symptoms of ADHD.</p><p>Our primary outcome measure will be the change in standardised mean score on the working memory test from the National Institutes of Health Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function (NIH Toolbox)<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> from baseline to post-treatment.

All eligible subjects undergo a baseline neurodevelopmental assessment and then are randomly assigned to either the home-based Cogmed intervention or to a control group receiving the standard of care for children with CHD. All participants will undergo a post-treatment and a 3-month follow-up assessment. All investigators collecting outcome data are blinded to patients&#x02019; group assignment (Cogmed intervention versus standard of care) and to medical and surgical histories. Participants and their parents know their group assignment and thus are not blinded. For children assigned to the Cogmed group, post-treatment assessments are performed 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;weeks after the end of the intervention (ie, approximately 7&#x02013;8 weeks after baseline assessment) and follow-up will be performed 3 months after the end of the intervention (ie, approximately 5 months after baseline assessment).

Families are invited to participate in the study via a mail packet and follow-up phone call. Flyers and study brochures are displayed in Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital Cardiology Clinic and affiliated medical centres as well as in some local advocacy parent organisations. Participants are assessed for eligibility and enrolled by a study coordinator and a research nurse. Informed consent and assent from the child are obtained by a study coordinator or a research neuropsychologist before the baseline assessment at the hospital. Parents and children receive monetary compensation for participation in the study. These incentives are given at the second and third visits. Additionally, in order to further facilitate participants&#x02019; compliance and reduce dropouts, the second and third study assessments may be completed at a child&#x02019;s home.

Allocations are assigned using a computerised system only seen by the research assistant or study coordinator after confirming all eligibility criteria and consent. Subjects are assigned in the order in which they are enrolled into the study. Randomisation is done by computerised permuted blocks design with blocks of varying sizes. Once a subject has been assigned to a group, he or she will remain in the same trial arm for the duration of the study. The randomisation scheme involves two stratification factors: type of CHD (univentricular or biventricular) and baseline level of EF (a score &#x0003c;85&#x02009;or &#x02265;85 on the working memory test from the NIH Toolbox). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the flow chart of the trial design.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of trial design.

The training programme contains 12 child-friendly visual-spatial and verbal working memory tasks (eg, remembering the order in which lamps light up on a 4&#x000d7;4&#x02009;grid; recalling a series of numbers of increasing length on the screen). All tasks are adaptive, that is, task complexity levels are automatically adjusted to match each child&#x02019;s working memory capacity, to improve performance and to limit non-compliance to the intervention due to lack of motivation. Tasks become more difficult, on a session-by-session basis, as a child&#x02019;s performance improves. Each training session lasts approximately 40&#x02013;50&#x02009;min, and the child is instructed to complete one session per day 5 days each week for 5 weeks, for a total of 25 sessions. The programme yields individual session-by-session and task-by-task training results, including the children&#x02019;s responses, time spent on each task and evolution curves. Cogmed is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated. Based on our specific aims, Cogmed is considered a non-significant risk device.</p><p>Study tablets (ie, iPads) are provided to families randomised to the Cogmed group in order to standardise the method of delivery. Families receive a link for downloading a web-based software program to the tablet. The program is installed on the tablet by a study coordinator who explains how the training program works and how to log into the system and complete training. The training session and installation of the program are completed after baseline assessment and randomisation. Parents and children will be actively involved, and during the installation session, children will complete several practice trials under the supervision of the study coordinator. The 25 sessions will be completed by the child, supervised by a parent. For the first five sessions, the child trains on the same set of games; on the sixth session and every fifth session thereafter, a new task is introduced and replaces one of the initial tasks. At the end of each session, the child can play an age-appropriate tablet game as a reward. After each session, a parent will upload the results to a secure website. Families are contacted weekly to check program function and discuss concerns. Compliance is automatically registered by the computerised program and is defined as completing at least 20 sessions, the criterion by which children are categorised as compliant or non-compliant to treatment.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41 42</xref>
</p><p>To implement this intervention, each investigator and study coordinator involved in coaching is certified as a &#x02018;Cogmed Coach&#x02019;. The Cogmed Coaches will monitor children&#x02019;s performance on mycogmed.com secured website every week during the intervention to permit continuous evaluation of treatment compliance and fidelity. The Cogmed coach specifically monitors performance of each child and contacts the parents and the child by phone on a weekly basis to discuss progression and any issues arising during the training week. A designated Cogmed coach will be available during the trial to respond to any questions or help with any difficulties during the training. Families and children are encouraged to continue the training for at least 20 sessions. If parents or children struggle with some aspects of the intervention such as the time commitment or a lack of motivation to persist with the training, the Cogmed coach discusses alternative options for accommodating each individual child&#x02019;s needs (ie, rewards systems available, best time of the day to practice, number of breaks necessary during each session and so on) We provide weekly feedback sessions and close monitoring in order to discourage dropouts and increase compliance with the intervention. Parents are asked to complete a training evaluation scale following completion of Cogmed; this scale is an integrated component of Cogmed that gathers information regarding the child&#x02019;s motivation and attention during the training as well as parents&#x02019; feedback. As soon as a child finishes the intervention, a blinded post-treatment assessment will be scheduled to occur within the following weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Control group: standard of care</title><p>Children randomly assigned to the control group will receive the standard of care recommended for patients with critical CHD. This includes cardiac surveillance and, if needed, neurodevelopmental counselling and screening at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital Cardiac Neurodevelopmental Program. Once enrolled in the study, a child in the control group will not receive Cogmed intervention or any other cognitive intervention that targets EFs or ADHD symptoms until after the 3-month follow-up assessment is completed, that is, 5&#x02013;6 months after initial enrolment. Like children assigned to the intervention group, children in the control group can continue treatments that are already in place for other neurodevelopmental disabilities (eg, speech therapy and occupational services). For children in the control group, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up assessments will be performed 6&#x02013;7 weeks and 4&#x02013;5 months after baseline assessment, respectively. After the study is completed, children in the control group will be offered the possibility of completing the Cogmed intervention at no cost.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The NIH Toolbox<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> is a set of computerised assessments designed to measure outcomes in longitudinal or intervention trials. This battery is particularly appropriate for our study because it is presented in a computerised child-friendly version, paralleling that of the Cogmed intervention. The <italic>List Sorting Working Memory Test</italic> from the NIH Toolbox is the primary outcome of the trial. This standardised measure assesses the ability to process information across a series of modalities (visual-spatial and verbal), to hold this information in a short-term buffer and to actively manipulate it mentally. It is considered an excellent composite indicator of children&#x02019;s EF skills, as it requires the simultaneous implementation of control of attention and working memory abilities on tasks of increasing complexity. Mean scores are automatically computed and are compared with a standardisation sample of US children of the same age. Scores are normally distributed (mean=100, SD=15) in the standardisation sample. The construct validity of the NIH Toolbox working memory tasks is 0.58 for convergent validity and 0.30 for divergent validity. This test has a test&#x02013;retest reliability of 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.92).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>NIH toolbox cognition battery</title><p>We include tests that measure cognitive flexibility, attention and inhibitory control, episodic memory, language and processing speed.

Although this test has a good test&#x02013;retest reliability of &#x003c1;=0.87, to be conservative, we will assume a value of &#x003c1;=0.70 between baseline and post-treatment and between baseline and 3-month follow-up on the same subject. Given a sample size of 100 subjects, &#x003c1;=0.70 for within-subject correlations, and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, we have 81.4% power to detect a mean difference of 0.5 SD between treatment groups, with a conservative 20% attrition rate (hence, analysing a minimum of 80 subjects) in our primary outcome measure. This corresponds to a mean difference of 7.5 units, given an expected SD of 15 for the List Sorting Working Memory Test of the NIH Toolbox.</p><p>Among children who receive the Cogmed intervention, we also seek to assess associations of cognitive, sociodemographic and medical factors with changes in the scores for our primary outcome measure (specific aim 3). Given a sample size of 50 children in the Cogmed group and a two-sided type I error rate of 5%, we have 79.9% power to detect a correlation of 0.43 (or <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>=0.43<sup>2</sup> = 0.185 from a linear regression) between a patient-specific factor and the primary outcome variable even with a conservative 20% attrition rate (analysing a minimum of 40 subjects).</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Data analysis plan</title><p>For specific aims 1 and 2, the efficacy of the intervention will be evaluated by comparing within-subject differences (baseline to post-treatment, baseline to 3-month follow-up and, in secondary analyses, post-treatment to 3-month follow-up) across treatment groups using an intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>Descriptive statistics will be calculated, including means, SD, medians and IQRs for continuous variables and frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables. The primary outcome measure, the List Sorting Working Memory Test of the NIH Toolbox and most other study outcomes are continuous variables. T-tests and linear regression will be used to assess differences between the intervention and control groups for continuous outcomes (ie, differences in means, 95%&#x02009;CI). Proportions and logistic regression will be used to examine group differences in binary outcomes (ie, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, ORs and 95%&#x02009;CI). We expect that randomisation will produce balance between treatment groups in terms of demographic and baseline factors, but we will use regression methods to adjust for any factors that may be unbalanced. All analyses will be accompanied by graphical exploration of the data to identify outlying and influential observations. Data transformations and non-parametric methods (eg, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) will be used as appropriate when parametric assumptions are violated. Primary analyses of treatment group differences will focus on complete cases. In secondary analyses, we will assume no change over time for subjects who do not return for their post-treatment assessment (ie, last value carried forward approach), but we will also carry out other sensitivity analyses to assess the strength of our findings based on other missing data assumptions.</p><p>For specific aim 3, we will explore the associations between patient factors and within-subject differences (baseline to post-treatment, baseline to 3-month follow-up) using correlation and linear regression methods, including consideration of possible confounding or effect modification. Specific attention will be given to certain patient-specific risk factors including age at first heart surgery (neonatal vs non-neonatal), number of surgeries and neurological complications. Because we will be conducting multiple analyses with several predictors and primary and secondary outcomes in an exploratory fashion, we will interpret results cautiously, based on significance levels (p&#x0003c;0.05, two tailed) and on the magnitude of differences, correlations or regression effects. As appropriate, we will also consider the use of other statistical methods, such as generalised additive models, partial and sparse partial least squares and family-wise error rates, in our approach. Analyses will be conducted primarily using SAS&#x000a0;V.9.4, Stata&#x000a0;V.15.1, SPSS&#x000a0;V.25 and R&#x000a0;V.3.5.2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Protocol modifications and amendments will be submitted to the ethical committees for approval.

This is the first study to investigate the effects of a neurocognitive intervention targeting EF in school-aged children with CHD. We will evaluate children&#x02019;s cognitive and social outcomes including autism spectrum and ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, the results from this trial will provide information on potential patient-specific factors associated with response to the intervention. As a first clinical trial, we will test the efficacy of the intervention at 3&#x02009;months after the cessation of training. If the intervention is proven effective at this time, longer term effects should be investigated (eg, at 6-month or 12-month postintervention). Assessment of longer term effects of working memory training will provide key information about the cost-efficacy of Cogmed in patients with CHD, the likelihood that lasting benefits generalise to other areas of development and the duration of its benefits.</p><p>Executive dysfunction may have cascading adverse effects on a myriad of domains ranging from specific neurocognitive abilities to school achievement, social adaptation and, ultimately, quality of life. Timely prevention and treatment of these issues is a priority in the care of patients with CHD. If proven effective, this type of neurocognitive intervention could be implemented in a clinical outpatient practice for patients at increased neurodevelopmental risk.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e268"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-023304.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d35e269"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2018-023304.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Patient consent for publication:</bold> Not required.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JC, DCB and JWN are the primary investigators and, together with DW, designed and established this research study.
