</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Plasmids are important in horizontal gene transfer and are critical in facilitating genome restructuring by providing a mechanism for distributing genes that provide a selective advantage to their host (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Typically, plasmids have a modular structure, containing several functional genetic modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Plasmids are known to vary from 5 to 500 kb in size, although plasmids as small as 2 kb (2–4) to as large as more than 1 Mb in size (5, 6) have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Historically, environmental plasmid studies focused on exogenous isolation of plasmids studied via mating experiments (7, 8) or via plasmid isolation from bacterial strains that can be cultured (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A previous study on groundwater samples revealed the presence of plasmids in strains that could be cultured, indicating the presence of plasmids in bacteria from low-cell-density environments (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Given that it is well established that only 1% of bacteria on Earth can be readily cultivated (13), a lot remains unexplored, establishing the need to explore plasmids by a cultivation-independent method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>More recently, with affordable DNA sequencing technologies, methods have been developed to specifically isolate and sequence circular plasmid DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The plasmidome is described to be the entire plasmid content in an environment that is resolved by metagenomic approaches during high-throughput-sequencing experiments (14) and thus circumvents the need to culture environmental bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It identifies all plasmid types—conjugative, mobilizable, and nonmobilizable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Such plasmidome analyses have been performed in cow rumen (15, 16), rat cecum (17), soil (18), and activated sludge (19, 20), samples that are abundant in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, plasmidomes have not been explored in low-cell-density environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Due to the role of plasmids in environmental stress adaptation, we explore the plasmids in groundwater typically characterized by low cell counts but diverse and dynamic microbiomes (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here we examine samples from the Oak Ridge Field Research Center (ORFRC) site at the Y-12 Federal Security Complex in Oak Ridge, TN, which is a widely studied and characterized model groundwater environment (22–25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To explore the plasmidome of groundwater known to have a fluctuating microbial community along with lowered cell counts (26, 27), we modified known plasmid DNA isolation methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to discover the incidence, distribution, and function of plasmids from this site and to develop a foundation to explore the plasmidome of low-cell-density environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We present the plasmidome analyses from groundwater samples that resulted in the identification of several hundred circular plasmids bearing genes involved in plasmid replication, mobilization, and maintenance along with those that code for metal, antibiotic, and phage resistance, thus bestowing beneficial traits on the host. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The optimized plasmid DNA isolation methodology used in this study yielded the largest plasmid sizes reported in plasmidome studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Since a previous culture-based study of native plasmids from groundwater environment revealed the presence of a large plasmid (202 kb) (9), we used strains containing large plasmids for the method optimization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The key steps that aided in the optimization of standard protocols (15, 16, 19) were (i) using a model system that contained a large 202-kb plasmid in comparison to the 65-kb (28) and 56-kb (29) plasmids used earlier and (ii) optimization of Phi29 amplification to better represent large plasmids (details in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The optimized method was used to isolate plasmid DNA from seven groundwater samples followed by shallow (five plasmid DNA libraries from samples A to E pooled) and deep (two plasmid DNA libraries from samples F and G not pooled) sequencing (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The resulting scaffold distribution showed that the majority of the genes were annotated to be bacterial in origin (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the number of raw reads generated was an order of magnitude higher in the deeply sequenced samples, enabling a more comprehensive analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>We found a high abundance of genes annotated to provide resistance to metals—copper, triclosan, arsenic, and mercury—with a large majority being proteobacterial in origin (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>A previous study noted a high abundance of metal resistance genes in these groundwater samples (24) and hypothesized that they might be present on plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Among antibiotic resistance genes, those providing resistance to aminocoumarin, elfamycin, and bacitracin were predominant (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Overall, the plasmids were enriched in metal resistance genes compared to the antibiotic resistance genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>There was no detectable metal contamination in our groundwater samples, but given that these groundwater samples are close to a metal-contaminated site at ORFRC (22, 31), it is possible that the microbiome was exposed to metal stress at some point and/or that the dynamic nature of groundwater flow coupled with weather changes might lead to sporadic exposure to low levels of metal contaminants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we find metal resistance genes to be the most predominant, rather than antibiotic resistance genes predominant in activated sludge/wastewater (19, 20), genes required for survival under dairy conditions reported in Lactococcus (32), or genes providing an advantage in rumen environments (16). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to explore the plasmidome of a groundwater environment based on metagenomic approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Given the low cell density and absence of selective parameters (e.g., mercury), along with the burden associated with carrying plasmids, it was surprising to find a rich plasmidome in the groundwater samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Our study adds hundreds of novel plasmids to the plasmid database(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the optimized plasmid DNA isolation methods targeted large circular DNA molecules and identified the largest plasmids reported in plasmidome studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Further, we find that plasmid distribution is more conserved across groundwater samples even though the microbiome fluctuates daily from well to well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In fact, our analyses also revealed the presence of certain identical plasmids from different groundwater samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The predominance of genes encoding metal (including mercury) resistance on circular plasmids, despite the lack of detectable metals in the corresponding groundwaters, strongly implicates the native plasmids as the mechanism for maintaining latent functionalities in these environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we find that antibiotic resistance genes are not as predominant as the metal resistance genes, indicating that a lack of selective pressure (i.e., no use of antibiotics) helps in curtailing the spread of antibiotic resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Together, the plasmidome analysis of this site provides a broad insight into plasmid-borne functions and provides evidence that plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer plays a role in driving the evolution of this groundwater microbial community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although certain observations made were unique to this site, the method to examine native plasmid DNA in low-cell-density environments and the broad trends observed are generalizable to all microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
