</text></title><p id="Par1"><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization (WHO) revised its clinical guidelines for management of childhood pneumonia in 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant delays have occurred during previous introductions of new guidelines into routine clinical practice in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined whether providing enhanced audit and feedback as opposed to routine standard feedback might accelerate adoption of the new pneumonia guidelines by clinical teams within hospitals in a low-income setting. </plain></SENT>
</text></SecTag></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par2"><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this parallel group cluster randomized controlled trial, 12 hospitals were assigned to either enhanced feedback (nâ=â6 hospitals) or standard feedback (nâ=â6 hospitals) using restricted randomization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standard (network) intervention delivered in both trial arms included support to improve collection and quality of patient data, provision of mentorship and team management training for pediatricians, peer-to-peer networking (meetings and social media), and multimodal (print, electronic) bimonthly hospital specific feedback reports on multiple indicators of evidence guideline adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to this network intervention, the enhanced feedback group received a monthly hospital-specific feedback sheet targeting pneumonia indicators presented in multiple formats (graphical and text) linked to explicit performance goals and action plans and specific email follow up from a network coordinator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the start of the trial, all hospitals received a standardized training on the new guidelines and printed booklets containing pneumonia treatment protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the proportion of children admitted with indrawing and/or fast-breathing pneumonia who were correctly classified using new guidelines and received correct antibiotic treatment (oral amoxicillin) in the first 24âh. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The secondary outcome was the proportion of correctly classified and treated children for whom clinicians changed treatment from oral amoxicillin to injectable antibiotics. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par3"><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The trial included 2299 childhood pneumonia admissions, 1087 within the hospitals randomized to enhanced feedback intervention, and 1212 to standard feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The proportion of children who were correctly classified and treated in the first 24âh during the entire 9-month period was 38.2% (393 out of 1030) and 38.4% (410 out of 1068) in the enhanced feedback and standard feedback groups, respectively (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37â3.34; Pâ=â0.855). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, in exploratory analyses, there was evidence of an interaction between type of feedback and duration (in months) since commencement of intervention, suggesting a difference in adoption of pneumonia policy over time in the enhanced compared to standard feedback arm (ORâ=â1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.36, Pâ&lt;â0.001). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par4"><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Enhanced feedback comprising increased frequency, clear messaging aligned with goal setting, and outreach from a coordinator did not lead to a significant overall effect on correct pneumonia classification and treatment during the 9-month trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be a significant effect of time (representing cumulative effect of feedback cycles) on adoption of the new policy in the enhanced feedback compared to standard feedback group. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Pneumonia is the second leading cause of child mortality worldwide; 0.9 million of the 5.9 million childhood deaths in 2015 were caused by pneumonia [1â3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>At least one half of all global pneumonia deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The World Health Organization (WHO) pneumonia guidelines that diagnose pneumonia using a small number of simple clinical signs are routinely used in sub-Saharan Africa where resources for laboratory and radiologic diagnosis of pneumonia are limited [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Prior to 2013, WHO guidelines recognized three pneumonia severity classifications: pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and very severe pneumonia [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>According to previous guidelines, a child with a cough or difficult breathing was diagnosed with pneumonia if they developed fast breathing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Severe pneumonia was defined by lower chest wall indrawing in a child with cough or difficult breathing while a diagnosis of very severe pneumonia was made in children who developed any danger sign (inability to drink/breastfeed, altered consciousness, grunting, central cyanosis, hypoxia) in the presence of cough or difficult breathing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The severity of pneumonia guides subsequent antibiotic treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Emerging research, however, challenged this original guidance [5, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>First, studies suggested equivalence between injectable penicillin and oral amoxicillin for the treatment of pneumonia characterized by indrawing but no danger signs [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Second, studies suggested that the population of children with pneumonia and indrawing but no danger signs for whom recommendations suggested inpatient care could be successfully treated as outpatients [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The WHO responded to this new evidence in 2013 by making the first major revisions to childhood pneumonia guidelines in many years [4, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These revisions aimed to (1) simplify the classification of childhood pneumonia severity to two categories instead of three and (2) switch treatment from injectable penicillin to oral amoxicillin for children aged 2â59âmonths with pneumonia characterized by indrawing but no danger signs (hereafter referred to as indrawing pneumonia). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The treatment change harmonized the treatment for indrawing pneumonia with that for pneumonia defined only by fast breathing (without either indrawing or any danger signs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The 2015 results of a Kenyan trial also suggesting equivalence of injectable penicillin and oral amoxicillin (conducted on hospitalized patients) prompted a change in Kenyan pneumonia guidelines to align with the new WHO guidance in 2016 [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Progress in translating policy changes such as these for pneumonia into routine clinical practice is slow in sub-Saharan Africa [12], even in cases where clear guidance exists [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This slow progress is particularly evident for policies that require changes in well-established clinical behaviors [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For example, in Kenya, reducing the unnecessary use of cough medicines as co-treatment of pneumonia has taken many years [15], while changing first-line treatment for inpatient severe malaria has taken several years [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The advent of new pneumonia guidelines in Kenya therefore provided an opportunity to study implementation strategies that might accelerate adoption of the new guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Audit of hospital care is widely used as a strategy for improving quality of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Clinical audit involves measuring clinical teamsâ performance in providing care [17â19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The effect of audit is enhanced when it is coupled with feedback where agents (e.g., peers or supervisors) provide information regarding individual health worker or clinical teamsâ performance [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The suggested mechanism through which audit and feedback improves performance in hospitals is by identifying and reducing the discrepancy between current and desired performance [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Interventions that make better use of audit and feedback provide a possible strategy for promoting desired clinical performance following changes in health policies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We therefore designed a study to compare the effect of alternative audit and feedback strategies delivered concurrently with dissemination of the new policy on the uptake of policy recommendations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Our trial aimed to test whether enhancing the frequency and format of feedback and incorporating goal setting and action planning could result in more rapid adoption of the new policy of using oral amoxicillin for indrawing pneumonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This randomized trial directly addresses a need expressed in a systematic review that included 140 studies that âfuture studies of audit and feedback should directly compare different ways of providing feedbackâ [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Addressing the question of how best to promote policy adoption is also important as failure to implement evidence-based policies in routine practice undermines the whole research enterprise. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>A pragmatic parallel group cluster randomized trial was conducted over a 9-month period in 12 county hospitals providing first level inpatient referral care in Kenya that are part of a clinical information network (CIN) [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The hospital was the unit of randomization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The cluster design was selected because inpatient pediatric care is organized around multidisciplinary teams composed of doctors and nurses among other health workers and providing team level feedback is logistically easier for health systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Secondly, it is much more effective to deliver the intervention at hospital level rather than individual health worker level in hospitals with rapid staff turnover where the individual, junior front-line clinicians change every 3âmonths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>This is the group of clinicians who are expected to adhere to the pneumonia guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Study participants </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The 14 hospitals in CIN were selected in consultation with the Ministry of Health from 12 out of the 47 counties in Kenya. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>All these hospitals were public government-owned hospitals and were estimated to admit at least 1000 children per year and located in one of the main malaria ecological zones in Kenya (either high or low to very low malaria transmission). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>For the trial, 12 of the initial 14 hospitals, one from each county, were selected for inclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The hospitals that were excluded from the trial were a small facility (less than 1000 admissions per year) that is staffed by clinical officers (physician assistants) and not resident physicians or pediatricians as in the other 13 CIN hospitals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The second facility was excluded from the trial because it had existing formal linkages with other research and academic institutions that might influence the intervention effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Individual case records were identified for post-discharge medical record review in each participating hospital if the admissions were aged between 2 and 59âmonths and had a provider clinical diagnosis of pneumonia regardless of signs or symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>We excluded admissions with cough persisting more than 2âweeks or co-morbid conditions for which there are specifically recommended antibiotic treatments in Kenyan guidelines including meningitis, HIV, severe malnutrition, severe malaria (spanning cerebral malaria and severe malaria anemia), surgical conditions, and sepsis [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Interventions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The trial had two arms, and each trial arm received one of the two intervention strategies implemented between March 10, 2016, and December 4, 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The first intervention (referred to as enhanced feedback) involved an audit on indicators of pneumonia care with feedback delivered every month, using a specific pneumonia feedback sheet provided in both graphical and text-based formats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We incorporated explicit performance goals for each audit and feedback cycle with accompanying action plans for relevant indicators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The network coordinator (a senior pediatrician) sent emails to the local pediatrician encouraging them to read and act on the received feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The enhanced feedback intervention was designed drawing on Feedback Intervention Theory [20], the modifications to this theory suggested by Hysong and colleagues [18, 19], and a systematic review that suggests which attributes of feedback may promote its effectiveness [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The second intervention (referred to as standard feedback) was audit and feedback of general pediatric care delivered less frequently (bimonthly), using a single format of comprehensive performance reports for general indicators of pediatric care spanning five major conditions including pneumonia and described in more detail elsewhere [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Additionally, both trial arms received a half-day training delivered to the clinical and nursing teams on the new pneumonia guidelines at the start of the trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Clinicians in all hospitals were also supplied with updated protocol booklets that contained information on the new pneumonia guidance including specific pneumonia algorithms articulating the key clinical signs and how these are to be used in classification together with dosage tables for oral amoxicillin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Finally, all hospitals in the trial received continued network support, described in detail in the next section under intervention context. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The Kenyan clinical information network has been in operation since late 2013 and has adopted a range of approaches to understand and improve hospital care (TableÂ 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A full description of its components, activities, and theoretical underpinnings is presented elsewhere [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In brief, CIN components and activities comprise (1) initial mentorship and basic training on team management provided to hospitalsâ pediatricians in 2014 and early 2015 to promote their engagement in service improvement, (2) data collection that supports the provision of hospital-specific reports on quality of documentation and adherence to multiple guidelines (spanning recording of key clinical signs, appropriate use of basic diagnostic tests and assessment and treatment of malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea &amp; dehydration, meningitis, and severe acute malnutrition), and (3) peer to peer networking through twice yearly meetings and a simple WhatsApp group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Hospital reports are sent as printed documents and by email to the pediatrician, the lead pediatric nurse and the medical superintendent in each hospital; the pediatrician is expected to provide feedback to frontline pediatric care providers on their hospitalâs performance. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The trial, conducted in a resource-constrained healthcare setting, showed that the overall adoption of the new policy after initial training, guideline dissemination, and in the context of the network activities and feedback approaches we have described was moderate at approximately 40%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Failure to use recorded signs to direct treatment (misclassification) rather than inappropriate treatment once correctly classified accounted for most cases of incorrect performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Initial training and dissemination of guidelines appeared to result in modest (and variable) adoption of the new policy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, there was declining performance in hospitals receiving standard feedback (from a higher baseline) and increasing performance with enhanced feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the possibility that clinicians in the standard feedback arm slowly revert to prior behavior [39], whereas we speculate that enhanced feedback aimed particularly at the clinical team leader sustained and promoted guideline adoption among junior team members possibly through better reinforcement practices. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The decline in performance in the control arm may also be linked to staff rotations that occur frequently in Kenyan hospitals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Frontline staff who admit patients to district hospitals are typically intern clinicians in their first year of experiential training in countries like Kenya. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Such staff typically rotate every 3âmonths and two such rotations occurred during this trial across both trial arms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The decline in performance in standard feedback hospitals may therefore have resulted in care increasingly being provided by clinicians who had not had specific training on the guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Efforts were made to make sure these new clinicians had copies of guideline booklets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In the enhanced feedback hospitals, we suggest the pediatricians leading practice made a greater effort to support guideline adoption providing some insulation against staff turnover; although, we were unable to collect data on the actual practices of pediatric team leaders in intervention and control hospitals that might support this proposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>However, this suggestion is consistent with previous work in similar settings in which we observed that new practices became slowly embedded in hospital routines with long-term feedback despite considerable staff turnover [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The enhanced feedback intervention may have achieved more sustained adoption of the policy compared to standard feedback, but our findings suggest that there is still considerable scope for improving policy adoption requiring additional interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>For example, neither the enhanced nor the standard feedback arm achieved the target performance of 80% compliance with correct classification and treatment for pneumonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The failure to attain this goal could be explained by the level of goal difficulty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Greater success was achieved with classification of pneumonia severity using simple clinical signs, but performance declined when we examined the composite outcome with an additional requirement of prescribing appropriate treatment for the assigned pneumonia classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overall performance for correct classification in the trial ranged between 64% and 74% in the trial arms, but up to 32% of children in the control sites did not receive oral amoxicillin despite having been correctly classified (indrawing) pneumonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>There remains a need to investigate why clinicians have trouble adhering to treatment guidelines once they have correctly classified a child. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation is a lack of belief among clinicians in oral treatment or monotherapy hence the tendency to assign a more severe pneumonia classification to warrant use of injectable or broader spectrum antibiotics [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>A useful additional finding from our study was that treatment failure among children given oral amoxicillin was similar to that of children who were started on injectable penicillin, a finding supporting the results of previous randomized trials [9, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Demonstrating that almost nine out of ten children quickly improve on oral treatment may help provide some assurance to clinicians that oral treatment for (indrawing) pneumonia confers no more risk than injectable treatment, knowledge that may facilitate wider policy adoption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>However, non-trivial mortality in this group of children in hospital does suggest the need for additional research factors that would help clinicians assess risk and additional on interventions to improve outcomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The optimal duration of time for providing feedback interventions to promote policy adoption is unclear [21], and it is possible that greater improvements would have occurred if the intervention was implemented for a longer period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>This is suggested by the apparent benefits of enhanced feedback seen in the final months of the intervention period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>There is a need for studies to determine how long it would take to embed new policies in practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Future feedback intervention designs could also target individual clinicians as an additional approach to promote policy uptake especially during health provider rotations that occurred frequently in our trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>This could be done using phone text messaging which had been implemented successfully in previous randomized trials [41]; although, logistically, such interventions would be much harder to sustain at scale. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>At present there is still limited work on how to implement new national policies at scale in LMIC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The failure to monitor implementation means much research evidence is not effectively translating to health benefits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We have shown that modest investments in information systems may support improvements [16, 23, 25, 29], and could support audit and feedback interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Investments in information systems within the field of adult and pediatric HIV care have shown that it is feasible to use such systems to improve antiretroviral therapy guideline adherence at scale under routine care conditions in LMICs [42, 43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>We argue that greater attention needs to be paid to improving information systems not just aimed at centralized national reporting but to enable monitoring and develop feedback interventions that promote adoption of effective interventions as part of wider efforts to reduce newborn and child mortality [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec20"><title><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Strengths </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The cluster RCT design and methodologic rigor applied in the evaluation are a strength. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Although we could randomize only 12 hospitals, we performed restricted randomization to minimize baseline imbalance in characteristics between trial arms (a major challenge in cluster trials). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>We also used random intercept multilevel models to account for any residual imbalances in performance at baseline therefore improving our ability to attribute any effects to intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is among the first studies conducted in low- and middle-income African countries to examine different approaches to providing feedback at hospital level while exploring characteristics of feedback that can optimize effectiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Our study was based on a theory-driven intervention that responded to current priority research areas within this field [17] and was conducted within a network with good quality data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>There are several limitations of the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>First, neither the trial investigators nor the participants were blinded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However, the clerks who were responsible for data collection were unaware of the hospital allocation to intervention reducing the potential of differential documentation of physical examination findings, pneumonia severity classification, and treatment during data abstraction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Separately, contamination of intervention could have occurred through peer to peer interactions during the single face-to-face network meeting held while this trial was in progress and possibly through discussions on a social media platform (WhatsApp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>We did not determine the extent of contamination but the decline of performance in the control arm suggests that this potential contamination was minimal and did not strongly influence the intervention effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Separately, we did not study a random sample of hospitals and the findings in this study are most directly generalizable to county hospitals that provide primary referral inpatient care and that are also in receipt of some form of routine performance feedback (a situation that is rare in LMIC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Despite this limitation, we believe these findings are relevant to LMIC hospitals particularly as electronic medical records (EMR) are rapidly being introduced in many countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Our findings further suggest that the rollout of EMRs should be accompanied by careful planning to incorporate appropriate data collection and enable further testing of audit and feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A further limitation of this trial is that due to reliance on information obtained from medical records at discharge, it is difficult to determine whether the intervention improved the actual care received, documented practice, or both. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par43"><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that enhanced feedback as opposed to standard feedback delivered as components of a multifaceted network intervention did not result in improvements in the overall proportion of children managed in accordance with the new guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>However, providing enhanced feedback was associated with improving compliance over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Findings suggest specific components of feedback including its frequency, links between goal setting and targeted action plans, and reinforcement by a senior professional may promote slow adoption of policy recommendations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Overall, policy makers, researchers, and implementers should pay more attention to utilizing and testing evidence-based strategies including audit and enhanced feedback to achieve policy adoption in low and middle income countries if the benefits of research investments and new interventions are to be realized. </plain></SENT>
