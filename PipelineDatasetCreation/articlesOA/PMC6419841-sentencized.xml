</text></title><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle modification of nutrition and physical activity are often recommended to help manage overweight and obesity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite increased knowledge of beneficial lifestyle strategies for weight management, rates of overweight and obesity continue to climb among adults in Canada and the United States [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The Group Lifestyle Balance™ (GLB™) program is one of the most successful lifestyle-based weight management programs and is currently offered in over 80 primary care settings in the United States and is now becoming increasingly prevalent in Canada [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The GLB™ program was originally intended only for individuals with prediabetes and was formerly referred to as The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In patients with prediabetes, the DPP lifestyle intervention reduced the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes by 58%, while the biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, Metformin, reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 31% when compared to a placebo pill [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Given the documented success of the DPP, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care encouraged program expansion through broader eligibility criteria [6], and as such some clinics are now offering this program for general weight management (regardless of receiving a prediabetes diagnosis), since overweight and obesity are considered risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although the GLB™ program has proven to be successful [5, 8, 9], a “one-size fits all” approach to weight management has been critiqued by experts, who argue that this generalized approach yields minimal weight loss outcomes that do not satisfy the wants and needs of clinicians, researchers and patients alike [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing is an innovative tool, which has the potential to facilitate positive lifestyle changes and enhance patient outcomes, though this has been widely debated in the literature in recent years [11–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A systematic review found that actionable lifestyle recommendations (e.g., “reduce your consumption of sodium”) facilitated behaviour change greater than the provision of simple genetic-based disease-risk estimates, and that nutrition was the most promising lifestyle habit that could be motivated by lifestyle genomics testing [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A few studies have assessed change in weight from the provision of genetic-based information compared to a standard intervention [15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Two studies reported that genetic testing was superior to a standard intervention for changes in weight or BMI [15, 17], and one study showed that adherence to a genetic-based diet was correlated with greater weight loss, whereas adherence to a standard diet was not [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There have been considerable scientific advancements in knowledge pertaining to nutrition and physical activity recommendations, which can be personalized based on an individual’s genetic variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Nutrigenomics is a science that explores the interaction between nutrition, genetics, and health outcomes [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The science exploring how nutrition and physical activity, alongside other lifestyle components, can impact health outcomes can be referred to as lifestyle genomics [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the genes FTO, MC4R, TCF7L2, UCP1, APOA2, and PPARg2 can impact physical activity and dietary approaches to weight management and/or nutritional habits [19–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SNPs located within the genes ACTN3, NFIA-AS2, ADRB3, NRF2 and GSTP1 have been shown to impact genetic predisposition to excel in either endurance or strength-based activities [28–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These genetic variants were used in the genetic test provided in the present study as they are currently offered through commercial genetic testing [33], thus optimizing the pragmatic nature of this trial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>While genetics certainly plays a role in obesity, there are multiple factors contributing to the current obesity epidemic, including diminished energy expenditure, increased energy intake, rising food costs, the built environment, socioeconomic status, and other social determinants of health [34–39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Several of these factors can be modified such as energy intake and energy expenditure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) posits that attitudes towards a behaviour, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and actual behavioural control can be used to predict intentions and behaviours [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although the TPB is one of the most widely-accepted behaviour change theories, it has yet to be incorporated into genetic testing behaviour change research [11, 41] despite a recent call to incorporate this theory into personalized healthcare behaviour change research [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>By considering this theory, we can account for many contributors impacting behaviour change and therefore account for several confounding factors, which could influence study results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The present randomized controlled trial is the first study to intentionally incorporate the TPB into genetic testing behaviour change research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The proposed extended CONSORT checklist for reporting pragmatic trials [42] was used to guide the development of the current manuscript. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four participants (n = 37 per group) are needed in this study to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 4% in body fat percentage, assuming 80% power, an alpha of 5%, and a standard deviation of 6.1% [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We aimed to recruit 88 participants (n = 44 per group) to account for the potential dropout rate of 20%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>While minimal research exists outlining a clinically meaningful change in body fat percentage, a 5% change in weight (which would come from fat mass, water weight and/or muscle mass) is often reported to be clinically meaningful [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, clinical experience from the registered dietitians involved in this study helped to determine the clinically meaningful 4% difference mentioned above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This difference has also been supported in published reference standards of body fat percentage in Caucasian adults which indicate that a 4% change in body fat percentage is associated with a 1 – 2 decile change on the reference standards charts [45]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>A cohort randomization model was used rather than subject randomization to allow all participants in a given GLB™ group to obtain the same intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>At the time of randomization, 12 cohorts (GLB™ groups) were randomized 1:1 to either the personalized lifestyle intervention (PLI) based on genetics, or the standard lifestyle intervention (SLI) based on population-based guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>It was anticipated that 12 groups of approximately 7 participants each would be needed to obtain the desired sample size of 88 participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Prior to obtaining informed consent from participants, randomly permuted blocks were generated using the original generator on an internet-based randomization program [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Since participant recruitment was quicker than anticipated and there was an even 1:1 split of a PLI and a SLI group in the last two randomized groups, only 10 of the randomized groups (5 PLI groups, 5 SLI groups) were used, resulting in a total of N = 140 participants in the study (mean number of study participants per group ± SD = 14.0 ± 4.1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Participants were recruited from the GLB™ program at the East Elgin Family Health Team (EEFHT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>There were two primary methods of recruitment into this program: [1] adults from Elgin and Middlesex Counties in Ontario, Canada were referred to the GLB™ program by healthcare professionals in the area such as registered dietitians (RDs), physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physical therapists; and [2] adults joined the program through word-of-mouth referrals from members of the community. </plain></SENT>
