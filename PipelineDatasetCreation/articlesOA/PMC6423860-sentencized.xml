</text></title><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Sanitation has been found to be protective against diarrheal disease, active trachoma, schistosomiasis, some soil-transmitted helminth infections and stunting [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Despite these health benefits, an estimated 12% of the world’s population (892 million people) practices open defecation [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Current estimates, however, do not include households that own toilets but do not use them, suggesting that the actual number of people defecating in the open is underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>A systematic review by Garn et al. [3] found that increases in sanitaiton coverage did not equate to use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>With a post hoc regression analysis, the authors found latrine use only increased 5.8% for every 10% increase in latrine coverage [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In India, the 2011 national census found that 49.8% of the population defecated in the open, to which the government excelerated focus on sanitation by responding with a series of sanitation campaigns intended to increase sanitation coverage [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The current version of the national sanitation program, known as Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), was initiated under Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 2, 2014 with the goal of making India defecation free by October 2, 2019 [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>As of December 3, 2018, the SBM claims to have constructed 89,369,285 latrines amounting to approximately 97% coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As of March 7, 2019, the SBM claims to have constructed 92,358,614 latrines amounting to approximately 98.9% coverage [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, use of household latrines has been a consistent challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In research across five Indian states with 3235 households and 22,787 respondents, Coffey et al. [8] found that over 40% of households with working latrines had at least one family member still practicing open defecation [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>They also found that people were more likely to use privately built latrines than those built with government funds, regardless of their wealth [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study found only 44% of rural inhabitants from these states to be defecting in the open compared to 70% in 2014; however 23% of latrine owners still practice open defecation in 2018, which is unchanged from 2014 [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In an assessment of latrines constructed in villages in Odisha under the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), a campaign that preceeded the SBM, Barnard et al. [8, 10] found that 39% of latrines were not in use by any household member. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The lack of sanitaiton use has been cited as a potential explanation as to why large-scale community level sanitation interventions have failed to lead to health benefits [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These results have led to a call to invest in the development and assessment of interventions that specifically promote and evaluate defecation behaviours above and beyond accelerating access alone [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There is a compelling need to identify strategies that increase and sustain the practice of latrine use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, research in India also suggests that such strategies must address multiple factors associated with continued open defecation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Studies have identified a variety of factors related to why members of rural Indian households elect to defecate outside rather than use a latrine: incomplete or poor quality latrines, lack of water access in latrines, concern for latrine pits filling too quickly, large family size, sex and age of user, livelihood type, remoteness, ability to socialize and roam when going for open defecation, general preference for open defecation, and a lack of habit for latrine use [9, 14–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This broad range of conditions illustrates the complexity of the challenge of ending open defecation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>There is also a need to increase the practice of safe disposal of child feces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Households that have access to improved sanitation often do not always dispose of their children’s feces into the latrine [19–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Instead, child feces are disposed of in the household’s solid waste pile or other open location, enabling potential exposure to harmful fecal pathogens and increasing likelihood of negative health impacts [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The latest Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS) found that the faeces of only 35% of children under age five ended up in a latrine (22% from the child defecating directly into a latrine, and 13% from subsequent disposal into a latrine) [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Evaluations of Indian sanitation campaigns have found limited impacts on child faeces disposal practices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In an assessment in Odisha, India of villages covered by the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), which aimed to reduce open defecation primarily through latrine construction, safe disposal of child faeces increased from 1.1% at baseline to 10.4% in intervention households compared to 3.1% in control households (RR: 3.34; 95% CI: 1.99–5.59) [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>While some improvements in child faeces disposal were achieved, the majority of faeces still ended up in the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It’s important to note that the TSC intervention included sparse behaviour change messaging to increase latrine use, including use by children, or for safe disposal of child faeces. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As part of a larger program of research improving latrine use in India [27], we sought to develop and assess the effectiveness of a low-cost behavior change intervention that could be deployed at scale to improve latrine use and the safe disposal of child feces in Odisha. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The intervention is based on formative research and behavioral theory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the design of a two arm (parallel group design), cluster randomized controlled trial (CRT) to evaluate this intervention. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="?"><plain>Our primary research question is: Is the intervention effective in improving latrine use and safe disposal of child feces among households in rural communities in Odisha that received latrines under the SBM or prior sanitation campaigns? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="51" pm="?"><plain>We also sought to address the following secondary research questions: (i) Does the intervention compel households that do not own latrines to construct a latrine?; (ii) Does the intervention influence the identified determinants of behaviour? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="?"><plain>Specifically, are behavioral determinant scores (i.e. scores for social norms, abilities, physical opportunity, risk perception, motivation, and self-regulation) higher at endline among latrine owners in intervention villages compared to latrine owners in control villages?; and (iii) Are behavioral determinant scores (i.e. scores for social norms, abilities, physical opportunity, risk perception, motivation, and self-regulation) associated with latrine use? </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>According to the 2015–2016 Indian NFHS, 37% of rural households in Puri district have an improved sanitation facility – the same percentage of those living in rural areas at the national level albeit somewhat higher than the overall state level (23% in Odisha). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Puri was previously the site of a cluster-randomized trial that sought to understand the impact of the Indian Government’s TSC on various indicators of child health, including diarrhea, stunting, and parisitic infection [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The study found no impacts on health and low rates of latrine coverage and use were posited as potential reasons [11]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>To be eligible for inclusion in the study, we sought villages that had not been declared open defecation free by the Government of India, had 50–150 households, and minimum 60% latrine coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>These criteria reflect both the study needs (coverage and household size influence sample size estimates) and the limits of our funding (larger villages would require more inputs and thus more costs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Because latrine construction remains ongoing across the district as a result of the SBM, no accurate and up-to-date sampling frames existed with the information needed for village selection, namely village size and latrine coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To identify potentially eligible villages, we met with village leaders in the identified blocks to create a preliminary sampling frame of villages that could be of the appropriate size and coverage if confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We then visited the potentially elible villages to conduct a census of all households and record whether each owned a latrine to determine coverage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>As it was difficult to find villages that satisfied our a priori eligibility criteria of 50–150 households and minimum 60% latrine coverage, we allowed villages outside the size range and below the minimum coverage provided that we maintained adequate statistical power. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>As per guidance from the study funder, the International Initaitive for Impact Evaluation (3ie), the the intervention should aim to increase latrine use among latrine owning households at a cost of no more than 20USD per household on average. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>A local NGO, Rural Welfare Institute (RWI), delivered the intervention package, called Sundara Grama or beautiful village. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Participants were also asked to identify ‘positive deviant’ households, households where all the members always used their latrine for defecation for latter intervention activities.Positive deviant household recognition: Households identified as positive deviants were provided a banner to display in front of their house to publically recognize and praise their contribution to achieving a ‘clean, healthy, and beautiful village.’Village wall painting: For the final village level activity, artisans painted a mural that shows a map of all of the households in the village and distinctly identified the positive deviant households. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Then, starting with the respondent, the following is asked for every household member noted in the household roster: “The last time [NAME] defecated, did [NAME] defecate in the open or use the latrine?” Response options include: Open, Latrine, Somewhere else (i.e. potty, nappy, bedpan). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>If the household member is present and able, the member provides a response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>If not, the survey respondent answers on their behalf. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>We acknowledge that self-report is not ideal and reporting bias is plausible, but we are asking for ‘last defecation event’ over ‘usual’ behavior, which has been demonstrated to be more robust [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The simulation parameters were derived from data on latrine use collected from 2011 to 2013 during a large-scale sanitation trial in Odisha [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Based on those data, we assumed a baseline prevalence of latrine use of 45%, a village-level ICC of 0.10, and a within-person correlation from baseline to follow-up of 0.60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Estimates of household latrine coverage and village size were generated from a rapid assessment of villages in the study area conducted in 2017. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>No previous trials have investigated the effect of interventions specifically aimed at increasing latrine use to inform sample size estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>We selected a 10% increase in absolute prevalence of use (from 47 to 57%) as a reasonable minimum intervention effect assuming that the intervention will have a greater effect than increases in coverages have demonstrated (see Garn 2017 who found an increase 5.8% for every 10% increase in latrine coverage in post hoc regression analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Assuming an average of 292 eligible participants per village (cluster size coefficient of variation = 0.35), 10% loss to follow-up, 80% power, and 0.05 significance level, we calculated a required sample size of 33 villages per arm. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par67"><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the impact of a multi-level intervention that aims to increase latrine use by all, including safe disposal of child feces, in households that own latrines in rural Odisha, India. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This is one of four studies being rolled out concurrently to evaluate interventions designed to increase latrine use in rural India at an average cost of 20USD per household, and the only of that group to include a specific intervention component for safe child feces disposal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Odisha has the second lowest rate of latrine coverage in India despite SBM efforts [7], representing a critical sanitation challenge. </plain></SENT>
