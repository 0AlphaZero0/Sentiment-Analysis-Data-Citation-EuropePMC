</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Acid β-glucosidase (GCase), encoded by GBA1, is the lysosomal hydrolase that hydrolyzes glucosylceramide (GC) and glucosylsphingosine (GS) to ceramide and sphingosine, respectively1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disruptive GBA1 mutations are causal to Gaucher disease by leading to insufficient GCase function and resultant GC and GS accumulation1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three types of Gaucher disease are clinically defined, based on age at disease onset and organ involvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Type 1 is the non-neuronopathic variant with highly variable visceral disease2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Type 1 patients also have an increased life-time risk of developing Parkinson disease variants indicating that mutations in GBA1 are genetic risk factors3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Types 2 and 3 have early onset of primary, but variable, central nervous system (CNS) degeneration and are distinguished phenotypically by the rapidity of CNS disease progression in type 2 during the first year of life4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Several hundred GBA1 mutations have been identified in affected patients2,5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Genotype/phenotype correlations show that the presence of homozygosity or heteroallelism of N370S predicts absence of early onset progressive CNS disease, and L444P homozygosity predisposes to variable primary CNS disease6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the relationships of other GBA1 mutations and disease phenotypes are poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In humans, the presence of the N370S allele in Gaucher disease patients is associated with type 1 and highly variable visceral involvement2,7,8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The D409H alleles have significant frequency and homozygotes (designated here as 9H) manifest early onset of variable visceral and the CNS involvement9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>9H patients also uniquely manifest calcific aortic root and valvular disease10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The V394L allele in humans has been reported only in the heteroallele state and is associated with type 1 or types 2 and 3 depending on the heteroallele11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In mice, Gba1 mutations have been created to mimic those found in human patients12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In comparison to humans, N370S homozygosity (designated here as 0S) in mice leads to death within 24 hours due to a defect in the skin permeability barrier12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This is likely due to the lesser hydrolytic efficiency of the N370S enzyme toward the longer chain fatty acid acyl moieties on GC in murine skin vs. human13–15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Mice homozygous for V394L (designated here as 4L) and 9H have defective GCase activity and survive up to 2 years with relatively mild visceral abnormalities12,16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The mild phenotype in such murine models limits our understanding of in vivo effect of the GBA1/Gba1 mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Human GCase protein structures have been solved by X-ray crystallography and only one mutant GCase structure, N370S, has been characterized by X-ray and biochemical analyses13,17,18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The approach of studying protein - structure-function relationship has relied on structural modeling and dynamic simulation based on the crystal structure information19,20. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Specific Saposin C deficient mice (C−/−, designated here as C*) were generated by a knock-in point mutation within the Saposin C domain of the Prosaposin locus (Psap), preserving Saposin A, B, and D, but leading to undetectable Saposin C protein and reductions of GCase activity and protein, and a slowly progressive CNS phenotype developing after 8–12 months26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Mice with Saposin C deficiency (C*) and homozygosity for 4L (combined model designated 4L;C*) have greater reductions in 4L GCase levels and develop a severe CNS disease phenotype compared to C* mice26,27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To study the pathogenic effect of Gba1 mutations and gain insights into the in vivo effects of GCase and Saposin C, additional Gba1 mutant mouse models (0S, 9H, and 9V) combined with C* (designated as “Gba1 mutation”;C*,. e.g, 0S;C*) were created and analyzed for biochemical, histopathologic, and phenotypic abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Compared to the models of 4L or 9H homozygotes combined with a hypomorphic prosaposin transgene that expresses subnormal levels of mouse prosaposin and four saposins22, these models allow the study of Saposin C’s specific effects with GCase mutants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The D409V contains a non-polar amino acid, valine, which lost all WT interactions with surrounding amino acid side chains (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>GS is deacyl form of glucosylceramide resulting from acid ceramidase hydrolysis50,51. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Degradation of GC requires three components, GCase, Saposin C and phospholipids52,53. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>It is evident that there is mutation-specific quantitative differences in GC species and GS accumulations that influences tissue/regional expression of Gaucher disease phenotypes in these mouse models16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>4L;C* mice had major GC18:0 degradation defects in the brain, whereas the analogous mice with 9H;C* led to all GC species accumulating massively in visceral tissues16. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>With the available ceramide standards, the detectable longest fatty acid chain length ceramide was C18:1/24:0, which may omit long chain and complex ceramide that contribute to major portion of ceramides in epidermis59. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Valvular disease found in human patients10 was not observed grossly in 9H12 or 9H/C* mice which presents a limitation for studying valvular disease using these models. </plain></SENT>
