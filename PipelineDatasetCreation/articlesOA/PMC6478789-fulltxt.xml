In recent years, the essential role of epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation has emerged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Apart from changes in DNA methylation, covalent post translational modifications (PTMs) of histones and other nuclear proteins define a complex language, the epigenetic code, which regulates chromatin structure and dynamics. Lysine acetylation (Kac) is a major epigenetic PTM occurring on histone proteins, which has been studied broadly. Kac has generally been associated with activation of transcription through opening of chromatin structure, although some recent studies have found some Kac marks to be responsible for the compaction of chromatin, protein stability, and the regulation of protein-protein interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Disruption of histone acetylation patterns has been linked to the development of disease, which may occur through mutations that deregulate enzymes responsible for adding or removing these histone acetyl marks, as well as the protein interaction modules that recognize and interpret this important PTM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Histone acetylation is a highly dynamic process that is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that respectively write and erase acetylation marks. The complex pattern of acetylation marks is interpreted (read) by reader domains of the bromodomain (BRD) family of proteins. BRD-containing proteins are evolutionarily conserved and of substantial biological interest, as components of transcription factor and chromatin-modifying complexes and determinants of epigenetic memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. There are 61 BRDs expressed in the human proteome, present in 46 diverse proteins. However, some atypical bromodomains, which lack essential residues, have little or no&#x000a0;activity towards Kac-containing histone sequences and may recognize other epigenetic marks or unmodified peptide sequences, while canonical BRDs may also bind to complex patterns of modification around a central Kac site that often contain other PTMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The modular nature of many BRD-containing proteins, which typically harbor a number of diverse reader domains in addition to enzymatic functionalities and role(s) as scaffolds in large chromatin-modifying complexes, makes their functional study a challenging task. However, the development of highly selective inhibitors has provided versatile tools for functional studies on endogenous BRD-containing proteins, which can now be used to unravel the role of the epigenetic Kac-dependent reading process in chromatin biology as well as in the development of disease. This is exemplified by the development of highly potent inhibitors for BET (Bromo and extra-terminal; BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRDT) BRDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which has led to numerous translational and functional studies on this subfamily of bromodomain proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Chemical probes, small-molecule tool inhibitors with selectivity against similar proteins, have led to the validation of many disease targets, making seminal contributions to our understanding of complex cellular processes. However, chemical probes need to be highly selective, cell active, and therefore need to be comprehensively characterized in order to link observed phenotypic responses to targeted proteins. Unfortunately, selectivity and potency of tool compounds are often insufficient resulting in contradictory and erroneous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Following the disclosure of potent BET BRD inhibitors (BRDi), other members of the BRD family of interaction modules have been found to be highly druggable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, resulting in the identification of chemical fragments that were subsequently developed into potent and selective chemical probes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, BRDs outside the BET family have not been found to be major regulators of primary transcription control, posing challenges for the discovery of functional roles of these conserved domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As a result, only a few studies have reported phenotypic consequences of inhibiting non-BET BRDs pointing to important roles in cellular differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we characterize a comprehensive set of BRD chemical probes covering all subfamilies previously identified with good druggability scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Using a standardized commercial assay format (BROMO<italic>scan</italic>), based on a high-throughput binding assay originally developed to assess the selectivity of kinase inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, we evaluate the selectivity of this BRD chemical probe-set and determine a total of 626 <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values on all detected interactions. We present here an overview of the binding modes of these inhibitors, resulting in the excellent selectivity of these chemical probes. To exemplify the use of this probe-set in biological systems, we further screen the collection on a cellular model of muscle differentiation identifying BET BRDs as major regulators in this context. Furthermore, systematic investigations of BRD inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines have revealed an essential role for BRD inhibitors to target the metabolic vulnerability of TNBC, demonstrating their utility as a collection to uncover a previously unknown crosstalk between BRD components of the HBO1 HAT complex and cell metabolism. Together, our study provides a comprehensive structural and functional insight on BRD inhibitors, establishing a powerful resource for future mechanistic studies of this family of epigenetic reader domains, and underscoring the broad utility and immediate therapeutic potential of direct-acting inhibitors of human bromodomain proteins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>A set of highly selective bromodomain chemical&#x000a0;probes</title><p id="Par8">Chemical biology efforts of the past few years have led to the development of potent chemical probes for most BRD families&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The promyelocytic leukemia-SP100 nuclear bodies (family V), which harbor a PHD-BRD tandem reader cassette are a notable exception and some families are still insufficiently covered, including members of families VI and VII, which also have atypical and shallow Kac-binding pockets. In contrast, family I that contains the HATs PCAF and GCN5, as well as CECR2 and FALZ, is well covered by chemical probes. The dual PCAF/GCN5 chemical probe L-Moses showed good potency for these two highly related bromodomains (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 126 and 600&#x02009;nM, respectively, determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. GSK4027 offers an alternative chemotype to antagonize the BRDs in these two targets with improved potency (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> 1.4&#x02009;nM determined by BROMO<italic>scan</italic> for both BRDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Early lead molecules for bromodomains of CECR2 and FALZ were discovered by screening a series of triazolophthalazines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, compounds of this series inhibited several BRD family members and exhibited poor solubility, limiting further development. NVS-CECR2-1 was the first potent chemical probe targeting CECR2 with good potency (80&#x02009;nM, determined by ITC) and selectivity. An alternative probe molecule, GNE-886, has recently been published showing, however, some activity towards the BRDs of BRD9, BRD7, and TAF1/TAF1L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Chemical probes of the human bromodomain family.

This is an area that has rapidly evolved and has been previously reviewed in detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The first published Kac-competitive BRD inhibitors, which now have been widely used are the thienodiazepine (+)-JQ1 (henceforth, JQ1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> the related clinical compound OTX015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, as well as the benzodiazepine iBET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Inhibitors of this family show panBET activity primarily against the first BRD with slightly lower binding affinity towards the second BRD in BET proteins. More recently, antagonists featuring diverse Kac mimetics have been developed, including the isoxazole I-BET151 (GSK1210151A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and the tetrahydroquinazoline PFI-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

The first inhibitor developed for CBP/p300, SGC-CBP30, exhibited potent activity for BRDs in these two HATs (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>: 21 and 38&#x02009;nM, respectively), retaining however significant BET affinity, which needs to be taken into account in cellular assays by using appropriate concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. An alternative chemical probe is the benzoxazepine I-CBP112<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

The ATAD2 and ATAD2B BRDs have been targeted using the potent and selective antagonist GSK8814<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, while the allosteric BRD antagonist BAY-850 was developed as a specific probe against ATAD2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. BRPF BRD antagonists are well represented by the pan-BRPF chemical probes OF-1 and NI-57, and the two related BRPF1B-selective chemical probes PFI-4 and GSK6853<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In addition, BAY-299, a dual activity chemical probe for BRPF2 and TAF1(2), has also been developed providing the only currently available chemical tool for family VII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Similarly, compound 34, a dual activity antagonist of BRPF1B/2 and TRIM24&#x000a0;represents the only chemical tool currently developed for TRIM24<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Family VI is divided into the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase of the TRIM (tripartite motif-containing protein) family and BAZ2 (bromodomain adjacent to zinc-finger domain), which are components of chromatin remodeling complexes.

The BRD family contains 61 domains, many of them sharing significant sequence homology in the acetyl-lysine-binding domain and a common structural mechanism of Kac recognition. In particular, even partial inhibition of BET bromodomains by less selective BRD inhibitors has been linked to many phenotypic responses, thereby confounding attribution of the phenotype to a specific BRD protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. The selectivity of chemical probes targeting diverse BRDs has been previously evaluated against a comprehensive set of recombinant human BRDs employing a temperature shift assay. This assay format makes use of the increase in the melting temperature (&#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of a protein domain when complexed with a potent ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, intrinsic stability and other properties of proteins influence the magnitude of the observed temperature shift. Using bromosporine (BSP), a promiscuous BRD inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, we evaluated selectivity screens against a panel of BRDs employing the BROMO<italic>scan</italic> ligand-binding assay, as well as ITC and thermal melt assays (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). BROMO<italic>scan</italic> is a binding assay based on the well-known KINOME<italic>scan</italic> technology. This assay measures the binding of a DNA-tagged bromodomain to an immobilized BRD ligand. If an inhibitor is present, it will compete with the bromodomain binding to the immobilized ligand, resulting in reduction of a quantitative PCR (qPCR) signal in a dose-dependent manner. We used ITC as a standard for the accurate determination of binding constants, given its capacity to directly measure ligand binding in solution. All three assays resulted in comparable data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and we used this assay platform to determine affinities across 15 inhibitors of the probe-set (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). While correlation between ITC and BROMO<italic>scan</italic> data was excellent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), some BRDs exhibited smaller than expected &#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> values based on their binding constants determined by ITC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). In particular, BSP showed only modest &#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> against TAF1L(2) and BRD9 and a relatively large &#x00394;<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> against CBP, compared to the directly determined ITC dissociating constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s). Encouraged by the accuracy of the BROMO<italic>scan</italic> assay, we screened 15 chemical BRD probes against 42 diverse bromodomains and determined a total of 626 dose&#x02013;response curves (Supplementary data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition to the BRD probe-set, we included three closely related variants of chemical probes within our set, CBP30-298 and CBP30-383, which are closely related to SGC-CBP30, as well as PFI-3 D1, a close derivative of PFI-3 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. However, while CBP30-related BET off-target effects were also apparent in the two additional CBP30 derivatives, the exclusive selectivity of PFI-3 towards SMARCA2/4 and PB1 was maintained in the derivative PFI-3 D1. Interestingly, the Kac mimetic salicylic acid head group of PFI-3 and its derivatives showed selectivity for this bromodomain subfamily. This striking observation has been rationalized by the unique binding mode of family VIII inhibitors that penetrated deeper into the Kac-binding site, leading to displacement of water molecules that are maintained in other BRD inhibitor complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In summary, BROMO<italic>scan</italic> offers a robust platform for accurate <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> determination of BRD inhibitors, and chemical probes screened here maintained at least a 30-fold selectivity window against BRDs in other families. In order to address selectivity outside the bromodomain family, we screened the chemical probes against 26 protein kinases, a target class that has been reported to be potently inhibited by some BRD inhibitors&#x000a0;(Supplementary Table 2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In addition, the probe-set was also screened against other epigenetic modulators such as lysine and arginine methyl transferases, HATs, and methyl lysine reader domains (Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). However, no significant activity of this probe-set was observed on any of these potential off-targets suggesting that this probe-set is selective toward&#x000a0;bromodomains.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Selectivity of bromodomain chemical probes and assay comparison. <bold>a</bold> Structure of bromosporine (BSP). <bold>b</bold> Structural/phylogenetic dendrograms quantifying binding affinities of BSP to human BRDs measured by BROMO<italic>scan</italic> (left), ITC (middle) and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> assays (right).

Here we exemplify how the BRD probe-set can be used in a cellular system that has already been explored using the now well-studied BET inhibitors. Several BRD-containing proteins are known to be essential for different types of cellular differentiation, including myogenesis that we chose as a model system here<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. During myogenesis, differentiating myoblasts fuse to form multinucleated myotubes/myofibers, a process that plays an important role in development and regeneration, and BET proteins have recently been implicated in this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Given the importance of muscle regeneration in human health, we were interested in determining whether BRD inhibition would modulate the ability of muscle progenitor cells to undergo terminal differentiation. To explore this, the muscle progenitor C2C12 cell line was cultured in conditions of low serum to initiate differentiation in the presence of diverse BRD inhibitors from the chemical probe-set described here. Strong inhibitory effects of myoblast differentiation were seen for the BET inhibitor JQ1 as well as the pan-BRD inhibitor BSP, but not for other BRD inhibitors (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref>). To gain insight into the transcriptional effects resulting from BRD inhibition, we performed gene-expression analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). In agreement with our observations on myoblast differentiation, treatment with JQ1 and BSP resulted in significant changes in gene-expression levels. Importantly, promiscuous targeting of BRD proteins using BSP resulted in almost identical changes in gene expression compared to JQ1, strongly suggesting that the inhibition of differentiation is due to BET BRDs and, among the targets tested, is not due to inhibition of other BRD-containing proteins. In agreement with this observation, expression changes resulting from targeting of other specific BRD inhibitors outside the BET family were negligible (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Most significantly, differential expression analysis identified several anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory genes down-regulated including proteins modulating interferon response, such as IFIT3 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3), interferon-induced GTP hydrolases (GBPs), and USP18 (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) resulted in strong signatures for anti-inflammatory pathways and cell cycle regulators, as well as myogenesis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis corroborated these observations identifying enriched biological processes (BPs) relating to cell cycle and mitosis, as well as immune system processing and innate immune response (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). In particular, transcription of genes regulating expression of myosin light and heavy chains, as well as regulators of myosin, such as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was strongly suppressed. Importantly, we observed strong down-regulation of the muscle-specific basic-helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factor myogenin (myogenic factor 4), a protein whose induction acts as a point-of-no-return in myogenesis by inducing cell cycle exit and activation of muscle-specific genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. These observations suggest therefore that transient inhibition of BET bromodomain-containing proteins may be a means to delaying myoblasts from undergoing terminal differentiation. Interestingly, we did not observe transcriptional regulation of MYC and its target genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), a gene-expression response that is frequently used as a marker for BET inhibition in cancer highlighting the context-dependent effect of BET inhibitors in different tissue types.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Influence of bromodomain inhibition on C2C12 myoblast differentiation. <bold>a</bold> Fluorescent images of myotubes cultured in differentiation media (Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) containing 2% horse serum, 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;gml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> insulin, and 10&#x02009;&#x000b5;gml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> transferrin) in the presence or absence of bromodomain chemical probes.

We were therefore interested if bromodomain targets that are inhibited by the current BRD probe-set would act synergistically with inhibitors that target other key drivers of tumor growth in TNBC. Metabolism is an important modulator of tumor growth and it can directly impact cellular epigenetic landscapes and alter responses to chemotherapeutics. In particular, acetylation of histones relies on the availability of the universal acetyl donor metabolite acetyl-CoA, which is biosynthesized by breakdown of carbohydrates through the glycolytic pathway. Many TNBC cell lines display a classical Warburg metabolism with up-regulated glucose uptake to fuel their bioenergetics and biosynthetic demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. We confirmed that the set of 10 TNBC cell lines investigated in this study had a range of metabolically distinct states and variable global levels of histone acetylation (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a&#x02013;c</xref>). Furthermore, compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC cell lines have a higher glycolytic gene-expression signature, especially for glucose transporter I (GLUT1) expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), and thus tend to be more sensitive to glucose depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Accordingly, this led us to investigate whether disruption of glycolysis in TNBC cell lines can give rise to epigenetic vulnerabilities to BRD inhibitors.</p><p id="Par19">For this we chose the selective GLUT1 inhibitor BAY-876<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. We first confirmed that exposure to BAY-876 inhibits glucose uptake in TNBC cell&#x000a0;lines &#x000a0;and then assessed the impact of its treatment on metabolites related to glycolysis and relevant to histone acetylation&#x000a0;(Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3d). Acetyl-CoA is at the crossroads of glycolysis and TCA cycles and is the cofactor for HATs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Upon treatment with BAY-876, a decrease in absolute acetyl-CoA level was observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). Another essential player involved in metabolism and acetylation is the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, which is closely associated with energy status in cell and is thought to positively regulate the activity of sirtuins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. We observed an increase in the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio that may lead to increased sirtuin activity, possibly also contributing to histone hypoacetylation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). Having observed changes in metabolites linked to lysine acetylation in response to BAY-876, we next investigated whether there are corresponding changes in histone acetylation levels. Interestingly, we detected a reduction in the global levels of acetylated histone H3 (ac-H3), but not in the global levels of acetylated histone H4 (ac-H4), in response to BAY-876 treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>).

In order to deconvolute which BRD proteins are responsible for the observed phenotype with BAY-876, we compared the combinational effect on TNBC cell viability with another potent pan-BRPF inhibitor NI-57, and the selective BRPF1 inhibitor PFI-4. Co-treatment with BAY-876 and OF-1 led to the strongest reduction&#x000a0;of cell viability, whereas other combinations were less effective (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Although NI-57 has higher binding affinity toward BRPF family proteins in vitro compared to OF-1, its lower solubility and 3-fold lower predicted cell permeability might affect its cellular activity, potentially explaining why no synergy was observed with BAY-876 (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3g</xref>). Moreover, no significant effect was observed in the PFI-4 and JQ1 combination, which excludes the role of BRPF1 and potential contribution of BET off-target activity to the observed synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3h&#x02013;i</xref>). In agreement with these results, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of BRPF1 did not change the cell sensitivity to BAY-876 treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d&#x02013;f</xref>). Notably, compared to the single BRPF2 or BRPF3 knockdown, the cells with dual BRPF2/3 knockdown are more sensitive to BAY-876 treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the observed synergy effects are due to the inhibition of BRPF2 and/or BRPF3 by OF-1.</p><p id="Par23">BRPF2 and BRPF3 are components of the HBO1 (KAT7) acetyltransferase complex, while BRPF1 preferentially participates in the MOZ/MOF complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Furthermore, BRPF2/3/HBO1 complexes were also shown to be important and specific for the HAT activity toward H3K14, whereas the BRPF1 complexes have high specificity on H4 acetylation marks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. To explore whether inhibition of BRPF2 or/and BRPF3 has any effect on histone acetylation, we measured the H3K14ac level upon treatment with BRPF BRD chemical probes, or in BRPF-knockdown cell lines. Compared to NI-57 and PFI-4, the acetylation of H3K14 was significantly decreased in the presence of OF-1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3j</xref>). Likewise, dual BRPF2/3 knockdown displayed the strongest reduction of H3K14ac compared to BRPF2 or BRPF3 knockdown alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7h</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3k</xref>). Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which inhibition of glucose uptake by BAY-876 and antagonism of HBO1 subunits BRPF2/3 by OF-1 both converge on the same histone marks, leading to synergistic crosstalk between metabolic and epigenetic pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7i</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">Recent effort by our laboratories and others established a comprehensive set of epigenetic probe molecules for selective targeting of acetyl-lysine-dependent reader domains. We believe that this is a significant achievement considering that apart from a number of fragment-like small molecules, no BRD had been targeted before the first potent BET inhibitors were disclosed in 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In particular, BET inhibitors had a major impact on basic and translation research as demonstrated by the large number of research papers that have been published using these reagents and more than 20 clinical trials that are currently registered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, BRD inhibitors outside the BET family have not been validated as potential drug targets. Here we provide data showing that inhibition of BRPF BRDs in combination with selective inhibitors of glucose transport might be beneficial for the treatment of TNBCs. Earlier studies demonstrated also synergies of BRD inhibitors with other drugs, such as CBP/p300 inhibitors acting synergistically with BET inhibitors as well as cytotoxic agents and dexamethasone in leukemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In addition, BET inhibitors showed synergy in cancer models in combination with HDAC inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. The combination of different inhibitors might also be important in overcoming drug resistance, which has been observed in cells treated with BET inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. The reported surprising dual activity of kinase and BET inhibitors suggests that potent activity for both bromodomain and kinases could be designed into a single inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">The profiling data provided here offers a comparison of inhibitor potency and selectivity across the BRD family. We found good correlation of BROMO<italic>scan</italic> assay data with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>s determined in solution by ITC, whereas the magnitude of <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> shifts across the BRD family may vary depending on the intrinsic stability of each BRD. However, as an analytical tool the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> shift assay provides a good platform for assessment of selectivity when hits are carefully followed up using orthogonal binding assays. Some probe compounds were exclusively selective, while others, such as the CBP/p300 probes I-CBP112 and CBP30, showed significant BET activity (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Thus, care should be taken when these probes are used in cellular assays. We recommend that probe concentration not higher than 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;M for I-CBP112 and 2.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;M for CBP30 are used in cell-based assays and that BET inhibitors are included as controls.</p><p id="Par26">Even though the coverage of the bromodomain family with chemical probes is now quite good, there are still a number of BRDs for which no selective or even non-selective inhibitors are available. Many of these BRDs have unusual Kac-binding sites, for instance, in some BRDs the conserved Asn is replaced by Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. No specific Kac-containing sequences have been reported binding to these BRDs limiting the development of Kac-competitive assays. Some of these BRDs may also not recognize Kac-containing sequences at all. Other BRDs have less druggable binding sites making the development of high-affinity chemical probes challenging. There are now also structurally diverse Kac-binding domains called YEATs domains that have recently been targeted by small molecules and fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. It is therefore likely that the arsenal of chemical probes for these reader domains will continue to grow in the future. New chemical probes and associated data will therefore be published on our web-based database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes">https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par27">Most bromodomain-containing targets are complex multi-subunit-containing molecules, which also contain histone- and chromatin-interacting proteins. For some BRD-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, chemical antagonism of Kac binding is sufficient to displace the target protein from its intended chromatin loci. In other cases, such as for p300/CBP- and SMARCA2/4-containing complexes, it appears that BRD antagonism is insufficient to displace the entire complex from chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.
