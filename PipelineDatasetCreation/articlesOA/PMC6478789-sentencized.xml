</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genetic and epigenetic variation, as well as environmental and lifestyle factors, work in concert to influence human health and disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the essential role of epigenetic modifications in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation has emerged1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Apart from changes in DNA methylation, covalent post translational modifications (PTMs) of histones and other nuclear proteins define a complex language, the epigenetic code, which regulates chromatin structure and dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lysine acetylation (Kac) is a major epigenetic PTM occurring on histone proteins, which has been studied broadly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Kac has generally been associated with activation of transcription through opening of chromatin structure, although some recent studies have found some Kac marks to be responsible for the compaction of chromatin, protein stability, and the regulation of protein-protein interactions2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Disruption of histone acetylation patterns has been linked to the development of disease, which may occur through mutations that deregulate enzymes responsible for adding or removing these histone acetyl marks, as well as the protein interaction modules that recognize and interpret this important PTM3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Histone acetylation is a highly dynamic process that is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that respectively write and erase acetylation marks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The complex pattern of acetylation marks is interpreted (read) by reader domains of the bromodomain (BRD) family of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>BRD-containing proteins are evolutionarily conserved and of substantial biological interest, as components of transcription factor and chromatin-modifying complexes and determinants of epigenetic memory4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>There are 61 BRDs expressed in the human proteome, present in 46 diverse proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, some atypical bromodomains, which lack essential residues, have little or no activity towards Kac-containing histone sequences and may recognize other epigenetic marks or unmodified peptide sequences, while canonical BRDs may also bind to complex patterns of modification around a central Kac site that often contain other PTMs 5–7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The modular nature of many BRD-containing proteins, which typically harbor a number of diverse reader domains in addition to enzymatic functionalities and role(s) as scaffolds in large chromatin-modifying complexes, makes their functional study a challenging task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, the development of highly selective inhibitors has provided versatile tools for functional studies on endogenous BRD-containing proteins, which can now be used to unravel the role of the epigenetic Kac-dependent reading process in chromatin biology as well as in the development of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This is exemplified by the development of highly potent inhibitors for BET (Bromo and extra-terminal; BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRDT) BRDs8,9, which has led to numerous translational and functional studies on this subfamily of bromodomain proteins10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Chemical probes, small-molecule tool inhibitors with selectivity against similar proteins, have led to the validation of many disease targets, making seminal contributions to our understanding of complex cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, chemical probes need to be highly selective, cell active, and therefore need to be comprehensively characterized in order to link observed phenotypic responses to targeted proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, selectivity and potency of tool compounds are often insufficient resulting in contradictory and erroneous results11,12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Following the disclosure of potent BET BRD inhibitors (BRDi), other members of the BRD family of interaction modules have been found to be highly druggable13, resulting in the identification of chemical fragments that were subsequently developed into potent and selective chemical probes14–20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, BRDs outside the BET family have not been found to be major regulators of primary transcription control, posing challenges for the discovery of functional roles of these conserved domains21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>As a result, only a few studies have reported phenotypic consequences of inhibiting non-BET BRDs pointing to important roles in cellular differentiation22,23. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Here, we characterize a comprehensive set of BRD chemical probes covering all subfamilies previously identified with good druggability scores13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Using a standardized commercial assay format (BROMOscan), based on a high-throughput binding assay originally developed to assess the selectivity of kinase inhibitors24, we evaluate the selectivity of this BRD chemical probe-set and determine a total of 626 KD values on all detected interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We present here an overview of the binding modes of these inhibitors, resulting in the excellent selectivity of these chemical probes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>To exemplify the use of this probe-set in biological systems, we further screen the collection on a cellular model of muscle differentiation identifying BET BRDs as major regulators in this context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, systematic investigations of BRD inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines have revealed an essential role for BRD inhibitors to target the metabolic vulnerability of TNBC, demonstrating their utility as a collection to uncover a previously unknown crosstalk between BRD components of the HBO1 HAT complex and cell metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Together, our study provides a comprehensive structural and functional insight on BRD inhibitors, establishing a powerful resource for future mechanistic studies of this family of epigenetic reader domains, and underscoring the broad utility and immediate therapeutic potential of direct-acting inhibitors of human bromodomain proteins. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Chemical biology efforts of the past few years have led to the development of potent chemical probes for most BRD families (Fig. 1)5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The promyelocytic leukemia-SP100 nuclear bodies (family V), which harbor a PHD-BRD tandem reader cassette are a notable exception and some families are still insufficiently covered, including members of families VI and VII, which also have atypical and shallow Kac-binding pockets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In contrast, family I that contains the HATs PCAF and GCN5, as well as CECR2 and FALZ, is well covered by chemical probes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The dual PCAF/GCN5 chemical probe L-Moses showed good potency for these two highly related bromodomains (KD of 126 and 600 nM, respectively, determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC))25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>GSK4027 offers an alternative chemotype to antagonize the BRDs in these two targets with improved potency (KD 1.4 nM determined by BROMOscan for both BRDs)26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Early lead molecules for bromodomains of CECR2 and FALZ were discovered by screening a series of triazolophthalazines27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, compounds of this series inhibited several BRD family members and exhibited poor solubility, limiting further development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>NVS-CECR2-1 was the first potent chemical probe targeting CECR2 with good potency (80 nM, determined by ITC) and selectivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>An alternative probe molecule, GNE-886, has recently been published showing, however, some activity towards the BRDs of BRD9, BRD7, and TAF1/TAF1L28.Fig. 1Chemical probes of the human bromodomain family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The set includes probes developed by our laboratory and a selection of additional inhibitors that are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>For each BRD family a single structural example of a chemical probe is shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Additional probes are listed and a summary showing all chemical structures is included in Supplementary Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>BRD family members for which probes have been developed are highlighted in bold and by dark red lines in the dendrogram </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To date, the BET BRDs (Family II) have had the greatest activity in inhibitor development, undoubtedly due to the strong and clinically relevant phenotypes observed for these compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This is an area that has rapidly evolved and has been previously reviewed in detail10,29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The first published Kac-competitive BRD inhibitors, which now have been widely used are the thienodiazepine (+)-JQ1 (henceforth, JQ1)8 the related clinical compound OTX01530, as well as the benzodiazepine iBET9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Inhibitors of this family show panBET activity primarily against the first BRD with slightly lower binding affinity towards the second BRD in BET proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>More recently, antagonists featuring diverse Kac mimetics have been developed, including the isoxazole I-BET151 (GSK1210151A)31,32 and the tetrahydroquinazoline PFI-133. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Here we included in our probe-set JQ1, I-BET151, and PFI-1 as three structurally diverse and unencumbered chemical probes for BET proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Family III contains BRDs present in the HATs p300 and CBP, as well as a number of diverse BRDs for which no potent inhibitors have been identified so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The first inhibitor developed for CBP/p300, SGC-CBP30, exhibited potent activity for BRDs in these two HATs (KD: 21 and 38 nM, respectively), retaining however significant BET affinity, which needs to be taken into account in cellular assays by using appropriate concentrations18,34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>An alternative chemical probe is the benzoxazepine I-CBP11223. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Recently, a highly potent antagonist, GNE-781, which has 650-fold selectivity over BRD4 for CBP/p300 became available35. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Family IV contains BRDs participating in HAT scaffolding (BRPF1-3), and chromatin remodeling complexes (BRD7, BRD9, and ATAD2A/B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Several chemical probes target BRD7 and BRD9, including BI-956436 and LP-9915, as well as I-BRD9, which has good selectivity towards BRD9 over BRD737. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The ATAD2 and ATAD2B BRDs have been targeted using the potent and selective antagonist GSK881438, while the allosteric BRD antagonist BAY-850 was developed as a specific probe against ATAD239. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>BRPF BRD antagonists are well represented by the pan-BRPF chemical probes OF-1 and NI-57, and the two related BRPF1B-selective chemical probes PFI-4 and GSK685340,41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In addition, BAY-299, a dual activity chemical probe for BRPF2 and TAF1(2), has also been developed providing the only currently available chemical tool for family VII42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Similarly, compound 34, a dual activity antagonist of BRPF1B/2 and TRIM24 represents the only chemical tool currently developed for TRIM2443. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Family VI is divided into the RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase of the TRIM (tripartite motif-containing protein) family and BAZ2 (bromodomain adjacent to zinc-finger domain), which are components of chromatin remodeling complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, compound 34 offers proof of principle that BRDs within this family like TRIM24 are also druggable43. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Two high affinity probes have also been developed against the BRDs of BAZ2A/B, GSK2801, and BAZ2-ICR16,44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Finally, BRDs in SMARCA2/4 (family VIII) (SWI/SNF related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin) and the scaffolding protein polybromo (PB1(5)) have been selectively targeted by PFI-322. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The chemical probe-set presented here comprises 25 tool compounds covering 29 (50%) of all human BRD proteins (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Each chemical probe interferes with the binding of its respective BRD(s) acetyl-lysine target sequences, including the major acetylation sites described as BRD binding sites on histone proteins (Fig. 2)5.Fig. 2Schematic representation of interaction sites of current set of bromodomain (BRD) chemical probes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Selectivity of a chemical probe is the most important feature of these key reagents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The BRD family contains 61 domains, many of them sharing significant sequence homology in the acetyl-lysine-binding domain and a common structural mechanism of Kac recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In particular, even partial inhibition of BET bromodomains by less selective BRD inhibitors has been linked to many phenotypic responses, thereby confounding attribution of the phenotype to a specific BRD protein45. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Recent effort by our laboratories and others established a comprehensive set of epigenetic probe molecules for selective targeting of acetyl-lysine-dependent reader domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is a significant achievement considering that apart from a number of fragment-like small molecules, no BRD had been targeted before the first potent BET inhibitors were disclosed in 20108,9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In particular, BET inhibitors had a major impact on basic and translation research as demonstrated by the large number of research papers that have been published using these reagents and more than 20 clinical trials that are currently registered10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>However, BRD inhibitors outside the BET family have not been validated as potential drug targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Here we provide data showing that inhibition of BRPF BRDs in combination with selective inhibitors of glucose transport might be beneficial for the treatment of TNBCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies demonstrated also synergies of BRD inhibitors with other drugs, such as CBP/p300 inhibitors acting synergistically with BET inhibitors as well as cytotoxic agents and dexamethasone in leukemia23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>In addition, BET inhibitors showed synergy in cancer models in combination with HDAC inhibitors64,65. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The combination of different inhibitors might also be important in overcoming drug resistance, which has been observed in cells treated with BET inhibitors66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The reported surprising dual activity of kinase and BET inhibitors suggests that potent activity for both bromodomain and kinases could be designed into a single inhibitor45,49,67. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The profiling data provided here offers a comparison of inhibitor potency and selectivity across the BRD family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>We found good correlation of BROMOscan assay data with KDs determined in solution by ITC, whereas the magnitude of Tm shifts across the BRD family may vary depending on the intrinsic stability of each BRD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>However, as an analytical tool the Tm shift assay provides a good platform for assessment of selectivity when hits are carefully followed up using orthogonal binding assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Some probe compounds were exclusively selective, while others, such as the CBP/p300 probes I-CBP112 and CBP30, showed significant BET activity (Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Thus, care should be taken when these probes are used in cellular assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>We recommend that probe concentration not higher than 3 μM for I-CBP112 and 2.5 μM for CBP30 are used in cell-based assays and that BET inhibitors are included as controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Even though the coverage of the bromodomain family with chemical probes is now quite good, there are still a number of BRDs for which no selective or even non-selective inhibitors are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Many of these BRDs have unusual Kac-binding sites, for instance, in some BRDs the conserved Asn is replaced by Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>No specific Kac-containing sequences have been reported binding to these BRDs limiting the development of Kac-competitive assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Some of these BRDs may also not recognize Kac-containing sequences at all. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Other BRDs have less druggable binding sites making the development of high-affinity chemical probes challenging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>There are now also structurally diverse Kac-binding domains called YEATs domains that have recently been targeted by small molecules and fragments68,69. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>It is therefore likely that the arsenal of chemical probes for these reader domains will continue to grow in the future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>New chemical probes and associated data will therefore be published on our web-based database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes">https://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Most bromodomain-containing targets are complex multi-subunit-containing molecules, which also contain histone- and chromatin-interacting proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>For some BRD-containing proteins, such as BET proteins, chemical antagonism of Kac binding is sufficient to displace the target protein from its intended chromatin loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In other cases, such as for p300/CBP- and SMARCA2/4-containing complexes, it appears that BRD antagonism is insufficient to displace the entire complex from chromatin22,23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Thus, BRDi targeting complex chromatin proteins are not likely to always replicate genetic knockdown studies of the full-length protein22,70. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>We believe that this chemical probe toolset will be an excellent resource for understanding the role of specifically targeted BRDs within larger chromatin complexes and will likely reveal novel opportunities for translational research projects. </plain></SENT>
