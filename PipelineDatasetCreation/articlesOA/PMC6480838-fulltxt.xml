Additionally, firefighters struggle with poor health/low levels of fitness, including high (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%) rates of overweight and obesity. Limited resources exist for fire departments that are tailored to the culture and work requirements of these &#x0201c;tactical athletes&#x0201d;. Though there has been increasing interest in high intensity functional training (HIFT) programs, research data are lacking among firefighters and few studies have focused on training recruits. The purpose of this pilot investigation was to examine a novel HIFT program (TF20) on fire academy recruits&#x02019; health, fitness, and performance as determined by a simulated fire ground test (SFGT), as well as determining the program&#x02019;s acceptability and feasibility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Thirteen participants were recruited from an entry level fire academy and were randomly assigned to the control (CG, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;6) or HIFT group (TF20, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;7). The CG was asked to continue current exercise habits. TF20 was provided a 10-week online based training program that included periodized workouts, nutritional information, and mental readiness education. Due to attrition within the first two weeks of the study, 10 male fire recruits (23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x02009;years) completed the study (CG, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;3, TF20, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;7).

Firefighters (FFs) work in dangerous and complex environments, which increases their risk for injuries and fatalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to the dangerous nature of the job, FFs struggle with poor health and low levels of physical fitness, including very high (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%) rates of overweight and obesity (body mass index [BMI]&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), likely related to the culture of the fire service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many firefighters experience significant weight gain over the course of an approximate 25-year career, with a range of 29&#x02013;85 pounds gained (i.e., 1.15&#x02013;3.4 lbs./year; 3). As a firefighter&#x02019;s weight increases, their cardiorespiratory fitness plummets and their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Comorbidities related to overweight and obesity include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer which are highly prevalent among the firefighter population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">It is well documented that physical fitness is related to job performance, including the performance of simulated firefighting tasks that are relevant to actual job tasks (e.g., pulling hose, carrying a ladder, and rescuing a victim; 3). Firefighting presents a unique challenge for physical fitness training because it requires concurrently improving multiple fitness training goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Firefighting requires optimal levels of power, strength, muscular endurance, and anaerobic/aerobic endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Inadequate fitness levels may reduce the occupational performance and increase the risk of overexertion injuries for firefighters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, increased physical fitness is related to lower levels of injury/illness, reduced absenteeism, increased productivity, and increased work capacity for firefighters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Limited resources exist for fire departments that are tailored to the culture and work requirements of these tactical athletes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There has been increasing interest in high-intensity functional training (HIFT) programs among tactical populations, yet key research data are lacking for the firefighter population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has several standards that focus on the health risks of firefighters (e.g., NFPA 1500, NFPA 1582, and NFPA 1583; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]). While these guidelines exist, there are no nationally-enforced fitness or physical activity requirements for firefighters, which leads to inconsistent fitness training within and between fire departments, substandard fitness levels, and greater risks for obesity, injury, and cardiovascular-related events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, only 38.7% of career and 23.6% of volunteer firefighters meet the fitness threshold suggested as a minimal return to work post cardiac event by NFPA 1582 which includes a VO<sub>2max</sub> of at least 42&#x02009;ml/kg/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">The NFPA recommends firefighters be allowed to exercise on duty to maintain adequate fitness levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While Poplin et al. (2012) found that on-duty physical exercise was responsible for one-third of all firefighter injuries (32.9%), most of these injuries tended to be minor strains/sprains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is still recommended that firefighters be encouraged to exercise while on duty. Studies have shown that firefighters who engaged in regular physical training were less likely to incur a serious injury on the fireground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, firefighters who train regularly and possess higher fitness levels tend to perform job-specific tasks more efficiently than untrained firefighters, emphasizing the importance of implementing an exercise program for firefighters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for cost-effective training programs targeted at the&#x000a0;unique needs and culture of the fire service as a means of improving readiness, decreasing injury, and preventing line of duty deaths (LODD) related to CVD.</p><p id="Par40">Fire academies provide instruction for new firefighters and should instill the importance of physical fitness training as recruits begin a physically demanding career in the fire service [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, current fire academies across the U.S. do little to address physical fitness other than the physical skills taught during fire training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The applied coursework requires much time spent on the drill ground learning basic firefighter skills, e.g., donning personal protective equipment such as bunker gear and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), navigating through dark search quarters, searching and removing a victim, climbing ladders, and fighting live fire. Firefighter recruits also are typically required to take the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT), or an equivalent occupational fire ground test during the Fire Academy, which they must pass to be considered for employment in most fire departments across the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These tests are physically demanding and require high fitness levels.</p><p id="Par41">The purpose of this pilot investigation was to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and relevant fitness and occupational performance outcomes of an innovative firefighter HIFT program, The First Twenty Tactical High Performance Program (TF20) with firefighter recruits.

Using a holistic approach combined with empirical evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] TF20 is a comprehensive program that addresses firefighters&#x02019; unique physiological challenges by simulating tasks performed on the fire ground. Specifically, the program&#x02019;s goals are to optimize a firefighter&#x02019;s occupational performance, resilience to injury, stability, mobility, strength, and endurance through a series of high intensity circuits, focused on both resistance and endurance exercises. TF20 online platform allows participants to apply and track these principles on a daily basis and record their progress. The portal includes private account settings, health programs, fitness tracking with exercise and workout videos, nutrition tracking, health education, results tracking, and communication and social media tools.</p><p id="Par47">TF20 Intervention Group (TF20) workouts were part of an online training program that provided endurance and resistance exercises, nutritional information, and mental performance guidance. The original program was a 24-week periodized program which was condensed into a 10-week exercise program to accommodate the time frame of the study and fire academy academic semester. A National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) and Tactical Strength and Conditioning Facilitator (TSAC-F) condensed the program but kept the periodization scheme consistent to mimic the longer cycle of workouts.

A Seca stadiometer (Chino, CA) was used to assess height. The Tanita TBF-300A digital bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scale (Arlington Heights, IL) was used to assess body composition including percent body fat (%BF), fat mass (FM in kg), fat-free mass (i.e., muscle mass; FFM in kg), body mass index (BMI in kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and weight (to the nearest 0.1&#x02009;kg).

A standardized protocol recommended for firefighters by the Joint Labor Management Wellness Fitness Initiative (WFI) was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This test is recommended for firefighters because, unlike other submaximal graded exercise tests, this one requires the participant to exercise to maximal volitional fatigue, similar to completing a physically exhausting task on the fireground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

The CPAT provides a traditional frame of reference to evaluate increases or decreases in physical fitness and occupational readiness and provides a firefighter-specific assessment. The CPAT consists of eight separate events that require the participant to progress along a predetermined path from event to event in a continuous manner. It is a pass/fail test based on finishing all events in a maximum total test time of 10&#x02009;min and 20&#x02009;s or less. Participants were provided with a familiarization session prior to taking the CPAT for the first time as is suggested by the IAFF/IAFC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

In order to examine outcomes of all participants initially recruited in the study, we used an Intention to Treat (ITT) Model carrying forward the baseline observations for those that did not have post-test values. This allowed us to examine all participants, assuming no change for those that did not complete the intervention. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to examine differences between the two groups.

We hypothesized that TF20 participants would demonstrate greater improvements in fire ground performance, body composition, and strength than the CG participants. This pilot study examined the program&#x02019;s performance and acceptability in &#x0201c;real world conditions&#x0201d; to determine if TF20 training program was relevant for firefighter recruits as they progressed through a fire academy.</p><p id="Par76">It is interesting to note that prior to participation in the training program, all firefighter recruits in this study demonstrated aerobic capacity levels below that which is deemed essential for safe and effective fire ground operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Previous reports have stated that the most demanding firefighter tasks, which also were the most commonly encountered, demanded a mean VO<sub>2</sub> of 41.5&#x02009;ml/kg/min (range of 36.6&#x02013;44.0&#x02009;ml/kg/min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The WFI recommends maximal oxygen uptake of at least 42&#x02009;ml/kg/min to meet the aerobic demands of the job [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Prior to training, fire recruits in this study possessed an estimated average VO<sub>2max</sub> of 38.9&#x02009;ml/kg/min (CG mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;39.8&#x02009;ml/kg/min, TF20 mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;38.5&#x02009;ml/kg/min). After the 10-week intervention the CG had a mean estimated VO<sub>2max</sub> of 43.8&#x02009;ml/kg/min and TF20 had a mean estimated VO<sub>2max</sub> of 41.1&#x02009;ml/kg/min.</p><p id="Par77">The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) classifies VO<sub>2max</sub> values between 38.0&#x02013;41.0&#x02009;ml/kg/min in the &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; range for males between the ages of 20&#x02013;29&#x02009;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Our study findings also support the current literature that suggests the general public is not as fit as they should be, thereby effectively lessening those qualified for physically demanding jobs such as firefighting and other tactical occupations (e.g., military and police).</p><p id="Par78">At baseline, 67% of the CG and 80% of TF20 group reported meeting moderate/vigorous PAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. At the end of the 10-week study, all nine of the participants that took the follow-up questionnaire (TF20&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, CG&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) reported meeting or exceeding the aerobic portion of the PAG. Four TF20 participants met the full PAG at baseline and at follow-up. These findings may be due, in part, to the physically demanding nature of the Fire Academy (e.g., climbing ladders, navigating through dark search quarters). Fire ground activities may increase aerobic activity so the nature of the Fire Academy itself, may be the reason for the increase in reporting meeting aerobic guidelines.</p><p id="Par79">The CPAT was used as a critical occupational performance measure since it (or an equivalent test) is required for employment by most fire departments across the country. TF20 participants showed marked improvement on their CPAT performance, even with a small sample size. It is possible that improvement on the CPAT was due to familiarization with fire ground-related tasks in the fire academy and not the intervention itself; the only two participants who failed the test at baseline and passed at post-intervention were in TF20 group. However, occupationally-relevant physical agility tests are related to several fitness and body composition parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, recruits may learn the basic firefighter skills while in an academy, yet lack the physical fitness to pass the CPAT. This shows the importance of implementing a culture of fitness early in a firefighter&#x02019;s career. If fitness programs can be implemented at the fire academy level, physical fitness training can become habitual for young firefighters.</p><p id="Par80">Results from this study show promise for utilizing TF20 as part of a fire academy-specific training program to begin instilling the importance of a fit fire service at the start of their careers.

Given the pilot nature of this study, there are several limitations that should be noted including the small initial sample size (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;13). The fire academy from which we recruited only had a very small initial group from which we could recruit (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;24), thus limiting our starting sample size.</p><p id="Par82">Second, because this was a pilot study with minimal funding, we were limited in the amount of contact we could provide participants and were unable to offer any incentives, unlike other exercise studies. This resulted in a third study limitation, which was high and differential attrition in the CG (50%) vs. TF20 group (0%). This high CG attrition and the small initial sample led to an even smaller post-treatment sample size for the completers&#x02019; analysis (and further limited power to detect group differences in outcomes), as well as negatively impacting our ability to address missing data using common imputation methods for ITT analysis as suggested in the CONSORT Guidelines for clinical trials.</p><p id="Par83">Another limitation was equipment availability. For example, because the site of data collection was two hours away from our laboratory, we were unable to complete maximal aerobic capacity tests for each participant. Instead, based on recommendations from the WFI, we used a StepMill submaximal graded exercise test to estimate VO2max. Though there are errors associated with submaximal exercise tests, a recent review article found that submaximal step tests provide a simple, effective, and valid method of submaximally assessing VO2max [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">While weighted vests required for use in the CPAT do not elicit the same physiologic burden as firefighting in full turnout gear, the weighted vest, as well as the other equipment used in the CPAT, were designed to provide the highest level of consistency, safety, and validity in measuring each participant&#x02019;s physical ability and occupational readiness. In addition, they represent the recommended &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; set by the IAFF/IAFC WFI for recruit firefighter fitness testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Load carriage decreases exercise tolerance, capacity, and efficiency, although the shape (i.e., a weighted vest vs. protective clothing) and the placement of the load do have an impact on physical performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par85">Additionally, a longer intervention (&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;weeks) may be beneficial as the current 10-week intervention did not show as many improvements as some 16-week interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

This investigation provides promising results for the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of high-intensity training programs designed for the fire service. It also provides useful information that will aid in the design and implementation of a larger randomized controlled trial and provides alternative guidance for exercise prescription specifically for firefighters. Further investigation is necessary with a larger sample population to examine different types of physical training and its effects on the firefighter population, specifically firefighter recruits. Future studies should also examine the impact of load carriage on firefighter performance and examine the difference between weighted vests and full firefighter turnout gear on physiologic performance.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACSM</term><def><p id="Par5">American College of Sports Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BF%</term><def><p id="Par6">Body Fat Percentage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIA</term><def><p id="Par7">Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par8">Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par9">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p id="Par10">Control Group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPAT</term><def><p id="Par11">Candidate Physical Ability Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPR</term><def><p id="Par12">Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSCS</term><def><p id="Par13">Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p id="Par14">Cardiovascular Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEXA</term><def><p id="Par15">Dual X-ray absorptiometry analysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMT</term><def><p id="Par16">Emergency Medical Technician</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p id="Par17">Fat-free Mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FM</term><def><p id="Par18">Fat Mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GS</term><def><p id="Par19">Grip Strength</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAFC</term><def><p id="Par20">International Association of Fire Chiefs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IAFF</term><def><p id="Par21">International Association of Firefighters</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p id="Par22">International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p id="Par23">Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KSU</term><def><p id="Par24">Kansas State University</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LODD</term><def><p id="Par25">Line of Duty Death</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NFPA</term><def><p id="Par26">National Fire Protection Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAG</term><def><p id="Par27">Physical Activity Guidelines</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PU</term><def><p id="Par28">Push-ups</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCBA</term><def><p id="Par29">Self-contained Breathing Apparatus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SFGT</term><def><p id="Par30">Simulated Fire Ground Test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TF20</term><def><p id="Par31">The First Twenty Tactical High Performance Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSAC-F</term><def><p id="Par32">Tactical Strength and Conditioning Facilitator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USDHHS</term><def><p id="Par33">US Department of Health and Human Services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO<sub>2max</sub></term><def><p id="Par34">Maximal aerobic capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WFI</term><def><p id="Par35">Wellness Fitness Initiative</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="Par87">The authors wish to acknowledge the following groups/individuals for exceptional work on this project and the subsequent manuscript:</p><p id="Par88">
