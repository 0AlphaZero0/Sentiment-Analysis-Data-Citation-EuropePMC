PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	ENA	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1).
PMC2154357	1K4C,1BL8	Methods	PDBe	All values are reported in Table I together with previous results on KcsA (Bernèche and Roux, 2001; Noskov et al., 2004). 	We estimate that the accuracy and overall significance of the calculated free energies is roughly on the order of 1 kcal/mol, based on the difference between the computations with 1K4C (Noskov et al., 2004) and 1BL8 (Bernèche and Roux, 2001) and the comparison between the CHARMM PARAM27 and AMBER force fields. 	For the simulations with the AMBER force field, the systems were reequilibriated for 1.5 ns before starting the free energy computations. The hydration number of K+ and Na+ in the various binding sites were computed from the average of 800 ps of MD for each configuration; statistical error was estimated by comparing block averages.
PMC2216687	Q9XVV3,Q18688,P03372,P07900	Results	UniProt	We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. 	For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. 	Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively.

PMC2216687	P01023	Discussion	UniProt	Moreover, the CSIDOP may provide additional functional terms to existing proteins. 	For example, the Alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor [Swiss-Prot: P01023], was predicted by CSIDOP to be involved in protease inhibitor activity (GO:0030414), which is not among the current list of functions annotated in GO. 	Consistent with this prediction, alpha-2-macroglobulin is found to be a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested [33]. Another example is the PRS7 [Swiss-Prot: P35998] gene in human, which is currently annotated in GO to participate in protein binding (GO:0005515), with no other listed terms.

Another example is the PRS7 [Swiss-Prot: P35998] gene in human, which is currently annotated in GO to participate in protein binding (GO:0005515), with no other listed terms. 	Our CSIDOP method predicted that it is also involved in ATP binding (GO:0005524), hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), nucleotide binding (GO:0000166), and nucleoside_triphosphatase activity (GO:0017111), all of which can be verified in InterPro [34]. Other assigned terms for PRS7 by CSIDOP included endopeptidase activity (GO:0004175) and ATPase activity (GO:0016887), which were observed in the orthologous proteins of PRS7.

PMC2216687	GO:0005515,P09958,GO:0019904	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	As illustrated in Figure 2, 15 out of the 20 proteins were predicted with function distances of one or two. 	A distance of one means that the two terms have a direct parent-child relationship; for instance, protein binding (GO:0005515) is a known function of Furin precursor protein [Swiss-Prot: P09958], and our method predicted it to be involved in protein domain specific binding (GO:0019904), which is a direct child term of protein binding in GO. 	If we consider such cases to also be successful prediction, then the accuracy improves from 95.42% to 97.71%. A distance of two indicates that the two terms share a parent.
PMC2216687	O15524,GO:0005159,GO:0005118	Discussion	UniProt	A distance of two indicates that the two terms share a parent. 	For example, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 [Swiss-Prot: O15524] was identified in GO to be associated with insulin-like growth factor receptor binding (GO:0005159), whereas we assigned the function term, sevenless binding (GO:0005118). 	The two terms share a parent term, receptor binding (GO:0005102). In this case, if the more general terms were used, a correct functional annotation would have been achieved.
PMC2216687	Q13642,GO:0008270	Discussion	UniProt	Some of these novel annotations can be supported with evidence provided by QuickGO, a web browser of gene ontology data maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute [37]. 	For instance, the gene FHL1, four and a half LIM domains protein [Swiss-Prot: Q13642], was identified by the CSIDOP to participate in metal ion binding (GO:0046872) and zinc ion binding (GO:0008270). 	The metal ion binding annotation was found in QuickGO which was inferred from UniProt keywords. The zinc ion binding term was found by both the UniProt keywords and in InterPro [34], which is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can be applied to unknown protein sequences.
PMC2216687	Q14181	Discussion	UniProt	Orthologous proteins are generally believed to have similar functions, and the orthologs can be obtained from Inparanoid [31]. 	For example, the H. sapiens gene POLA2, DNA polymerase subunit alpha B [Swiss-Prot: Q14181], was predicted by CSIDOP to exhibit alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Orthologs of POLA2 found by Inparanoid include: POL12 [ORF: YBL035C; SGD:S000000131] in S. cerevisiae, POLA2 [RGD:621817] in R. norvegicus, and CG5923 [FlyBase: FBgn0005696] in D. melanogaster. All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889).
PMC2216687	O75995	Results	UniProt	All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Furthermore, the CSIDOP method detected three molecular function terms for the human protein SLY, SH3 protein expressed in lymphocytes homolog [Swiss-Prot: O75995], while no information was found anywhere else. 	The three functions identified were DNA binding (GO:0003677), chromatin binding (GO:0003682), and zinc ion binding (GO:0008270). The SLY protein contains a COR1 chromatin-binding domain, and it was suggested in [38] that SLY may be targeted to the gonosomes in spermatids and may regulate gonosomal chromatin conformation and expression.

Another protein CCNB3 [Swiss-Prot: Q8WWL7] in the human genome was predicted by the CSIDOP method to be involved in cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity (GO:0016538) and protein binding (GO:0005515).

An orthologous protein found in D. melanogaster CG5814 [FlyBase: FBgn0015625] shared both functional annotations, which were inferred from sequence or structural similarity and physical interaction [39], respectively. In the literature, CCNB3 was described as sharing properties with both A- and B-type cyclins.
PMC2216687	Q9W4J7,GO:0015662	Discussion	UniProt	In addition, we were able to discover novel annotations for some proteins. 	For example, the D. melanogaster protein CG15912 [Swiss-Prot: Q9W4J7] was detected by CSIDOP to exhibit ATPase activity, coupled to transmembrane movement of ions, phosphorylative mechanism (GO:0015662). 	Its orthologs: Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain containing 3 [Swiss-Prot: Q9BSH5] in H. sapiens and [Swiss-Prot: Q9CYW4] in M. musculus were both found to be associated with phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity (GO:0008967) and hydrolase activity (GO:0016787), which is an ancestor term of our predicted term (GO:0015662). Moreover, for the protein CG18445 [Swiss-Prot: Q9V5F2], a multispan transmembrane protein related to fly Porcupine, our algorithm identified to carry out the O-acyltransferase activity (GO:0008374).

Since the CSIDOP method only keeps the most significant interacting domain patterns from the closely related protein interaction pairs across species, PPI pairs in the test dataset not containing the patterns in the lookup table will result in no prediction.

PMC2602789	1GDT	Introduction	PDBe	The 1–2 dimer is present in a structure of γδ resolvase bound to site I DNA (11; Figure 2A), but the 2–3′ interaction has not yet been observed in X-ray structures of complexes containing DNA. Figure 2.Resolvase structures and activating mutations. 	(A) Crystal structure of a wild-type γδ resolvase dimer bound to site I [1GDT; (11)]. 	On the right, residues relevant to the experiments presented here are shown in spacefill on the orange resolvase subunit (in the same orientation); S10 in green; R2 and E56 in blue; G101, E102, M103 and K105 in cyan; A117, R121 and E124 in magenta. The hydroxyl group of S10 is the catalytic nucleophile in recombination.
PMC2602789	1ZR4	Discussion	PDBe	The γδ resolvase residues E102 and K105 correspond to D102 and Q105, respectively, in Tn3 resolvase. 	(B) Crystal structure of a synaptic tetramer of γδ resolvase with two cleaved site Is [1ZR4; (16)], and on the right the orange resolvase subunit in the same orientation, showing residues in spacefill as in (A), except that the following residues are mutant; A2, K56, S101, Y102, I103, Q124. 	The images were created with PyMol. Resolvase variants with ‘activating’ mutations promote recombination at site I in the absence of the accessory binding sites of res (12,13).
PMC2602789	1GDT,1ZR4,1ZR2,2GM4,2GM5,2RSL,1GDR	Discussion	PDBe	The crystal structures of wild-type γδ resolvase and activated γδ resolvase mutants (both unbound and in complexes with site I) should provide clues to the nature of the regulation, and why it is defective in the activated mutants. 	The structures of the site I synaptic intermediates [1ZR2, 1ZR4, 2GM4; (16,17)] and of an activated variant catalytic domain without DNA [2GM5; (17)] contain a tetrameric arrangement of the catalytic domains which is not found in any of the structures of wild-type resolvase [2RSL, 1GDR, 1GDT; (6,8,9,11)] (Figure 2B). 	However, the structures do not provide an obvious explanation of how the mutations stabilize the tetramer, or why it is not formed by wild-type resolvase. Li et al. (16) make two hypotheses.
PMC2677866	1CW0	Methods	PDBe	RNA secondary structures were identified using the Vienna package (RNAfold) via http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi using default parameters, and visualized using PseudoViewer [http://pseudoviewer.inha.ac.kr]. 	Similarity of the Vsr-like homing endonuclease to known structures was found using the Phyre server (34), and a structure model was created with the Rosetta structure prediction program suite using the K*Sync alignment method (35), with PDB structure 1CW0 as a template. 	For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein.

Residues that were modeled in similar positions and backbone conformations after sequence threading and energy minimization are shown in upper case; unaligned sequence regions are shown in grey lowercase. Identical residues are highlighted in red.
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17).
PMC2677866	NZ_ABDA01000203.1	Results	RefSeq	In another case, Vsr-like ORFs are present in two group I introns of recA genes. 	One of these introns is found in a gene fragment from a whole genome shotgun sequencing project of Bacillus cereus (NCBI accession NZ_ABDA01000203.1). 	The fragment includes part of a recA 5′ region and a group I intron with a complete Vsr-like ORF. This region is 94% identical to a B. anthracis recA gene with an active group I intron (45) and identical recA loci from several other sequenced Bacilli (data not shown).

MEGA 4.0 was used for DNA sequence alignments and to visually scrutinize chromatogram trace files (Tamura et al. 2007). Caenorhabditis briggsae MA line mtDNA sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers (GU452324-GU452381). 	Detection and Treatment of Heteroplasmy To distinguish between fixed MA line mtDNA changes and those where sequence differences are in a heteroplasmic state (either in progenitor or in MA line), we carefully scrutinized chromatogram data (for base substitution polymorphisms and homopolymer mutations) and the results of PCR amplification on agarose gels (for large deletion events).
PMC2839355	GU452324,GU452381	Methods	ENA	Although this method will be biased if base composition differs between groups, the slight differences in base composition between species (%A/T = 75.6% in C. elegans and 75.1% in C. briggsae) and the even smaller difference between strains of C. briggsae (<0.1%) mean that the test is essentially unbiased as applied to our data.

PMC2928273	rs20417,rs5275,rs689470	Abstract	RefSNP	We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. 	For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10–3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09–2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09–10.49). 	Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31–0.96).
PMC2928273	rs20541,rs180925	Results	RefSNP	Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. 	rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14–7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03–10.18, respectively). 	The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P<0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events.

Joint Analysis of Esophagitis Risk Alleles To understand the cumulative effect of unfavorable genotypes on risk of esophagitis, we performed a combined analysis.
PMC2928273	rs1799724	Results	RefSNP	Inflammation-related SNPs and Risk of Pneumonitis 	A different set of inflammation-related SNPs was found to be significantly associated with risk of developing pneumonitis following radiation therapy and remained so at an FDR of 10% ( Table 4 ). Only one of the 12 SNPs identified were also associated with esophagitis risk – TNF:rs1799724. 	Patients homozygous for this variant exhibited a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI:1.33–18.57) of pneumonitis. This risk is similar for esophagitis risk in patients carrying at least one variant allele ( Table 2 ).
PMC2928273	rs1800587,rs17561	Results	RefSNP	Other significant genetic variants associated with pneumonitis included six SNPs in proinflammatory genes, including IL1A, IL8, TNFRSF1B, MIF, and NOS3. 	Two SNPs in IL1A – rs1800587 and rs17561– are in strong linkage disequilibrium and each resulted in a more than doubling of risk with HRs of 2.90 (95% CI:1.34–6.25) and 2.51 (95% CI:1.19–5.27), respectively. 	The risk associated with IL8:rs4073 was similar at 3.16-fold (95% CI:1.54–6.48). Under the additive model, TNFRSF1B:rs1061622 resulted in a 2.12-fold increased risk (95% CI:1.18–3.79).

A SNP in the lymphokine gene MIF resulted in an even higher HR of 3.96 (95% CI:1.04–15.12).

In contrast, genetic variation in NOS3 was associated with a 50% decrease in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31–0.96).
PMC2928273	rs20541,rs180925	Results	RefSNP	The two IL4 SNPs each resulted in increased risk with HRs of 2.54 (95% CI:1.27–5.08) and 3.05 (95% CI:1.50–6.22), respectively. IL13 polymorphisms had a similar effect on pneumonitis risk. 	Patients with two variant alleles or either rs20541 or rs180925 were approximately 3-times more likely to develop pneumonitis compared to those with wild-type or heterozygous genotypes (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14–7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03–10.18). 	The signaling molecule IkappaB-alpha (NFKBIA) inhibits the inflammatory response by blocking NFkappaB-mediated transcription of proinflammatory genes. NFKBIA:rs8904 resulted in a 2.02-fold increased pneumonitis risk (95% CI:1.01–4.03).
PMC2928273	rs1801275	Results	RefSNP	Joint Analysis of Pneumonitis Risk Alleles 	In combined analysis, the significant SNPs together with an additional borderline significant variant – IL4R: rs1801275 (P = 0.053) – showed an increase in pneumonitis risk as the number of unfavorable genotypes increased ( Table 3 ). The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013). 	This risk was dramatically increased for the group of patients with four or more unfavorable genotypes (P<0.0001). These high risk individuals also had a shorter duration between start of treatment and development of pneumonitis of only 5.33 months compared to over 12 months for those with 0 to 2 unfavorable genotypes ( Figure 1B ).
PMC2928273	rs1800872	Results	RefSNP	Therefore, we determined if any of the variants identified as toxicity risk factors were also associated with survival over three years. 	We found that patients with at least one variant allele of IL10:rs1800872 had a 1.74-fold increased risk of esophagitis, but a 40% decreased risk of dying when compared to patients with wild-type genotypes (HR:0.62, 95% CI:0.40–0.97).  Figure 2A  illustrates the time to esophagitis for patients with IL10:rs1800872 genotypes. 	Although not significant, patients with wild-type genotypes had median time to event of greater than 12 months contrasted with only 1.8 months for those with at least one variant of rs1800872. For survival ( Figure 2B ), there was a non-significant survival advantage of nearly four months for carriers with a median survival time of 16.1 months compared to only 12.4 months for patients with wild-type genotypes.

PMC2928273	rs5275,rs689470	Discussion	RefSNP	However, this same variant, while altering the Sp1/Sp3 site, also introduces a binding site for another transcription factor, Egr-1, although the consequences are unknown [22]. 	The other two significant variants (rs5275 and rs689470) are located in the 3′-UTR and regulate PSTGS2 mRNA levels. 	Our results suggest that these SNPs are linked with an increase in pro-inflammatory activity leading to esophagitis. Further functional analysis is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms [24].
PMC2928273	rs1801275	Results	RefSNP	Further functional analysis is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms [24]. 	For anti-inflammatory molecules and esophagitis risk, Khurana Hershey et al. demonstrated that IL4R:rs1801275 resulted in enhanced IL4 signaling and the induction of high levels of the IgE receptor CD23 [25]. 	IL10:rs1800872 and IL10RA:rs3135932 have been shown to decrease IL10 signaling by decreasing serum levels and altering IL10-IL10RA interactions, respectively [26], [27]. The reported functions of these three SNPs would be in agreement with our findings of an increased risk of esophagitis by decreasing the anti-inflammatory response.

Twelve common polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with risk of pneumonitis.
PMC2928273	rs1800587	Results	RefSNP	The two IL1A variants are in linkage disequilibrium and were found to increase risk by nearly 3-fold. 	IL1A:rs1800587 has been shown to contribute to an increase in IL1-α promoter activity, mRNA levels and protein levels [28]. 	IL1A:rs17561 is a non-synonymous SNP and increases processing of the IL1-α precursor resulting in an increase in the levels of active IL1-α [29]. The variant of IL8:rs4073, which was found to increase pneumonitis risk 3-fold, has been associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL8 [30].
PMC2928273	rs4073	Discussion	RefSNP	IL1A:rs17561 is a non-synonymous SNP and increases processing of the IL1-α precursor resulting in an increase in the levels of active IL1-α [29]. 	The variant of IL8:rs4073, which was found to increase pneumonitis risk 3-fold, has been associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL8 [30]. 	IL4 and IL13 work together to regulate the inflammatory response. Four genetic variants in these two genes were associated with ∼3-fold increased risk of pneumonitis.
PMC2928273	rs20541	Results	RefSNP	Four genetic variants in these two genes were associated with ∼3-fold increased risk of pneumonitis. 	Studies have demonstrated increased IgE production for IL4:rs2070874 and rs2243250 [31] and increased IL13 activity for IL13:rs20541 and rs180925 [32], [33]. 	Genetic variation in TNF and the receptor TNFRSF1B were also associated with increased risk of pneumonitis. TNF-α signaling is an important modulator of the inflammatory response.
PMC2928273	rs1799724	Discussion	RefSNP	TNF-α signaling is an important modulator of the inflammatory response. 	The TNF:rs1799724 variant is located within the promoter region of the gene and thought to influence gene expression by creating an OCT-1 transcription factor binding site [34]. 	The effect of this differential binding on TNF-α signaling is not clear. Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40].
PMC2928273	rs1061622	Discussion	RefSNP	Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. 	For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. 	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis.
PMC2928273	rs1799983	Discussion	RefSNP	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. 	This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. 	Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant results in production of a variant allozyme with reduced enzyme activity [43] resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide production [44]. These observations support our findings of decreased pneumonitis due to decreased inflammatory signaling.

Further interactions among the faces of the resulting β-sheets lead to layered structures in which tightly self-complementing “steric zippers” bind together the faces of the paired β-sheets.(6)

PMC3044699	106210	Introduction	OMIM	Patients with the PAX6 contiguous gene deletion, including the RCN1 gene, presented more severe vision impairments than those carrying the PAX6 3′ deletion. 	Aniridia (AN; OMIM 106210) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. 	The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1].
PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	OMIM	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18].

PMC3310866	3AUV	Results	PDBe	Since the phage display systems in Figure 1 are based on the scFv and the sc-dsFv scaffolds, it is important to verify that both the scFv and the sc-dsFv structures are similar to the variable domain structure in G6-Fab even in the absence of the two Fab constant domains in the scFv or the sc-dsFv structures. 	High-resolution sc-dsFv structure with the sequence identical to the parent G6-Fab variable domains (except for the two interface cysteines in the sc-dsFv shown in Figure 2) has been elucidated with x-ray crystallography as shown in Figure 2 (PDB code 3AUV); the refinement data are shown in Table S3. 	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details.

The structural differences of the engineered interface disulfide bond unique to the sc-dsFv structure are also highlighted in Figure 2. Although the G6-derived scFv structure has not been determined with experimental method, the consistency of the sc-dsFv structure with the G6-Fab structure as shown in Figure 2 and the consistency of the sequence patterns for the scFv and sc-dsFv variants binding to VEGF (comparison of Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) indicate that the scFv-VEGF interactions can be modeled based on the G6 Fab-VEGF complex structure as well.

Two of these complex interfaces (1BJ1 [32] and 2FJH [26]) have been optimized for high affinity, while the other three anti-VEGF antibodies (2QR0 [33], 1TZH and 1TZI [34]) were selected from phage display libraries with only limited amino acid variations (Y, S, D, A) in selected CDR residues. 	Since the corresponding phage display variant profiles as shown in Figure 1 are not available from the associated studies, similar analyses shown in Figure 3 could not be carried out. Alternatively, we predicted the ranking of the 20 natural amino acid types in each of the CDR positions defined in the respective antibody-antigen complex structures and highlight the rank of the CDR amino acids in the crystal structures based on the ranking predicted with the trained logistic regression models (Figure 5).

Among the residues in these core interfaces, only one Tyr residue was poorly predicted in the complex 1TZH. It is evident that the minimalist antibody library designs have not only substantially reduced the complexity space of the CDR regions, the computational antibody design herein can be better applied to a system with less complex combinatorial selections.

Only one clear solution was found and the R-work and R-free values of the initial 30 rounds of Refmac5 refinement [39] were 0.2581 and 0.3003, respectively.

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools: FGG ZHH. 	The aim of this study was to determine the association between the rs6552828 polymorphism in acyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACSL1) and elite endurance athletic status. 	We studied 82 Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes, and a group of sex and ethnically matched healthy young adults (controls, n = 197). The analyses were replicated in a cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (runners) [cases, n = 241 (128 male)] and healthy sedentary adults [controls, n = 504 (267 male)].
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	The odds ratio (95%CI) for an elite endurance Chinese athlete to carry the G allele compared with ethnically matched controls was 1.381 (1.015–1.880) (P-value = 0.04). 	Our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Caucasians, yet a marginal association seems to exist for the Chinese (Han) male population. 	
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2].

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Genotype analyses were performed during June–July 2011 in the Science and Research Centre of the Beijing Sports University (Beijing, China). 	For high-throughput genotyping of the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism, we used a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). 	Primers for PCR and single base extension were designed by using the Assay Designer software package (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	In females, genotypic (P = 0.973) and allele frequencies (P = 0.881) were similar in endurance and controls, whereas in males both genotypic (P = 0.019) and allelic (P = 0.040) differed in endurance and controls. 	The main finding of our study was that the ACSL1 rs6552828 SNP, located in the first intron of the ACSL1 gene, 715 bp and 718 bp upstream of exon 2 and the start codon, respectively, was not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Spanish men, yet a marginal association was found in Chinese men. 	The ACSL1 gene is a putative candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolic adaptations to regular exercise, at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level. Long-chain acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase (ACSL) isoenzymes, of which ACSL1 is the main and most studied isoenzyme convert free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) in an ATP-dependent manner, simultaneously activating and trapping FFA within cells [13].
PMC3400600	rs6552828,rs4862417,rs13120078,rs12503643	Discussion	RefSNP	ACSL1 is a candidate to explain individual differences in some several disease and endurance exercise-related phenotypes. 	Recent research has shown that the ACSL1 rs9997745 polymorphism influences the risk of metabolic disease, most likely via disturbances in FFA metabolism [16]; no individual or combined association was however found for other SNPs of this gene, i.e. rs4862417, rs13120078, rs12503643 and the one we studied here, rs6552828. 	A GWA study recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] on 324,611 SNPs identified a set of 21 SNPs accounting for 49% of the variance in the trainability of VO2max [3]. The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to ACSL1 rs6552828.

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	Further investigations are thus needed with other ethnic groups and populations as the one studied here, i.e. representing an important fraction of the total planet population. 	In summary, our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is marginally associated with male elite endurance status in Chinese (Han) population yet such association was not found in Chinese females or in a different (Caucasian) cohort. 	Our findings exemplify the need for further genetic association studies in the field of sport sciences to use at least two cohorts of a different ethnic background in order to increase the generalisability of their results.

PMC3598806	1YTZ,5TnC	Results	PDBe	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). 	Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied.
PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. 	Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. 	The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2].
PMC3689696	AY452039	Methods	ENA	For distance calculation the distance estimation method K3ST (Kimura’s three-substitution-types; [29]) was used. 	To construct cluster networks in form of rooted rectangular phylogrammes, the sequence AY452039 of Candida picachoensis CBS 9804T was used as outgroup. 	This species is close enough to the M. pulcherrima group [7] to have a D1/D2 sequence moderately related to the analysed sequences but far enough to be an uncontroversial outgroup. To generate neighbor-nets, Equal Angle setting was chosen and the sequence used as outgroup in cluster networks was excluded from the analysis, as its inclusion had little effect on the overall structure (the neighbor nets are unrooted networks) of the network and the layout of the network was improved by its exclusion.
PMC3689696	AJ745110,AF360542	Results	ENA	In the framed sequences the symbols of ambiguous nucleotides are highlighted with black colour. 	Comparison of the cloned sequences with the database D1/D2 sequences of the type strains (AJ745110 and AF360542) confirmed our hypothesis that the ambiguous nucleotides of the type strains could be due to heterogeneity of the PCR products used by the depositors for sequencing. 	It is evident from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3 that all their ambiguous nucleotides corresponded to sites variable in the clones and their ambiguity symbols (M, R, Y and N) were in agreement with the alternating nucleotides (A/C, A/G, C/T and any base, respectively). The Megablast search in GenBank with the cloned sequences did not identify identical sequences with the exception of fc21 of M. fructicola.

PMC3730352	AB065375	Introduction	ENA	For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. 	In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). 	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010).

PMC3791179	rs5743808	Table	RefSNP	No polymorphisms in TLR1 or TLR2 were associated with LD. 	A TLR6 polymorphism, 359T>C (rs5743808), was associated with an elevated risk of LD in genotypic and dominant (OR 5.83, p=7.9×10−5) models. 	The increased risk in persons with 359 TC or CC genotypes was further enhanced among smokers. In a multivariate model, 359T>C was associated with a higher risk of LD (OR 4.24, p=0.04), than any other variable, including age and smoking.
PMC3791179	rs3821985,rs3775073	Methods	RefSNP	We analyzed 14 candidate polymorphisms, 5 in TLR1, 3 in TLR2, and 6 in TLR6 in 98 cases and 268 controls. 	Two TLR6 SNPs (rs3821985 and rs3775073) had HWE p values ≤ 0.001 and were not analyzed further. 	Since TLR1 and TLR6 are contiguous genes on chromosome 4p14, we evaluated the linkage disequilibrium pattern for the 5 TLR1 and 4 TLR6 SNPs in the control population (Fig. 2). The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage.
PMC3791179	rs5743618	Results	RefSNP	The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage.

The frequency of a single TLR6 SNP, rs5743808 (359T>C), a nonsynonymous variant in the extracellular leucine rich repeat domain of the protein (encoding an isoleucine-to-threonine transition at amino acid residue 120), was greater in cases compared to controls (genotypic analysis: p= 7.9 ×10−5) (Table 2).

Two SNPs in TLR6 (rs3821985 and rs3775073) showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among control subjects (p<0.001) and were not further evaluated. 	The remaining twelve SNPs passed the HWE p value test (p≥0.001) and were assessed for association with LD, using a genotypic model in the first-pass analysis; those that had a significant association (p<0.05) were then investigated under dominant and recessive genetic models. In the dominant model, carriers of the less common allele (01 and 11 genotypes) were compared with homozygous subjects for the major allele (00 genotype).

For docking simulation, we used AutoDock4.2 program [31] which is the most commonly used because of its automated docking capability [12] among the many tools available for in silico protein-ligand docking. Because AutoDock program uses a grid-based method to allow rapid evaluation of the binding energy of trial conformations, we computed a grid box of the docking pocket on PPAR α/γ using the AutoGrid4 included in the Autodock4.2 program.

PMC3804621	KF152923	Results	ENA	To evaluate and compare the structure of the OitaAP2 gene with that of known AP2-like genes, the OitaAP2 locus was amplified from genomic DNA using multiple primer pairs. 	Sequence comparison of the OitaAP2 and OitaAP2_ISO cDNAs with the genomic sequence of the OitaAP2 locus (accession number KF152923) revealed the presence of 10 exons and 9 introns (Figure 1d). 	This gene structure appears conserved for the AP2 genes of Arabidopsis, grapevine [55] and apple [56], all of which constitute 10 exons and 9 introns. The twelve AP2-like genes of the orchid E. pusilla show an intron number ranging from 7 to 11; however, the specific structure of the EpAP2-11 gene, the putative ortholog of OitaAP2, is not reported [41].

Four functional polymorphisms (rs3821236, rs7574865, rs7574070, and rs897200) located within STAT4 gene as well as three independent polymorphisms (rs7517847, rs11209026, and rs1495965) located within IL23R were genotyped using TaqMan® allelic discrimination in a total of 206 patients with non-anterior uveitis and 1553 healthy controls from Spain. 	
PMC3843656	rs11209026	Introduction	RefSNP	Different studies have identified IL23R as a susceptibility factor associated to multiple inflammatory conditions [16,17,18]. 	In these studies several independent signals located within IL23R locus were suggested; however, only the R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism, whose minor allele plays a protective role for several autoimmune disease, appear to have a functional involvement [19,20]. 	Additionally, the rs1495965 polymorphism has been reported as the stronger IL23R association with Behçet’s disease (BD), a systemic autoimmune disease involving uveitis, in a previous combined meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [21,22]. On the other hand, STAT4 has been also identified as another shared susceptibility locus [23,24].

On the other hand, STAT4 has been also identified as another shared susceptibility locus [23,24]. Interestingly, the presence of two STAT4 independent functional genetic variants associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), both affecting the STAT4 levels, has been recently evidenced by fine mapping [25].
PMC3843656	rs3821236,rs7574865,rs11209026	Methods	RefSNP	Since the aim of this study was to investigate whether different STAT4/IL23R autoimmune disease-associated polymorphisms were also implicated in the susceptibility to develop non-anterior uveitis, the IL23R and STAT4 polymorphisms most robustly associated with autoimmunity were selected. 	Following this criterion, we studied the IL23R rs11209026 genetic variant, encoding the functional amino-acid change Arg381Gln [16,17,18,19,20], and two independent STAT4 SNPs (rs3821236 and rs7574865), influencing levels of the protein [23,24,25]. 	Additionally, two IL23R polymorphisms were analyzed; rs7517847, strongly associated with Crohn’s disease and whose association seems to be independent on rs11209026 [16], and, rs1495965, previously associated with BD by GWASs [21,22].

PMC3843656	rs3821236,rs7574865,rs897200	Methods	RefSNP	In this case, it is not likely that the lack of association was due to a type II error. 	Likewise, based on the statistical power of our study, an effect of the STAT4 rs897200 and rs7574070 genetic variants similar to that described for BD [26,27] could be discarded in non-anterior uveitis (Table 3 ). In relation to the STAT4 rs3821236 and rs7574865 polymorphisms, there was a higher heterogeneity in the reported ORs [36,37,38,39,40] (Table 3 ), with some autoimmune diseases showing considerably stronger signals than others (e.g. OR > 1.40 for SLE and 1.16 for RA). 	Therefore, no definitive conclusions on these STAT4 variants can be drawn. On the other hand, associations of these IL23R and STAT4 polymorphisms with systemic autoimmune diseases involving uveitis, such as Behçet’s disease, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease or sarcoidosis, have been described in Asian populations [21,22,26,27,41,42,43,44] but not in Europeans.
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), we identified rs17099451 in MMP8, using a single locus model, with a mean cross-validation of 87.0%. 	Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%. 	Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease.

Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. 	The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease. The main pathogenic mechanism of bronchial asthma involves a particular form of chronic inflammation, in which the increase in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the respiratory tract membrane and exfoliation of the respiratory epithelium cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, followed by airway remodeling.1 These pathological changes result from the interactions between the inflammatory mediators and the various cytokines produced by the infiltrated cells or the structural cells.2
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	In this study, we investigated whether any of 31 SNPs in genes encoding cytokines or monokines are associated with asthma development in a Japanese population. 	In a single locus model, we found that MMP8 rs17099451, and in a two-locus model, the combination of this rs17099451 in MMP8 SNP and rs44707 in ADAM33, as well as this MMP8 SNP and rs40401 IL-3, were selected as significant asthma development risk markers. 	The single locus model of the MMP8 was consistently selected, and the balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluation against the test data were superior in the single locus model compared with those in the two-locus model. In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model.
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	Furthermore, IL-3 is a cytokine produced by active T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, which stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.30 Moreover, IL-3 mRNA-expressing cells and IL-3 production are increased in asthma patients; this increase in IL-3 is independent of eosinophil number.31 Park et al.32 reported that one exonic SNP (in exon 1), IL3 + 79T > C (Ser27Pro) showed significant association with the risk of asthma and atopy. 	The Pro-allele had dominant, protective effects against the development of asthma in nonatopic subjects (p = -.002) and also showed significant association with the risk of atopy in normal control subjects (p = 0.007).32 We also found that rs40401 in IL-3 had the most significant effect in the 2 × 2 dominant model analysis, which suggests that the minor C allele may have a suppressing effect on asthma development. 	Van Eerdewegh et al. reported that ADAM33 on chromosome 20p13 was linked to asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, using a genomewide scan of 460 white families.9 The ADAM33 gene group appears to be related to proliferation, differentiation, or migration of fibroblasts, muscle fibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells, factors that are related to bronchial hyperresponsiveness or bronchial remodeling. However, these proteins do not appear to be involved in the respiratory epithelium, which is related to asthmatic immunologic or inflammatory components.9,33 Although a previous genomewide association study in a Japanese population did not implicate ADAM33 among the three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma,34 another study suggested the involvement of ADAM33 in the development of childhood asthma among the Japanese.35

The sequences obtained were compared with the reference sequence of COL6A1 gene (NM_001848.2) with Sequencer ver. 4.10.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). 	As a result, we found three variants of unknown significance; one homozygous intronic variant (c.588+19dupC), one heterozygous missense variant in the start of exon 11 (c.904G>A; p.Gly302Arg), and one homozygous silent variant (c.1095T>C; p.Gly365=). Of those variants, c.904G>A (p.Gly302Arg) was considered as a potential candidate for disease-causing mutation (Fig. 3).

Hypothetical Protein AF0060 (2P06) 	The 3D structure and ADM of the hypothetical protein AF0060 (2P06) are presented in Figure 6i and 6j.

The ADM predicts the almost whole region to be the compact region (3–83) as seen in Table 2. The Dali search hit portions corresponding to the G-H helices and a small portion of the corresponding E helix as the part with a 3D structure similar to the query structure (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material).
PMC4030988	1FSL	Introduction	PDBe	The configurations of the four helices corresponding to the E-to-H helix unit in the proteins obtained by the present method are illustrated in Figure 7. 	In particular, 1R8J and 1XL3 have the same helix configuration as the helices in 1FSL and 1MBN. 	However, the helix configuration in 2FM9 and 2NP5 is almost a mirror image of that in 1FSL. This is because the Dali search picks up a protein with a 3D structure similar to that of a query protein by comparing the inter-Cα distances, and thus a protein with a mirror image structure with a query can be hit.
PMC4030988	1XL3,2NP5,2P06	Results	PDBe	Focusing on the conservativeness of hydrophobic residues, that is, A, F, I, L, M, V, and W, we present the conserved hydrophobic residues in each protein in Figure 8, indicating the conserved residues with the mark “˅”. 	Conserved hydrophobic residues in the E-to-H helix unit of (a) 1FSL, (b) 1MBN, (c) 1R8J, (d) 1XL3, (e) 2FM9, (f) 2NP5, and (g) 2P06. 	The conserved residues are labeled with the mark “˅”. Any two residues with the same mark (one of the marks, #, %, ‡, †, ▲, ▼, ■, □, ○, ◊, and ∆) in different helices denote that this residue pair makes a hydrophobic packing detected by the buried surface.
PMC4030988	2FM9,2NP5,2P06	Results	PDBe	The residue with “*” actually does not form hydrophobic packing. 	For (e) 2FM9, (f) 2NP5 and (g) 2P06, a residue with a mark “+” indicates a residue pattern similar to one of the present common residue patters in Table 4. 	
PMC4030988	1XL3	Results	PDBe	Only 1of the 44 residues in these patterns, 267-R in 1R8J (a residue with the mark “*” in Figure 8), does not form hydrophobic packing. 	The packing of the residues constituting common residue patterns in the E-to-H helix unit in 1FSL, 1R8J and 1XL3 is presented in Figure 9a,c respectively. 	For 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06, the similar residue patterns are also inferred by visual inspection based on only the packing in Figure 8e,g. A residue in such a pattern in 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 is labeled by “+” in Figure 8e,g.
PMC4030988	2FM9	Results	PDBe	The packing of the residues constituting common residue patterns in the E-to-H helix unit in 1FSL, 1R8J and 1XL3 is presented in Figure 9a,c respectively. 	For 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06, the similar residue patterns are also inferred by visual inspection based on only the packing in Figure 8e,g. 	A residue in such a pattern in 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 is labeled by “+” in Figure 8e,g. These residue patterns are also summarized in Table 4.
PMC4030988	2P06	Results	PDBe	For 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06, the similar residue patterns are also inferred by visual inspection based on only the packing in Figure 8e,g. 	A residue in such a pattern in 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 is labeled by “+” in Figure 8e,g. 	These residue patterns are also summarized in Table 4. The residue patterns for 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 deviate somewhat from those in the four proteins discussed above.
PMC4030988	2P06	Results	PDBe	This is probably due to the different configurations of the E-to-H helix units [Figure 7b,c] compared with the helix configuration of the four proteins 1FSL, 1MBN, 1R8J, and 1XL3. 	Thus, the rule of common residue patterns cannot be applied strictly to 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 as presented in Table 4. 	The location of these residue patterns for 1R8J, 1XL3, 2FM9, 2NP5, and 2P06 correspond well to that for 1FSL. Figure S1 in Supplementary Material shows the amino acid sequence alignments based on the Dali algorithm of these proteins with 1FSL. In this figure, a residue with the mark “†” constitutes a common residue pattern.
PMC4030988	1R8J,1XL3	Results	PDBe	It might be possible to define a structural motif specific for E-to-H helix unit by sophisticating the present amino acid sequence patterns. 	The hydrophobic packing formed by residues of the common patterns in (a) 1FSL; (b) 1R8J and (c) 1XL3. 	For the other hit proteins with the Configurations B and C, only loosely defined common residue pattern are observed as seen in Table 4. Thus, proteins with Configurations B and C show the irregularity of the patterns.
PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search.
PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to identify the conserved residues across the E-to-H helix unit of each protein hit by the Dali search, homologous amino acid sequences of the helix unit were collected from the amino acid sequence database, UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/), by means of BLAST. 	The amino acid sequence of the E-to-H helix unit of a representative protein for each family as well as that of leghemoglobin (1FSL) were queried against the UniRef100 which is non-redundant set of the UniProt database. 	A threshold of the expected value of a BLAST search for a hit amino acid sequence retrieval was taken sufficiently low value, e = 0.001, to ensure that homologous sequences were obtained. We made a multiple alignment of the obtained amino acid sequences for each query protein using MUSCLE [30].

PMC4188009	2ei4	Figure	PDBe	Structural analysis was performed with CNS (Brünger et al., 1998 ▶), REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011 ▶) and XtalView (McRee, 1993 ▶). 	The structure of aR2 in the P321 crystal (PDB entry 2ei4) was used as an initial model. 	After rotational and translational searching with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 ▶), water and lipid molecules were added on the basis of the 2F o − F c map and the structure was refined by several cycles of simulated-annealing and individual B-factor refinements. The final refinement of the protein structure using REFMAC5 resulted in an R cryst of 21.4% and an R free of 23.4% (Table 1 ▶).
PMC4188009	1c3w	Figure	PDBe	It has been reported that the neutral purple form is destabilized in bR-containing vesicles reconstituted with egg lethicin, in which the transition from the neutral purple form into an inactive red form with λmax at 480 nm takes place at pH 6.5 (Nasuda-Kouyama et al., 1990 ▶). 	With respect to the protein structure in the P63 crystal, Glu194 OE2 in the structural model solved at 1.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 1c3w) has an unusually large B factor (62 Å2; Luecke et al., 1999 ▶). 	(The B factor of Glu199 OE2 of aR2 in the H32 crystal is 31 Å2.) It is possible that the conformation of Glu194bR in the P63 crystal represents a mixed state between the neutral purple form and the alkaline pink form. There is another caveat to the structural model of bR that was built using the P63 crystal.

PMC4208647	A23187	Results	ENA	MEG‐01 cells (2.0 × 105 cells) were incubated in a Krebs–Ringer solution that comprised 128 mmol/L NaCl, 1.9 mmol/L KCl, 1.2 mmol/L KH2PO4, 1.3 mmol/L MgSO4, 26 mmol/L NaHCO3, 2.4 mmol/L CaCl2, 10 mmol/L d‐glucose, 10 mmol/L 4‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐1‐piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)‐Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.2% BSA in the absence or presence of serial dilution of glyoxylate for 30 min at 37°C. 	The cells were incubated under low Ca2+ (0.2 mmol/L CaCl2, 3.8 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA) condition or stimulated by the addition of A23187 (Ca2+ ionophore) to a final concentration of 5 μmol/L at 37°C. 	After aliquots were taken at 20 min, the amount of ATP was measured by bioluminescence method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) based on luciferin–luciferase reaction with BLR‐101C Luminescence Reader (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). For ADP conversion into ATP, the following reaction buffer was added to ADP in Krebs–Ringer solution: 40 mmol/L Tricine (pH 7.75), 40 mmol/L magnesium sulfate, 10 mmol/L KCl, 40 μmol/L phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), and 40 U/mL pyruvate kinase (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
PMC4208647	A23187	Results	ENA	Then, we investigated whether VNUT gene expression is linked with the secretion of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells. 	Nucleotide secretion was triggered by the addition of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, since it causes entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell interior; the resultant rapid increase in Ca2+ facilitates exocytosis of secretory vesicles. 	As shown in Figure 4A, appreciable amounts of ATP and ADP were released from the cells in a time‐dependent fashion. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in the medium, no A23187‐dependent release of nucleotides was observed.

While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

AJ224005) with the 3′ LTR of spleen focus-forming virus and the leader of the murine embryonic stem cell virus [58, 59]. 	To generate retroviral producers, the Phoenix-gp packaging cell line was transfected with pSF91/eGFP or pSF91/DsRed, and a plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.

Complementary Raman spectra are also provided. Time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data have been measured from ∼90 mol% deuterated isotopologues of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O at 295 K to a resolution of sin (θ)/λ = 0.77 Å−1.
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	Since the incoherent neutron scattering cross section of 1H is large (80.3 barns) it is usual to prepare perdeuterated specimens whenever possible (the incoherent cross section of 2D being only 2.1 barns) as this optimises the coherent Bragg scattering signal above the background, reducing the counting times required for a high-precision structure refinement from many days to a matter of hours on the instrument used for these measurements. 	These data were therefore measured using Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O samples. 	The occurrence of polyhydrated forms of both Na2MoO4 and Na2WO4 suggests that both would be excellent candidates for the formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes with water-soluble organics, such as amino acids, producing metal-organic crystals with potentially useful optical properties (cf., glycine lithium molybdate; Fleck et al., 2006 ▸). High-pressure polymorphs of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O are indicated from Raman scattering studies (Luz-Lima et al., 2010 ▸; Saraiva et al., 2013 ▸).
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	The clusters corner-share via O6 to create a ‘slab’ parallel to (010) (Fig. 2 ▸ b). 	The mean Na—O bond lengths are statistically identical in Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O being ∼1.6% longer in the NaO6 octa­hedra and ∼2.3% shorter in the NaO5 polyhedra than Na—O bonds in the anhydrous crystals (Fortes, 2015 ▸). 	The agreement in Na—O bond lengths with the X-ray single crystal studies of Capitelli et al. (2006 ▸) and Farrugia (2007 ▸) is very good. Overall, the agreement in bond lengths and angles for the two independently refined data sets is excellent (Tables 1 ▸ and 2 ▸).

To reduce the impact of differences in sequencing depth and data quality, only the stable TADs shared by both Hi-C pipelines were used to calculate the reproducibility of parameter AP. Our result shows that the parameter AP is quite reproducible between two experimental pipelines (Supplementary Figure S6).

Figure 3 illustrates that TAD can undergo block split when comparing human cell lines GM12878-I with IMR90-I. 	Intuitively, the statistically significant chromatin interactions in cell line GM12878-I are more dispersedly distributed compared with those in cell line IMR90-I, which is accurately captured by interaction blocks and the parameter AP. Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90.

Gene expression studies reveal that Aldh1a3 and Foxn1 are expressed in ~E13.5 mouse embryonic brain, as well as in adult piriform cortex (PC; ~P30).

Furthermore, homozygous ALDH1A3 missense and nonsense mutations in humans have been linked to anophthalmia and microphthalmia (MIM: 615113; A/M) with some affected individuals also exhibiting autistic traits [18–23]. 	Though no clear evidence supports a link between variants in ALDH1A3 with autism, mouse studies show that lack of Aldh1a3 (Gene NC_000073.6) results in abnormal GABAergic neuronal differentiation in the forebrain basal ganglia [24]. Malfunctions in this inhibitory system have been found to be associated to mental disorders like ASD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [25,26].
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	OMIM	This overexpression has also been reported in ASD children [32]. 	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs).

Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well.
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	InterPro	The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. 	The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase MdPL1 in growing apple.72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. 	Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III.
PMC4591669	BG319625	Results	ENA	The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 	Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry (PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry.73 	In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Table S4).
PMC4591669	JU090722	Results	ENA	Notable contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 further included two putative transcription factors (an AP2 family member, Pa_00973 and an MYB family member, Pa_23194, best B2G hit MYB66), a putative (hemi)cellulase (Pa_10720) and a lipid transport protein (Pa_22556, best BG2 hit uncharacterized GPI-anchored protein). 	The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein, PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit.29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572.

Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. 	Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation.

It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY37687814) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase PcPEL1 from sour cherry73 (best hit of PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). 	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF.

The tridimensional model that was generated was used for a structural alignment with the HsNMNAT-1 model (PDB ID: 1KQO) (Zhou et al. 2002), which was generated from the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) database and registered on the PDB database (Bernstein et al. 1978). 	This process was performed using UCSF Chimera v.1.8 software (Pettersen et al. 2004). T. cruzi culture and DNA extraction - T. cruziepimastigotes were cultured at 27ºC in Schneider medium (Sigma S9895) that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (Gibco) (Baker & Price 1973, Miralles et al. 2002).

PMC4682451	120435	Introduction	OMIM	We propose that these variants may be pathogenic due to constitutional partial loss of MLH1 expression, and that this may be associated with intermediate penetrance of a Lynch syndrome phenotype. 	Lynch syndrome (MIM #120435) predisposes to the development of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers [Lynch and de la Chapelle, 2003]. 	It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually MLH1 (MIM #120436) or MSH2 (MIM #609309) [Lynch et al., 2009]. The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003].

In many cases, the functional and hence clinical significance of the sequence alterations, in particular single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) outside coding regions, is uncertain.
PMC4682451	164757	Methods	OMIM	The c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants studied in this manuscript have been submitted to the LOVD database at http://www.lovd.nl/MLH1. 	At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type BRAF (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). 	Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (Fig. 1). Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
PMC4682451	600259,600678	Methods	OMIM	Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 	No copy-number alterations were identified in any exons of the MLH1, PMS2 (MIM #600259), MSH2, and MSH6 (MIM #600678) genes in either proband. 	Sequence alterations across the MLH1 and PMS2 genes were further assessed using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing. No sequence alterations were detected in the MLH1 or PMS2 genes except for the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T heterozygous variants in the MLH1 5′UTR.
PMC4682451	138120	Methods	OMIM	M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. 	The promoter of the HSPA5 (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. 	GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region ≥150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI.
PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	OMIM	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

PMC4724163	KT594769	Results	ENA	The genome of MaHV-1 is the first metatherian herpesvirus to be sequenced. 	Excluding the genomic termini, which remained unresolved, the final genome length of MaHV-1 was approximately 140.1 kbp (Fig. 1) [GenBank:KT594769], larger than previously predicted. 	This difference appears to be due to a larger than predicted inverted repeat region [15]. This included a 98.8 kbp UL region and a 15.3 kbp US region flanked by 13 kbp inverted repeat sequences (IRS/TRS).
PMC4724163	BAP00706	Results	UniProt	Comparison of other viral core genes yielded similar clustering patterns.

This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials.
PMC4724163	SRP067309	Methods	ENA	Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina, Inc.) in paired-end 150 bp format. 	Over 350 Mbp of sequence data were obtained from 2.69 million paired reads with a mean length of 137 bp (standard deviation of 26.3) and were submitted to the Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP067309]. 	Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and de novo assembly was performed using medium-low default sensitivity settings on the bioinformatics package Geneious version 6.1.7 [37] (Biomatters Ltd). This yielded four large contigs (52.6 kbp, 37.3 kbp, 14.9 kbp and 17 kbp) with consensus sequences that corresponded to herpesvirus sequence, according to Blastx and Blastn searches of GenBank databases [38, 39].
PMC4724163	AY048539,AF188480	Methods	ENA	These consensus sequences were used as references in further assemblies, where reads were reiteratively mapped until there was no further contig extension. 	Previously published MaHV-1 genome sequence data [GenBank:AY048539, GenBank:AF188480] was used to aid scaffold construction. 	Medium and high sensitivity default settings with a minimum of 90–95 % overlap identity in Geneious version 6.1.7 were used in these assemblies. Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) using Glimmer3 was restricted to those larger than 240 bp, and ORF annotations were determined by Blastx and Blastn searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases, respectively [38, 39].

PMC4747093	Q9BX84	Discussion	UniProt	Both basic and pre-clinical studies show that the magnesium flux by TRP magnesium channels is highly related with tumor cell proliferation and cycle, angiogenesis, tumor growth and reprogramming, as well as metastasis [20]. 	The R1122Q mutation occurs at the topological domain of TRPM6 towards the cytoplasm, according to the Uniprot database annotation (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84). 	Thereby, dysfunction of the TRPM6 protein may affect the cation homeostasis leading to the tumor development.

As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	As indicated, the used search keywords were plant chemistry, plant pharmacology, plant natural product, plant compound, plant drug discovery, plant bioactivity, and the total number of PubMed publications per year was retrieved by search with the symbol *. The trend analysis reveals that the increase of PubMed citations in the target areas is faster than the increase in the total number of annual PubMed citations (indicated by the steeper slopes of the respective trend lines). 	(A) Two molecules of magnolol concomitantly occupying the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) are shown, with the chemical interaction pattern that defines the activity of the molecules depicted. 	Yellow spheres represent hydrophobic interactions, red and green arrows mark hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms. This interaction pattern may be converted into a structure-based pharmacophore model and used for virtual screening.

PMC4920148	135100	Introduction	OMIM	Furthermore, our study has also defined a pipeline of assays that will be useful for the evaluation of other pharmacological inhibitors of heterotopic ossification. 	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. 	The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously.

PMC4961654	137215	Introduction	OMIM	Most of GC cases are sporadic and hereditary cases account for only 1–3 % of GCs, this includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (Monahan and Hopkins 2016). 	HDGC (OMIM #137215) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. 	Between 25 and 30 % of cases of HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). This gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007).

Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].

PMC5296949	NCT01692756	Conclusion	NCT	Corticosteroids have previously been demonstrated to reduce early OA changes such as osteophyte formation and cartilage lesion in a canine OA model [54] and to reduce cartilage degradation when administered early after anterior cruciate ligament injury in a porcine model [55]; however, they do not entirely halt disease progression. 	Clinical trials are currently underway to examine the effect of intra-articular administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid on pain, joint function, inflammation, and cartilage degradation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01692756). 	Anti-cytokine, anti-MMP therapies, and anti-S100A8/A9 therapies are promising candidates for new disease-modifying OA drugs. However, preventing the expression and/or release of degradative mediators rather than inhibiting their activity may prove more efficient.

Moreover, the mtDNA of Lottia digitalis (GenBank Accession Number NC_007782) turned out to be very fast-evolving and very prone to create LBA artifacts, therefore this taxon was excluded from the study, thus lowering the number of ingroups to 109. 	Being Lottia the only known representative of the clade with a published complete mtDNA, unfortunately this also led to the exclusion of the whole Patellogastropoda from our analysis. The ML analysis was extensively described elsewhere (see, in particular, see supplementary Additional file S4, Supplementary Material online of Plazzi et al. 2016).

In the present study, we analyzed microarray data of breast cancer expression profiling (NCBI GEO database, accession GSE65194), focusing on Na +/K +-ATPase coding genes. 	We found overexpression of the ATP1A1 and down-regulation of the ATP1A2. We expect that our research could help to improve the understanding of predictive and prognostic features of breast cancer.

In the present study, we analyzed public breast cancer expression profiles made using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (NCBI GEO database 20, accession GSE65194) for the expression of alpha subunits of NKA. 	We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05).

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	A multiple linear regression model was used to assess associations between the genetic risk score, single SNPs, and the five inflammatory biomarkers. 	The minor allele (G) (CAD risk allele) of rs2075650 (TOMM40/APOE) was associated with lower levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (effect per risk allele: -0.37 mg/l [95%CI -0.56 to -0.18 mg/l]). 	The inflammatory markers tested showed no association with the remaining 44 SNPs or with the genetic risk score.

Of these, a nominally significant association was observed for rs1561198 (VAMP5/VAMP8) with IL-6 and calprotectin; rs17609940 (ANKS1A) with C3; rs2075650 (TOMM40, APOE) with hs-CRP and IL-6; rs264 (LPL) with C3; and finally rs599839 (SORT1) with fibrinogen. 	Only the association between rs2075650 and hs-CRP met the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of significance. The rs2075650 locus is displayed in Fig 1.

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	In the present study of patients with established CAD, we investigated the association between 45 lead SNPs from loci associated with CAD and five common biochemical markers of inflammation. 	The main findings were; 1) for SNP rs2075650 in the TOMM40, APOE locus, the established CAD-risk allele was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP levels, 2) No other CAD-related SNPs were associated with the inflammatory marker levels, either measured as individual SNPs or when combined into a GRS. 	Previous GWASs have demonstrated a robust association between the rs2075650 G-allele and an increased risk of CAD [11]. In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19].
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19]. 	Considering the well-established relationship between increasing levels of hs-CRP and adverse cardiovascular outcome [20], it may be surprising that the CAD risk allele of rs2075650 was associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in our sample. 	However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies. In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21].
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	The mechanistic explanation for this inverse association is currently unknown. 	The marker rs2075650 is located in the TOMM40 gene, just upstream of APOE, and APOC1. 	The CAD risk allele (G) has been associated with a range of other phenotypes including reduced longevity [24], reduced BMI [25], increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [22,26], and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [27]. Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene.

Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene. 	The APOE encodes the apolipoprotein E with three different isoforms (ε2, ε3, and ε4 defined by the combination of rs7412 and rs429358. Northwestern European ancestry (CEU): r2 = 0.02 and r2 = 0.20 with rs2075650, respectively), of which the ε4 isoform has long been known to associate with LDL-C, Alzheimer’s disease, and hs-CRP [28,29].

However, recent data suggest that the TOMM40/APOE locus is genetically complex [30], and therefore it is plausible that the G-allele is tagging different underlying causal variants with different effects on CAD risk and hs-CRP, a concept supported by Middleberg et al [22]. This would also be in line with the current understanding that hs-CRP is not causally related to cardiovascular risk [31].
PMC5501546	rs4129267,rs4845625	Conclusion	RefSNP	Some previous GWASs have explored the association between CAD-associated risk variants and common inflammatory markers, of which the IL6R locus has been associated with several. 	In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. 	Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response.

A large study from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology) consortium demonstrated a significant association between fibrinogen and variants near LIPA (rs2250644) and SH2B3 (rs7310615) [36]. 	Although these variants are in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs genotyped in our study (CEU: r2 = 1.00 for both), we did not find evidence of such association. Other GWASs have also demonstrated weak associations between variants at the AB0 locus (rs657152 and rs8176704; CEU: r2 = 0.46 and r2 = 0.02 with rs495828) and IL-6 [34,37], and a Chinese GWAS of C3 found an association with rs11575839 close to HLA-C (CEU: r2 = 0.02 with rs3869109) [38].

We were not able to confirm any of these associations. Importantly, our study was not powered to detect very small effect sizes.
PMC5501546	rs1561198	Discussion	RefSNP	To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the association between calprotectin and CAD-associated risk variants. 	Although none of the CAD-associated variants significantly affected calprotectin levels, a trend was observed for rs1561198. 	This SNP is located between the VAMP5 and VAMP8 genes, whose products are involved in different aspects of vesicle trafficking including cytokine release and phagocytosis [43]. Hence, a link between this locus and calprotectin levels may plausibly exist.
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	Moreover, we performed the statistical analyses assuming additive genetic effects of the risk alleles. 	In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3.

PMC5520553	rs776746	Results	RefSNP	Tacrolimus is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoenzymes.[7] A cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) gene variation involving an A-to-G transition at position rs776746 within intron 3 was significantly associated with CYP3A5 expression. 	Tacrolimus is poorly metabolized in CYP3A5 rs776746 GG carriers.[8] However, the effects of CYP3A5 rs776746 do not explain the total individual differences in tacrolimus metabolism. 	Therefore, additional markers can play a role in individual variation.

PMC5520553	rs776746	Discussion	RefSNP	In the current study, researchers investigated the associations of CYP3A5, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-18 genetic polymorphisms with tacrolimus metabolism.[456] Based on our findings, we propose the existence of a gene interaction network that affects tacrolimus pharmacogenomics in patients with HCC after OLT. 	Thus, we hypothesized that CYP3A5 rs776746 polymorphisms play a key role in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics although donor CYP3A5 polymorphisms have a more significant influence.[19] A limited number of clinical markers have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.[20] However, these markers or genetic polymorphisms do not account for all the observed variations. 	Interestingly, in this study, variations in tacrolimus C/D ratios among individual patients were partially correlated with C6 polymorphisms. Recipients of liver grafts are known to be at increased risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), immunological injury, and drug toxicity during the posttransplantation period.
PMC5520553	rs10052999,rs9200	Discussion	RefSNP	The complement system is involved in several cytolytic activities.

Hence, C6 may play a decisive role in hepatocyte function in patients with HCC undergoing OLT. Complement mediates hepatic injury and regeneration, as well as cancer immune surveillance.
PMC5520553	rs10052999,rs9200	Discussion	RefSNP	In conclusion, patients with OLT for HCC require different therapeutic regimens compared with patients with etiologically distinct liver disease.

Further, this study confirmed the association of CYP3A5 rs776746 SNPs with tacrolimus C/D ratios. The combination of C6 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms exerted a greater effect on tacrolimus metabolism than individual SNPs and developed better equations that described the association between genotype and tacrolimus metabolism.

PMC5539595	KT716847	Discussion	ENA	Recurrently identified in our population, subtype IIdA17G1, was reported to be the cause of an outbreak in Finland in 2012, with more than 250 individuals involved and it was associated with consumption of fries and salads (Cacciò and Chalmers, 2016), whereas subtype IIdA18G1 has been widely identified in Europe (e.g., Czech Republic, Spain) and in the Middle East (e.g., Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, etc.). 	Less frequently observed, subtype IIdA19G2 has been detected in France as a foodborne etiological agent (GenBank number KT716847.1), IIdA14G1 in Spain (Plutzer and Karanis, 2009), and IIdA16G1 in Egypt and Tunisia (Rahmouni et al., 2014). C. meleagridis, mainly isolated from poultry and birds, has been frequently observed in Africa (Aldeyarbi et al., 2016) as well as within mixed cryptosporidium infections (Ng-Hublin et al., 2013). 	Although, as stated earlier, Qatari children have limited contact with wildlife, such animal subtypes may infect them indirectly through housemaids who themselves may have been exposed to animals back home and/or through their presence in the food supply via remnants of fertilizers of animal origin on salad crops.

To exclude possible endogenous viruses, all virus assemblies were blasted against the I. ricinus reference genome (GCA_000973045.2). 	Finally, to assess mean sequence depth and relative frequency, the quality trimmed libraries were mapped back against all viral assemblies and the COX11 mitochondrial gene of I. ricinus (KF197136.1) using Bowtie2 v.2.2.831. Following previous studies1 we assume that a higher relative frequency suggests that the virus is more likely to be associated with ticks (rather than being a component of diet or environment).

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Results	RefSNP	We aimed to investigate whether genetic variations in glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor are associated with responses to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. 	Genetic variations of rs3765467 in GLP-1 receptor were explored in 246 patients with type 2 diabetes who received DPP-4 inhibitors treatment for 24 weeks in addition to previous medication. 	Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7% and who were naive to any DPP-4 inhibitors were enrolled. Responders were defined as those who showed a > 10% reduction in HbA1c after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	In fact, 6-month DPP-4 inhibitor treatment elevated insulin secretion and decreased postprandial glucagon-to-insulin ratio in a clinical study.[3] Additionally, DPP-4 inhibitors also involve a low risk of hypoglycemia.[4] Although safety concerns for acute pancreatitis and DPP-4 inhibitor use are controversial, a population-based case-control study showed that incretin-based therapy did not increase acute pancreatitis risk.[5] 	Previously, it was reported that the rs3765467 variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene (GLP1R) was associated with insulin secretory response to exogenous GLP-1 in nondiabetic subjects.[13] Therefore, we investigated whether this same variation in GLP1R could affect T2DM patients’ responses to DPP-4 inhibitors. 	
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Results	RefSNP	Genotype frequencies were tested for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium using the chi-square test. 	Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess independent associations between patient's responses to DPP-4 inhibitors (dependent variable) and rs3765467 (independent variable), including covariates. 	Results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Given that triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values were not normally distributed, statistical analyses of these values were conducted on log-transformed data.

G was the major allele, whereas A was the minor allele in this group. The genotype distribution did not deviated from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.939).
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Results	RefSNP	Effect of GLP1R genetic variation according to the baseline blood glucose level 	As baseline HbA1c could influence the response to DPP-4 inhibitors, we stratified the subjects according to the median value of basal HbA1c (8.0%) and rs3765467 genotype. 	Proportion of DPP-4 inhibitor responders increased stepwise among the 4 groups, with the highest response rate shown in subjects with higher baseline HbA1c and GA/AA genotype (91.2%, P < 0.001 for trend, Fig. 1A), as well as A allele (89.2%, P < 0.001 for trend, Fig. 1B). Moreover, response rates to DPP-4 inhibitor in patients with higher baseline HbA1c (> 8%) were determined by rs3765467 variation (P = 0.005 for GA/AA genotype and 0.017 for A allele).
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	Moreover, response rates to DPP-4 inhibitor in patients with higher baseline HbA1c (> 8%) were determined by rs3765467 variation (P = 0.005 for GA/AA genotype and 0.017 for A allele).

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	Many investigators have found the concepts of genetic variation and antidiabetic medication efficacy to be quite attractive. 	For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.[6–8,20,21] Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.[22] Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467. 	
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 	In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%. 	The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue.
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. 	However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. 	Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study.

PMC5737465	PRJNA275635	Methods	BioProject	Population Genomic Data Processing 	We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single C. grandiflora population, generated by Josephs et al. (2015) (NCBI accession number PRJNA275635, ID: 275635). 	We trimmed the paired-end 100-bp raw reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014), and randomly subsampled reads of each individual to a total of 54 million reads per sample (average coverage 25×) to avoid an overrepresentation of individual samples with high coverage. We mapped the trimmed reads to a TE-merged reference with bwa bwasw 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin 2009), as recommended before analyses with PoPoolationTE2 (Kofler et al. 2016).
PMC5737465	PRJNA212731	Methods	BioProject	C. rubella was derived from a C. grandiflora-like outcrossing ancestor fairly recently, most likely <200,000 years ago (Foxe et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2009; Brandvain et al. 2013; Slotte et al. 2013), and it is the best available model for inferring such information. 	Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs.

M(NLS-88R)-neutral occurs as physiological monomers similar to wt-M1 structure 1EA3 (also crystallized at neutral pH),12 and are arranged loosely in a so-called ‘face-to-back’ orientation with each other in the cell (Figure 1A).

All three M(NLS-88E)-acidic monomers superposed on each other with a r.m.s.d. of ~0.5 Å. However, least-squares superposition of the two M(NLS-88E)-acidic independent dimers 1 and 2 resulted in a very large r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å (see Supplementary Table S2 in the Supplementary Material), indicating that the two dimers of M(NLS-88E)-acidic show significantly different dimer arrangements.
PMC5750462	1AA7	Discussion	PDBe	A few dimer interface hydrogen-bond interactions (Asn85 to Arg134 and X88 to Tyr100) are conserved, whereas the rest of the contacts are mostly unique to each structure (Figure 1F; see Supplementary Table S3), highlighting the differences in the relative monomer–monomer arrangement of different dimers. 	The analyses indicated that M(NLS-88R)-acidic (dimers 1 and 2) had a very similar dimeric arrangement as wt-M1 1AA7 structure (r.m.s.d. of 0.6 Å screw rotation angle of 2°, Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S2). 	However, M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer differs significantly from wt-M1 1AA7 or M(NLS-88R)-acidic (r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å screw rotation angle of ~17°, Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S2). Dimer 1 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is more like M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer (r.m.s.d. of ~0.6 Å screw rotation angle of ~8°, see Supplementary Table S2), but not its dimer 2 (r.m.s.d. of ~0.6 Å screw rotation angle of ~15°, see Supplementary Table S2).
PMC5750462	1AA7,1EA3	Discussion	PDBe	When compared to the M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer interface, the positively charged Lys104 side-chain in M(NLS-88R)-acidic has reoriented to avoid close contact with the positively charged opposing Arg88 (Figures 1F and 2). 	When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure. This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation.
PMC5750462	1EA3	Discussion	PDBe	This additional inter-subunit interaction may explain why it took longer for M(NLS-88R) M1 to disintegrate in vitro at pH 5.5 than wt-M1, as the fulcrum of M(NLS-88R)-acidic was relatively difficult to break during the dimer interface rotation. 	The G88R mutation also results in two additional inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds (Lys104-NZ to Glu29-OE2 and Arg134-NE to Glu29-OE1) in M(NLS-88R)-neutral (see Supplementary Table S3) that make the subunit rotation slightly difficult than similarly face-to-back-oriented wt-M1 neutral structure 1EA3. 	This may explain why a lower pH was needed to soften the M1 layer in assembled M(NLS-88R) virions than in WSN particles. Nevertheless, M(NLS-88R) M1 retains pH-dependent conformational transition like WSN.

PMC5766183	1na6,3zi5,2c1l,4crt,4ldx,4ldu,1wid,1yel	Results	PDBe	The overall fold of the domain belongs to SCOP double-split β -barrel fold, DNA binding pseudobarrel domain superfamily (21). 	The structure of the UbaLAI-N domain is similar to the DNA recognition domains of restriction endonucleases EcoRII (PDB ID 1na6, DALI Z-score 10.6, Figure 4B), BfiI (3zi5, 10.0), 2c1l and NgoAVII (4crt, 5.3), and to B3 domains of plant transcription factors, including auxin response factors 1 (4ldx, 9.4) and 5 (4ldu, 9.3), DNA binding domain of RAV1 (1wid, 6.3), and hypothetical A. thaliana protein AT1G16640 (1yel, 6.0). 	DNA recognition by UbaLAI-N UbaLAI-N interacts with its pseudo-symmetric recognition sequence 5′-CCWGG-3′ asymmetrically (Figure 4), forming different contacts with the ‘T’ strand (the DNA strand containing a T at the central position of the recognition sequence) and the ‘A’ strand (the DNA strand with central A, Figure 4C).
PMC5766183	4mut	Results	PDBe	EMSA experiments revealed that the E89A+R91A mutant of the UbaLAI-N domain retained residual DNA binding ability (KD for specific DNA is approx. 200 nM, or 5000-fold lower than observed with wt UbaLAI-N, Supplementary Figure S5A and D). 	To generate an UbaLAI variant with a completely disabled N-domain, we have introduced two additional mutations, R37A and H38A, thereby generating a quadruple (R37A + H38A + E89A + R91A) mutant of the full-length UbaLAI (henceforth referred to as UbaLAI-4mut), and a corresponding variant of the UbaLAI-N domain. 	EMSA experiments with the quadruple UbaLAI-N mutant confirmed complete loss of its specific DNA binding ability (Supplementary Figure S5E). DNA binding by the full-length UbaLAI-2mut and UbaLAI-4mut proteins was investigated by a standard gel-shift assay.
PMC5766183	3hqf	Discussion	PDBe	We show here that Type IIE enzymes UbaLAI and EcoRII use similar N-terminal effector domains specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ sequence. 	Despite the fact that UbaLAI-N and EcoRII-N domains share only 18% sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1C), their overall structures are very similar (Figure 4B): 134 of 173 residues of the EcoRII N-terminal domain (3hqf) could be aligned with UbaLAI-N with r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (DALI server (22)). 	The loops of the N-arms adopt slightly different conformations in both domains; the C-arms overlay better, but the loop between the strands in the C-arm of UbaLAI-N is shorter (Supplementary Figure S6). Both domains make identical contacts with the central T0:A0 base pairs employing overlaying residues (Figure 4D and E, Supplementary Figure S6).
PMC5766183	2reu,4pxg	Discussion	PDBe	According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). 	Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

All SHs have unique, individual digital object identifiers (DOIs; https://www.doi.org/) for unambiguous reference across time and scientific studies (e.g., 10.15156/BIO/SH216455.07FU which resolves to http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/SH216455.07FU). 	UNITE recently received an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant to improve the support within the database for handling, processing, and characterising the mycobiome from the built environment (the built mycobiome). Several actions have been taken towards that goal, including a workshop to annotate all extant built-environment fungal ITS sequences according to the MIxS-BE annotation standard (Glass et al. 2014; Abarenkov et al. 2016).

PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	NCT	4SC‐202 inhibits canonical HH/GLI signaling in murine and human HH‐responsive cells 	4SC‐202 is a novel small‐molecule inhibitor selectively targeting class I HDACs 1/2/3 and the lysine‐specific demethylase LSD1.17 Notably, 4SC‐202 has shown excellent safety and promising anti‐leukemic activity in a recent phase I clinical trial (see TOPAS study at clinicaltrials.gov trial no. NCT01344707 and J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	To analyze whether 4SC‐202 affects HH/GLI signaling, we first treated Sonic Hh stimulated murine Hh/Gli luciferase reporter cells with 4SC‐202 and found that 4SC‐202 strongly repressed Gli activity with an IC50 of ∼50 nM (Fig. 1 a).
PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	NCT	Intriguingly, analysis of the genetic landscape of SHH subgroup medulloblastoma identified frequent somatic alterations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.25 In light of these findings, our data together with the previous studies by the Canettieri group may provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and guide possible new therapeutic approaches. 	The clinical relevance of our findings is further underlined by a recent phase I clinical trial with 4SC‐202, where 18 out of 24 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies went into follow up treatment, one patient showed complete response and remained on study medication for >28 months, while another patient had a partial response over a period of 8 months (Clinical trial: NCT01344707, poster J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	Although it is unclear whether the promising clinical response to 4SC‐202 treatment was due to inhibition of GLI activity, the results of the present study warrant further clinical evaluation of 4SC‐202 as a treatment for GLI‐dependent cancers including BCC, medulloblastoma and possibly other malignancies with high medical need.

PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	However, rs10033464 (4q25, PITX2) displayed a risk estimate in the opposite direction than had been previously reported by others. 	This discrepancy appears to be in part due to linkage disequilibrium between this marker and the nearby SNP with the strongest association in this gene, rs2200733 (p = 0.005). 	We and others have observed that the risk alleles at these markers are negatively associated with each other. There remains uncertainty in the optimal genetic risk model for AF, and superior models will certainly evolve in the future as more genetic discoveries are made.
PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	In this light, we also considered a modified AF GRS that included only the most strongly associated SNP in each gene—which is a common solution in GRS estimation to eliminate confounding due to linkage disequilibrium [32]. 	The resulting 9-SNP model included rs2200733 for PITX2 and the other 8 SNPs from the other genes. 	The risk of AF with this modified AF GRS, as in the 12-SNP model, was greater for the highest AF GRS quintile than for the lowest AF GRS quintile (OR 5.07; 95% CI 2.04–12.60; p < 0.001), and this model appeared to better differentiate risk of AF throughout the distribution of genetic risk (S3 Table). As expected, the risk estimates derived for both AF GRS models remained significant in an analysis limited to participants who self-reported as white (S4 Table).

PMC5893785	NCT00297193	Introduction	NCT	Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. 	Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). 	This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17). Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17).

PMC6155776	4NNI	Introduction	PDBe	However, there are limitations that make them inapplicable for our compounds. 	The complex of POA bound to the ribosomal protein S1 (involved in trans-translation process) was resolved (pdb: 4NNI). 	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24].

Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA. The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA.

PMC6243512	rs2066842	Discussion	RefSNP	Environmental carcinogens and NOD-induced proinflammatory cytokines could be possible reasons by which the studied polymorphisms may increase the risk for gastric cancer [9]. 	A meta-analysis evaluated several NOD2 polymorphisms such as rs2066842 C/T, rs2066844 C/T, rs2066845 C/G, rs2066847, L1007fsinsC and risk of cancer. 	The NOD2 rs2066844 C/T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer for individuals bearing TT or CT genotype compared to individuals with CC genotype. The subgroup of analysis revealed that TT+CT genotype was associated with high risk of colorectal cancer, but there was no important association with the development of gastric cancer.

Other important findings by our group include the identification of a 9996-bp resistance island that has recently been described in other A. baumannii strains [e.g., AR0101 (GenBank CP027611.1), 11510 (Graña-Miraglia et al., 2017), AF401 (GenBank NZ_CP018254.1), AbH120-A2 (Merino et al., 2014), and AB030 (Loewen et al., 2014)]. 	The blaOXA-23 gene has been considered an important resistance biomarker and is located in either the plasmid or chromosome and is highly prevalent (Mugnier et al., 2010; Opazo et al., 2012; Evans and Amyes, 2014; Luo T.L. et al., 2015). MLST analyses have identified several clonal complexes, groupings of unique genotypes that share at least five loci, and these genotypes have diversified and increased their frequency in the population.

For the interaction with maternal ETS, a 2-SNP haplotype and two 3-SNP haplotypes showed significant interactions with ETS after Bonferroni correction, with T-A-G for rs541731-rs9531050-rs9545409 showing the lowest p-value (p-value = 9.18 × 10−5). Table 2 presents the results of the interaction analysis. 	
PMC6406689	rs541731,rs9669948	Discussion	RefSNP	Considering the higher statistical power of haplotype analysis compared to individual SNP analysis when LD was exploited to explore genes associated with diseases, we conducted the haplotype analysis and haplotype—environment interaction analysis to further investigate the roles of SPRY genes in Chinese NSCL/P. 	The results of haplotype analysis altogether indicated that one genetic segment (rs541731- rs9669948, from 80345577 to 80372188) located at 4.5 kb—31.1 kb downstream of SPRY2 was associated with NSCL/P, indicating that the neighborhood region of this segment might contain causal variants. 	Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies.
PMC6406689	rs541731,rs496932,rs9545412,rs9669948	Discussion	RefSNP	Although statistical interactions do not always guarantee biological interaction, evidence about the biological function of SPRY2 [21,29,30] and the signals in the single haplotype analysis might together support a biological interaction. 	Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P.
