<italic>res</italic> recombination promoted by wild-type resolvase. Activated variants have reduced topological selectivity and no longer require the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface between subunits that is essential for wild-type resolvase-mediated recombination. They also promote formation of a stable synapse comprising a resolvase tetramer and two copies of site I. Cleavage of the DNA strands by the activated mutants is slow relative to the rate of synapsis. Stable resolvase tetramers were not detected in the absence of DNA or bound to a single site I. Our results lead us to conclude that the synapse is assembled by sequential binding of resolvase monomers to site I followed by interaction of two site I-dimer complexes. We discuss the implications of our results for the mechanisms of synapsis and regulation in recombination by wild-type resolvase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Site-specific recombinases promote controlled rearrangements of DNA sequences, by binding, cutting and rejoining the DNA strands at sites that they recognize. The capacity of site-specific recombinases to bring about insertion or excision of defined DNA segments has led to their widespread application in experimental genetics and biotechnology, with further potential uses in gene therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Members of one large family of these enzymes, the serine recombinases, have biological functions that include bacteriophage integration and excision, switching of bacterial gene expression by DNA inversion and transposon cointegrate resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Much of our understanding of the mechanisms of serine recombinases has come from studies on the closely related cointegrate resolvases from the bacterial transposons Tn<italic>3</italic> and &#x003b3;&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Tn<italic>3</italic> (or &#x003b3;&#x003b4;) resolvase catalyses recombination between two 114 bp <italic>res</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Each <italic>res</italic> site contains binding sites for three resolvase dimers. The DNA strands are broken and rejoined at specific bonds near the centre of the 28 bp binding site I; catalysis of these reactions is by the subunits bound to site I. The &#x02018;accessory&#x02019; binding sites II (34 bp) and III (25 bp) are also required for recombination. Resolvase dimers bound to sites II and III do not participate in the catalysis of strand cleavage and rejoining, but have an essential role in assembly of the synaptic complex (&#x02018;synapse&#x02019;) of two <italic>res</italic> sites that is a prerequisite for strand exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and C). The synapse has regulatory functions which include restriction of recombination to pairs of <italic>res</italic> sites that are in the same orientation in a supercoiled DNA molecule, specification of a single round of recombination and specification of the 2-noded catenane recombinant product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).

(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustrating synapsis and strand exchange of a supercoiled substrate by wild-type and activated resolvase mutants. The two sites (<italic>res</italic> or site I) are indicated by arrowheads. Synapsis of two <italic>res</italic> sites in head-to-tail orientation by wild-type resolvase traps three topological nodes (shaded oval), and strand exchange results in a 2-noded catenane resolution product. Activated mutant resolvases can synapse sites by random collision, giving rise to products of variable topologies; in the example shown, a 5-noded knot inversion product.

The C-terminal domains (&#x0223c;45 amino acids) of resolvase dimers make sequence-specific interactions with the DNA at each end of binding sites I, II and III in <italic>res</italic>. The N-terminal domain contains the active site for catalysis of strand exchange, and all known interactions between subunits involve residues of this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The structure of the N-terminal domain of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase, solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9">6&#x02013;9</xref>), revealed two important types of interaction between subunits. The 1&#x02013;2 or dimer interface mediates dimerization of resolvase in solution and when bound to DNA. The 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface connects dimers; it has essential functions for wild-type resolvase in assembly of the synapse of two <italic>res</italic> sites and in activation of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The 1&#x02013;2 dimer is present in a structure of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase bound to site I DNA (11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), but the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interaction has not yet been observed in X-ray structures of complexes containing DNA.

The hydroxyl group of S10 is the catalytic nucleophile in recombination. The sidechains of R2 and E56 contribute to the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface (see Introduction section).

Certain combinations of activating mutations are more effective than any single mutations, and one double mutant (D102Y E124Q) was shown to have site I &#x000d7; site I recombination activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The activating mutations affect residues at or close to surfaces involved in subunit interactions, in particular the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). One group of these residues is near the N-terminus of the long E-helix which lies on the dimer interface, and comprises G101, D102, M103 and Q105. M103 is the first residue of the E-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Variants with combinations of activating mutations at these positions have high site I &#x000d7; site I activity in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and have been used in recent analysis of the structures of recombination intermediates. Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) demonstrated the formation of a &#x02018;crossover site synapse&#x02019; (herein referred to as a &#x02018;site I synapse&#x02019;) in which two copies of site I are held together by a tetramer of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase with several activating mutations. The low-resolution structure of a site I synapse containing similar Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase mutants was solved by small-angle scattering combined with other biophysical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and structures of site I synapses with cleaved DNA strands have been solved by X-ray crystallography (16,17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). In these structures, the site I DNA is on the outside of a tetrameric core of the resolvase catalytic domains. How the activating mutations promote the formation of the site I synapse remains unclear (see Discussion section). The conformation of the resolvase subunits in the crystallographic site I synapse is substantially different from that seen in earlier structures; the dimer interface has been radically altered, resulting in a flat hydrophobic interface between pairs of subunits in the tetramer. Strand exchange by resolvase is proposed to involve a relative rotation of the components of the cleaved site I synapse about this flat interface [16; reviewed by Grindley <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>)].</p><p>Deregulation of recombination by &#x02018;activating&#x02019; mutations has been observed in other members of the serine recombinase family, including Sin resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the DNA invertases Cin, Gin and Hin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22">20&#x02013;22</xref>) and the bacteriophage &#x003c6;C31 integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These activated recombinase variants have potential uses as tools for genetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Chimaeric recombinases comprising activated serine recombinase catalytic domains attached to zinc finger DNA recognition domains can promote recombination at sites recognized by the zinc finger domains, and might allow natural genomic sequences to be chosen as targets for insertions or deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>Despite the substantial interest in highly activated resolvase mutants, their functional properties <italic>in vitro</italic> have not yet been reported in any detail. Here, we describe the <italic>in vitro</italic> properties of a number of these mutants, focusing on a set of variants with mutations near the N-terminus of the E-helix, which have particularly striking-activating effects. We show that site I &#x000d7; site I cleavage and recombination by these mutants can be fast and efficient. The mutants have lost the strong topological selectivity of wild-type resolvase to varying extents, and make products via a random collision synapsis pathway. Increased site I &#x000d7; site I activity is correlated with increased stability of a site I synapse, formation of which is much faster than the subsequent DNA cleavage and strand exchange steps of the recombination reaction. We show that one very active resolvase variant is predominantly monomeric in solution, whereas it forms a stable tetramer within the site I synapse. Our results are consistent with synapsis by docking of two site I-bound dimers. The site I synapse component of the wild-type <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> synaptic complex might be formed by a similar pathway, promoted by contacts between resolvase subunits at site I and the accessory sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The pBR322 derivatives pMA21 and pAL225 contain two copies of Tn<italic>3 res</italic> and site I, respectively [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>)].

The final concentration of resolvase was 200 nM, and reactions were at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h, unless stated otherwise. Assays of resolvase-mediated DNA cleavage were similar except that the plasmid DNA was in &#x02018;EG buffer&#x02019; [50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 8.2), 0.1 mM EDTA, 40% v/v ethylene glycol]. Reactions were terminated by heating at 70&#x000b0;C for 5 min, or by adding loading buffer (for cleavage assays). The products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis (after digestion with restriction enzymes or DNase I if required). Loading buffer [50% v/v glycerol, 100 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 1 mg/ml protease K, 0.5 mg/ml bromophenol blue] was added (25% of the sample volume) prior to loading on the gel. Gels were 1.2% (or 0.7% for nicked samples) agarose, in TAE buffer [40 mM Tris&#x02013;acetate (pH 8.2), 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA], and were run horizontally in TAE buffer at &#x0223c;3 V/cm.

Gels were pre-run for 30 min at 200 V and 4&#x000b0;C. Samples were then loaded and the gels were run for a further 3 h at 200 V under the same conditions, without buffer recirculation. Gels were dried, and bands were visualized by phosphorimaging or autoradiography. To observe products containing resolvase&#x02013;DNA covalent linkages, binding assay mixtures were treated with 0.1% SDS for 30 min, then loaded on gels as described above, except that the buffer was TBE plus 0.1% SDS.

No single mutant promotes efficient recombination of a site I &#x000d7; site I substrate, but several multiple mutants do so [as was first shown for D102Y E124Q by Arnold <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>)]. Whereas some combinations of activating mutations elicit high site I &#x000d7; site I recombination activity (for example, G101S D102Y, and the group G101S D102Y M103I Q105L), other combinations do not; for example, the A117V R121K E124Q triple mutant is almost inactive and binds poorly to site I. A double mutation at the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface (R2A E56K) abolished all <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination by wild-type resolvase [as expected; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>)]. However, the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; mutations were neutral or even stimulated site I &#x000d7; site I recombination in the context of variants which already have this activity (such as D102Y E124Q), as had previously been observed <italic>in vivo</italic> by Burke <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface is thus not required for the catalytic functions of resolvase at site I. Variants with high site I &#x000d7; site I recombination activity formed a synaptic complex of two site I fragments in a bandshift assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; further details below).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> recombination by selected activated mutants</title><p>Two activated resolvase variants with multiple mutations near the N-terminus of the E-helix, and their counterparts with additional mutations of residues on the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface, were selected for more detailed analysis. These were the double mutant of adjacent residues G101S D102Y (&#x02018;SY&#x02019;), and the quadruple mutant G101S D102Y M103I Q105L (&#x02018;M&#x02019;), which has higher site I &#x000d7; site I activity than SY <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The 2&#x02013;3&#x02032;-defective variants of SY and M (&#x02018;NSY&#x02019; and &#x02018;NM&#x02019;) have the mutations R2A E56K. NM resolvase was previously shown to form a stable site I synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and its catalytic domain was used to construct chimaeric recombinases with zinc finger DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The site I synapse crystal structures of Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) use a &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase variant with equivalents of five of the six mutations in NM resolvase (R2A, E56K, G101S, E102Y and M103I), as well as another activating mutation E124Q. The natural &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase residue K105 corresponds to Q105 in Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase (mutated to L in M and NM).</p><p>Wild-type, SY, NSY, M and NM resolvases were tested on plasmid substrates containing either two <italic>res</italic> sites in direct repeat (pMA21) or two copies of site I (pAL225) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Following incubation for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C, reaction samples were analysed by further treatment with restriction enzymes or DNase I, then agarose gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). All the mutants recombined pAL225 <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas wild-type resolvase did not. The mutants retain high sequence specificity; no products indicating reaction at non-site I sequences were observed under these conditions. The 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface-defective NM resolvase gave more recombinant products than the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; proficient M resolvase, whereas the extent of recombination by SY and NSY was similar.</p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> show that recombination activity on pAL225 is correlated with several other effects. First, the activated mutants show partial or complete loss of the wild-type specificity for &#x02018;resolution&#x02019; of pMA21, as seen by the presence of products of inversion and intermolecular reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). A second, related effect is the loss of the wild-type specificity for a 2-noded catenane product. Various other product topologies (free recombinant circles, knots, catenanes and intermolecular products) were seen following DNase I nicking to remove DNA supercoiling. &#x02018;Ladders&#x02019; of topologically complex products were observed on the gels after reaction of pAL225 with SY or NSY resolvase, as expected for recombination following a &#x02018;random collision&#x02019; synapsis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, M and NM resolvases formed substantial amounts of simple, free circle products in this assay after 1 h of reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). We show below (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) that this alternative product pattern is the result of multiple rounds of reaction, not a different synapsis pathway. NM resolvase and other highly activated mutants no longer require supercoiling for activity, and recombine linear or oligonucleotide substrates [data not shown; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>)].

Annotation is as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn885f4"/></fig></p><p>Another property of the activated mutants which is apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> is their increased tendency to form species with double-strand breaks (DSBs) at site I. It was shown previously that the DNA cleavage and rejoining activities of resolvase can be partially decoupled in reaction buffers containing high concentrations of glycerol or ethylene glycol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). We tested for resolvase-mediated cleavage of pMA21 and pAL225 in a buffer containing 40% ethylene glycol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Wild-type resolvase gave traces of DSB products [as expected; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>)], but only with pMA21 (<italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic>), whereas the activated mutants gave substantial amounts of DSB products from both substrates.</p><p>NM resolvase is the most activated variant of those studied here. In time course assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, and data not shown), NM resolvase-mediated site I &#x000d7; site I (pAL225) recombination was at least as fast as wild-type resolvase-mediated <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> (pMA21) recombination. Wild-type resolvase made exclusively a 2-noded catenane resolution product which accumulated to a high level at later time points, as expected. In contrast, the NM resolvase reaction products at early time points were mainly topologically complex, but recombinant free circles became more abundant over the time course. This change is reflected in the restriction digest; at early time points, the &#x02018;resolution&#x02019; and &#x02018;inversion&#x02019; recombinant bands were observed in an approximate 1:1 ratio, whereas later time points show an increased proportion of &#x02018;resolution&#x02019; products. The final (60 min) time point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> corresponds to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B. We conclude that the changes in product topology and restriction digest pattern over the time course are due to multiple rounds of strand exchange (see Discussion section). A substantial amount of &#x02018;non-recombinant&#x02019; DNA is observed even at later time points in the pAL225/NM resolvase reaction, which is also consistent with multiple rounds of strand exchange that convert recombinants back to the non-recombinant configuration.</p><p>Another surprising feature of the activated resolvase variants is their altered pH sensitivity. SY, NSY, M and NM resolvases are all active on pMA21 (<italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic>) or pAL225 (site I &#x000d7; site I) over a wide pH range, from &#x0003c;6.0 to &#x0003e;10.0, whereas wild-type resolvase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and the single mutant D102Y are almost inactive on pMA21 at pH 7.0 and below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and data not shown). The reasons for this altered pH sensitivity are still unclear. The mutations might induce conformational changes of active site residues, which reduce the sensitivity of catalysis to low pH, or the effects might be due to loss of dependence on pH-sensitive regulatory interactions between the catalytic tetramer and subunits at the accessory sites.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). The activated M and NM mutant resolvases made a synaptic complex that was observed as a slow-running band [labelled S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>)]. The site I synapse was not observed following binding by wild-type resolvase or the SY and NSY variants; we presume that any synapse formed by these proteins (or the other synapsis-negative variants reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) is too unstable to survive gel electrophoresis. Complexes corresponding to binding of one or two resolvase subunits to a single site I fragment were also observed in all cases, though these bands (especially the 2-subunit complex) were very faint in the NM resolvase lane. Curiously, the mobilities of all types of complex varied slightly depending on which resolvase was used.</p><p>NM resolvase-mediated synapsis is fast. Even at 0&#x000b0;C, the maximum amount of site I synapse was formed within 20 s of addition of resolvase (as fast as we could load the samples on the gel) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).</p><p>The pattern of complexes observed was strongly affected by the conditions of gel electrophoresis. Much lower amounts of site I synapse were observed when the samples were separated using TGE running buffer [previously used to observe complexes of Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase with <italic>res</italic> or parts of <italic>res</italic>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>)] instead of TBE buffer. The intensities of the bands corresponding to site I bound by one or two resolvase subunits correspondingly increased, as illustrated for NM resolvase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). We conclude that the site I synapse decomposes on entry into the gel with TGE buffer, to give the observed one-site complexes. The predominance of the NM resolvase site I synapse band was restored when the TGE gel was 8% rather than 6.5% polyacrylamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>The stoichiometry of the NM resolvase site I synapse (that is, two copies of site I held together by four subunits of resolvase) was confirmed by experiments analogous to those used by Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) to study synapsis by &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D). A larger version of NM resolvase (NM&#x02013;GFP) was created by fusing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) domain to the C-terminus. Site I treated with mixtures of NM and NM&#x02013;GFP gave five synapse bands, which we assign as containing 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 NM&#x02013;GFP subunits. Analogous experiments using mixtures of different sized site I oligonucleotides showed that there were two DNA fragments in the complex [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and data not shown]. When NM and NM&#x02013;GFP resolvases were mixed immediately before addition to the site I DNA, the synapses contained the statistically predicted distribution of the two types of monomers (lane 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), and the distribution did not change if the resolvase mixture was kept at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C overnight prior to addition to the DNA (data not shown). This result indicates either that there are no stable unbound resolvase multimers in solution, or that the subunits comprising any such species can exchange rapidly; otherwise synapses containing the unmixed NM or NM&#x02013;GFP multimers would be anomalously abundant. However, once the site I synapse is formed, the resolvase tetramer in it is quite stable. When pre-formed NM resolvase synapse was challenged with excess NM&#x02013;GFP, no synapses containing mixtures of subunit types were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lane 5). Likewise, when pre-formed NM and NM&#x02013;GFP site I synapses were mixed, the complexes did not disproportionate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D, lane 6). TGE electrophoresis buffer conditions (see above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) destabilize the site I synapse, giving complexes of a single site I with one or two resolvase subunits, but no species that might be a single site I bound to a resolvase tetramer was observed.</p><p>These results differ from Sarkis <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whose data indicated the presence of stable activated mutant &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase tetramers in solution, which then bound to the DNA. It was previously shown that wild-type Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase is in monomer&#x02013;dimer equilibrium in solution at low concentrations (&#x0003c;1 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We compared wild-type Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase and NM resolvase by gel filtration chromatography, at higher concentrations (&#x0223c;65 &#x003bc;M), and at the same salt concentration used in the resolvase storage/dilution buffer. Both proteins eluted as single peaks, with apparent molecular weights of 50 kDa (wild-type resolvase) or 26 kDa (NM resolvase) (data not shown). We conclude that wild-type Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase (subunit molecular weight 20.5 kDa) is predominantly dimeric in solution in this experiment, and NM resolvase is predominantly monomeric. A possible reason for destabilization of the dimers of NM resolvase and other activated mutants is noted in the Discussion section.</p><p>Resolvase-mediated site I cleavage was observed as single-strand break (SSB) or DSB products with a covalently attached resolvase subunit, following treatment of samples with the protein denaturant SDS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). The resolvase variants that produced the most site I synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B) gave the highest levels of cleavage products, suggesting that cleavage occurs within the synapse. However, the rate of cleavage by NM resolvase is much lower than the rate of synapsis. Whereas synapsis reached a maximum within 20 s at 0&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), the site I DNA was mostly uncleaved even after 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). To analyse the state of the site I DNA in the NM resolvase synapse as observed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we performed a 2D experiment. Following electrophoresis in TBE buffer, the gel was soaked in TBE containing SDS, then run in the perpendicular direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Separation in the second dimension showed that most of the site I DNA in the synapse band was uncleaved, with small amounts of single-strand and double-strand cleavage products. A larger amount of double-strand cleavage product was observed as a smear running faster than synapse in the first dimension, suggesting decomposition of cleaved site I synapses during electrophoresis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Recombination by activated resolvase variants <italic>in vitro</italic>; role of the accessory sites of <italic>res</italic></title><p>&#x02018;Activated&#x02019; Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase multiple mutants can promote rapid <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination between two copies of the 28 bp dimer-binding site I or &#x02018;crossover site&#x02019; of the 114 bp Tn<italic>3</italic> recombination site <italic>res</italic>. The rate of site I &#x000d7; site I recombination can be as high as that of <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> recombination promoted by wild-type resolvase. Wild-type resolvase is active only on a supercoiled <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> substrate and forms exclusively a 2-noded catenane resolution product, whereas the mutants recombine <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> or site I &#x000d7; site I substrates to give resolution, inversion and intermolecular recombination products of variable topologies, as well as DNA cleavage products. Mutant-catalysed site I &#x000d7; site I cleavage and recombination in a plasmid substrate are faster than cleavage of site I oligonucleotides, suggesting that the reaction is stimulated by negative supercoiling. The topologies of the site I &#x000d7; site I products are consistent with a &#x02018;random collision&#x02019; mechanism of synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), as has been inferred from the products formed by activated mutants of other serine recombinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). The apparent selective formation of free circle site I &#x000d7; site I resolution products at later time points in NM resolvase reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) can be accounted for by multiple rounds of recombination; under these circumstances products with simpler topology, and therefore lower free energy, will eventually accumulate.</p><p>The activating mutations present in the resolvase variants studied here were identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> screens for <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; site I or site I &#x000d7; site I recombination activity; that is, reactions where one or both partners lack the <italic>res</italic> &#x02018;accessory&#x02019; binding sites II and III [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>)]. The properties of the mutants might therefore provide insights into the functions of the accessory binding sites in the wild-type system. The accessory sites have an established role in bringing about topological selectivity by formation of an intertwined structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), but how do they then stimulate recombination at site I? One hypothesis would be that accessory site synapsis is necessary simply to enhance the overall rate of formation or stability of the complete two-<italic>res</italic> synapse. However, the activated mutant NM resolvase recombines a site I &#x000d7; site I substrate, with no accessory sites, faster than wild-type resolvase recombines a <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that this is not a sufficient explanation. A more appealing hypothesis is that resolvase subunits at the synapsed, intertwined accessory sites somehow promote the site I-bound resolvase subunits from a catalytically inactive configuration to an active one.</p><p>The 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface is essential for <italic>in vitro</italic> catalytic activity of wild-type resolvase (see Introduction section). It has been shown to be involved in contacts between subunits at site I and the accessory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and site I-accessory site 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interactions have been built into structure-based models for the <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, the 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; interface is dispensable for site I &#x000d7; site I recombination by activated resolvase mutants. A site I synapse made by wild-type resolvase was not observed in our gel-based assays; either it is not formed, or it is too unstable to survive electrophoresis. Site I synapse formation leading to catalysis by wild-type resolvase might require 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; contacts from subunits at the accessory sites, whereas activating mutations allow site I synapse formation without 2&#x02013;3&#x02032; contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), bypassing this regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Formation and stability of the site I synapse</title><p>Formation of a synapse of two site I oligonucleotides by NM resolvase is fast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C), but subsequent DNA cleavage is much slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E). The synapse bands seen on our gels contain largely uncleaved site I DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). The site I synapse is held together by a tetramer of resolvase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D; 14), which is stable whilst it is in the synapse but is not present as a long-lived species in solution or bound to a single site I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D and gel filtration results). Based on these results and previous evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), our favoured model for assembly of the site I synapse is that resolvase monomers bind cooperatively to site I to form dimers, and two site I-dimer complexes then interact with each other. This pathway might be advantageous in the context of the biology of the wild-type resolution system because it can fully exploit the potential for cooperativity in synapse formation, though mutants other than NM, or other related resolvases, might well behave differently (e.g., see 14,17). A similar pathway for synapsis was deduced by Sanders and Johnson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>) from an elegant study of synaptic complexes and strand exchange intermediates formed by an activated H107Y mutant of Hin, a DNA invertase related to resolvase. Hin H107Y forms a synapse comprising two <italic>hix</italic> recombination sites and four Hin subunits which can be observed by gel electrophoresis. The <italic>hix</italic> DNA in the synapse has been cleaved by Hin H107Y to give DSBs, and this cleavage is required for the stability of the complex, in contrast to the Tn<italic>3</italic> resolvase site I synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Further studies on the Hin H107Y synapse showed that the Hin subunits translocate with the DNA half-sites during strand exchange, supporting a subunit rotation model for the mechanism of catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>How do activating mutations exert their effects?</title><p>The activating mutations in the resolvase variants studied here were identified as conferring a &#x02018;gain of function&#x02019; phenotype; that is, ability to recombine substrates lacking one or both sets of <italic>res</italic> accessory sites. However, mutations in general are most likely to result in loss of function, so it might be better to regard the effect of activating mutations as loss of a regulatory function of wild-type resolvase. That is, wild-type resolvase has evolved so that its catalytic activity is strictly dependent on formation of a synapse involving two complete <italic>res</italic> sites, and the mutants have lost this dependence. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments show that the mutations have various additional effects on resolvase activity (see above).</p><p>The crystal structures of wild-type &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase and activated &#x003b3;&#x003b4; resolvase mutants (both unbound and in complexes with site I) should provide clues to the nature of the regulation, and why it is defective in the activated mutants. The structures of the site I synaptic intermediates [1ZR2, 1ZR4, 2GM4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)] and of an activated variant catalytic domain without DNA [2GM5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)] contain a tetrameric arrangement of the catalytic domains which is not found in any of the structures of wild-type resolvase [2RSL, 1GDR, 1GDT; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). However, the structures do not provide an obvious explanation of how the mutations stabilize the tetramer, or why it is not formed by wild-type resolvase. Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) make two hypotheses. First, the observed bond angles for the wild-type resolvase residue G101 are allowed only for glycine, so substitution of this residue by serine in the activated mutants might destabilize the dimer by forcing a change in the conformation of this part of the protein, the &#x02018;hinge&#x02019; connecting the globular N-terminus of the catalytic domain to the E-helix. Second, some of the mutated residues (e.g. Y102) make new hydrophobic contacts in the tetrameric structures.</p><p>To relate the properties of the activated mutants to the mechanism of the wild-type resolution system, it is important to establish whether the changes in resolvase conformation between the crystal structures of the (wild-type) dimer bound to site I and the (activated mutant) tetramer in a cleaved site I synapse occur before or after initial synapsis. An &#x02018;early&#x02019; synaptic interface between two resolvase dimers in approximately wild-type conformation has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), involving residues near the N-terminus of the E-helix including G101, D102 and M103, which are mutated in the activated variants studied here. However, this hypothetical interface has not been observed by crystallography. The rapidly formed, uncleaved site I synapses observed in this study (and in previous studies using catalytically defective resolvase mutants or chemically modified DNA; 14,15) are distinct from all the current crystallographic structures which contain cleaved site I DNA, and therefore might contain the hypothetical early synaptic interface, stabilized by the activating mutations. Alternatively, the activating mutations might promote pre-synapsis conversion of the dimer into a conformation resembling that seen in the crystallographic tetramer. In this latter scenario, there would be no equivalent of the hypothetical early synaptic interface. Further work will be needed to distinguish between these two models, and to determine whether either of them is applicable to the natural <italic>res</italic> &#x000d7; <italic>res</italic> recombination system.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>U.K. Commonwealth Academic Staff Scholarship Award (to F.J.O); a Carnegie Trust Ph.D Studentship (to S.V.C.T.W); Wellcome Trust (Grant reference numbers 039542, 072552).
