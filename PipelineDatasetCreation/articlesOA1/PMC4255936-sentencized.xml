</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most efforts in synthetic biology have so far concentrated on the engineering of metabolic pathways or the engineering of sensory and logic systems, generally (although not exclusively) in unicellular organisms [1–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Anatomical structure, a feature as essential to complex animals as metabolism and logic, has so far received very little attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the recent report by Carvalho et al. [6], who generated morphogen diffusion gradients from engineered cysts, illustrates the power of synthetic tools towards spatial engineering in mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In recent essays, we have proposed the construction of genetic modules for ‘synthetic morphology’: programming mammalian cells to display specific morphogenetic behaviours using synthetic biology principles, the eventual aim being the self-organization of these cells into designer ‘tissues’ [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The aim of synthetic morphology is greatly aided by the observation that most normal mammalian morphogenesis seems to take place using about ten basic cellular behaviours, each tissue using them in different sequences and to different extents [7, 9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Analytical approaches to developmental biology have created models (or at least narratives) of normal development [10], but it is difficult to test these models properly [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The usual method of inactivating a key component and verifying that the event fails to take place does not really test more than the necessity for particular components (see Davies 2009 for further discussion [12]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Synthetic biology offers new ways of studying complex systems by the bottom-up approach, i.e. dissecting a process into basic events/modules and combining them back up from scratch, building this process de novo, or at least part(s) of it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This way, engineered cells should be able to execute simple sequences of predetermined morphogenetic events and test theories of morphogenesis away from its complex, natural setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The approach will also allow researchers to explore what cells can do, rather than merely what they normally do. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Careful review of the literature indicates that many basic morphogenetic behaviours can be triggered by the expression of a single protein [7], making the idea of constructing synthetic morphology modules a realistic proposition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Here we report the construction of five inducible effector modules, to control cell adhesion, elective cell death, cell fusion, cell locomotion and proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These are produced in a standardized format, easy to connect to existing logic and sensory modules, and all have been made available in a public repository. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We also report the testing of these synthetic, inducible modules in mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We assembled a Gateway® cloning (Invitrogen) compatible pENTR library of morphogenetic effectors: these include Cdh1 (cell-adhesion [13]), Casp2 (elective cell death [14], p14 (cell fusion [15]), Crk-II (cell locomotion [16]) and p27Kip1 (inhibition of otherwise constitutive proliferation [17]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The T-REx™-293 cell line (Invitrogen), a commercially available and easy-to-maintain cell line, was used to test these effector modules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is derived from Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells, to which stable expression of the tetracycline repressor protein has been added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>T-REx-293 cells were used in combination with Gateway® pT-REx™-DEST vectors, so that driver genes could be conveniently inserted downstream of a tetracycline-inducible promoter from our library of pENTR library vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This way, effector modules could be switched on and off using tetracycline (Tet), without the need for construction and testing of the elaborate upstream logic modules that will control effector modules in advanced synthetic morphology projects [7, 8, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>After stable transfection, followed by clonal selection, independent clones were tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Generally, effector genes were from a non-human origin in order to facilitate monitoring of their expression in T-REx-293 cells with species-specific antibodies or primers, the only exception being the gene encoding p27Kip1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent reporters were also used in the system, by engineering pT-REx™-DEST vectors with IRES-TurboGFP or IRES-mCherry cassettes downstream of the effector, or by using 2A peptide fusions inside the effector cassette itself (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Such reporters enable (i) the testing of clones for the simultaneous expression of the reporter and the gene of interest after stable selection and clonal isolation, (ii) real-time monitoring of inducible expression and (iii) visualization of different cell populations within a mixture of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Below, we demonstrate that each driver construct’s behaviour is effective in controlling the expected aspect of morphogenetic cell behaviour.Figure 1 The morphogenetic effectors used in this study. p27 kip1 (control of proliferation), Casp2 (elective cell death), Cdh1 (cell-cell adhesion), p14 (fusion) and Crk-II (locomotion) were inserted downstream of a tetracycline-responsive promoter and coupled with different fluorescent reporters in pTREx destination vectors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>By definition, mammalian cell lines proliferate constitutively and indefinitely in culture [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In systems where proliferation of cells needs to be controlled, chemical inhibitors such as mitomycin C are used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A common example is the growth inhibition of feeder layer cells for the expansion of stem cells [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>However, chemical inhibitors can metabolically alter cells [21] and are difficult to remove from culture systems [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In contrast, imposing proliferation control through genetic engineering would allow reversible, conditional and selective growth inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>This way, targeted populations of cells could selectively be controlled in systems or tissues composed of different cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Progression of cells through the cell cycle is regulated by complexes of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Their action can be inhibited by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), which are important in allowing cells to exit the cell cycle and to differentiate during foetal development [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>p27Kip1 is a member of the CDKI family that binds G1-cyclin/CDK complexes and inhibits transition from the G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of p27Kip1 causes human fibroblasts to arrest in G1 phase [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>To build an inducible, proliferation-inhibiting module, we placed p27Kip1 under tetracycline induction in the pTREx-DEST-IRES-TGFP modified vector (pTREx-p27kip1-IRES-TGFP, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Control T-REx-293 cells treated with 0.05 μg/mL tetracycline showed population growth rates similar to untreated wild-type cells (Figure 2a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, clones stably transfected with p27Kip1 and induced with tetracycline for 72 h showed less proliferation than their uninduced (but still p27Kip1-carrying) counterparts (Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Arrested cells appeared rounded and attached to the culture plate surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>It was important to test that the great reduction in proliferation that we observed was due to a reversible brake on cell cycling, and not as a result of cell damage or cell death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To verify this, we exploited the flexibility of the Tet induction system and observed the behaviour of cells following release from p27Kip1-mediated inhibition of proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Cells were induced with tetracycline for 48 h, when the medium was replaced by the tetracycline-free version: released cells resumed proliferation after a delay of about one day (Figure 2d), although somewhat slower than their never-inhibited counterparts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Arrested cells could withstand tetracycline exposure for as long as 72 h before resuming growth. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Elective cell death (as distinct from death due to infection or external injury) is an important mechanism of morphogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It is used, amongst other things, to turn solid rods into hollow tubes [26], to eliminate temporary ‘scaffold’ structures [27] and to balance populations of different types of cells [28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The best-understood mechanism of elective cell death, apoptosis, is activated by caspases: these are cysteine proteases and are classified as initiator or effector caspases, according to where they lie in the apoptotic pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Caspase-2, unusually, shows characteristics of both initiator and effector caspases [30, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>It localizes to the nucleus where it is activated through dimerization [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>It has been shown to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>To engineer an elective cell death module, we placed mouse Casp2 under tetracycline induction in the pT-REx-DEST30 vector (pTREx-Casp2, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Uninduced T-REx-293 cells carrying the elective cell death module (Figure 3a, Additional file 1: Movie 1), as well as control wild-type T-REx-293 cells treated with tetracycline (see Figure 2a), showed little cell death and their number increased after 48 h in culture due to proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>After induction, the cells carrying pTREx-Casp2 showed extensive apoptotic death, detectable by microscopy (Figure 3a, Additional file 1: Movie 1) and by counting the declining number of cells still adhering to the wells (Figure 3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>To verify that the mechanism of cell death was that intended, we used Q-VD-OPh, a pan-caspase inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>When added to the growth medium, it largely blocked cell death after tetracycline induction of the module (Figure 3c), confirming that the cell death observed previously (in absence of the inhibitor) was indeed caspase-driven.Figure 3 Tetracycline-induced cell death in Casp2 -engineered T-REx-293 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>(a) Uninduced cells from clone THAP2-2 (a representative clone of T-REx-293 cells carrying the elective cell death module) showed normal growth, but extensive cell death when induced with tetracycline (1 μg/mL) for 48 h.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Arguably, the most important regulators of cell-cell adhesion in mammalian development are the various cadherins, a family of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The first to be discovered [33, 34], E-cadherin (CDH1), is a cell surface protein involved in intercellular adhesion of epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This protein possesses a large extracellular domain that consists of repeated motifs responsible for homophilic adhesion between adjacent cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In the cytoplasm, its intracellular domain binds to catenins and links E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>CDH1 promotes strong cell aggregation when expressed in mouse fibroblasts deficient in E-cadherin (L-929 cells) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>To build an adhesion module, we fused mouse Cdh1 to TurboGFP through a 2A peptide link, and inserted the resulting cassette into pT-REx-DEST30 (pTREx-TGFP-2A-Cdh1, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>After clone selection, T-REx-293 cells stably transfected with pTREx-TGFP-2A-Cdh1 expressed mouse E-cadherin after 48 h of 1 μg/mL tetracycline induction, as shown by RT-PCR analysis (Figure 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The primers used to detect levels of Cdh1 mRNA were specific for mouse Cdh1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>When uninduced, cells show very little mouse E-cadherin mRNA transcription compared to induced cells, indicating a low level of expression leakage from the tetracycline transcriptional switch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Wild-type cells and T-REx-293 cells carrying the adhesion module but without induction showed only modest cell-cell adhesion: they grew in small, connected, ragged-edged clumps that formed a network across the culture plate (Figure 4b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>For the purposes of synthetic biology, it is a potentially useful way to bring two different nuclei together in one cytoplasm, and thus to share cytoplasmic regulators of gene expression or metabolic effectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are reptilian reovirus membrane fusion proteins that are involved in virus dissemination in the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>They are expressed in the plasma membrane of infected cells where they mediate cell-cell fusion by converting pre-existing cellular adhesion sites into fusion sites [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Apposed membrane bilayers merge, hemifusion stalks appear, and pores are created and expand [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>During viral infection, formation of the resulting extensive multinucleated syncytium eventually triggers an apoptotic response that contributes to the dissemination of infection in the host [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>p14FAST, a reptilian orthoreovirus protein, is known to cause cell-cell fusion when expressed in QM5 quail fibrosarcoma cells [15], suggesting it will possibly function in mammalian cells too. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>To construct a fusion module, we placed p14 under tetracycline induction in the pTREx-DEST-IRES-TGFP modified vector (pTREx-p14FAST-IRES-TGFP, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Cells overexpressing p14FAST after tetracycline induction formed multinucleated syncytia as shown in Figure 5a: these could be detected as large, multinucleate cells in bright field that showed formation of tight ‘rosettes’ of nuclei visible with DAPI staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>In uninduced (unfused) cells, cortical actin surrounds each individual nucleus, indicating that the nucleus is in cytoplasm surrounded by its own plasma membrane: in the induced (fused cells), cortical actin instead surrounds complete rosettes of nuclei rather than individual ones, implying that the nuclei share one common cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Syncytia formed through p14-induced fusion started dying around 20 h after tetracycline induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Fusion events were rare when cells were grown in calcium-free medium (Figure 5b), confirming that the fusion process is calcium-dependent as expected [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>To test whether the construct needed to be expressed in both neighbouring cells for fusion to take place, we mixed T-REx-293 cells carrying the fusion construct with MDCK canine kidney cells that had been transiently transfected with pTREx-mCherry as a marker (but not with the fusion construct). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>MDCK cells were chosen as they are well-characterized cells routinely used in our laboratory, and are from a different cell type and a different species than HEK cells (dog). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>They do not naturally form syncytia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In the mixed culture (Figure 5c), while some normal (unfused) MDCK cells could be seen as intensely red individual cells, some of the large syncytia contained red fluorescent patches suggesting that syncytia had formed in the mixed culture, and contained cytoplasms originating from both cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Potential users of this module should note that this result implies a risk that cells carrying the fusion module might fuse with cells of living humans, and potentially carry dangerous genetic material such as oncogenes and viruses into them (even basic cells lines carry mutations making them proliferative and immortal). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Cell locomotion is a major mechanism in mammalian development: the long migrations of the neural crest and the primordial germ cells depend on it, as does wiring of the nervous system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Even in adult life, cells of the immune and inflammatory systems make constant use of locomotion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Cell migration is driven by the local polymerization of actin into protrusions called lamellipodia and filopodia, in response to a combination of internal cell state and external environmental cues [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>These protrusions are stabilized by the formation of integrin adhesions to the extracellular matrix and extend in the direction of migration [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Complex cytoskeletal reorganization also takes place at the rear of the cell, where existing adhesions are remodelled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>CRK-II, an adaptor protein from cytoskeletal signalling pathways, has been shown to promote cell migration when expressed in human pancreatic carcinoma cells [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>It promotes the formation of lamellipodia and the loss of cell-cell junctions (and consequent loss of cell-cell adhesion) in MDCK cells [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>To engineer a module that promotes locomotion, we placed Crk-II under tetracycline induction in the pTREx-DEST-IRES-mCherry modified vector (pTREx-CrkII-IRES-mCherry, Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In this study, we describe a synthetic library of five separate morphogenetic effector modules that induce five morphological behaviours in T-REx-293 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>We have made these biological parts available to others by depositing them in a plasmid repository (Addgene) as pENTR vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>We have chosen the T-REx-293 cell line as our engineering chassis for its ease of transfection and its built-in tetracycline transcriptional control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to find out how easily our tools can be engineered in cell types that are more problematic to transfect or where sustained transgene expression is difficult to achieve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>It would also be useful to know how reliably our effectors perform in other cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>The constructs assembled here do not contain cell-type-specific features and should therefore be functional in other mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (used in the T-REx system) has been reported to show poor activity in some cell lines [43] and promoters such as elongation factor 1α (EF1α) could improve transgene expression if needed [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>This might be particularly relevant when engineering stem cell chassis where CMV has been shown to have poor transcriptional activity [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The resultant stem cells (i.e. stably transfected with functional and inducible morphogenetic effectors) could offer new options for synthetic approaches to tissue-engineering. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Also, we have used a simple controlling switch in this study to demonstrate the basic functions of the modules in a synthetic biology context. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Better performance may come from more sophisticated switches, for example of the type described by Deans et al. [46], that combine RNAi and repressor proteins to improve the leakiness associated with the tetracycline switch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Using switches with translational or post-translational control might also change the kinetics of the system and confer a faster response to environmental cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In addition, using different promoters may allow for better tunability over the desired morphologic changes in engineered mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Also, IRES-dependent expression of fluorescent markers was extremely variable, when expression from 2A constructs was robust and reliable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Exploring the use of other IRESes than the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES used in this study might help to get reliable fluorescent marker expression from bicistronic vectors [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>We are currently combining sequences of morphogenetic effectors in a series of proof-of-concept trials for synthetic morphology, where cells are genetically programmed to organize themselves into designed 2D or 3D structures in response to artificial external stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>To this end, several morphogenetic effectors can be combined in the same chassis, with each effector placed under the control of a different switch to ensure they can be induced at different times or rates. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>There are two broad fields in which the modules described here (and others like them) may be useful, particularly if placed under the control of existing sensing and logic modules [48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The first is the testing of fundamental theories of developmental biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>There is a strong thread of philosophical thought, traceable to Giambattista Vico (1668-1744), that we can be sure we understand something only if we can (re)create it: synthetic biologists often quote Richard Feynmann’s re-statement of this principle as ‘what I cannot create, I do not understand’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Analytical biology has produced models of how morphogenesis works in simple tissues: using synthetic morphological modules to try to teach naïve cells to undergo similar morphogenesis is a powerful mean of testing the quality of these modules [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The second field in which these modules may be useful is that of tissue engineering, especially adapting human cells to live in culture, whether for life-support machines or as test beds for pharmaceutical efficacy or toxicity screening [50–52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Combinations of various cell lines with different morphologic effectors (the ones described here and others yet unpublished) could be assembled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Importantly, the resulting cell arrangements would not be restricted to natural ones and un-natural, designed structures could be obtained and may, in the future, be used in surgery and regenerative medicine, making synthetic morphology a powerful tool for tissue engineering. </plain></SENT>
