Unlike others in this gene family, <italic>APOL1</italic> possesses a signal sequence that allows for it to be exported out of the cell. Once extracellular, <italic>APOL1</italic> associates with HDL particles and may play a role in programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While they confer protection against the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, genetic variants in the <italic>APOL1</italic> region of chromosome 22 have been identified as major determinants of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in African Americans. The two most common high-risk variants of <italic>APOL1</italic>, G1 and G2, are only seen among individuals of West African descent, with approximately 12% of African Americans having two high-risk variants. In contrast, these high-risk variants are virtually nonexistent among Asians, Europeans, and Hispanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Multiple studies have now shown that, compared to those with zero or one high-risk variant, the presence of two high-risk variants is associated with advanced kidney disease in the setting of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], hypertension-attributed nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and HIV-associated nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. High-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> is also associated with progression of established CKD, independent of diabetes status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Less is known about the relation of <italic>APOL1</italic> and early kidney damage. Some studies have shown associations between having two 2 high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> variants and prevalent high ACR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and very high ACR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] among populations with largely preserved eGFR.</p><p>However, importantly, not all African Americans with two high-risk variants develop incident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or progressive CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], suggesting that a &#x0201c;second hit&#x0201d; may be required. This second hit may be environmental, including infectious factors (as in the case of HIV associated nephropathy), as well as factors related to socioeconomic status (SES) or comorbid disease burden. Multiple studies have found that adjustment for SES attenuates observed disparities in kidney-related outcomes between African Americans and whites, suggesting that factors related to low SES contribute to the excess risk of advanced CKD and ESRD seen among African Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some studies have found that low SES correlates more strongly with CKD/ESRD among African Americans than whites, further supporting the notion of environmental contributions to racial disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are many possible mechanisms through which SES could contribute to these disparities, and several models have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, limited availability of healthful foods in the neighborhoods of many low SES African Americans could lead to poor dietary patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which could ultimately affect CKD risk-- particularly given the growing body of evidence supporting that dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables could be kidney protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite recent advances in understanding genetic contributions to racial disparities in CKD, questions still remain, including the relation of genetic factors to the variation in GFR among populations largely free of established CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, the possible role of gene-environment interactions in determining early kidney disease among African Americans has not been well-explored. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate whether genetic factors, environmental factors (SES), or their interaction are associated with markers of renal dysfunction among persons without established CKD in an urban population of predominantly low income African Americans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS): design and population</title><p>We examined cross-sectional data from the National Institute on Aging (NIA), HANDLS study.

We found that income, but not high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic>, was significantly associated with mildly reduced kidney function. Upon examining further reductions in kidney function (eGFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60), the association of high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> and reduced kidney function was significant. We also found that high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> status, but not income, was significantly associated with elevated ACR. The associations of <italic>APOL1</italic> with markers of early kidney disease did not vary by income category, or vice versa.</p><p>Few other studies have examined the association of <italic>APOL1</italic> with milder forms of kidney disease and findings have varied. Foster, <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] performed a prospective study examining a cohort of African Americans with no CKD at baseline and found an increased risk for eGFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60 and progression to ESRD among those with the high-risk genotype. Friedman, <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] found a 3-fold increased risk of eGFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60 and microalbuminuria associated with high risk <italic>APOL1</italic> among nondiabetic African Americans in a cross-sectional study; however, this association did not persist among persons with diabetes. Freedman, <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] examined these cross-sectional relationships in relatives of patients with non-diabetic ESRD. They found a significant association between <italic>APOL1</italic> and macroalbuminuria, but not with microalbuminuria or eGFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60. In aggregate, these studies and ours suggest that high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> variants may be more strongly associated with advanced and progressive kidney disease than with early disease, arguing for a primary role of <italic>APOL1</italic> as a progression rather than initiation factor in CKD.</p><p>Recent advances have swung the pendulum of research and clinical thought regarding the etiology of racial disparities in kidney disease towards the role of genetic contributions. The results of our study suggest that genetic factors may not fully explain these disparities. In this sample largely free of CKD, a large proportion of individuals with early kidney damage were among those without high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> variants. Rather, diabetes and/or hypertension were prevalent among the majority of participants with early kidney damage. Thus, despite the highly significant association between high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> and kidney disease among African Americans in multiple recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], it may not be the only contributor to early kidney disease in this population. Other factor(s), including those related to and influenced by SES, may be the primary initiators of CKD among African Americans. In our study, for example, we found that only about a third of individuals with elevated ACR had high-risk <italic>APOL1</italic> variants, however, the overwhelming majority had hypertension. Therefore, early CKD identification and treatment of modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, may offer the greatest opportunity for reducing CKD disparities among minority and low income populations.</p><p>Our finding of greater odds of eGFR &#x0003c;75 among the lowest compared to the higher income group is consistent with prior studies implicating SES as a major predictor of early kidney disease among African Americans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Our analyses of other indicators of SES were generally consistent with the income analyses, except our finding of no association between access to care measures and eGFR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;75. Here, reverse causality was possible, as individuals in poor health (ie. with reduced kidney function and other chronic illnesses) may be more able to obtain public health insurance and may seek care more often than healthier persons. There are multiple possible mechanisms through which low SES could lead to increased risk of kidney disease, most of which have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Aside from its potential impact on receipt of high quality health care, there are less obvious mechanisms, related to the social environment and psychosocial impact of low SES that may contribute as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Future studies are warranted elucidating pathways between low SES and kidney disease.</p><p>The limitations of our study should be considered. First, its cross-sectional design disallows direct causal inferences regarding the associations examined, and thus, longitudinal studies of this kind are needed. Second, despite our stratifying participants around an annual income of $14,000, our study population was largely comprised of low income individuals, which may have influenced our results. Third, we lacked complete data on some variables included in our sensitivity analyses. Finally, our relatively low event rate for early kidney damage did not allow adjustment for multiple covariates, or more granular analyses of income levels; and unmeasured confounders, particularly of the association of income and early kidney disease, are likely. Our power to detect statistically significant differences was limited in some of our models (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). We included adjustment for a parsimonious set of variables despite the low event rate, and found that this did not substantially alter the point estimates of our univariate models. While our findings can serve to generate hypotheses, larger studies more representative of all African Americans are warranted addressing these relationships among well-characterized populations with a greater range of kidney disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study is one of few examining the association of both genetic and environmental factors with early kidney damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In a population of urban-dwelling, primarily low-income African Americans, we found that genetic factors were significantly associated with albuminuria and significantly reduced eGFR, however, income level was a correlate of less severe markers of early kidney damage. Thorough examination of the burden of CKD among African Americans may require consideration of both genetic as well as environmental factors.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12882_2015_8_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
