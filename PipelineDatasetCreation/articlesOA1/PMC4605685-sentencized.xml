</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With growing population and increasing urbanization, humanity faces a looming food crisis, which to prevent, will require yields to be increased by at least 50% over the next 40 years [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In addition, extreme climate changes, decreasing availability of water and energy resources, and competitions between grains for bio-fuels and food could worsen the situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One of the most promising solutions is to introduce the C4 photosynthetic pathways into C3 crops such as rice and soybeans, to improve their water, radiation, and nitrogen use efficiency [1–3], resulting in higher yields than present day C3 crops [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the past few decades, numerous efforts have been made to introduce C4 traits into C3 plants, for example the work carried out by the C4 Rice Consortium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://irri.org/c4rice">http://irri.org/c4rice</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although none of them have so far demonstrated significantly enhanced photosynthetic properties in transgenic plants, the expression patterns and activities of many known C4 associated genes and proteins were thoroughly studied, and can be used as the basis for future engineering attempts [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Several features of studied C4 genes are: (1) The C4 pathway independently evolved more than 60 times from C3 plants [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Orthologues of genes encoding classic C4 enzymes preexisted in their C3 ancestors but are usually lowly expressed in C3 plants, while in C4 plants these genes are highly expressed and co-regulated by multiple stimuli, e.g., light [5, 9]; (2) Many proteins, encoded by multi-gene families and thought to fulfill housekeeping functions in C3 species [7, 9], are recruited into the C4 pathway after a neo-function is acquired for the C4 paralog [10], which may change its gene expression pattern [11]; (3) C4 genes are often expressed in a cell-type specific manner, i.e. bundle sheath (BS) or mesophyll (ME) cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These characteristics could be exploited to identify novel C4 genes as well as their regulatory networks, which in practice could provide guidance for strategies of establishing the C4 cycle in C3 plants, e.g., by transferring a group of genes instead of a single gene into C3 crops [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>With recent advances in sequencing technologies, genome assemblies of multiple C4 species including maize [12], sorghum [13] and new C4 model species, foxtail millet (Setaria Italica) [14, 15], are currently available, providing a good opportunity to dissect the C4 pathway using system biology approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To date, several transcriptomics and proteomics studies have provided insight into C4 gene expression and protein accumulation by comparative analysis of BS and ME cells in maize [16–21], green foxtail (Setaria viridis) [22], and rice [23], transcriptional profiling along a leaf development gradient in maize [24, 25] and between maize and rice [26], and between both distantly and closely related C3 and C4 species [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Hundreds of differentially accumulated genes and proteins were identified and functionally characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Little, however, is known about the downstream regulatory networks of genes and protein interactions responsible for the fundamental anatomical features in both C4 and C3 species [29], as well as the mechanisms controlling the expression and function of well characterized C4 genes[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Systems biology analysis of multiple lineages of C3 and C4 species [7, 9], and comparative studies across species could provide great promise for identifying unknown genes that control many, yet unknown, C4 functions [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Recently, novel cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements and candidate transcription factors of C4 photosynthesis have been identified, by comparing sets of leaf gradient transcriptome data from maize and rice [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In that study, transcriptome data from anatomically and developmentally different leaf sections of maize and rice were projected to a unified gradient to facilitate cross-species clustering analysis on orthologue gene sets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The limitation of this approach is that when studying tissues from two species that are very divergent, it is not always feasible to project a unified gradient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Gene co-expression network analysis, which uses transcriptomic data (either microarray or RNA-seq data) to group genes according to the similarity of their expression profiles [31], is one of the most powerful methods to explore genes relationships and to predict their function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is presumed that genes that exhibit similar expression profiles across various tissues/samples are often functionally related [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The identified groups are referred to as modules, while the gene relationships within groups are referred to as networks, where nodes represent genes, and edges represent the correlations between pairs of genes [31, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In plants, this method has been successfully applied many times to identify new members of biological processes [34–36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>When multiple species data are available, this process can be refined by extracting the gene co-expression networks found independently in each species, as biologically irrelevant associations caused by noise are not likely to be repeatedly observed in the co-expression networks in different species [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Two different strategies can be used for multi-species comparisons: (1) To find conserved modules across species with common gene orthologues [37] and then compare their expression patterns and expression levels, (2) to detect differentially co-expressed modules in which gene orthologues show different network structures between species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the present study, expression profiles of segments along a leaf developmental gradient [29], was used to conduct gene co-expression analysis in one C3 and three C4 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to identify C4 candidate genes, which are light-regulated and functionally different between C4 and C3 species (e.g., different expression levels, different expression patterns, present in C4 species but absent in C3 species), through genome-wide transcriptome data comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Such C4 candidate genes may be used in the future as a useful source for engineering C4 traits into C3 crops for production improvement. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>BTx623) and 10 sections of green foxtail (Setaria viridis, ecotype A10.1) data, which derived in each case from 10-day-old third leaves were generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The growth conditions of these four species were described previously [24, 26], in detail, under an 80:20 mix of metal halide, with capsylite halogen lamps at light intensity of 550 μmol/m2/sec, 12:12 L/D, 31°C L/22°C D and 50% relative humidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>All samples were harvested three hours after light on in the morning, pooled from at least seven plants (seven for maize, rice and sorghum, twenty for green foxtail) per biological replicate and have at least three biological replicates (five for maize, four for rice and three for sorghum) except green foxtail, which has only one replicate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We believed the data from green foxtail is reliable based on following reasons: (1) the samples of green foxtail showed very similar clustering patterns as maize and sorghum throughout all the sections (S1 Fig); (2) the expression patterns of classical C4 genes (e.g., PPDK, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME), which were used as case control in our study, were the same as maize and sorghum; (3) additional two C4 species (maize and sorghum) were also used, the cross species validation designed in the study can minimize the false-positive results due to lack of replication in green foxtail. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>169M, 332M, 141M and 364M raw reads were generated by single end 35 bp, 51 bp, 51 bp and 35 bp sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine from maize, sorghum, green foxtail and rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>After sequence quality examination, reads were mapped to the reference genomes (B73_AGPv2 for maize via MaizeSequence.org, rice_v6 for rice via rice.plantbiology.msu.edu, and JGIv2.0.21 for green foxtail and Sorbi1.22 for sorghum via plants.ensembl.org) using Tophat v2.0.10 [38] with most default settings (e.g., mismatches = 2, threads = 6) but without novel junctions detection (—no-novel-juncs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Because green foxtail reference genome is not currently available, the reads were mapped to its domesticated cultivar, foxtail millet (setaria italica). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Reads counting and calculation of RPKM were described previously [26], and gene expression level was finally expressed as mean of RPKM across replicates. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Before gene co-expression network analysis, low expressed loci were filtered by using RPKM &gt; 1 in more than 10% sections (i.e., genes with RPKM &gt; 1 in more than 2 out of 15 maize, 13 sorghum, 10 green foxtail and 11 rice sections are kept), and outliers were detected by clustering of samples with the correlation of gene expression [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Section 1, harvested from leaf base that displays very different expression profiling from other sections in three C4 species, was detected as outlier and removed from the analysis to avoid the network structures being dominated by difference between section 1 and the others. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Modules were determined by the dynamic tree cut method, and modules with high correlated genes (e.g., Pearson correlation &gt; = 0.9) were merged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Modules were named as the first upper letter of each species then followed by their module colors, e.g., M.red and R.black represent red module in maize and black module in rice, respectively. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>DiffCoEx was originally designed to cluster genes using a novel dissimilarity measurement computed from the topological overlap of the correlation changes between biological conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>C4 candidate genes were defined as those found in C4 modules (defined by co-expression modules which showed similar gene expression patterns as classic C4 genes, see below) of at least two C4 species in consideration of species specification/divergence, and then categorized into three sub-types by comparing with rice: (I) genes showed similar expression pattern as C4 modules but were lowly expressed in rice, e.g., the expression levels (mean of one third of all sections from the tip) were &gt; = 1.5-fold lower in rice compared to C4 species; (II) genes showed different expression patterns in rice comparing with C4 species; and (III) genes whose syntenic orthologues were present in all three C4 species but absent in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>We presume that genes should be differentially co-expressed once their expression patterns were changed between species, thus we then filtered the type II of C4 candidate genes with the DiffCoEx results, and only retained those that were differentially co-expressed in at least two out of three comparisons (maize vs. rice, green foxtail vs. rice, and sorghum vs. rice) with the same direction, either lower or higher correlated in C4 species than in rice. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we suggest three possible evolution scenarios for the recruitment of genes into the C4 pathway (1) Genes that have expression patterns similar to known and well characterized photosynthetic genes, could have increased their expression levels in C4 species (e.g., type I), because C4 photosynthesis requires light-regulated high expression of genes in leaves [9, 56]; (2) Genes that exhibit an expression patterns different from photosynthetic genes, may have altered their expression patterns to obtain a novel function for C4 photosynthesis (e.g., type II). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This explanation is consistent with a recent study, which demonstrated that C4 expression patterns were not present in the C3 ancestors, but were acquired during the evolutionary transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis [11]; (3) Genes that have syntenic orthologues in C4 species but were absent from C3 rice (e.g., type III), may represent genes that were newly formed in C4 species, after the divergence of the C3 and C4 lineages, and may thus participate in new biological functions that do not exist in C3 plants. </plain></SENT>
