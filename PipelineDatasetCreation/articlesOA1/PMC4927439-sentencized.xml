</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cuticle protects the leaves, fruits and other softer parts of plant from dehydration and it acts as the outermost barrier in plant parts to infestation by pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The major constituent of the cuticle is insoluble lipid polyester called cutin, which primarily consists of hydroxylated 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids that are linked together via ester bonds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cutinase/cutin hydrolase (3.1.1.74) secreted by phytopathogenic microorganisms are inducible in nature and are capable of degrading cutin polymers of plant cell wall (Purdy and Kolattukudy 1975). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are widely distributed in animals, plants and microorganisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Cutinases have attracted attention of researchers because of the fact that they do not require any cofactors, are fairly stable, catalyzes both hydrolysis and synthetic reactions and are even active in organic solvents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These are versatile enzymes showing several interesting properties which have potential industrial applications (Macedo and Pio 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the food industry, cutinases have been used as important catalyst to produce dehydrated fruits, dairy products, flavoring compounds and some important fatty acids such as eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) (Dutta et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These enzymes have been also used to degrade various insoluble polymer films like poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETP) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) (Murphy et al. 1996; Liu et al. 2009; Korpecka et al. 2010; Greimel et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>X-ray crystallographic studies of F. solani pisi cutinase have revealed that a catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp is located in its active site (Egmond and Vlieg 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Fungal cutinases can hydrolyse not only cutin, but also insoluble triglycerides as well as soluble esters such as p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Thus, fungal cutinases are considered as being intermediate between lipases and esterases (Carvalho et al. 1999; Longhi and Cambillau 1999). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Previously cutinases have been isolated from various microorganisms including bacteria (Purdy and Kolattukudy 1975; Chen et al. 2007) and fungi (Fett et al. 1992, 1999). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Further increase in cutinase production to 261 ± 3.0 U/mg protein was observed when medium was supplemented with orange cutin. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Most of the reported cutinases showed highest cutinase production in minimal medium supplied with cutin (Chen et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The production of cutinase is influenced by the type and concentration of carbon and nitrogen sources, culture pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration (Du et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
