</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stem-cell-based bone regeneration was recently considered to be a preferable method to reconstruct bone defects compared to autologous bone grafts or allogeneic bone grafts, which have obvious flaws such as requiring extra surgery or potentially producing a severe immune response1–4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seeded stem cells initiate local bone formation with biomaterials as carriers5–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in vivo osteogenic differentiation potential of seeded bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has been indicated by various studies8–10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, along with the effort to enhance the osteoconductivity of the biomaterials, some researchers have shown that the seeded stem cells exhibit a low survival rate after implantation in vivo 11–15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the in vivo cell fate and the failure of some clinical trials caused by cell deficiency remain unsolved questions regarding clinical approaches16–18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Strategies to improve this situation rely on exploiting innovative biomaterials that could amplify the initial seeding quantity of stem cells while possessing excellent cytocompatibility for maintaining the seeded cells’ viability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Silk fibroin is a biodegradable material with strong mechanical properties, superior biocompatibility, a simple fabrication process and tunable processing parameters19–22; above all, it can be easily fabricated into various forms, such as sponges, films, fibers or gels23, 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our previous study successfully fabricated this material into a hydrogel and scaffold; both have exhibited excellent biocompatibility because they have successfully improved bone regeneration by delivering stem cells and growth factors to the defect area25, 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Notably, the silk-fibroin-based hydrogel allows stem cells to be encapsulated before gelation, and, as a highly hydrated material, it can suspend cells homogeneously within the hydrogel network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This distinguished capacity of the silk hydrogel renders it as a possible carrier to deliver a large quantity of cells to the bone regeneration area27–30. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a silk hydrogel was used to deliver more bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) into the porous three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds to enhance bone regeneration, where the mass of stem cells carried by the silk hydrogel could grow inside the specifically shaped scaffold. In vitro, we tested the transportation rates of small molecules and large proteins into the gel, which might enhance the survival rate of inner seeded BMSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>After osteogenic induction in vitro, the silk gel/scaffold complex containing 1.0 × 107/mL stem cells was implanted into critical-sized calvarial defects in rats to evaluate the bone regeneration effects. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the alizarin red solution can consistently permeate through the silk gel/scaffold complex. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The OD value of the 1 min group was significantly higher that of the control group (p &lt; 0.01), which indicates that the BSA was rapidly absorbed by the complex from the first minute. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Stem-cell-based bone engineering is very promising and opens the possibility of developing cell-carrying materials with optimized abilities to carry as many cells as possible and prolonged lifespans for exerting certain functions in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The conventional cell seeding process relies on the cell to adhere to the scaffold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>In addition to the initial seeded cell quantity used in another study, which varied from 1.0 × 105 to 5.0 × 105, the seeding efficiency was only 50% to 70% because most of the stem cells adhered only at the scaffold’s surfaces and easily fell off31–34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the actual seeding quantity in vivo is beyond prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>We see this utterly inadequate and unstable cell seeding quantity as a huge challenge, combined with the more difficult problem of maintaining the cell quantity for a long period of time after implantation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Based on the evidence that silk fibroin possesses excellent mechanical properties, fine biocompatibility and a controllable degradation rate, scientists have been incubating various cell lines with silk fibroin in the form of films, fibers or porous scaffolds for bone or soft tissue engineering35–39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Among all of those forms made using silk fibroin, we found hydrogel to be an ideal cell carrier because of its high water content, adequate mechanical strength and easily controlled gelation process27–30. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the manufacturing process for producing silk hydrogel allows the mingling of a determined quantity of cells before gelation, which could ensure the initial cell seeding number and allow for optimization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In this study, we quantitatively seeded selective densities of rat BMSCs into the silk hydrogels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The maintained cell viability in the three experiment groups (Fig. 4) demonstrated the marked cytocompatibility of the silk hydrogel. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>We compared the osteogenic potential of these cell containing silk hydrogels and found that silk gels encapsulated with higher cell quantities tended to have better osteogenic potential both in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The 1.0 × 107 group exhibited the highest ALP activity, the most calcium deposition and the strongest osteogenic-related gene expression in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the in vitro experiment, the 1.0 × 107 group showed a clear increase in bone formation in vivo (Figs 6 and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Micro-CT showed that the 1.0 × 107 group had more and faster calcium deposition from the seeded BMSCs, which led to a prominent performance with respect to both new bone volume and trabecular number in the defect area compared to the other two groups (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The histological analysis also confirmed this result, as Van Gieson’s staining for the 1.0 × 107 group showed the highest ratio of new bone area (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>To further confirm that the rapid bone regeneration was produced by the encapsulated BMSCs, we conducted a cell tracing experiment that showed that the encapsulated stem cells maintained their viability and actively participated in the local bone formation process after implantation (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>This comparison of the three experimental groups verifies that the excellent bone formation was primarily a result of the larger quantity of encapsulated stem cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Generally, the 1.0 × 107 group exhibited more mineralization locations in the defect area, providing more cores for calcium nodule formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>More importantly, the long-term in vivo preservation of the viability and function of the encapsulated stem cells in the 1.0 × 107 group guaranteed a continuous bone formation process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (ALP and OCN) in the 1.0 × 107 group was detected to be the strongest among the three groups (Fig. 5), which implies the better osteogenic differentiation potential of single cells when they are in a higher degree of encapsulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the result may be attributed to the enhanced cell–cell interactions in the 1.0 × 107 group (Fig. 3), where this optimization could increase the formation of gap junctions that directly transfer signaling molecules and metabolites between adjacent cells40–42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>In addition, the increased cell quantity may also lead to more cytokines and proteins being secreted into the microenvironment that stimulate cell behavior43, 44. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Conventional cell scaffolds rely on the seeded cells to grow into the center of the defect area, in which the long-term repair process and the insufficient oxygen and nutrients inside the scaffolds make it a challenge to preserve the survival of implanted cells45–48. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>However, the strategy of mingling stem cells with a silk hydrogel before gelation ensures that the cells are homogenously suspended in the material, which leads to mineralization of the entire defect area and reduction of the repair time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>In addition, the silk hydrogel has a permeability that allows the transfer of both small molecules and proteins (Fig. 2) that could nourish the seeded cells to preserve their viability after implantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This study emphasized the crucial role of stem cells in rapid bone regeneration while confirming the cell carrying properties and in vivo long-term cell viability supporting properties of the silk gel/scaffold complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The fast and efficient bone-forming property achieved by the stem-cell-carrying silk hydrogel could be applied to multiple shapes of small defects by simply changing the nature or material of the scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>We have now applied this strategy only to small defect areas to confirm the encapsulated cell functions with respect to rapid bone regeneration; verification of its applicability to large defect repair is still needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Notably, achievements in in vitro osteogenic induction of hydrogel-enwrapped stem cells also hint at the possibility of pre-inducing the encapsulated stem cells into osteogenic progenitor cells to attain calcium deposition and local mineralization before implantation, which might further shorten the time needed for bone regeneration and reduce the risk of in vivo cell necrosis. </plain></SENT>
