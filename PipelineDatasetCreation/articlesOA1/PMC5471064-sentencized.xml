<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Overweight and obesity have been identified as independent risk factors for various cancers including liver cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer and esophagus cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There is also a possible association between obesity and gallbladder, pancreas, thyroid and hematologic malignancies [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>For HCC, research showed that the body mass index (BMI) more than 30 kg/m2 could increase HCC risk [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Besides, HCC mortality rates in male with high BMI are 5 times higher than men of normal weight [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive analysis including 11 studies from Asia, Europe and United States evidenced that both obesity (RR = 1.89) and overweight (RR = 1.17) were closely associated with the development of HCC [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>SEER-Medicare data analysis showed that adjusted OR of obesity for HCC was 1.93 [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer Project (Me-Can) examined 578700 subjects from Austria, Norway and Sweden, showed RR of obesity for the development of HCC was 1.39 [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis of 21 cohort studies demonstrated that the summary RR of HCC with T2DM was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.49-2.31) for patients with chronic liver disease [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>T2DM combined with its relative hyperinsulinemia and hyper-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production may also accelerate the development of HCC [17]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The clinic pathological classification of NAFLD include from extensive isolated steatosis (a milder form of hepatic adipose infiltration) to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (a more severe form of hepatic adipose infiltration). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In 2013, Monda et al. conducted a meta-analysis in African individuals and identified two new loci in GALNT10 and MIR148A-NFE2L3 [37]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>FTO is a common susceptibility gene for BMI in Asian, African and European populations. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>In 2006, the risk variant in TCF7L2 was discovered by a positional linkage strategy in Iceland population [42], which remains the most influential common T2DM variant (allelic OR = ~1.46) [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Then it was successfully validated by several other GWASs [44â46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Soon, multiple T2DM loci were discovered by independent GWASs, such as SLC16A11, CDKAL1, FTO, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, PPARG, SLC30A8 et al.[44, 45, 47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>DIAGRAM conducted the first meta-analysis on T2DM comprising 10,128 European individuals at the discovery stage and identified six novel loci including ADAMTS9, CDC123-CAMK1D, JAZF1, NOTCH2, TSPAN8-LGR5, and THADA [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The second meta-analysis by DIAGRAM had a sample size of 8130 cases and 38,987 controls of European descent. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Of 200 loci associated with T2DM and 400 loci associated with standard measures of adiposity, merely 11 loci are shared (CDKAL1, FTO, GIPR, KCNQ1, LINGO2, LYPLAL1, MC4R, TMEM18, GRB14, RREB1 and ZNF608), which may do not include shared associations below the level of genome-wide statistical significance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>The past 8 years of genetic discoveries brought about by the GWASs approach have meant a giant leap for genetic research of complex traits, with more than 288 genetic loci shown to associate with metabolic traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Yet, the major part of the genetic predisposition to these phenotypes remains unaccounted since the proportion of variance explained by genetic risk variants discovered to date is limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Implicit in the initial design, GWASs-identified variants in metabolic syndrome and related cancer are common (minor allele frequency &gt;5% in the population). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>There has been much focus on this missing heritability [72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The rare alleles with large effects are the primary drivers of common disease, which has received renewed attention. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In addition, systemic integration of complex date obtained from other âomicsâ such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, and modeling research for composite effect on the integrate common metabolic phenotype, is projected to be a breakthrough in the research of genetic determinants of metabolic traits. </plain></SENT>
