</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A profitable beef cattle production system requires high reproductive efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Acceptable female fertility rates depend on an in-depth understanding of endocrine, cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Hormonal variations during each bovine estrous cycle induce uterine changes that are crucial for uterine receptivity for conceptus development and implantation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of plasmatic progesterone (P4) immediately after conception are related to advanced conceptus elongation [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent studies have shown that low plasmatic concentrations of P4 are associated with a suboptimal uterine environment for conceptus (or blastocyst) development [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a positive association exists between the probability of a successful pregnancy and plasma concentrations of P4 at D7 after estrus in both dairy and beef cows [4, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, the identities of molecules and mechanisms responsible for triggering the latter phenomena need further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this context, information on the involvement of amino acid (AA) transport and metabolic pathways and availability to the embryo during early diestrus remains limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>During the first two weeks of pregnancy, before implantation, the conceptus depends exclusively on the intrauterine milieu created by the endometrial secretions or molecules transported into the lumen by the uterine endometrium prior to implantation and placentation [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Amino acids are important components of these maternally derived secretions that are crucial for embryonic survival mainly during early pregnancy [8–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Optimal amounts of essential and non-essential AAs are important for embryonic development, which is altered in case of suboptimal amounts of these molecules [13–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The regulation of AA transport and concentration in cells and tissues, including the placenta and endometrium, depends on specific transport proteins [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>There is no consistent information regarding the regulation of protein synthesis and the activity of AA transporters; however, changes in transcriptional profiles of AA transporters reveal changes in AA availability in the uterine lumen [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, AA transporter gene expression increases simultaneously in maternal endometrium and conceptus cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This indicates transport of AAs from the maternal circulation to the endometrial lumen exclusively for embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Amino acids seem to be indispensable for embryonic survival and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>When non-essential AAs were completely removed from the medium, blastocyst growth drastically decreased [14]; the same was observed in medium with any combination of glucose and phosphate without AAs [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, P4 infusion in animals with no CL and no follicle increased AA availability in the uterus and maternal plasma of cows [17] and gene expression of AA transporters in ovine and bovine endometria [8, 12, 18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>During early embryonic development in vitro, AA requirements seem to change [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Until the blastocyst stage, an excess of essential AAs seems to be detrimental for embryonic development, at least in vitro [13]; however, the absence of non-essential AAs in the culture medium is unfavorable for embryonic development [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>During the blastocyst expansion stage, few changes were observed in AA turnover during embryo culture [20], when patterns of AA depletion and release were similar to those observed in vitro for pre-elongation embryos [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, AA turnover has been identified as an indicator of embryonic viability in humans and cattle [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Another relevant finding is that enzymes present in endometrial tissue can regulate AA synthesis or degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These enzymes are not characterized in the bovine endometrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In other tissues, DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) catalyzes the deamination of alanine and aspartate [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>SCLY (selenocysteine lyase) is involved in the production of alanine and elemental selenium from selenocysteine [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>In this context, AA uterine transport and luminal availability emerge as important variables that might play a role in maternal and embryonic well-being. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>However, there is limited information available on how changes in the pre- and post-ovulatory endocrine milieu affect the transport of AAs from the maternal circulation to endometrial cells and finally to the uterine lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the size of the POF and subsequent physiological circulating concentrations of P4 in early diestrus modulate endometrial expression of AA transporter protein pathways. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We recently described a model to manipulate preovulatory follicle growth to produce groups of cyclic beef cows with distinctly different circulating preovulatory concentrations of E2 and early diestrus concentrations of P4 [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Based on the contrasting ovarian and endocrine characteristics of these two groups of animals, we studied the following variables on both D4 and D7 of the estrous cycle: (1) transcript abundance of AA transporters in endometrial tissues; (2) transcript abundance of enzymes related to AA metabolism in endometrial tissues; and (3) uterine luminal concentrations of AA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Previous studies indicated that the phenotype of smaller follicles and short proestrus was associated with lower receptivity and capacity to support conceptus development in comparison with a group manipulated to have a longer proestrus and ovulate a larger follicle [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We focused on D4 and D7 for our investigation because it is around D4-5 that the embryo moves from the oviduct to the uterus; thus, from this moment until implantation (i.e., D20 in cattle) the embryo depends exclusively on endometrial secretions for its development [28–30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Moreover, most embryonic losses occur during the two first weeks of pregnancy [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mechanistic insights retrieved from this animal model could serve as a potential basis for future strategies to fine-tune maternal receptivity towards the embryo. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Disappointing fertility success in the beef cow industry is mainly caused by excessive rates of embryonic mortality during early pregnancy, which has been linked to inadequate endometrial receptivity [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>During early pregnancy, the mother needs to provide the optimal uterine microenvironment for the embryo in order to facilitate initial embryonic-maternal interactions leading to subsequent implantation [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, the exact definition of a microenvironment optimal for the proper development of embryos during early pregnancy remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>As previous studies pointed towards the importance of greater concentrations of AA in the uterus to increase fertility outcome in dairy cows [9], this study attempted to investigate the link between AA metabolic pathways and uterine function to support embryo growth during early diestrus in beef cows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we characterized AA transport and metabolic pathways in the endometrium and AA levels in the uterine lumen on D4 and D7 after induction of ovulation in response to different endocrine profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study was conducted in cyclic, non-inseminated cows based on the previous report by Forde et al. [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In that report, the authors indicated that from the first week of diestrus until after D13, the pregnant cow endometrium undergoes molecular changes similar to those of the cyclic cow endometrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Thus, because sample collection was conducted on D4 and D7, it is reasonable to assume that the treatment effects observed in the present report would be similar were the animals pregnant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In this context, a previously described in vivo receptivity model was used here [26, 32, 36, 38], aiming to define the AA signatures of the receptive endometrial tissues and histotroph. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Using the same model, we were able to manipulate two fundamental aspects of receptivity: compared to the LF-LCL group, fertility was lower in the SF-SCL group (i.e., the low receptivity group) [27], and the concentration of PGR in the endometrium was greater in the same group on D7 of the estrous cycle [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>More specifically, data on the bovine endometrial tissue transcriptome associated with AA transport have been integrated with information on uterine flushing AA profiles from highly receptive (LF-LCL) versus low-receptive (SF-SCL) groups of cows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>In beef cattle, altered endocrine patterns during follicle growth are known to influence the follicular size and steroidogenic capacity before ovulation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Thereby, corpora lutea originating from larger follicles are characterized by larger sizes, resulting in greater circulating concentrations of P4 compared to those originating from smaller follicles [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>In our study, POF influenced CL size and plasmatic levels of P4 on D7 but not on D4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>It is important to mention that CL is a transient endocrine organ that starts to develop after ovulation, when theca and granulosa cells differentiate into luteal cells [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The D4 and D7 CL are considered to be in different stages of development [48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Specifically, at D4, the CL is under early development and did not achieve a large enough area to show differences in P4 production as it did on D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, gene expression related to P4 production indicated a greater capacity for P4 production at D7 than at D4 [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In cattle, POF size is directly related to E2 production [50, 51], suggesting that POF size and probably circulating concentrations of E2 influence the uterine environment and endometrial gene expression on D4 and D7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The uterine flushing AA signatures show that on D4, concentrations of taurine, alanine and α-aminobutyric acid in uterine luminal flushings were greater in the SF-SCL group, which in this animal model represents the low-receptive uterus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>The mRNA of SCLY, the enzyme related to alanine production, was up-regulated in the LF-LCL group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SLC6A6 mRNA, which transports β-alanine and mainly taurine, was more abundant in the endometrium of cows from the LF-LCL group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>A collective interpretation of these data suggests that (1) alanine biosynthesis was stimulated in the LF-LCL group and that (2) alanine transport was stimulated in the LF-LCL group, mainly in a lumen-to-endometrium direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Stimulating accumulation of alanine in the endometrium may be important for endometrial cellular functions, such as proliferation, to guarantee endometrial receptivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, in accordance with data on cardiomyocytes, excess supplementation of AA may downregulate their transporters [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This relationship could explain the findings in the SF-SCL group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Although early bovine embryos are purported to use all available AAs, alanine is unique in that it is not used and is even secreted by the embryo [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This suggests that regulation of this AA, which is available in greater concentrations in low-receptive than in high-receptive uteri, plays no major role in early embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Taurine, which was more abundant in the SF-SCL group, seems to be beneficial for embryonic development [54]; however, the addition of an elevated dose of cysteamine, a taurine precursor, to embryo culture media was toxic to the bovine embryo [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Supplementation of α-aminobutyric acid in the embryo culture medium did not affect porcine embryo cell viability [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Similar to the alanine transporter, SLC38A1 is a transporter with high affinity for glutamine and is more abundant in high-receptive endometrial tissue than in low-receptive tissue, whereas glutamine tended to be more abundant in uterine washings of the low-receptive group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>These data can be associated with the major proliferative activity found in the LF-LCL endometrium on D4, which was related to adequate uterus conditioning for receiving the embryo [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>This proliferative activity may also be responsible for the observation of an increase in transporter abundance without an associated increase in the concentration of the target substrate in the uterine lumen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Indeed, glutamine is essential for cell proliferation in other tissues [57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>On D7, regulation of AA transporter transcript abundance and cognate substrates is complex, and several scenarios were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>For example, SLC1A4 was more abundant in the endometrium of LF-LCL cows, although its direct targets, serine, tyrosine, threonine, were present in similar concentrations in the uterine lumen of cows of both groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Likewise, SLC38A1 and SLC38A7 transcripts were up-regulated in the endometrium of the LF-LCL group on D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>These transporters have high affinity for glutamine transport, but this AA was present in similar concentrations in the uterine lumen of both groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In contrast, regardless of a similar abundance of the transporter SLC7A11 between groups on D4 and D7, cystathionine, a product of serine and homocysteine condensation by cystathionine β-synthase [58], and valine were present in greater concentrations in the uterine washings of cows from the LF-LCL group compared to cows from the SF-SLC group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In a third scenario, SLC6A14 and one of its transporting targets, valine, were stimulated in the LF-LCL group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, in the human cervix, an increase in SLC6A14 mRNA was associated with a parallel increase in protein [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, after the 4-cell stage, valine, along with leucine, isoleucine, and methionine, was favorable for the cleavage rates of the diploids after compaction and increased the total number of cells in the blastocyst and inner cell mass [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>SLC7A8 transcript was up-regulated in the LF-LCL endometrium on D7, and this carrier transports neutral AAs such as valine, which is also up-regulated in the LF-LCL group. SLC7A8 is also responsible for alanine transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the concentration of alanine in uterine washings is similar for both groups, the transcript abundance of DDO, an enzyme related to alanine degradation, is up-regulated in LF-LCL group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Perhaps there is a requirement to strictly control luminal concentrations of alanine on D7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In this study, AA concentrations were quantified using uterine washings, composed of histotroph diluted in 20 mL of PBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Such a method of quantification is appropriate for estimating AA availability in the uterus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the present data suggest that in the more receptive uterine phenotype, on D4, AA transport and metabolic pathways are directed to supply endometrial requirements for growth and function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Coincidentally, around D4, embryos have a limited demand for AAs, and they are in transit from the oviduct to the uterus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Thus, the AA composition of the histotroph reflects the endometrial demands for proper function more than a milieu for embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>More interestingly, on D7, when the embryo is expected to be in the uterus, AAs are more abundant in the uterine secretions of the LF-LCL group, probably to serve as a supply to meet embryonic requirements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, transcript abundance data show a greater number of AA transporters that are up-regulated in the more receptive endometrium on D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This phenotype is probably associated with the greater AA requirement for the subsequent stages of embryonic development (i.e., hatching and elongation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In terms of sex steroid regulation of such processes, the phenotype on D4 reflects classical actions of estradiol that include stimulation of endometrial cell proliferation, while the phenotype on D7 is associated with actions of progesterone, such as glandular secretory activity and histotroph formation to support embryonic growth [4, 39, 61–63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>A summarized view of the AA transport systems in the endometrium in association with receptivity during early diestrus is presented in Fig. 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation that relates early diestrus temporal changes in AA transport and availability in the uterine lumen to different periovulatory endocrine patterns that characterize fertility phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>This study points to an important link between AA metabolic pathways in the endometrium and uterine receptivity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>In addition, these data can serve as a basis for novel studies in bovine reproduction biotechnology with the aim of developing new tools to improve beef cattle fertility and profitability. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>This study showed that the transcript abundance of AA transporters in the endometrium is linked with the receptive state of the endometrial tissue at both D4 and D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the AA patterns in uterine flushings differ between contrasting receptivity status of cows, both at D4 and at D7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The latter data indicate that AA metabolism and transport may be a potential key that needs to be regulated in order to fine-tune the maternal receptive state during early diestrus. </plain></SENT>
