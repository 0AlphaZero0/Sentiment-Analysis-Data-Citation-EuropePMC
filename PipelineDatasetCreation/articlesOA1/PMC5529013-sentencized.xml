</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworm Necator americanus are the three major soil-transmitted helminths (STH) that infect more than one billion poor people in the world and are the leading neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 indicate that approximately 761 million people are chronically infected with A. lumbricoides, resulting in 2,700 annual deaths from ascariasis [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Global control of STH infections depends on the mass drug administration of anthelminthics such as albendazole or mebendazole targeting children between the ages of 1–14 years [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the rapid rates of post-treatment re-infection [5], potential drug resistance [6], low treatment coverage for children [7], and low access to clean water [8] compromise the effect of anthelminthics alone as a suitable means to control or eliminate STH infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Indeed, two systematic reviews have largely failed to confirm the beneficial effects of periodic deworming [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Thus, the development of a multivalent pan-anthelminthic vaccine targeting all three major STH infections would be a desirable biotechnology to prevent parasite reinfection and advance efforts for the control and elimination of these diseases [11].To advance such a strategy, two major N. americanus hookworm vaccine antigens are undergoing clinical vaccine tests, but there is a need to simultaneously develop A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura candidate antigens as suitable vaccines to be integrated within the human hookworm vaccine development program [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>With regard to the development of A. lumbricoides vaccine antigens, the genetically highly homologous pig parasite, Ascaris suum, is commonly used as a model to identify and evaluate vaccine candidates. A. suum and A. lumbricoides are morphologically, immunologically, and genetically very similar [13, 14] and might even be subspecies variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Indeed, A. suum has been shown to be an important cause of human ascariasis [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similar to its natural host, the pig, mice can be infected with A. suum eggs and larvae will be released into the mouse intestine from which they will migrate to the lungs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>However, in mice, these larvae cannot return to the intestine to develop into adult Ascaris worms [16–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the mouse model has proven to be a valuable tool in the identification and evaluation of vaccine candidates against Ascaris infections [19–21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Indeed, mice infected with A. suum eggs produced significant protection against A. suum egg challenge as judged by the significant reduction in the number of larvae migrating to the lungs or livers [19, 20, 22] and also by reduced lung pathology [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Using serum from infected mice or rabbit, several immunodominant antigens have been identified including As16 [20], As14 [19], As24 [24], As37 [21] and As-Enol (enolase) [25], and protective immunity has been induced by immunization with recombinant proteins [19, 20, 26, 27] and with DNA [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>As14 and As16 were the first two antigens previously identified by the Tsuji lab through immunoscreening of an A. suum cDNA library with serum from Ascaris infected rabbit [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>They share 47% amino acid sequence identity and similar localization (in larva and adult stages, as well as in excretory/excretory products) [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Intranasal immunization with Escherichia coli expressed recombinant As16 and As14 conjugated with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) produced significant protection against A. suum infective egg challenge in mice [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, rAs16 induced protection in a pig animal model [29], and mice fed with As16-transgenic rice mixed with CTB were also protected against A. suum infection [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>As14 fused with CTB was also successfully expressed in transgenic rice, but there was no oral immunization and protection reported [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Notably though, without CTB as the adjuvant, neither As16 nor As14 were able to induce protective immunity in any model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the production of recombinant As16 and As14 in the yeast Pichia pastoris, a eukaryotic expression system with scalability and without the concern for endotoxin contamination as in E. coli-expressed proteins [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Mice immunized with yeast-expressed rAs16 mounted a Th2-biased immune response and showed significant protection in terms of lung larval reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However, the same immunization regime for rAs14 did not induce any protection in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The immunological mechanisms underlying rAs16-induced protection were evaluated compared to rAs14 that did not induce protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The results in this study provide a feasible approach to developing a vaccine against ascariasis on the basis of the yeast-expressed rAs16 that can be produced at low cost and formulated with alum, an FDA-approved adjuvant for human use that induces the Th2 immune response necessary to achieve anti-Ascaris immunity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>A. suum larval stage antigens induce significant protection through the reduction of worm larvae migrating to the lungs and thus subsequently reduce lung pathology [17, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed in this study that almost sterile protection with up to 99.6% lung larval reduction upon A. suum egg challenge was observed in mice infected three times with 1,000 A. suum eggs, indicating A. suum larvae produce some antigens that induce protective immunity during the migration of the L3 larvae to the lungs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these larval antigens recognized by the immune serum from low-dose Ascaris egg-infected mice constitute potential vaccine antigen candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, As16 and As14 had been identified as two such possible targets; immunization with the E. coli-expressed recombinant rAs16 or rAs14 proteins induced protective immunity in mice when adjuvanted with the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and administered through the intranasal route [19, 20, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in this study we identified that the protective immune sera from mice infected with A. suum eggs strongly recognized rAs16, confirming that As16 is an antigen which exposes to the host immune system and is immunogenic during A. suum infection, and the immune response to As16 may contribute to the protective immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, we confirmed that As16 is expressed in larvae, not in eggs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>However, we did not observe that As14 was recognized by the A. suum-infected mouse immune sera and accordingly the immunization of As14 didn’t elicit any protective immunity against A. suum infection in this study, indicating that exposure of antigen is required for inducing protective immunity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>To develop a vaccine that can be used cost-effectively in endemic areas, we expressed As16 and As14 as recombinant proteins in the yeast P. pastoris X-33, a process that can be easily scaled up and manufactured without concerns for endotoxin contamination from proteins expressed in E. coli [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The purified rAs16 and rAs14 were used to test their vaccine efficacy in mice through subcutaneous administration when formulated with adjuvant ISA720. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We found that mice immunized with yeast-expressed rAs16 produced a 36.7% lung larva reduction which is statistically significant compared to the adjuvant-only control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>This level of protection was reproducible in another experiment with rAs16 formulated with Alhydrogel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In addition to the reduced number of larvae migrating to the lung, we also observed developmental stunting in those larvae that migrated to the lungs, suggesting immune responses induced by rAs16 damage the larvae’s viability and/or impair the development of survived larvae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>We notice that As16 formulated with ISA720 and alum induced less lung larval reduction (36.7–38.9%) in this study compared to previous 58% induced by intranasal administration of As16 conjugated CBT as adjuvant in the previous study [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>It is possibly due to the different adjuvants, immunization route or the post-translational modification of rAs16 expressed in E. coli and P. pastoris system that may induce different immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The intranasal immunization may induce mucosal immunity in respiratory ducts that may contribute to the better protection against larva migrated to lungs [20], but there is no evidence that intranasal immunization could induce mucosal immunity in the gut in which the adult Ascaris worms parasitize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>CTB is a nontoxic portion of cholera toxin, a toxin that causes massive watery diarrhea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>CTB has the capacity not only to bind to monosialotetrahexosylganglioside on epithelia or antigen presenting cells to induce immune response as an adjuvant, but also to evoke a regulatory response that causes safety concern [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Therefore CTB is not widely used as an adjuvant for a human vaccine test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>The effect of CBT as an adjuvant on inducing intestinal immunity against gastrointestinal pathogens through oral immunization is not well determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>The mice fed with rice transgenic with As16-CTB fusion were not able to induce enough immune response against A. suum infection unless CT was added [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Here we report mice subcutaneously immunized with As16 formulated with ISA720 and alum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The latter is a commonly used adjuvant approved by FDA for human use at low cost, and produced significant larval reduction in lungs upon A. suum infection, making As16 feasible and practical to be used for human trial. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of protection induced by rAs16 remains under investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Possibly A. suum larva-secreted As16 is critical for the survival and development of the A. suum larvae in mammalian hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the neutralization of this antigen through specific antibodies or other components of the immune responses may weaken the viability of the migrating larvae and block them from reaching the lungs, a critical step in migration back to intestine to develop to adult worms [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that anti-As16 antibodies inhibited the molting and survival of infective L3 when co-incubated together in vitro [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>More specifically, immune-mediated protection appears to be associated with high levels of antigen-specific IgG1 and Th1/2 type cytokine secretion including elevated IL-4, IL-10 and INF-γ in previous studies [20, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>We observed that immunization with rAs16 formulated with ISA720 induced much higher antibody titers of IgG1 than IgG2a (2662:1) and elevated IL-4 and IL-5 but without any detectable IFN-γ response, indicating that the protection induced by immunization with rAs16 formulated with ISA720 in this study is associated with predominant Th2-type response rather than Th1-type response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>IL-2 and IL-10 were also observed to be induced upon the immunization of As16 formulated with ISA720. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Even though IL-2 is considered a Th1-biased cytokine, it also plays a central role in Th2 differentiation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>IL-10 has been essentially re-classified as a Treg-associated cytokine [44], but it is not clear if IL-10 is involved in the protective immunity since IL-10 was not induced in mice immunized with As16 formulated with Alhydrogel that produced similar protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The protection of mice immunized with As16 formulated with Alhydrogel was associated with high level of IgG1 and IL-5, further confirming the Th2-type immune responses contribute mainly to the protective immunity of As16 against A. suum infection, This finding is consistent with other studies showing that a Th2-type response is critical in achieving protective immunity against helminthic infections [45–47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>As the second vaccine antigen candidate investigated in this study, As14 shares 47% sequence identical with As16 and produced protection in immunized mice when formulated with CTB in our previous study [19], we did not see any protection with immunization with As14 formulated with ISA720 adjuvant in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>We did confirm expression of the antigen in A. suum larvae as well as strong immunogenicity when immunized in mice, but As14 was not recognized by immune sera from A. suum infected mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that As14 might not be exposed to the host immune system during infection so that immune response could not access it, or it might trigger a Th1-type immune response characterized with high level of IFN-γ that is not related to protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Another possibility for not seeing protection with As14 immunization plus ISA720 in this study is that As14 may only induce protection when formulated with CBT and administered through the intranasal route that induces mucosal immunization [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Immunization with rAs16 alone, without an adjuvant, is not sufficient to yield protective immunity [20, 29], indicating that an adjuvant is necessary for boosting the rAs16-associated immune response or inducing a certain type of immune response that relates to protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Since CBT may not be a suitable adjuvant for use in humans, we have tried some other adjuvants that are used commonly in vaccine efficacy tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>ISA720 is a water-in-oil emulsion that has been used in clinical trials for malaria vaccines and other infections [48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In this study, immunization with rAs16 emulsified with ISA720 induced a strong Th2-type immune response that was associated with lung larva reduction in immunized mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>To further interpret the protective immunological mechanism underlying the protection induced by As16, three other adjuvants (Alhydrogel, MPLA and AddaVax) were formulated with rAs16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Alhydrogel, an alum-based adjuvant approved by the FDA for use in humans, is known to stimulate a Th2-type response [50, 51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>MPLA (Monophosphoryl Lipid A) is a potent activator of TLR4 that boosts a combined Th1/Th2 response [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>AddaVax is a squalene-based oil-in-water nano-emulsion adjuvant similar to MF59 that has been licensed in Europe for flu vaccines with the ability to induce a balanced Th1/Th2-type response [53, 54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Our studies revealed that mice immunized with 25 μg of rAs16 formulated with Alhydrogel produced a similar level of lung larva reduction (38.9%) as observed with 50 μg of rAs16 formulated with ISA720 (36.7%); accompanied by high levels of IgG1 and IL-5, but without IFN-γ or TNF-α production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Immunization with rAs16 formulated with MPLA or AddaVax induced a mixed Th1/2-type responses, with high levels of both Th1 associated cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and Th2 type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10) and IL-2; however, this, at best, only resulted in a 26.1% larva reduction, which was not statistically different from the controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that a Th1-type response might be counterproductive in terms of achieving protective immunity and might even interfere with the desired Th2-type response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Some evidence showed that IL-12 and IFNγ suppressed Th2 responses that caused chronic helminth and plasmodium co-infection [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>In Schistosoma infections, Th1-type response did not contribute to protective immunity, but caused serious inflammatory pathology in the liver [56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Other studies have found that the Th2-polarized protection induced by some nematode infections actually downregulated the Th1-type response [47, 57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mice immunized with ISA720 and Alhydrogel formulated rAs16 that showed protection against A. suum egg challenge were all found to have high levels of IL-5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>IL-5 plays a major role in the regulation of eosinophil formation, maturation, recruitment and survival [58]; eosinophils have been identified as important contributors in the control of helminth infections in mammalian hosts [59, 60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>IL-5 knockout mice, for instance, were incapable of augmenting blood and tissue eosinophil levels and were diminished in their ability to kill Strongyloides stercoralis larvae through innate and adaptive immune responses [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Thus, the induction of IL-5 in the immunized mice may recruit and activate eosinophils towards the migrating larvae and damage the parasite through antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or through releasing toxic granules [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In addition to IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was also elevated in protected mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In helminth infections, GM-CSF is known as a potent stimulator of granulocytes, namely eosinophils, basophils, and dendritic cells [62], all serving as first responders to the parasites [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that activated murine eosinophils can serve as specific antigen-presenting cells after infection with the cestode Mesocestoides corti [63], prime naïve T cells, and aid in the maturation of antigen-specific T-cells, for example upon S. stercoralis infection [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>However, it cannot be concluded whether IL-5 or GM-CSF are involved in the protection since mice immunized with As16 formulated with MPLA and AddaVax also showed similar levels of IL-5 and GM-CSF but did not elicit significant protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The real roles of IL-5 and GM-CSF in the As16 immunity may be more complicated and may associate with other factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>We confirmed in this study that As16 is a good target for vaccine development against ascariasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>However, the As16-induced protection is not complete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Compared to the sterile immunity induced by A. suum infection, the partial protective immunity induced by As16 may reflect that As16 is just one of the larva-secreted protective antigens secreted by infected larvae, or trickling release of As16 from naturally infected larva may increase the immunogenicity and protection of As16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Non-sterile immunity or low protection rate is a common problem for vaccine development against helminth infections [65, 66], possibly due to the complexity of the life cycle of parasites, different antigens expressed by different stages, and immune-evasion strategies developed by helminths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, the severity of helminth-caused diseases usually depends on worm burden, since low infection usually is asymptomatic [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Therefore, reducing the worm burden by vaccination, even not sterile, may benefit in reducing the seriousness of disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>To further increase the level of protection elicited by As16, its combination with other vaccine candidates such as As24 [26], As37 [21], and As-enolase [11, 25] is currently being investigated in a mouse model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The individual or combination of antigens will eventually be evaluated in a pig model, the permissive host of A. suum in which adult worms can be developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>As16 and other vaccine candidates are expected to be more effective at reducing worm burden in a pig model since most of these antigens are expressed on the both stages of larva and adult worm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>The ultimate goal is to develop a multivalent vaccine or vaccine combination with other STH vaccines such as Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1, which are currently under clinical trial for preventing hookworm infection [12], to prevent infections or re-infections of more than one STH, as a complementary strategy for MDA to control STH endemic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The combination of different antigens from different STHs may increase protective immunity due to cross-protection since STHs are genetically related and share some sequence homology [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The individuals in endemic areas are usually repeatedly infected with Ascaris and other STHs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>The existing immune responses to the infections may confound the vaccine efficacy; therefore the vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy should be tested in a re-infection animal model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Another concern for As16 as a surface-associated antigen of larval is IgE response during natural infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Immunization of As16 and other larval antigens in individuals with existing IgE may induce allergic response as hookworm larva-secreted Na-ASP-2 does [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Therefore, immunoscreening for the IgE response in the endemic population is needed before the decision is made to use As16 for a vaccine trial in endemic area. </plain></SENT>
