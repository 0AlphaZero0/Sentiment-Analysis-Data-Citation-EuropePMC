<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tumor cells escape from immune response by deploying immunosuppressive mechanisms such as immune checkpoints.2 These ligand–receptor interaction-mediated checkpoints modulate the amplitude and duration of immune response and act as a natural “brake” of the immune system to maintain self-tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Targeting and modulating the immune checkpoint proteins by antibodies has become a powerful therapeutic strategy for anticancer immunotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A major therapeutic target is the immune checkpoint axis of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1 and CD279) and its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1 and CD274). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a number of cancers including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung, breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, PD-L1 expression has been shown to be upregulated constitutively3 or due to inflammation in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to deactivation of PD-1-expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that results in immune suppression.2 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cancer treatments targeting immune checkpoints have shown robust and durable clinical responses that lead to long-term survival in some patients.2 Several immune checkpoint targeting antibody therapeutics have received Food and Drug Administration approval. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PD-L1 targeting antibodies such as MPDL3280A (atezolizumab), MEDI4736 (durvalumab), and Avelumab have demonstrated anticancer activity in multiple tumor types including advanced melanoma,4 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),5 RCC,6 and bladder cancer.7 Nearly 70% of patients with cancer do not respond to checkpoint blockade therapies, however. There is a pressing clinical need to accurately predict which patients are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Methods of monitoring conventional cancer therapy can be confounding to measure immunotherapy response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For example, tumor shrinkage is initially observed in only ∼10% patients with immunotherapy but is a typical positive response with cytotoxic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Delayed response to therapy following initial increase in tumor burden is also observed in some patients, indicative of immune-mediated response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, it is known from biopsy specimens of tumors from patients undergoing immune checkpoint therapy that PD-L1 expression within the TME is relevant to achievement of response.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Currently, PD-L1 expression in the tumors is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Food and Drug Administration has recently approved 2 IHC companion diagnostic tests (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx and PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, PD-L1 IHC has considerable inadequacies such as variable criteria for quantification, different antibodies for detection, variability in tissue preparation and processing, and heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression in primary tumors and in metastatic lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Also, it is impractical to perform repeated biopsy to monitor therapy response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these limitations are compounded in patients with advanced stage disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that noninvasive imaging could be a complementary and superior tool to determine in vivo PD-L1 expression in all the lesions in entirety, providing more accurate assessment of PD-L1 for therapy management. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>For noninvasive detection of PD-L1, we chose atezolizumab from Genentech (San Francisco, CA) due to its extensive clinical use in cancer immunotherapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Atezolizumab is an effector function deficient humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody with impaired binding to Fcγ receptor that minimizes depletion of PD-L1-positive tumor-specific T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Atezolizumab has high binding affinity toward human (dissociation constant K d = 0.43 nM) and mouse PD-L1 (K d = 0.13 nM),7,9 thus providing an opportunity to relate preclinical and clinical observations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To begin with, we developed atezolizumab radiolabeled with indium 111 ([111In]atezolizumab) and conjugated with Licor 800 near-infrared dye (NIR-atezolizumab) for evaluation of PD-L1 expression. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We further validated [111In]atezolizumab in xenograft models with clinically relevant PD-L1 expression levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Specificity of [111In]atezolizumab was confirmed in orthotopic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (MDAMB231 PD-L1 high and SUM149 PD-L1 low) and NSCLC (H2444 PD-L1 high and H1155 PD-L1 low) xenografts expressing varying levels of PD-L1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>To develop PD-L1-targeting PET tracer, we conjugated atezolizumab with 2,2′,2″-(10-(2,6-dioxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid (DOTAGA anhydrate), and radiolabeled with copper-64 to prepare [64Cu]atezolizumab.11 The PD-L1 specificity of [64Cu]atezolizumab was assessed in vitro in multiple cell lines with varying PD-L1 expression which demonstrated a strong correlation (R = .997) between [64Cu]atezolizumab uptake and PD-L1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Next, we performed PET/CT imaging in NSG mice with hPD-L1 and control CHO tumors which evidently demonstrated increased uptake of [64Cu]atezolizumab in hPD-L1 tumor compared to the control tumor (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Since atezolizumab is cross-reactive to human and mouse PD-L1, we took advantage of this dual affinity to evaluate tumor PD-L1 in the presence of an active immune system, parts of which also express PD-L1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>PET and biodistribution of [64Cu]atezolizumab was performed in immunocompetent Balb/C mice harboring the syngeneic 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma expressing mouse PD-L1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Radioactivity was also detected in tissues with known endogenous PD-L1 expression such as lymph nodes, liver, brown adipose tissue, and spleen, with 4T1 tumors showing much higher uptake of [64Cu]atezolizumab than those tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Since PD-L1-positive TILs may also partially contribute to the uptake of [64Cu]atezolizumab in the TME, we quantified the amount of TILs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Ex vivo analysis of 4T1 tumor cell suspension by flow cytometry revealed that only minor proportion (∼6%) of TILs is PD-L1 positive, indicating that [64Cu]atezolizumab accumulation in the TME was mostly associated with PD-L1 expression on 4T1 tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Apart from the above described published studies conducted in primary tumors, we also tested the feasibility of PD-L1 PET with [64Cu]atezolizumab in a breast cancer lung metastasis model. </plain></SENT>
