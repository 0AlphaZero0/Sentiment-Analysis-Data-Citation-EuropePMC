</text></title><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug reactions (ADR) constitute some of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that ADR account for more than 5% of hospital admissions, 28% of emergency department visits and 5% of deaths during hospitalization [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Thus, ADR caused approximately 200,000 deaths per year in Europe and generated costs of 79 million euros in 2015 alone [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous reporting of ADR is the backbone of the pharmacovigilance system and has been proven to play a role in identifying signs related to drug safety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Descriptions of the safety profiles of drugs during clinical development are not exhaustive and do not reflect potentially late or rare occurrences of ADR [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous reporting by health care professionals in subsequent post-marketing settings is the greatest source of drug safety data [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, under-reporting of ADR is a key limitation of the efficiency of pharmacovigilance systems, and spontaneous reporting by patients is now recognized as a new source of information for these systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A recent review of the academic literature confirmed that patient reporting adds new information about ADR: such reporting provides a more detailed description of ADR that differs in terms of the nature of the reaction and the suspected drugs involved [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the Netherlands from 2010 to 2015, patients made important contributions by reporting 26% of all ADR reports [3, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The Danish Medicines Agency published a report on ADR reported by consumers compared with reports from health care professionals covering the period from 2003 to 2011 and showed that consumer reports contribute significantly to the total number of ADR reports, both quantitatively and qualitatively [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Patient self-reporting was also investigated in the United Kingdom (UK) in the UK’s Yellow Card Scheme from 2005 to 2007, and the results also suggested that patient reporting provides a positive complementary contribution to health professional reporting [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In France, during the pandemic influenza vaccination campaign in 2009–2010, a pharmacovigilance plan was introduced following the recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>For the first time in France, patients were able to report ADR concerning the pandemic vaccine directly to pharmacovigilance centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This study revealed no major qualitative differences between patients’ and health professionals’ reports [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Despite growing interest and acceptance of ADR reporting by patients [10, 11], few studies have validated the relevance of data from patient notifications [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Health authorities in 44 countries currently emphasize spontaneous ADR notifications by patients and the need for a more accessible reporting system [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>According to new European legislation (Directive 2010/84/EU), member states are required to establish an ADR reporting system for patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Since 2011, patients in France have been able to self-report their ADR without involving a health professional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The French pharmacovigilance system is based on 31 regional drug monitoring centers and a dedicated unit of the French Agency “Agence nationale de la sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM).” Patients can report ADR either directly to ANSM via a form that is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ansm.sante.fr">http://ansm.sante.fr</ext-link>/ or to a regional center electronically or by telephone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, patient reporting in France remains underdeveloped, and its availability is not widely known by the general population [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>For example, in 2014, ADR reported by patients represented 4.5% of all reports, compared with 10% in Europe, according to data from the French National Database of Pharmacovigilance [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Most patients remain unaware of reporting systems or are confused about reporting [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Therefore, “e-health” applications could be a convenient method to more closely connect with patients [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that the use of mobile applications to report adverse events, such as those related to a medical device, can save time and increase the number of notifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>On average, there were 15 times more reports submitted per month via the App MedWatch® with patient community support than submitted via traditional pharmacovigilance portals [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In 2016, it was estimated that 50% of the population and 99% of young physicians in France own a smartphone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The most widely used medical Apps by young physicians are Apps related to drugs (drug database, drug interaction database) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>A smartphone/tablet application seems to be a necessity for modern pharmacovigilance approaches (i.e., MedWatcher® in USA or YellowCArd® in UK). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In France, several applications dedicated to ADR reporting are available on the market (i.e., VigiBip®, My e-Report®, Medisafe®), but these applications are not yet widely used by patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>For example, in the Toulouse University Pharmacovigilance Center, patient reports submitted by the App VigiBip® (6.7% of total reports received by the center) were significantly more frequent than those submitted via classical methods (3.4%) (p = 0.01) [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To further promote patient involvement, teaching tools, such as mobile applications, should be encouraged, and these tools should be tested rigorously. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Population </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>During the past years, different new disease-modifying drugs (DMD) have become available on the market for multiple sclerosis (MS) care, although most of these drugs induce significant general and biological side effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>While these new treatments offer important medical benefits, they also require close monitoring, which has led to the implementation of risk management plans (RMP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial populations are homogenous and rigorously followed, whereas under-reporting by patients is undeniable in normal clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Hence, increasing the rate of spontaneous reports of ADR by MS patients would represent a significant contribution to the pharmacovigilance system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>MS occurs in young adults, which is a population that is accustomed to the use of smartphones and Apps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Therefore, utilizing an App to report ADR could stimulate spontaneous reporting by patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>According to data extracted on 15 December 2016 from the French MS Observatory “Observatoire Français de la Sclérose en Plaques (OFSEP)” based on an analysis of the French patient cohort EDMUS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ofsep.org/fr/la-cohorte-ofsep/descriptif-de-la-cohorte">http://www.ofsep.org/fr/la-cohorte-ofsep/descriptif-de-la-cohorte</ext-link>), each year, 5000 new patients are diagnosed with MS in France. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The distribution of the various forms of MS is as follows: 79% relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS), 11% progressive MS and 10% a clinically isolated syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This trial will focus on patients with RR-MS, as these patients are involved in the management and monitoring of their pathology, with a population of 3950 newly diagnosed individuals per year in France. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we know that 25% of RR-MS patients do not receive DMD (extracted from OFSEP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Thus, approximately 3000 first-line DMD evaluated in RR-MS patients are introduced per year in France. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>First-line DMD include interferon β, peginterferon β, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><sec id="Sec18"><title><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Hypothesis </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par87"><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In the academic literature, no study has measured the impact of an App on increasing reports of ADR by patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>MedWatcher® is a user-friendly reporting App used to prepare and submit an adverse event report to the Food and Drug Administration for a hysteroscopic sterilization device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In 2012, a patient social media community adopted MedWatcher® to declare adverse reactions related to the device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>On average, there were 15 times more reports via the App than via the traditional pharmacovigilance portal [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We assume that patient reporting will increase by 10-fold with the use of the mobile application My e-Report® over the traditional reporting method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par88"><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>To follow the cluster-randomized design, the statistical unit will be the center. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the average number of ADR patient reports per patient will be pooled by center, and the comparison will be performed at the cluster (center) level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Estimation of number of centers required: this is a comparison of two means with an average for the arm standard of 20/3000 = 0.0067 or 6.7 per 1000 patients; and for the interventional arm of 200/3000 = 0.067 or 67 per 1000 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The power is 90% according to a bilateral test with 5% error risk and an estimated standard deviation of 0.04. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 10 centers in each arm are needed to test our hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par89"><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>We will target to include 12 centers per arm to counter the trend in over-reporting due to informing physicians of the study (inflation factor). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>A total of 24 MS outpatient-clinic departments will recruit 180 patients (90 per arm) with the following distribution according to structure type: 10 patients per MS academic expert center, 5 patients per general hospital and 5 patients per private practice neurologist. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par90"><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Statistical criteria for stopping the study: no intermediate analysis is planned, and the study will be stopped when all centers have obtained the required number of patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par91"><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Method for accounting for missing, unused or invalid data: the patient is first informed of the study, and then, the patient’s statements are collected for 6 months. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The 1-month follow-up questionnaire will be used to determine whether the patient should be removed from the study and replaced according to the following considerations:If the patient has reported at least one ADR, the patient data are preservedIf the patient did not report an ADR:Because they had no ADR, the patient data are preservedBecause they did not like the method of reporting, the patient data are preservedFor technical reasons (loss or breakage of the telephone/tablet), the patient is replaced by another patient, and these data are not analyzed </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par101"><text><SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Application use by patients could be an integral part of the pharmacovigilance system that is in place in France. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>This study aims to improve the efficiency of the pharmacovigilance system by increasing the number of reports and, therefore, allowing earlier detection of events to prevent and minimize risks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par102"><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>The robust methodology, with a clustered randomized national study, will determine the usefulness of national support for reporting by mobile application. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par103"><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>The results of this study should be available in the summer of 2018, and we hope that these results will be consistent with our assumption that (1) the efficiency of the post-marketing authorization system will be improved by an increase in reporting of ADR via the mobile application and (2) the therapeutic safety of MS patients will be improved by a better knowledge of the safety profile of DMD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par104"><text><SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Developing a culture of reporting ADR by RR-MS patients is a relevant goal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>In 2015, in France, 20 ADR were reported by MS patients compared with 271 ADR reported by physicians concerning first-line DMD according to data from the French National Database of Pharmacovigilance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In the future, we hope that this new method of reporting will improve pharmacovigilance by RR-MS patients and can be extended to include all new DMD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>The overall goal is to be able to improve the early detection of unexpected adverse reactions not revealed by clinical consultations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>If our hypothesis is confirmed, other neurological diseases could be explored using this method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec21"><title><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Strengths and limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par105"><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>This study has several strengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>First, the design, a randomized control trial, will allow a causal interpretation in terms of outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>In addition, including several types of centers (academic expert centers, general hospitals and private practice neurologists) will increase the external validity of the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study is focused on the use of an innovative tool, a mobile application, by a population in real-life conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par106"><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>We are also aware of several potential limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This is an open trial and, therefore, over-reporting due to informing the patients and physicians is expected and cannot be neutralized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Moreover, patients failing to report ADR by the App may have had a technical problem or may have forgotten to report the ADR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the user-friendliness of the mobile application has not been tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>To counter this limitation, 1 month after inclusion, we will ensure by a telephone call that patients report all ADR and are able to use the mobile application effectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Feedback from regional pharmacovigilance centers will also be investigated by a telephone call at 6 months after inclusion to explore patient satisfaction [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par107"><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Currently, patients describe ADR via the App via free verbatim that is later coded by pharmacologists of pharmacovigilance centers using the MedDra dictionary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Encouraging this reporting requires the accompaniment of regional pharmacovigilance centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In addition, informing patients, as proposed in the study, requires time by neurologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Financial resources should be put in place for this support, which could be included, for example, in a patient education program. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par108"><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Pharmacovigilance is a major public health issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>First-line DMD, whose risk profiles are not fully known, that have been newly released to the market must be carefully monitored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Patient involvement in the pharmacovigilance system is already accepted to be a valuable asset but must be further developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>RR-MS patients, who are already well-adapted to managing their disease, could be key players in effective pharmacovigilance. </plain></SENT>
