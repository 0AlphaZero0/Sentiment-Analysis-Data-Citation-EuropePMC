In addition to centriole defects, flies lacking Gorab are uncoordinated due to defects in sensory cilia, which lose their 9-fold symmetry. We demonstrate the separation of centriole and Golgi functions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab in two ways: First, we have created Gorab variants that are unable to localize to trans-Golgi but can still rescue the centriole and cilia defects of <italic>gorab</italic> null flies. Second, we show that expression of C-terminally tagged Gorab disrupts Golgi functions in cytokinesis of male meiosis, a dominant phenotype overcome by mutations preventing Golgi targeting. Our findings suggest that during metazoan evolution, a Golgi protein has arisen with a second, apparently independent, role in centriole duplication.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P5">Centrioles are at the core of centrosomes, required for cell-division fidelity, and at the base of cilia, fulfilling roles in motility and signalling.

This requires Cep135 to recruit Ana1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (CEP295 in human cells), and in turn Asterless/Cep152and pericentrin-like protein<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. This process of centriole to centrosome conversion enables the daughter centriole to recruit Plk4, as a partner of Asterless/Cep152, and PCM components that organise cytoplasmic MTs.</p><p id="P6">In interphase, the centrosome is found in the vicinity of the Golgi, the heart of secretory pathways and key for vesicular trafficking. Golgi positioning and vesicle trafficking rely on cytoplasmic MTs organized by Golgi-associated AKAP450 (counterpart of pericentrin), the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi protein GM130, the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi CLASPs (cytoplasmic-linker-associated-proteins), and additional components of a multiprotein complex<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Interphase cells can also utilise the mother centriole to template cilia formation.

In mammalian cells, this requires golgin GMAP-210, which interacts with the intraflagellar-transport complex protein, IFT-20, required for ciliogenesis<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Such links between centrosome and Golgi are only beginning to be explored and require further study.</p><p id="P7">Although Sas6 adopts a 9-fold symmetrical structure <italic>in vitro</italic>, Sas6 alone cannot confer 9-fold symmetry on the centriole <italic>in vivo</italic>; mutations that disrupt Sas6&#x02019;ssymmetry <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> or that prevent its self-oligomerisation can still result in 9-fold symmetrical centrioles <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. This suggests additional, yet unknown factors must help establish symmetry, raising the question of whether otherSas6-interacting proteins had been missed by earlier genome-wide screens. This led us to use proteomic approaches to search for additional <italic>Drosophila</italic> centriole components and the discovery of a new Sas6 partner, the fly counterpart of Golgi-associated Gorab. Human GORAB is mutated in gerodermia osteodysplastica, characterised by non-elastic skin and osteoporosis<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. GORAB localises to the trans-Golgi membranes and interacts with SCYL1, which participates in the Golgi-ER trafficking of COPI vesicles<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. We now show <italic>Drosophila gorab</italic> null mutants fail to duplicate centrosomes in embryos and diploid larval tissues and have defects in the 9-fold symmetry of cilia in neurosensory organs resulting in loss of coordination. We have created mutants of Drosophila Gorab that cannot localise to the Golgi but can still rescue centriolar phenotypes of the <italic>gorab</italic> null. We also generate a dominant negative Gorab with cytokinesis phenotypes that depend upon its Golgi localisation.

Surprisingly, no other centriole proteins were enriched in Sas6 pull-downs from embryos but we consistently identified the <italic>CG33052</italic> gene product (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S1</xref>). This complex persisted following high salt treatment(440mM NaCl) and was not affected by inhibiting protein phosphatases with okadaic acid suggesting it is a stable complex, insensitive to the protein phosphorylation state. Similarly, mass spectrometry of Sas6 complexes from cultured cells consistently identified CG33052.

Sas6 also co-purified with Gorab from cultured cells, irrespective of whether GFP-Gorab was expressed constitutively or from the inducible metallothionein promoter. However, in addition to Sas6, co-purified proteins also included the &#x003b1;COP, &#x003b2;&#x02019;COP and &#x003b5;COP subunits of the cage-like COPI coatomer sub-complex and the &#x003b3;COP and &#x003b2;COP subunits of its adaptor subcomplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>). We did not detect COPI complex proteins in purifications of Sas6 or of GFP expressed in cultured cells. Nor did we detect COPI proteins associated with Gorab purified from syncytial embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Table S2</xref>), a stage prior to the onset of Golgi assembly<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>.</p><p id="P10">The centrosomal association of Gorab, suggested by its repeated copurification with Sas6, was confirmed in syncytial blastoderm embryos expressing a <italic>Ubq-GFP-gorab</italic> transgene, in which GFP-Gorab co-localised with the centriole protein, Asterless, in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>) and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). As the Golgi is not assembled at this stage, we did not detect the trans-Golgi Golgin245. Thus, at least in the absence of the Golgi, Gorab could be a <italic>bone</italic> fide centrosome component in partnership with Sas6.</p><p id="P11">We then determined the sub-cellular localisation of Gorab in cultured D.Mel-2 cells that have well established Golgi. Using antibodies against Gorab (Material and Methods) and counterstaining for markers of the cis- (GM130) and trans-Golgi (Golgin245), we found the greater part of all Gorab was associated with the trans-Golgi,like its human counterpart<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1e</xref>). However, Gorab was also associated with dPLP punctae indicating its presence at the centrosome independent of Golgin245 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1f</xref>). Moreover, Gorab persisted at the centrosome in mitosis, when Golgi components become dispersed throughout the cell(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1a</xref>). Simlarly in cells of larval wing imaginal discs and central nervous system, transgenic GFP-Gorab was abundant on the trans-Golgi becoming dispersed during mitosis with a smaller fraction being stably associated with the centrosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S1b and c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Gorab directly binds Sas6 at the centriole core</title><p id="P12">The co-purification of Gorab and Sas6 and their centrosomal colocalisation raised the question of whether they interact directly. To address this, we expressed and purified GST-tagged Gorab from E.coli on Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads, which we incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-Met-labelled full-length Sas6, synthesised by coupled transcription-translation. This revealed direct binding of Sas6 to immobilized Gorab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). To narrow down the interacting region, we made N- and C-terminally truncated S<sup>35</sup>-labelled Sas6 peptides for use in similar binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S2</xref>). These experiments identified the 351 to 462 amino-acid segment of Sas6 as able to interact directly with Gorab.</p><p id="P13">Gorab&#x02019;s direct binding to Sas6 and its centrosomal localization suggested it should be associated with the centriole. Indeed, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed Gorab co-localised with Sas6 in centriole zone I at the center of a ring of dPLP, which surrounds the mother centriole throughout the cell cycle. This dPLP ring is completed around the daughter centriole during mitosis in centriole to centrosome conversion. Gorab and Sas6 co-localised at mother and daughter centriole throughout the centrosome cycle and were recruited to the site of procentriole formation once mother and daughter disengaged in telophase (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus Gorab and Sas6 associate at the core of the centriole from the very onset of its duplication.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>
<italic>gorab<sup>null</sup>-</italic>derived embryos display mitotic defects due to centrosome loss</title><p id="P14">The above findings suggested a possible new function for this Golgi-associated protein that we addressed by generating <italic>gorab</italic> null mutants. We used CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to simultaneously target the 5' and 3' ends and exon1 of the <italic>gorab</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S10">Online methods</xref>) and generated <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> (NT_037436.4:g.33_507del) and <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> (NT_037436.4:g.1_1097del), eliminating significant coding sequence and the ATG initiation codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3a</xref>). We were unable to detect any Gorab protein in Western blots of whole fly extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c</xref>) of homozygotes of either allele leading us to consider both mutant alleles to be nulls.</p><p id="P15">Surprisingly, both homozygous <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>gorab<sup>2</sup></italic> animals developed to adulthood. However, flies emerging at 25&#x000b0;C moved slowly and were uncoordinated and when raised at 29&#x000b0;C, were unable to climb or fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d</xref>, video S1). Furthermore, embryos derived from <italic>gorab</italic> mutant females raised at 25&#x000b0;C failed to develop even when homozygous mutant mothers were mated to wild-type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). In contrast, <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> males were fertile suggesting the mutation did not affect spermatogenesis. A similar extent of female sterility and uncoordination was observed in flies trans-heterozygous for the two alleles, or when heterozygous to a large chromosomal deficiency, suggesting the defects result from the loss of Gorab function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig.3b</xref>). Accordingly, female fertility and coordination were restored by ubiquitous expression of a wild-type <italic>gorab</italic> transgene in the <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3d, e</xref>). Thus, the primary consequences of loss of Gorab are female sterility and uncoordination.</p><p id="P16">Coordination defects have previously been attributed to defective neurosensory cilia of the femoral chordotonal organs (fChOs)<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Accordingly, we could rescue coordination defects but not the female sterility of <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> fliesby expressing <italic>UAS-gorab</italic> only in the nervous system using the pan-neural driver <italic>elav-GAL4</italic>. This allowed us to recover coordinated adult females that generated sufficient embryos to analyse their development. Wild-type syncytial embryos undertake 13 rapid rounds of synchronous nuclear division cycles over a period of 2 hours. In contrast, only 50% of <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic>-derived embryos showed any nuclear division but not beyond 5 or 6 rounds. Centrosomes, revealed by anti- centrosomin (Cnn) or anti-Asterless (Asl) staining, were dramatically reduced in number in <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic>-derived embryos and were absent from the majority of mitotic spindle poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f, g</xref>). The extensive disorganisation of <italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic>-derived embryos accords with the known requirement for centrosomes in the syncytial cycles. Thus, maternally provided Gorab is required for centrosome duplication and thereby the nuclear division cycles of the embryo. We also observed centrosome loss in<italic>gorab<sup>1</sup></italic> imaginal discs indicating Gorab is required for centrosome duplication in other diploid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Coordination defects of <italic>gorab</italic> flies reflect absence of daughter centrioles and loss of 9-fold symmetry in ciliary organs</title><p id="P17">As flies defective for centriole duplication lose coordination, we examined the fChOs whose ciliated neurons have basal bodies derived from centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4a</xref>).

This suggests other components of the centriole, in addition to Sas6, also contribute to its symmetry. Gorab could be one such contributing molecule, at least in part. However, this cannot be universally true because centrioles and axonemes in the gonads of fully fertile <italic>gorab</italic> null males have correct9-fold symmetry (not shown). This could be either because maternal Gorab protein perdures sufficiently in male germ cells to permit centriole duplication or because Gorab is substituted by another molecule in spermatogenesis. These possibilities, either of which could reflect the distinctive morphology of <italic>Drosophila&#x02019;s</italic> spermatocyte centrioles, require further study.</p><p id="P29">The trans-Golgi localization of human GORAB<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> is mirrored in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues including salivary glands, imaginal discs, the central nervous system, and in the male and female germ lines but not in syncytial embryos, where Golgi has yet to form. Accordingly, Gorab&#x02019;s association with COPI coatomer components in cultured cells suggests involvement in retrograde vesicle transport from Golgi to ER consistent with its resemblance to a golgin. The rod-like golgins, which bind Rab, Arf, or ADP-ribosylation family GTPases, are tethered to Golgi membranes by their C-termini and protrude outwards to capture vesicles at their N-termini<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. Overlapping specificity in vesicle targeting provides redundancy of function. Thus, both golgins GMAP-210 and GM130 can capture ER-derived carriers; both GMAP-210 and Golgin-84 can capture cis-Golgi derived vesicles; and so on<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. Such redundancy might account for the lack of any Golgi phenotype in <italic>gorab</italic> null mutants. However, Gorab&#x02019;s functional relevance at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Golgi is indicated by the cytokinesis defects in male meiosis caused by expression ofC-terminally tagged Gorab, which are strikingly similar to those following disruption of COPI-mediated vesicle trafficking<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. This accords with Gorab&#x02019;s association with COPI proteins and reinforces suggestions that integrity of ER and other membraneous structures is interdependent with astral and spindle microtubule function in male meiosis.</p><p id="P30">By generating the counterpart of a gerodermia osteodysplastica missense mutant that prevents human GORAB from localising to Golgi<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, we can separate <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gorab&#x02019;s Golgi and centriole functions. Thisp.Val266Pro mutation prevents Gorab from associating with Golgi but fully rescues centriole duplication defects of <italic>gorab</italic> null mutants and restores their ciliary function. A proline residue at this site could strongly influence structure of the Golgi-interacting region because of its side chain&#x02019;s rigidity and ability to undergo cis-trans isomerisation. The mutation does not, however, interfere with Gorab&#x02019;s ability to bind Sas6. Moreover, introducing p.Val266Pro into C-terminally tagged Gorab prevents its localization to Golgi and so relieves the cytokinesis defect. Thus the male sterility resulting from a C-terminal GFP tag is mediated through Gorab&#x02019;s Golgi association. Gorab&#x02019;s precise Golgi functions in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> most likely redundant with other golgins, must await further genetic and molecular studies.</p><p id="P31">Gorab is not required for centriole duplication or Golgi function in unicellular organisms such as ciliated eukaryotes. Its evolutionary appearance in metazoans may reflect increased proximity and functional interactions between the Golgi, centrosomes and cilia (see Introduction). Such co-evolution could have facilitated the emergence of proteins with dual functions allowing a component of one organelle to &#x0201c;moonlight&#x0201d; in its neighbor. However, Gorab is not present in all metaozoans; it is absent, for example, from <italic>C.elegans</italic>. This could possibly reflect the assembly of <italic>C. elegans</italic> SAS6 into a spiral rather than the ring-shaped oligomers characteristic of the centriole cartwheels in most species<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, which may obviate the need for interactions with a Gorab-like protein. Moreover, even within a single species, Gorab may be required for centriole duplication in some tissues and not others, as we find in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Such tissue specificity might account for findings with a <italic>GORAB</italic> mutant mouse, which has few primary cilia in dermal condensate cells responsible for Hedgehog signaling in hair follicles but does have primary cilia on keratinocytes<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. This could reflect tissue specific failure of centriole duplication in the null mouse even though there is currently no evidence to support this notion.</p><p id="P32">Although the above defects in cilia development in the <italic>GORAB</italic> null mouse require molecular analysis, they suggest a possibility of conserved roles for GORAB. Both fly and human proteins are not only found at the trans-Golgi (this study;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) but also at the centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6a,b</xref>). We expressed GFP-tagged GORAB in U2OS cells and found it at both centrosomes and Golgi. The Golgi localization was abolished by the p.Ala220Pro mutation but centrosome association remained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig S6a</xref>). We also found anti-GORAB antibodies could detect human GORAB at the centriole albeit not always together with Sas6 as in <italic>Drosophila</italic>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6b</xref>). This might reflect different requirements for GORAB and Sas6 at the centriole in the two organisms; Sas6 remains centriole associated throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> duplication cycle whereas it is first recruited and then is later absent from the lumen of the mother centriole for a substantial part of the human duplication cycle<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. It will be of future interest to track the precise behaviors of SASS6 and GORAB throughout the centriole duplication cycle in human cells.</p><p id="P33">Currently, however, it remains uncertain whether GORAB functions in centriole duplication in human cells as in insects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6</xref>).

In our experience, some more stable centriole proteins require more rounds of knockdown before a duplication phenotype can be observed and, unfortunately, GORAB RNAi led to cell death before depletion was complete. This was possibly due to compromised Golgi function, making it difficult to assess the effect upon centriole duplication. However, GORAB RNAi enhanced the centrosome loss seen following depletion of SASS6 alone suggesting the possibility of a co-operative role between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6c</xref>). We also found that depletion of human GORAB abolished the centrosome overduplication that occurs in U2OScells held in S-phase following Aphidicolin and Hydroxyurea treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Fig. S6d,e</xref>). However, because Golgi function is also compromised by these treatments, we cannot be certain that human GORAB is required for centrosome duplication as in flies.</p><p id="P34">We note that thep.Ala220Pro mutation results in a comparable disease phenotype to null mutations<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. As GORAB p.Ala220Pro can still associate with the centrosome, this suggests the gerodermia osteodysplastica phenotype is likely to result predominantly from defective Golgi functioning. However, it remains of future interest to re-examine cells from different tissues of patients with GORAB null mutations for potential additional defects in centriole duplication and/or formation of primary cilia. It will also be important to examine GORAB -/- mice further to determine whether the reported loss of cilia could arise through failure of centriole duplication rather than a secondary consequence of Golgi malfunction.</p><p id="P35">To conclude, our findings bring insight into the dual life of a protein with Golgi and centriole functions but also raise new future questions.

All fertility tests were independently repeated once with n=15 individual flies. In the climbing assay, Chen et al used 10 individuals per genotype whereas we increased the sample size to 15 individuals. The experiments were done in three independent replicates, n=15 individual flies in each replica. The indistinguishable appearance of Drosophila individuals of the same genotype ensures that the flies were blindly and randomly collected for fertility and coordination tests. Flies dying during the assays were excluded from analysis and the test was repeated. For counting centrosomes in human cell lines, replicates consist of cells independently treated with siRNA/Aphidicoline+Hydroxyurea as indicated in figure legends. Each treated replica was mounted and imunostained on an idependent coverslip. Centrosomes in randomly selected cells (n=100) were counted in each replica. Number of replicates (N), mean and standard error of mean (s.e.m) are indicated in corresponding figure legends.
