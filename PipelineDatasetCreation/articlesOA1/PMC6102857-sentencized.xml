</text></title><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis among reproductive-aged women worldwide [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>BV is characterized by the replacement of lactobacilli with anaerobic bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>BV increases susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV [5–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although the exact role that sexual activity plays remains unclear, BV rarely occurs in its absence suggesting that BV may be a sexually associated condition [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>While the epidemiology and precise etiology of BV are poorly understood, there are several known correlates of BV including: childbearing age, Hispanic ethnicity, condomless vaginal sex with male and female partners, new and multiple sex partners, intravaginal washing, and infection with HIV or other STIs [3, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Inversely, factors that may protect against BV include condom use during vaginal sex and the use of estrogen or progesterone containing hormonal birth control [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>BV prevalence varies widely by region and population [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In studies of women in the general population in the United States (US), United Kingdom, and Australia, BV prevalence ranged from 9 to 30% [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, BV prevalence may be even higher among women who engage in sexual risk behaviors, such as female sex workers (FSWs) [1, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>For instance, BV prevalence was estimated to be as high as 45 and 70% among female sex workers (FSWs) in Peru and South Africa, respectively [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Many of the aforementioned correlates of BV overlap with HIV/STI risk, thus it is plausible that the HIV risk environment framework as described by Tim Rhodes and colleagues may help illuminate environmental factors associated with BV [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The ‘risk environment’ is a conceptual framework that explores how physical, social, political, and economic environments impact overall health and vulnerability to HIV among substance users [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Since BV increases the susceptibility to HIV/STIs, it is possible that BV may partially mediate the relationship between the HIV risk environment and HIV acquisition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Therefore, examining BV in the context of the HIV risk environment may further our understanding of the utility of intervening on environmental factors to reduce BV incidence and subsequent HIV/STI risk, especially among highly vulnerable groups such as female sex workers who inject drugs (FSW-PWIDs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We aimed to understand how BV is shaped by the HIV risk environment among FSW-PWIDs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, located along the Mexico/US border. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>FSW-PWIDs are considered a uniquely vulnerable population and have disproportionate rates of HIV and STIs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Among FSW-PWIDs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez the prevalence of HIV, active syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is two to three times higher compared to FSWs who do not inject drugs, [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These elevated prevalences may be partially due to FSW-PWIDs increased likelihood to concede to the demands for condomless sex, due to experiencing the urgency of drug-related withdrawal or being reliant upon partners or clients for drugs [16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Further, influences in the economic risk environment such as economic vulnerability, increase FSW-PWIDs susceptibility to demands for condomless sex from clients who pay more for this type of sexual transaction [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Taken together, FSW-PWIDs along Mexico’s northern border are at increased risk for HIV/STIs due to a constellation of individual and environmental factors that may also heighten their risk for BV. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The sex work industries in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are thriving, attracting clients from Mexico, the US and beyond, making HIV/STI transmission in these regions a global public health issue [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The robust nature of this industry is partly due to the regulation of sex work in Mexico [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As a result, FSWs are required to obtain a permit and undergo HIV/STI screening every four months, although the majority practice without permits and these procedures do not include screening for BV [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In Ciudad Juarez however, the red-light district has been disbanded in recent years forcing FSWs to work underground with limited access to routine HIV/STI testing [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The physical risk environment in these cities is largely characterized by their placement along two well-established drug trafficking routes that transport illicit substances into the US frequently [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the drug markets in these cities are flourishing, and it has been estimated that approximately 18% of FSWs in the region inject drugs [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Another defining characteristic of the physical risk environment in these regions is violence [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez have been subject to severe human rights violations and drug cartel-related violence for decades [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This has led to the normalization of violence, and has resulted in a high level of gender-based violence towards FSWs perpetrated by clients, intimate partners, and law enforcement officials [20]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>For instance, the decentralization of the red-light district in Ciudad Juarez has resulted in the deregulation of the sex work industry, which has displaced FSWs to truck stops, residential zones, and the streets [20, 22]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>These factors may partially explain the positive association between lifetime residence in Ciudad Juarez and BV, indicating that prolonged exposure to contextual factors in this city influence FSW-PWIDs risk behaviors that potentiate poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>A longitudinal study assessing factors that affect HIV/STI transmission among FSWs in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez found that client-perpetrated violence was correlated with street-based sex work and inconsistent condom use with non-regular clients [20]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>According to prior research that compared HIV risk behaviors between street-based FSWs and FSWs who work in bars in Tijuana, those who worked on the street were at increased risk for HIV/STIs due to the combined impact of infrequent condom use, greater access to illicit substances, more illicit drug use, and a larger client load [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Notably, infrequent condom use was associated with reduced access to condoms and HIV prevention services, increased economic incentives for condomless sex and decreased efficacy to use condoms [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>First, data were collected from a subgroup of FSW-PWIDs along the Mexico/US border, that were recruited using non-random sampling techniques which may limit the generalizability of these results to FSW-PWIDs in other settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Data were collected between 2008 and 2010 and therefore may not be representative of current trends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>For instance, changes in the sex work industry in Ciudad Juarez due to gentrification over the last decade may have altered the HIV risk environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Thus, more research is needed to ensure that future interventions are responding to changing risk environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This study relies on self-reported information of sensitive behaviors (e.g. sex work), which may have led to underreporting of behaviors considered socially undesirable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This analysis used cross-sectional data, we cannot disentangle the temporality of measured association, and therefore cannot infer causal relationships. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Our study provides important information regarding the factors in the HIV risk environment that are associated with BV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive interventions that address the sociostructural barriers, which prevent FSW-PWIDs from practicing sex work in safe environments and attaining sexual and reproductive health. Further, it illuminates the need to focus intervention efforts on micro level factors in the physical risk environment including; policy and cultural standards as they relate to violence targeted toward FSW-PWIDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study offers further evidence that health is a product of social structures and environments, and recommends amendments to the political, legal, and cultural contexts that influence the health of FSW-PWIDs in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, Mexico. </plain></SENT>
