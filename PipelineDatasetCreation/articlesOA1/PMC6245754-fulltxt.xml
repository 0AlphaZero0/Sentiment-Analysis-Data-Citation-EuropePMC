This study seeks to make a quite complete transcriptome for olive development and to elucidate the dynamic regulation of the transcriptomic response during the early-juvenile period by RNAseq time-series expression analysis. The transcriptome was made from 342,049,597 paired-end reads of 101&#x02009;bp in length. The assembled transcriptome contained 109,125 unigenes (N50&#x02009;=&#x02009;1490&#x02009;bp, average length&#x02009;=&#x02009;839).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The time-series-expression analysis showed that, embryonic structures present at the first month after the induction of germination reached a more differentiated state in two-month-old seedlings. Once the plants were between three and four months old and reached a size around 6&#x02013;7 nodes, the first developmental stages appeared to be complete and the developing seedling became a juvenile plant. In addition, an AGL-gene was rapidly downregulated during the induction of germination. The repression of this gene was very strong, as evidenced by the low levels of gene expression during plant development from the embryonic seedling to undetectable levels of expression in the adult tree. These results suggest that this gene may be involved in seed dormancy and could be a repressor of the germination. Also, an <italic>APL1</italic>-like olive gene was found to be expressed at high levels during flowering, and was also expressed during the cold incubation in the activation of embryo germination, suggesting a probable role in embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The early development from germination to the juvenile stage of olive seedlings occurred when plants reached a size around 6&#x02013;7 nodes, and general changes of relevant groups of genes involved in development are described.

After seed germination, the seedling grows to become a sapling that later makes phase transitions from the juvenile stage to become an adult tree, which has acquired competence for reproduction, completing the life cycle in the reproductive phase. Despite its relevance, the genetic control of the early steps of tree development has received little attention. In practical terms, the study of the genetic changes in normal olive-tree development is relevant to breeders seeking to shorten the unproductive juvenile period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Understanding the molecular basis of these characteristics and improving the efficiency of such breeding programs require the development of genomic information and tools. In previous work, we generated cDNA sequences from Sanger-sequencing and pyrosequencing 454 Roche technology to identify the whole transcriptome of olive by sequencing different juvenile and adult tissues from several olive-tree cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Their assembly and functional annotation facilitated the generation of an EST Olive Array to enable the first study of the juvenile-to-adult transition genetic control in <italic>Olea europaea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In that study, the transcriptional changes that took place during development of trees 6 to 33&#x02009;months old were analyzed by microarray hybridization. The study revealed that transcriptomic changes preceded the juvenile-to-adult phase transition and occurred when the tree trunk had developed between 30 and 45 nodes and at least 18&#x02009;months prior to the first flowering.</p><p id="Par13">In Arabidopsis, the main genetic changes at the juvenile-to-adult phase transition are controlled by a complementary expression pattern of the miRNAs, <italic>miR156</italic> and <italic>miR172</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These miRNAs also control the vegetative phase change in trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also, <italic>miR156</italic> and <italic>miR172</italic> have been found in olive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and target genes such as the <italic>AP2-like</italic> transcription-factor family appear to be regulated in the same way as in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, before reaching the juvenile-to-adult transition, the seedling should have developed nearly 45 nodes, but studies are lacking on this period of olive-tree development and in woody plants in general. New olive transcriptomes have been published recently, regarding to a developmental process as it is the plant architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], or in response to a biotic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Here, we report a transcriptional study of monthly samples from a number of seedlings from open pollinated olive trees cv. Arbequina over the first six months after germination. This study was aimed at developing a quite complete transcriptome dataset for olive development using RNAseq by Illumina and at studying the dynamic regulation of the transcriptomic response during the early-juvenile period by time-series-expression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plant material</title><p id="Par14">Olive fruits from the open pollinated olive cultivar Arbequina were collected and their seeds separated from the mesocarp (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

Phase change in woody perennials is associated with the plant reaching a certain size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In olive trees, the size to change from juvenile to adult tree is around 30&#x02013;45 nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, prior to this phase transition the germinating seedling must develop into a juvenile tree, and this is the developmental process analyzed by a transcriptomic approach in this work.</p><p id="Par36">The results of expression analysis of genes coding for transcription factors identified as likely being involved in plant development, indicated a change in gene expression two months after induction of germination (IG), which coincided with the transplanting of the seedlings to pots. Probably more significant was the change in gene expression after the first three months of growth. In fact, the analysis of the RNAseq data by time series showed that in the first three months there are major changes in expression of genes involved in plant development. Meanwhile, after this three-month period, the gene expression of many plant development related genes became substantially more stable, indicating that the development of the juvenile tree from the seed was completed and that the juvenile entered a growth period that would eventually transition to the adult phase. The three-month-old plants averaged 7.2 nodes per plant, most having 6 or more nodes. Therefore, 6&#x02013;7 nodes appear to mark the size at which the seedling becomes a juvenile tree.</p><p id="Par37">Due to the high complexity of the changes of gene expression in GO terms related to plant development, a model of the main changes was built (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In fact, the model is separated into two classes, genes involved directly in plant development (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a) and genes involved in hormone biosynthesis or genes regulated by hormones (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). There are genes that increase their expression during the six-month follow-up, as is the case of genes involved in DNA methylation, first increasing de novo DNA methylation and then its maintenance. This is consistent with the fact that one-month-old samples had embryonic structures; in fact, the distinction between shoots and roots was not very clear. In the samples two-month-old and older, structures became more defined and cell differentiation increased, so that DNA methylation must take place as cells differentiate. Thus it is consistent with the other type of genes that increase their expression with the same pattern, as genes for leaf pavement cell development and epidermal cell differentiation. In addition, in this same pattern the genes involved in release of dormancy increased as do the lignin biosynthesis genes. At the second month, the genes for xylem and phloem pattern formation were downregulated while the xylem and phloem histogenesis genes were induced and maintained high throughout the follow-up period. Simultaneously, genes for cell fate specification, tissue development, and specification of plant organ identity are also repressed. These results indicate that the main structures were established and the cells were committed to their fate by this time. At the second and third month of development, key changes of gene expression were found. Thus, a set of genes regulating plant development were induced, but one month later a different set of genes of the same GO term were repressed. Also at the second month after germination, leaf senescence genes were up-regulated and at the third month programmed cell death genes were upregulated, too. The programmed cell death is considered as the end point of leaf senescence but can also be involved in leaf maturation, so these results indicate that by this time the final stages in the development of certain major plant structures were complete.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>A model for gene expression of GO terms related to hormone regulation and plant development during the germination to the juvenile tree developmental process. Plant development (<bold>a</bold>); plant-hormone biosynthesis and regulated genes (<bold>b</bold>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2018_5232_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par38">The model for hormone-related genes is quite complex because most hormones are involved in different processes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Nevertheless, a key observation was that sets of genes under hormonal control or genes for hormone biosynthesis or degradation themselves were up- or downregulated during the first three months to finally reach a more stable state. This finding agrees with the observations made for the genes directly involved in plant development in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. Therefore, all the findings in this transcriptomic study point towards the conclusion of that embryonic development finishes when the seedling reaches a size of 6&#x02013;7 nodes. At this time, all the plant structures and the cell and organ differentiation of a juvenile tree have developed. In addition to this finding, we detected sets of genes activated by gibberellin or abscisic acid (GA and ABA, respectively) in the transcriptome of germinating olives that are switched off after two or three months from IG. GA and ABA are involved in the germination of cereals by controlling in an opposing way the expression of a number of genes, for instance, starch degradation and the function of the endosperm after germination. Several hormones, such as GA, auxin (IAA), cytokinins, ethylene, and brassinosteroids, promote stem and/or leaf growth by stimulating cell elongation and/or division. In addition, we found that sets of genes regulated by different hormones are induced after the first two months, when the germinating process appears to finish and the plant begins a phase of vegetative growth.</p><p id="Par39">In addition to the general examination of gene changes during the early stages of plant development, we focused special attention on two genes. First, an AGL-gene (contig_11,388) from the transcriptome described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] was found to be expressed only in seeds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b) and rapidly downregulated during the induction of the germination. The repression of this gene is very strong, and expression levels remain low throughout plant development from seedling emergence to the adult tree. These results suggest that this gene might be involved in seed dormancy and could be a repressor of germination. Further work is required to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, another gene (contig_34,438) described in an earlier transcriptome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], according to its annotation and expression profile is likely the <italic>APL1</italic>-like gene of olive, a gene exhibiting type-A function during flower development (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, d). This gene is over-expressed during flowering, but we found that it was also expressed during the cold incubation in the activation of embryo germination. This expression declines at two months after IG, just when the results of this work indicate that the embryo cells were committed to their fate and the seedlings had determined the main structures. This finding indicates that the <italic>APL1</italic>-like gene in olive may play a role during the embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In conclusion, this work provides a transcriptomic analysis of the early stages of the olive-seedling development, revealing that, in the first month after the induction of the germination, embryonic structures appeared, but they reached a more differentiated state in two-month-old seedlings. Once the plants were between three and four months old and reached a size of around 6&#x02013;7 nodes, the first developmental stages appeared to be complete and the seedling becomes a juvenile plant. In addition, a putative seed-dormancy transcription factor was identified and the <italic>APL1</italic>-like olive gene was also found to have a probable role in embryonic development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
