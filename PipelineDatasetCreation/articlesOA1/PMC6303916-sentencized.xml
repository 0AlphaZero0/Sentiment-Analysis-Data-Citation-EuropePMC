</text></title><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths among Iranians with age-adjusted rates of 8.2 and 7.0 per 100,000 populations for men and women, respectively [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It was reported that there is a noticeable increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer among young Iranians [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Various factors are involved in individual’s susceptibility for the CRC including environmental factors and genetic predisposition [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Cancer is a multi-step process associated with accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Gene mutations generate the genome instability via disruption of the normal epigenetic patterns [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Regarding the high survival ratios among the CRC cases who are diagnosed in the early stages of CRC, it is a critical requirement to find new non-invasive biomarkers to detect the CRC in the early stages [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Moreover, personalized medicine is also trying to design the chemotherapy based on genetic and epigenetic patterns of cancer in every patient [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Mutated genes are mostly oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair factors which are involved in genome instability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Various processes are involved in epigenetics such as DNA methylation and histone modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic mutations alter the gene expression without any change in DNA sequence and can result to inactivation and activation of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>There is not any single universal molecular prognostic and diagnostic marker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Regarding the role of ethnicity on prevalence of CRC, it is believed that the different races have probably different genetic and epigenetic patterns of tumorigenesis [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in present review we are going to summarize all of the 60 epigenetic and genetic aberrations which are reported until now among Iranian CRC patients (Table.1) (Fig. 1) to pave the way of designing an ethnic specific panel of diagnostic and prognostic markers in our country.Table 1All of the involved markers in CRC susceptibility among the Iranian

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>GSTs are belonged to the phase II metabolic enzymes which have critical roles in cellular detoxification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Phase I (activation) and phase II (conjugation) enzymes are known as the most important factors involved in metabolization of carcinogens [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>GSTs over activity was observed in chemotherapeutic resistant tumors against the alkylating agents [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>GST activity in plasma and tissue were assessed in Iranian CRC cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>There was a significant GSTs over activity in tumor compared with normal margins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This strong correlation supported the plasma GST activity as a non-invasive biomarker [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>GSTM1, P1, T1, and CYP2E1 polymorphisms were also assessed among Iranian CRC subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>They reported that there was a strong correlation between GSTT1 polymorphism and CRC [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase are the main protective enzymes against reactive oxygen species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>SODs convert the superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, subsequently the catalase is responsible for the hydrogen peroxidase detoxification through converting that into the water and oxygen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a group have assessed the correlation between SOD1 A251G and CAT C-262 T polymorphisms and CRC susceptibility among the Iranian population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>They observed that the SOD1 G allele was correlated with a higher risk of CRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Therefore, polymorphisms in antioxidant enzymes increase risk of CRC through the decreased antioxidant capacity [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Beside the toxic compounds and ROS, abnormal and defective proteins can be also damaging for the cells, therefore it will be required for the cells to eliminate such abnormal proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>It was reported that deregulation of ubiquitin-proteasome can be involved in tumor progression through the modulation of growth factors stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>UBE2Q1, 2 are belonged to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Methylation status of UBE2Q1 and UBE2Q2 were assessed in a group of Iranian CRC cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>UBE2Q2 was highly un-methylated in distal and advanced stage tumors suggesting the UBE2Q2 as a probable oncogene during the CRC progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the UBE2Q1 hypermethylation and UBE2Q2 hypomethylation as tumor suppressor and oncogene respectively can be associated with CRC progression [19]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) act as a tumor suppressor via cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis induction during early stages of tumor progression [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>TGF-b1 binding with receptor type II (TGF-bRII), results to phosphorylation of the receptor type I (TGF-bRI). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>This interactions finally activates and transfers the SMADs into the nucleus, resulting in the transcriptional regulation of target genes which are related to the cell proliferation [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Role of TGFB1 gene − 509 C/T polymorphism in risk of CRC was evaluated in a group of Iranian patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>They showed that the cases with the TGFB1 509 T allele can be at a lower risk of CRC in comparison with the cases harboring 509 C allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>This study highlighted role of this cytokine in suppression of CRC in which the 509 T allele has probably a protective role during the tumor progression [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>SMAD7 is an inhibitor of the TGF-β which functions as an oncogene through the suppression of TGF-β signaling [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>It was shown that there was a significant difference between the rs4464148 AG frequency of SMAD7 in the CRC and control groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>It was demonstrated that the allele T at rs12953717 of SMAD7 can be introduced as a risk factor of CRC among Iranian patients [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Canonical Wnt/b-catenin is one of the critical pathways during the tumorigenesis in which the unphosphorylated and activated b-catenin enters into nucleus and activates the LEF/TCF/PYGO2 transcriptional complex [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>GSK3b, AXIN, and APC are the components of a complex which is responsible for the regulation of b-catenin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>This complex phosphorylates and induces the degradation of b-catenin via the proteasome in the absence of WNT signals [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Regarding the presence of APC mutation in more than 80% of CRCs, aberrant WNT signaling pathway has a critical role in CRC progression [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the 7 and 12% of a group of 112 Iranian CRC patients had AXIN2 and APC promoter methylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>AXIN2 promoter methylation was mainly observed in stage I tumors and females [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Another group also examined the promoter methylation status of several WNT inhibitors among 125 Iranian CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>They observed the APC, AXIN2, DKK3, SFRP2, 4, 5, WIF1, and WNT5a promoter methylation in 35.2, 32.8, 40, 46.4, 28.8, 26.4, 41.6, 22.4% of tumor samples, respectively [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>It was reported that the hypermethylation of APC1A and SFRP2 promoter sequences as the WNT target genes are also correlated with polyp progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Therefore, hypermethylation of serum SFRP2 can be suggested as a sensitive precancerous marker [31]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The cell microenvironment and tissue homeostasis and repair can be modulated by inflammatory responses [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Adaptive and innate immune systems have important roles in cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>IL-17 is an inflammatory cytokine secreted by Th17 cells and stimulates the Macrophages and Neutrophils to produce the inflammatory factors in human malignancies [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of IL-17 SNPs were assessed in CRC tumors and serum levels of IL-17 were compared in patients and healthy controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>It was found that the TT genotype and T allele were decreased in comparison with the TC genotype and C allele among Iranian CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between IL-17F TT genotype and well differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant correlation between the AG genotype of IL-17A G197A SNP and higher risk of colorectal cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In contrast with the IL-17F, IL-17A serum concentrations were significantly increased in CRC compared with healthy cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Therefore, IL-17A is a tumor progression cytokine and can be efficiently introduced in targeted therapy of CRC patients [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>IL-16 is a chronic inflammation cytokine mediating tissue specific or systemic inflammation [35, 36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>It was observed that the IL-16 up regulates the TNF-α as an important factor in apoptosis and cell survival [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter and exons of IL-16 were screened to assess the frequency of genotypes in Iranian CRC and healthy cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The results suggested a correlation between rs11556218 T &gt; G and rs4778889 T/C polymorphisms and risk of CRC among a sub population of Iranian patients [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Expression of IL-17B, C, E, and F were also examined among Iranian sporadic CRC cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Although the IL-17B was increased, IL-17C showed a grade-linked expression pattern and IL-17E remained unchanged in CRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>IL-17F under expression was observed in tumors in comparison with the normal samples [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>NOD2 protein is a regulator of chronic inflammatory that is expressed in monocytes and macrophages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>It functions as a sensor of lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans to induce the (NF)-jB and STAT1 transcription factors which are associated with inflammation-related tumor progression [40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Correlation between rs3135500 (30UTR SNP) of NOD2 and CRC susceptibility was evaluated among the Iranian population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between AA genotype of rs3135500 and increased risk of CRC in Iranian population [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>CD86 is expressed by immune cells and is associated with inflammation related malignancies and cancer susceptibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine is commonly secreted by type 1 regulatory T cells and can be an oncogene or tumor suppressor based on microenvironment condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>A case–control study showed that there was significantly lower serum levels of IL-10 in Iranian CRC cases compared with controls which cause an aberrant innate immune reaction and tumor cell ignorance by adaptive immune. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cases with poor prognosis had higher levels of IL-10 compared with the other cases [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in DNA damage and apoptosis inhibition [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Its production is related with three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) including endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>eNOS and nNOS activations are calcium dependent [47], whereas, iNOS is related to the cytokines and has a calcium independent function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the NO is involved in prostaglandin biosynthesis through the COX-2 activation during inflammation process [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the COX2 and iNOS protein co-expressions were observed in epithelial tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>The cases with lymph node metastasis showed higher levels of COX2 and iNOS protein expressions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there was a direct correlation between iNOS and COX2 in advanced stage tumors among the Iranian CRC subjects [49]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>The HIWI protein has critical roles in self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells through the regulation of several processes such as protein synthesis, RNAi mechanism, and mRNA stability [141, 142]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>We have shown the HIWI and DPPA2 mRNA over expressions in 34.8 and 26.1% of 46 Iranian CRC cases, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>HIWI and DPPA2 over expressions had significant correlations with advanced stages and lymph node metastasis, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a significant direct correlation between HIWI and DPPA2 mRNA expression in which DPPA2 probably regulates the HIWI expression in CRC [143]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub population of tumor cells which are responsible for the drug resistance and tumor relapse [144, 145]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Therefore, targeted therapy against the CSCs can be an efficient method to overcome the tumor relapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the presence of CSCs in peripheral blood (PB), LGR5 and DCLK1 expressions have been assessed in blood sample of CRC patients. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>It has been observed that the levels of Fibronectin mRNA expression was increased and decreased in primary and advanced tumor grades respectively in a subpopulation of Iranian CRC patients [149]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Nebulin (NEBL) is also involved in cell adhesion through interaction with thin filaments, vinculin, and paxillin which probably increase the cell migration via destabilization of focal adhesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Levels of NEBL mRNA expression was evaluated in CRC tumors and their corresponding normal margins among Iranian CRC cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the tumor tissues had three fold increases of NEBL mRNA expression in comparison with the normal tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>There was also a significant direct correlation between levels of NEBL mRNA expression and lymph node metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Therefore, they suggested that the NEBL can be introduced as a prognostic factor among the Iranian CRC patients [150]. </plain></SENT>
