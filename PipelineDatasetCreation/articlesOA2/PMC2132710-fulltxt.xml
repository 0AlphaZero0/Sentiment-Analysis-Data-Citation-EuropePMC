The 129-amino acid peptide, designated 4.1G&#x02013;CTD, is the first known physiologic binding target of FKBP13. FKBP13 is a 13-kD protein originally identified by its high affinity binding to the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin (Jin, Y., M.W. Albers, W.S. Lane, B.E. Bierer, and S.J. Burakoff. 1991. <italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.</italic> 88:6677&#x02013; 6681); it is a membrane-associated protein thought to function as an ER chaperone (Bush, K.T., B.A. Henrickson, and S.K. Nigam. 1994. <italic>Biochem. J.</italic> [<italic>Tokyo</italic>]. 303:705&#x02013;708). We report the specific association of FKBP13 with 4.1G&#x02013;CTD based on yeast two-hybrid, in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The histidyl-proline moiety of 4.1G&#x02013;CTD is required for FKBP13 binding, as indicated by yeast experiments with truncated and mutated 4.1G&#x02013;CTD constructs. In situ hybridization studies reveal cellular colocalizations for FKBP13 and 4.1G&#x02013;CTD throughout the body during development, supporting a physiologic role for the interaction. Interestingly, FKBP13 cofractionates with the red blood cell homologue of 4.1 (4.1R) in ghosts, inside-out vesicles, and Triton shell preparations. The identification of FKBP13 in erythrocytes, which lack ER, suggests that FKBP13 may additionally function as a component of membrane cytoskeletal scaffolds.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>T<sc>he</sc> immunophilins comprise two classes of protein receptors for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Whereas cyclosporin A interacts with a family of proteins designated cyclophilins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), FK506 and rapamycin bind to a growing family of FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs).<sup>1</sup> A common feature of immunophilins is their peptidyl&#x02013;prolyl isomerase activity (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). FKBP12 was the first member of the FKBP family to be characterized (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In the presence of FK506, FKBP12 binds to calcineurin and inhibits its phosphatase activity, ultimately leading to T-cell immunosupression (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). FKBP12 associates physiologically with two intracellular calcium channels, the ryanodine receptor (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and regulates their ability to flux calcium. FKBP12 also interacts with type I TGF&#x003b2; receptors and can inhibit the signaling pathways of TGF&#x003b2; ligands (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>).</p><p>FKBP13 was the second member of the FKBP family to be cloned and shares 43% amino acid identity with FKBP12 (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Whereas FKBP12 is cytosolic, FKBP13 is a membrane-associated protein, possessing an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal signal sequence and COOH-terminal RTEL motif, which are believed to play roles in protein targeting and ER retention, respectively (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). FKBP13 has been identified in rough microsomal subcellular fractions and is enriched in samples containing ER luminal proteins (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Expression of FKBP13 is upregulated in response to heat shock and the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that FKBP13 may function as an ER molecular chaperone, which binds to and catalyzes the folding and/or assembly of proteins in the ER.</p><p>To further elucidate the physiologic role(s) of FKBP13, we sought to identify potential FKBP13 binding targets using the yeast two-hybrid method. We report that FKBP13 associates with the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of a novel homologue of the red blood cell (RBC) protein 4.1 (4.1R). We have designated the new gene product 4.1G because of its general, widespread distribution compared to 4.1R, which is enriched in hematopoietic tissues and discrete neuronal populations (Walensky, L.D., Z.T. Shi, S. Blackshaw, A.C. DeVries, G.E. Demas, P. Gascard, R.J. Nelson, J.G. Conboy, E.M. Rubin, S.H. Snyder, and N. Mohandas. 1997. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell.</italic> (<italic>Suppl</italic>.) 8:275a). 4.1R is a critical structural component of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The 135- and 80-kD isoforms of 4.1R are generated by the use of alternate start codons in the coding sequence; many additional isoforms are produced by complex alternative exon splicing (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The spectrin&#x02013;actin binding domain (SABD) of 4.1R potentiates the interactions of spectrin tetramers with F-actin in the RBC cytoskeleton (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). 4.1R also provides a linkage between the cytoskeletal scaffold and the plasma membrane through interactions of its membrane-binding domain (MBD) with band 3 and glycophorin C (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The role of the CTD of 4.1R is unknown. 4.1G is the closest homologue to 4.1R within the 4.1 superfamily whose members contain homologous MBDs. In addition to alternative splicing of 4.1R (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), 4.1G contributes to the protein 4.1 diversity observed by immunologic methods in a wide range of tissues (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>).</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="MaterialsMethods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>FKBP13 Yeast Two-hybrid Screen</title><p>Two-hybrid screening was conducted using the Y190 yeast strain containing the HIS3 and &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) reporter genes and the pPC86 and pPC97 expression vectors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The cDNA encoding rat FKBP13 was subcloned into the pPC97 vector (encoding the GAL4 DNA&#x02013;binding domain [GAL4 {DB}]) and then used as bait to screen a rat hippocampal library (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) constructed in the pPC86 vector, which contains the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (GAL4[TA]) cDNA. The FKBP13 clone was transformed into yeast using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Yeast expressing the GAL4 (BD)&#x02013;FKBP13 fusion were subsequently transformed with the rat hippocampal library using a variation of the lithium acetate/PEG method. Yeast were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 1.0, pelleted, and then washed with sterile water. After incubation in 100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M sorbital (buffer A) at 30&#x000b0;C for 30 min, the yeast were pelleted and resuspended in 2.5 mL of buffer A and then 50 &#x003bc;g of library and 800 &#x003bc;g of carrier DNA were added to a final volume of 3.0 mL buffer A. After adding 24 mL of 100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 40% PEG, the yeast were incubated for 30 min at 30&#x000b0;C and then heat shocked for 15 min at 42&#x000b0;C. 100 mL of media lacking leucine (leu), tryptophan (trp), and histidine (his) was added and then the yeast were incubated for 3 h at 30&#x000b0;C.

The plasmid was isolated from a colony displaying &#x003b2;-gal activity using glass beads (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), transformed into bacteria by electroporation, and then DNA sequenced. The plasmid encoded a 129-amino acid (aa) peptide with sequence homology to the CTD of 4.1R, as determined by searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence databases (Bethesda, MD) using the BLAST network service.

Y190 yeast were cotransformed with pPC97 and pPC86 constructs using the lithium acetate/PEG method, restreaked onto leu<sup>&#x02212;</sup>trp<sup>&#x02212;</sup> plates, and then assessed for &#x003b2;-gal activity using the nitrocellulose lift assay. To determine whether the interaction between FKBP13 and its target was sensitive to FK506, the double transformants were plated on leu<sup>&#x02212;</sup>trp<sup>&#x02212;</sup> plates containing vehicle (ethanol), 1-, 10-, and 50-&#x003bc;M FK506.

PCR was conducted with high-fidelity pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The degenerate primers made against the CVEEHHT (5&#x02032;-TGTGT[A/G]GA[A/G]CATCACACGTT) motif of the 4.1R MBD and the QHPDM (3&#x02032;-CAT-[A/G]TC[T/A]GG[G/ A]TGCTG) motif of the r4.1G CTD yielded a product of 965 bp. To obtain 5&#x02032; mouse 4.1G (m4.1G) sequence, the dbest database was searched using human 4.1G (h4.1G) as the query sequence (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).

Because 4.1G&#x02013;CTD binds to FKBP13 but not to FKBP12, we were interested in identifying the aa sequence that interacts with FKBP13 to shed light on the differing specificities of FKBP12 and FKBP13. Leu-pro and val-pro residues are optimal substrates for FKBP12 rotamase activity in vitro (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>); FK506 binds with high affinity to FKBP12 and inhibits its rotamase activity by mimicking the transition state of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization. Leu-pro 1400&#x02013;1401 of the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor has recently been shown to mediate the constitutive binding of FKBP12 to the calcium channel and presumably has structural characteristics similar to FK506 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>4.1G&#x02013;CTD contains three peptidyl-prolyl bonds that could potentially participate in FKBP13 binding, including val-pro at aa 18&#x02013;19, ser-pro at 32&#x02013;33, and his-pro at 107&#x02013; 108. We used yeast two&#x02013;hybrid assays to determine which residues are required for the FKBP13 interaction. Yeast were doubly transformed with FKBP13 and truncations of 4.1G&#x02013;CTD corresponding to aa 1&#x02013;67 and 35&#x02013;129. Only the transformants containing the 35&#x02013;129 aa-construct exhibited &#x003b2;-gal activity, which occurred with the same time course as yeast transformed with the complete 4.1G&#x02013;CTD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The inability of the 1&#x02013;67 aa construct to produce &#x003b2;-gal activity, eliminated val-pro and ser-pro as FKBP13 targets. To determine if the his-pro was responsible for FKBP13 binding, a 4.1G&#x02013;CTD construct containing aa 1&#x02013;106 that lacks this moiety and two constructs containing pro 108 to ala mutations (1&#x02013;129:P108A and 35&#x02013;129:P108A) were evaluated. These modifications completely abolished the FKBP13 interaction measured in yeast two-hybrid assays, suggesting that pro 108 of 4.1G&#x02013;CTD is important for FKBP13 binding. The finding that a pro preceded by his is involved in the interaction (rather than a leu- or val-pro), prompted us to assess whether his 107 is required for binding. 4.1G&#x02013;CTD constructs containing his 107 to leu (1-129: H107L) and his 107 to arg (1&#x02013;129:H107R) mutations both failed to promote the FKBP13/4.1G&#x02013;CTD interaction in yeast two&#x02013;hybrid assays.

IOVs that are depleted of spectrin and actin retained 4.1R (80-kD doublet [17]) and FKBP13. IOVs that are then depleted of peripheral membrane proteins by a stripping procedure lose 4.1R and FKBP13. Finally, Triton shells were prepared from RBC ghosts to further enrich for 4.1R. Western analysis of this preparation demonstrated increased amounts of 4.1R. The quantity of FKBP13 in Triton shells was likewise enriched compared to ghosts and IOVs.</p><p>It should be noted that these experiments do not completely rule out the possibility that the 13-kD protein identified in RBC ghosts is a distinct immunophilin that is recognized by the FKBP13 antibody and comigrates with brain FKBP13.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we have identified 4.1G&#x02013;CTD as the first known binding target of FKBP13. 4.1G is a novel, widely expressed homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeletal protein (4.1R). The FKBP13/4.1G&#x02013; CTD interaction was discovered using the yeast two&#x02013; hybrid system and then confirmed by in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation studies. Specificity of the association was established by blocking in vitro binding and the yeast interaction with FK506.</p><p>The cyclophilin and FKBP immunophilins possess peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, which interconverts the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers of peptidyl-prolyl bonds (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). FK506 mimics the transition state of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization, and thus effectively competes with natural substrates for FKBP binding. Interestingly, the binding domains of FKBP12 and FKBP13 for FK506 are virtually superimposable, as determined by X-ray crystallographic studies (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). However, the respective K<sub>i</sub>s of FK506 and rapamycin are 0.6 and 0.26 nM for FKBP12, and 74 and 3 nM for FKBP13 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), suggesting that the two proteins may have different substrate specificities in vivo. The differences between the affinities of FKBP12 and FKBP13 for FK506 and rapamycin have been explained by the cumulative effect of multiple small distortions in their protein structures (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Another distinction between the binding properties of FKBP12 and FKBP13 is exemplified by the ability of FKBP12, but not FKBP13, to form a complex with calcineurin in the presence of FK506. The inability of FKBP13&#x02013;FK506 to interact with calcineurin is attributed to the distinct gln-50, ala-95, and lys-98 surface residues of FKBP13 (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>The binding of 4.1G&#x02013;CTD to FKBP13 but not to FKBP12 underscores the selective nature of immunophilin interactions in vivo. Protein motifs that mimic the transition state of peptidyl-prolyl isomerization are believed to produce high affinity, steady-state interactions with FKBPs (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In this study, we have determined that his-pro 107&#x02013;108 of 4.1G&#x02013;CTD is required for FKBP13 binding. The crystallographic structure of the FKBP12&#x02013;FK506 complex indicates that the leu-like moiety of FK506, the pyranose methyl group region, shares a complementary surface with the side chains of his-87 and ile-91 of FKBP12. The corresponding aa in FKBP13 are ala-95 and lys-98. There is predicted complementarity between the IP<sub>3</sub>R-leu 1401 and FKBP12&#x02013;his 87 in the FKBP12&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R complex (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); the analogous aliphatic and his residues are reversed in FKBP13 and 4.1G&#x02013;CTD, suggesting that the 4.1G&#x02013;CTD&#x02013; his 107 may interface with FKBP13&#x02013;ala 95. We speculate that an aliphatic&#x02013;his complementarity may participate in FKBP-substrate interactions in vivo, conferring FKBP specificity based on the residues preceding pro in the physiologic targets.</p><p>A physiologic role for the FKBP13/4.1G&#x02013;CTD interaction is supported by the striking tissue colocalizations demonstrated throughout the body during development by in situ hybridization. FKBP13 and 4.1G&#x02013;CTD-containing mRNAs are widely expressed with enrichment in skeletal muscle, salivary glands, and the gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, respiratory, and nervous systems. Within these tissues, the proteins colocalize, for example, in intestinal crypt, salivary gland, and olfactory epithelium. Areas where expression of both transcripts is negligible include the heart and smooth muscle tissue of the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, and blood vessels. Whereas 4.1R transcripts predominantly localize to hematopoietic tissues and select neuronal populations (Walensky, L.D., Z.T. Shi, S. Blackshaw, A.C. DeVries, G.E. Demas, P. Gascard, R.J. Nelson, J.G. Conboy, E.M. Rubin, S.H. Snyder, and N. Mohandes. 1997. <italic>Mol. Biol. Cell</italic> [<italic>Suppl</italic>.] 8:275a), 4.1G mRNAs are broadly distributed, indicating a more generalized role for this 4.1 homologue.</p><p>The strong homology between 4.1G and 4.1R suggests that the novel 4.1G gene encodes a membrane cytoskeletal protein. The primary structure of FKBP13, however, contains a putative signal sequence and a variant of the defined KDEL motif, which may serve to target and retain FKBP13 in the ER, respectively (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The identification of a specific binding interaction between FKBP13 and 4.1G&#x02013; CTD, coupled with their mRNA tissue colocalizations, suggested that FKBP13 may additionally be found outside of the ER in association with 4.1G in the membrane cytoskeleton. Whereas FKBP13 has been identified in rough microsomal fractions enriched with ER membrane and luminal proteins (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), we were interested in determining if the membrane cytoskeleton could be a further source of FKBP13 protein. Thus, we conducted FKBP Western analysis on purified RBCs because they lack ER and are enriched in 4.1R, which shares sequence identity with 4.1G in the region implicated in FKBP13 binding. FKBP12 (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) and a 12-kD inositol phosphate-binding protein (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), believed to be an immunophilin, have previously been identified in RBCs. Our affinity-purified FKBP antibodies identified FKBP12 in the cytosol of RBCs and FKBP13 in RBC ghosts, where 4.1R is located. In addition, FKBP13 can be extracted from solubilized ghosts on the basis of its affinity for an FK506 matrix. Ghosts stripped of actin and spectrin retain both FKBP13 and 4.1R, whereas further treatment to remove peripheral membrane proteins liberates FKBP13 and 4.1R from the vesicles. The Triton shell preparation that enriches for 4.1R likewise contains increased FKBP13 compared to ghost and IOV samples. The development of isoform-specific antibodies is required to determine if 4.1G is found in RBCs and if the FKBP13 of RBCs interacts with 4.1G and/or 4.1R. These results demonstrate, however, that FKBP13 is a component of the RBC membrane cytoskeleton, and thus can occur outside of the ER. FKBP13 may localize to two distinct subcellular compartments by alternate transcriptional, translational or posttranslational processing of its putative NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal targeting sequence.</p><p>Whereas functional interactions of the MBD and SABD of 4.1R have been well documented (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), the role of the CTD remains undefined. In this report, we demonstrate the binding of FKBP13 to the CTD of 4.1G. What functional role might FKBP13 play in association with 4.1G&#x02013;CTD? Some clues may be derived from the physiologic implications of FKBP12 binding to its cellular targets. For example, FKBP12 has recently been shown to anchor calcineurin to the IP<sub>3</sub> receptor in a ternary complex, which regulates the phosphorylation state and function of the calcium channel (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). FKBP12 may serve a similar anchoring function in its association with the TGF&#x003b2; type 1 family of receptors (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). By analogy, FKBP13 may anchor regulatory protein phosphatases (or kinases) to 4.1G&#x02013; CTD, which may in turn regulate 4.1G function. 4.1R is well known to be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>); in each case, 4.1R phosphorylation leads to a marked decrease in its ability to bind spectrin and promote the spectrin&#x02013;actin interaction (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, protein kinase C phosphorylation of 4.1R inhibits its binding to membranes by blocking the interaction with band 3 (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our studies have identified a novel 4.1 homologue, whose CTD is a specific binding partner for immunophilin FKBP13. Interestingly, the 4.1G&#x02013;CTD peptide sequence required for FKBP13 binding is conserved in 4.1R across species. Research into the physiologic implications of the FKBP13/4.1G&#x02013;CTD interaction may provide insight into the functional role of the CTD of 4.1 proteins. The identification of FKBP13 outside of the ER, coupled with the widespread expression and colocalization of FKBP13 and 4.1G&#x02013;CTD transcripts throughout the body during development, suggest that these proteins perform a generalized function in the membrane cytoskeleton of mammalian cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank E.C.
