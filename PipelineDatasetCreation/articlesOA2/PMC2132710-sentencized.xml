<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Whereas cyclosporin A interacts with a family of proteins designated cyclophilins (31), FK506 and rapamycin bind to a growing family of FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs).1 A common feature of immunophilins is their peptidyl–prolyl isomerase activity (33). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In the presence of FK506, FKBP12 binds to calcineurin and inhibits its phosphatase activity, ultimately leading to T-cell immunosupression (26, 42, 43). </plain></SENT>
