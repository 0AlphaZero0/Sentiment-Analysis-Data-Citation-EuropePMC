We reveal that the absence of NrCAM causes the formation of mature cataracts in the mouse, whereas significant pathfinding errors of commissural axons at the midline of the spinal cord or of proprioceptive axon collaterals are not detected. Cataracts, the most common cause of visual impairment, are generated in NrCAM-deficient mice by a disorganization of lens fibers, followed by cellular disintegration and accumulation of cellular debris. The disorganization of fiber cells becomes histologically distinct during late embryonic development and includes abnormalities of the cytoskeleton and of connexin50-containing gap junctions. Furthermore, analysis of lenses of ankyrin-B mutant mice also reveals a disorganization of lens fibers at postnatal day 1, indistinguishable from that generated by the absence of NrCAM, indicating that NrCAM and ankyrin-B are required to maintain contact between lens fiber cells. Also, these studies provide genetic evidence of an interaction between NrCAM and ankyrin-B.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cell adhesion; Ig superfamily; L1 subgroup; cataract; axon outgrowth</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The transmembrane glycoprotein NgCAM-related cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> is a member of the L1 subgroup of immunoglobulin (Ig)-like cell adhesion proteins. This subgroup is composed of NrCAM, neurofascin, close homologue of L1 (CHL1), and L1 itself in vertebrates, and neuroglian and tractin in invertebrates (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;mmendorf et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hortsch, 2000</xref>). Like L1, NrCAM contains six Ig-like domains and five fibronectin type III (FNIII)-like repeats, a hydrophobic stretch, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic segment (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Grumet et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kayyem et al., 1992</xref>). A crucial role of the L1 subgroup of proteins in neural development is exemplified by a broad spectrum of neuroanatomical and neurological disorders caused by the knock out of the murine L1 gene (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dahme et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Demyanenko et al., 1999</xref>) and by mutations in the human L1 gene that affect the binding activity and trafficking of L1 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">De Angelis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Moulding et al., 2000</xref>). As also shown for other L1 subgroup members, NrCAM reveals a complex homo- and heterophilic binding pattern and is implicated in cell&#x02013;cell contact processes (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mauro et al., 1992</xref>). In in vitro bioassays it can promote axonal growth by binding to neurofascin, F11, or receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)&#x003b2;/&#x003b6; (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Volkmer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Sakurai et al., 1997</xref>) and can mediate interactions between neurons and glial cells via axonin-1 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Suter et al., 1995</xref>). In ovo antibody perturbation experiments indicate that NrCAM is important for commissural axons of the chicken spinal cord to grow across the midline through the floor plate and for proprioceptive axon collaterals to extend ventrally within the spinal cord (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fitzli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Perrin et al., 2001</xref>). NrCAM has also been found to be expressed specifically at the node of Ranvier in rat where it interacts with the cytoskeletal adaptor protein ankyrin-G (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lambert et al., 1997</xref>). Binding to ankyrin appears to be a common feature of L1 subfamily members and requires a highly conserved sequence within their cytoplasmic tails (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Davis and Bennett, 1994</xref>). This interaction appears to be inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation as demonstrated for neurofascin (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Tuvia et al., 1997</xref>), whereas clustering of the L1 subfamily member neuroglian at adhesion sites activates ankyrin binding followed by a redistribution of spectrin (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jefford and Dubreuil, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we describe the generation of <italic>NrCAM</italic> knock-out mice by gene targeting. The mice are viable and fertile, but smaller than heterozygous or wild-type littermates, and they show a slight motor defect. Although NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; neurons, unlike wild-type, are unable to grow on neurofascin and F11 in cell culture, NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; mice have no significant abnormalities on a histological level in any of their neural tissues. Also, unexpectedly, their commissural axons cross the spinal cord midline normally. Interestingly, we observed cataract formation due to a loss of intercellular communication between lens fiber cells followed by disintegration of cells. A similar disorganization of lens fiber cells was also observed in ankyrin-B&#x02013;deficient mice. These observations suggest that NrCAM and ankyrin-B&#x02013;deficient mice might provide further insights into cataractogenesis, one of the most common causes of visual impairment (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Francis et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Graw, 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The NrCAM locus and derivation of mutant mice</title><p>To study the function of NrCAM in an in vivo situation, we generated a mouse strain deficient for this gene.

The correct integration of the targeting vector and a deletion of the ATG-containing exon was confirmed by Southern hybridization as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> b and using the PauI-NheI fragment (region deleted in the mutant) as probe (not shown). Alternatively, the replacement of the ATG-containing exon by the neo cassette in the mutant mice was shown by PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> c). To detect NrCAM at the protein level, we generated polyclonal antibodies against a glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase fusion protein of the FNIII domains 1&#x02013;4 of NrCAM.

Although the gross anatomy of the nervous system appears normal, mutant mice develop a mature cataract in their lenses that becomes visible from the outside of the eye after 4 mo of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>
c). This cataract development was found to be progressive: 1-mo-old mice had lenses that were slightly less translucent in the nuclear region than wild-type lenses, and 4-mo-old mice already had a white opaque lens center. 9-mo-old mice had completely opaque lenses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> a).

At birth, most NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; mice were already relatively lighter than their heterozygous littermates and, at postnatal day (P)9.5, all NrCAM-deficient mice were lighter than their same-sexed heterozygous control siblings. At P15 to P35, the weight differences were most apparent; however, mutant animals stayed at &#x0223c;80% of the weight of their control siblings for their entire lifetime (not shown). To analyze whether the absence of NrCAM had an effect on the motor ability, we tested female NrCAM-deficient mice and wild-type control mice of similar weight for their ability to stay on a motionless or rotating rotarod. Generally, mutant mice fell from the rod at a higher frequency, especially when the rod was moving (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> e).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of NrCAM in the lens</title><p>NrCAM has been studied so far primarily in the developing nervous system.

a gives an overview of the lens architecture. Antibodies against NrCAM stain the cell surface of secondary fiber cells in mouse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> c) as well as in chick sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, d and e</xref>), showing regular staining patterns depending on the direction and position of the section. The fiber cells are flattened hexagons in cross-section (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, c and d</xref>), and the radial cell surfaces are highlighted more than the tangential cell surfaces. A longitudinal section of the mouse or chick lens results in a pattern of parallel lines, each line representing the neighboring cell surfaces of two lens fiber cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> e). The expression of NrCAM in the primary lens fibers was still visible in P12 mouse lenses, but very low in adult mouse lenses (not shown). Interestingly, no NrCAM expression was observed in the lens epithelium or the lens capsule (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> f), or the cell surface of fiber cells bordering the capsule (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> g), indicating that the contact formation between lens epithelial cells and between lens fiber cells and capsule is not mediated by NrCAM.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Expression of NrCAM in lens.</bold> (a) Schematic overview of an adult mouse lens as central longitudinal section. The lens has a spheric shape with a symmetry around its rotational axis. It contains primary lens fibers that are formed during early embryonic development and secondary lens fibers that are formed during later embryonic development and throughout life. The anterior end (pointing upwards) has a monolayer of epithelial cells that can divide and migrate towards the sides of the lens, followed by an elongation and maturation process, in which the nucleus and other organelles are lost and characteristics of secondary fiber cells are adopted. For clarity, the capsule, epithelial cells, and lens fibers are not drawn to scale (adapted from <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bassnett et al., 1999</xref>).

No other L1 subfamily proteins, including the NrCAM ligand neurofascin, are expressed in the lens at any stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> h). Also, other heterophilic extracellular ligands of NrCAM such as the F11 protein, axonin-1 or RPTP&#x003b2;/&#x003b6;, are absent from the lens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> i). Interestingly, chick lens NrCAM is consistently slightly larger than chick brain NrCAM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> h), whereas mouse lens NrCAM has approximately the same size as the smaller of two almost comigrating bands of brain NrCAM (not shown). These size differences might be due to posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation or to alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA. In summary, the absence of the currently known NrCAM ligands suggests a homophilic binding mode of NrCAM between opposing lens fiber membranes. However, heterophilic binding of NrCAM to a so far uncharacterized membrane protein expressed on lens fibers cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological analysis of cataract development in NrCAM-deficient mice</title><p>To begin to understand the importance of NrCAM for the development and maintenance of a functional translucent lens, we investigated lenses of NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; mice of different stages by standard histological methods. In mouse lenses of E14.5 embryos that consist predominantly of primary lens fibers, no significant morphological changes were observed in the NrCAM mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>
a). At E18, secondary lens fibers have developed. Even though there are roundish large-appearing cells especially at the anterior pole close to the suture in the mutant, most of the fiber cells remain ordered in the transition zone as in wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, b and c</xref>). Also, at P12 there are many fiber cells remaining in a somewhat ordered context, in particular in the periphery, but the number of rounded disoriented cells among the secondary lens fibers increases towards the nucleus of the lens (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> d). By 2 mo, the regular wild-type pattern (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> e) of cross-sectioned secondary lens fibers is severely disturbed in the NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; lens (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> f), as shown here for the region around the posterior pole. The cell shape and arrangement is still most ordered for the cells that have migrated inwards from the epithelium more recently (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> g, upper right). But even among these cells, there are some cells that start to round up, becoming shorter and thicker (arrow). Other cells have lost their integrity completely, creating distinct zones of cellular debris (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> g, *). Persisting cells are intensely stained, rounded, and have lost their orientation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> g, arrowhead).

In addition, we observe aggregates of connexin50, especially in the more interior layers of secondary lens fibers that have a higher occurrence of abnormally shaped cells. We conclude that NrCAM is not required for the localization of connexin50 to gap junctions when they are first created, but that it is required for gap junction maintenance, most likely indirectly by enabling cell&#x02013;cell contact.</p></sec><sec><title>Axonal pathfinding in the spinal cord and neurite outgrowth of NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; cells</title><p>Previous studies on NrCAM indicated a role for NrCAM in axonal pathfinding by in ovo antibody perturbation experiments (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Stoeckli and Landmesser, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Perrin et al., 2001</xref>).

However, 7 of these 10 axons still crossed the midline at a point more rostrally or caudally, and proceeded in the correct path after that. This amounts to a pathfinding error rate of 1.48%, a frequency comparable to that encountered in wild type (11 of 741 axons).

However, a selective stain of these axons in E15 embryos using antibodies against parvalbumin revealed no significant abnormalities (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, c and d</xref>). Further histological studies within the developing nervous system including retina, cerebellum, and spinal cord using antibodies to various neural proteins do not reveal any gross anatomical defects within NrCAM mutant mice (not shown).</p><p>Previous cell culture analyzes using embryonal chicken tectal neurons show an inhibition of neurite growth on immobilized F11 or neurofascin (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Morales et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Volkmer et al., 1996</xref>) by NrCAM antibodies, indicating that NrCAM acts as neuronal receptor protein for these substrates.

To analyze these observations further, embryonic brains of control or NrCAM<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; mice were dissociated, and single cells were seeded on a surface coated with substrate proteins.

These results confirm our previous cell culture observations with chicken neurons in antibody perturbation experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>NrCAM, previously not known to be expressed in the lens, is essential for maintenance of lens transparency and an ordered arrangement of lens fiber cells. Interestingly, the absence of ankyrin-B causes similar lens fiber disorganization as the absence of NrCAM, and both mutations cause cytoskeletal disarrangement, providing a genetic link between the interaction of NrCAM and ankyrin-B. Unexpectedly, significant pathfinding errors of commissural axons at the midline and of proprioceptive collaterals of the spinal cord are not detectable in the absence of NrCAM. NrCAM and other L1 subfamily members and their ligands are expressed in the developing nervous system in a dynamic and partially overlapping pattern (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;mmendorf and Rathjen, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;mmendorf et al., 1998</xref>). In contrast, only NrCAM, but none of its family members nor its ligands, are expressed in the lens. Thus, no other family member can compensate a loss of NrCAM in these cells. This might be the reason for this deleterious effect on the structure of lens fibers caused by the absence of NrCAM in contrast to the situation within the developing nervous system.</p><p>It is likely that the lens phenotype results from a perturbation of the maintenance of contacts between lens fiber cells. The absence of the currently known ligands of NrCAM suggests that this contact is mediated by homophilic binding of NrCAM on lens fibers. The consequences of the lack to establish appropriate contacts between cell membranes may result in the failure to form water channels by aquaporins or gap junctions, as indicated here by the irregular distribution and decrease of connexin50-containing gap junctions. Water channels and gap junctions are important for the transport of water or ions, metabolites, and second messengers and allow communication between metabolically inert lens fibers deep within the lens. Gap junctional channels that bridge the extracellular space are formed by members of the connexin gene family, in particular in lenses, by connexin50, -46, and -43, that allow transport of small molecules and facilitate the continuous flow (&#x0003c;1 kD) of ions, metabolites, and second messengers. This flow appears to be important for lens clarity, as demonstrated by analysis of connexin50 and -46 mutant mice (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 1998</xref>) and mutations in humans (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shiels et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mackay et al., 1999</xref>). The absence of connexin50 in mice results in reduced growth of the lens and the eye and the appearance of zonular pulverulent nuclear cataracts, however intercellular communication is not completely lost in these mice. In the absence of connexin50, lenses develop a nuclear cataract that is associated with the proteolysis of crystallins. Mutations within the major intrinsic protein, which also is important for intercellular communication of the lens fibers, causes lamellar cataracts in humans and mice (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Shiels and Bassnett, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Berry et al., 2000</xref>). The major intrinsic protein that forms tetramers within the plasma membrane regulates the transport of water in an energy- and direction-independent manner (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Heymann et al., 1998</xref>). Other mutations in humans or mice known to cause cataracts include genes encoding crystallins, which constitute the main cytoplasmic proteins in lens and the transcription factor PITX3 (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Semina et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Francis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Graw, 1999</xref>).</p><p>As shown by lens fiber disorganization in the ankyrin-B<sup>&#x02212;/</sup>&#x02212; lens, NrCAM function requires a link to the cytoskeleton via ankyrin. In addition, the transmembrane protein NrCAM, as well as the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin-B may function directly in maintaining an ordered cytoskeleton in the lens, for example, by anchoring the cytoskeleton to the lens membrane. Alternatively or in addition, the observed disarrangement of F-actin may be caused indirectly due to the perturbed lens metabolism. Both NrCAM and ankyrin-B, but most likely the cytoskeleton as a whole, may also be important for the suprastructural organization of cytoplasmic proteins such as the crystallins. Thus, crystallins might not be able to maintain their normal organization in NrCAM-deficient lenses, thus creating opacification.</p><p>Although the <italic>NrCAM</italic> (human chromosome 7q22-31) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Burmeister et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lane et al., 1996</xref>) and <italic>ankyrin-B</italic> (human chromosome 4q25-q27) (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Tse et al., 1991</xref>) loci have not been mapped so far to cataract formation in humans, our studies in mice might contribute to the understanding of cataract formation in humans. NrCAM is very similar to L1, the founder of this subfamily of adhesion proteins within the Ig superfamily. Missense mutations within the L1 gene have been shown to result in a broad spectrum of neurological disorders with different degrees of severity (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Br&#x000fc;mmendorf et al., 1998</xref>). It is conceivable that point mutations within the NrCAM gene affecting its homophilic binding activity might also cause cataract formation to different degrees. It is therefore not unlikely to implicate the NrCAM gene in recessive forms of inherited human cataracts. In addition, the inherited deletion or mutation of one <italic>NrCAM</italic> or <italic>ANK2</italic> allele could increase the susceptibility to age-related cataract formation. An inherited complete absence of ankyrin-B, however, might be lethal at early stages, as observed for mice (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Scotland et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mapping the <italic>NrCAM</italic> locus and derivation of mutant mice</title><p>To obtain information about the mouse <italic>NrCAM</italic> locus, a PCR screen in a mouse ES BAC library was done using primers derived from rat cDNA sequence of NrCAM.
