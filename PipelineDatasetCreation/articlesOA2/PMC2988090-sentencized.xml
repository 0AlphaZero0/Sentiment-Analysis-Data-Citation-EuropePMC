<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>JA is activated upon specific conjugation to the amino acid L-isoleucine (Ile), which produces the highly bioactive hormonal signal, JA-Ile that is functionally and structurally mimicked by the Pseudomonas syringae phytotoxin coronatine2–4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The discovery of coronatine-insensitive mutants enabled the identification of CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) as a key player in the JA pathway, with further implications of regulated proteolysis in JA perception and signal transduction5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>COI1 is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recruiting module of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have identified the JASMONATE ZIM-domain (JAZ) family of transcriptional repressors as the SCFCOI1 substrate targets, which associate with COI1 in a hormone-dependent manner6–8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the absence of hormone signal, JAZ proteins actively repress the transcription factor MYC2, which binds to cis-acting elements of JA-response genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In response to cues that up-regulate JA-Ile synthesis, the hormone stimulates the specific binding of JAZ proteins to COI1, leading to poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of JAZ by the 26S proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>JAZ degradation relieves repression of MYC2 and likely other transcription factors, permitting the expression of JA-responsive genes6,9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The role of COI1-mediated JAZ degradation in JA signaling is analogous to auxin signaling through the receptor F-box protein TIR1, which promotes hormone-dependent turnover of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors10,11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Supported by its sequence homology and functional similarity to TIR1, COI1 has been assigned a critical role in the direct perception of the JA signal12,13. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Here we present crystal structures of COI1 bound to JA-Ile or coronatine, as well as peptides of a bi-partite JAZ1 degron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Our structural and pharmacological studies reveal that the true JA receptor is in fact a co-receptor complex, consisting of the F-box protein COI1, the JAZ degron, and a newly discovered third component, inositol pentakisphosphate. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>To better characterize the pharmacology of JA perception, we used recombinant proteins and 3H-coronatine to quantitatively define the functional components of the receptor system with an in vitro radioligand binding assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>From saturation binding experiments, we detected high affinity specific binding of 3H-coronatine to COI1 in the presence of two different full-length JAZ proteins, JAZ6 and JAZ1 at a Kd of 68 nM and 48 nM, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The highly active (3R,7S) isomer of JA-Ile (Fig. 1c), and the less active (3R,7R) isomer, compete with 3H-coronatine for binding to the COI1-JAZ6 complex with Ki values of 1.8 µM and 18 µM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 3H-coronatine displayed no affinity to the JAZ proteins and exhibited only marginal binding to the F-box protein alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Hormone binding to COI1 alone elicited &lt; 2% binding signal relative to that of COI1-JAZ at a concentration that saturates the complex (300 nM) (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This result, together with the observation that endogenous JA-Ile activates COI1-dependent gene expression in the nM range1,14,15, indicates that the COI1-JAZ complex, rather than COI1 alone, functions as the genuine high affinity JA receptor in a co-receptor form. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We have previously mapped the COI1-binding region of the JAZ proteins to the C-terminal Jas motif, which is characterized by the SLX2FX2KRX2RX5PY consensus sequence preceded by two consecutive basic residues16,17 (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A single Ala mutation of the central strictly conserved phenylalanine residue in the Jas motif is sufficient to abolish the formation of the high affinity JA co-receptor (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Previous studies showed that the highly conserved PY sequence at the C-terminus of the Jas motif plays a role in JAZ localization and stability in vivo, but is not required for ligand-dependent COI1-JAZ interaction16,18,19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these findings, truncation of the PY motif in JAZ1 has little effect on the in vitro ligand binding activity (Supplementary Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To further map the minimal region of the Jas motif required for high affinity ligand binding with COI1, we replaced the recombinant protein with synthetic peptides of JAZ1 in the ligand binding assay (Fig. 1d, e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A 22-amino-acid JAZ1 peptide (Arg205–Tyr226) spanning the central conserved Jas motif plus the two N-terminal basic residues was not sufficient to form the high affinity JA co-receptor with COI1, suggesting that amino acids N-terminal to Arg205 also participate in the COI1-JA interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Because several JAZ proteins exhibit sequence homology in this region (Fig. 1d), we tested a series of JAZ1 peptides in which the N-terminus was systematically extended by one amino acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, inclusion of four but not three amino acids N-terminal to Arg205 allows ligand-dependent co-receptor formation, whereas addition of the fifth residue (Glu200) to the JAZ1 peptide permits 3H-coronatine binding with a Kd comparable to that of the full-length JAZ1 protein (Fig. 1e, f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Despite the sequence variation among different JAZ members in this region, only select amino acids are functional in this five amino acid extension, as a penta-alanine sequence fails to elicit the same effect (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicate that the JAZ1 protein uses a minimal sequence (Glu200–Val220) within the Jas motif, which consists of a highly conserved central and C-terminal region and a more variable N-terminal region, to interact with COI1 and perceive the JA signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our in vitro ligand binding data, the minimal sequence in JAZ1 is sufficient for coronatine-induced COI1-JAZ1 interaction (Supplementary Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the interactions among COI1, coronatine, and the JAZ1 peptide are highly cooperative and that the short Glu200–Val220 sequence functions as the JAZ1 degron. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the structural mechanism by which the COI1-JAZ1 co-receptor senses JA, we crystallized and determined the structures of the COI1-ASK1-JAZ1 degron peptide complex together with either (3R,7S)-JA-Ile or coronatine (Supplemental Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of COI1 reveals a TIR1-like overall architecture20, with an N-terminal tri-helical F-box motif bound to ASK1 and a C-terminal horseshoe-shaped solenoid domain formed by 18 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs; Fig. 2a, b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Similar to TIR1, the top surface of the COI1 LRR domain has three long intra-repeat loops (Loop-2, 12, and 14) that are involved in hormone and polypeptide substrate binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Unlike TIR1, however, a fourth long loop (Loop-C) in the C-terminal capping sequence of the COI1 LRR domain folds over Loop-2, partially covering it from above (Fig 2b, c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Despite their similar overall fold, COI1 has evolved a hormone-binding site that is distinct from TIR1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Configured in between Loop-2 and the inner wall of the LRR solenoid, the ligand-binding pocket of COI1 is exclusively encircled by amino acid side chains (Fig. 2d–f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Many of the pocket-forming residues on COI1 are large in size and carry a polar head group (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>These properties allow them to mold a binding pocket into a specific shape while forming close interactions with each chemical moiety of the ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>These close interactions are critical to proper hormone-sensing of the complex — in yeast two-hybrid assays, mutation of any of these large side-chain amino acids on COI1 is sufficient to disrupt the interaction of COI1 with JAZ1 in the presence of coronatine (Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In the binding pocket, both JA-Ile and coronatine sit in an “upright” position with the keto group of their common cyclopentanone ring pointing up and forming a triangular hydrogen bond network with Arg496 and Try444 of COI1 at the pocket entrance (Fig. 2d–f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Without the JAZ degron peptide bound, the keto group of the ligand is accessible to solvent (Fig. 2g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The rest of the cyclopentanone ring of both JA-Ile and coronatine is sandwiched between the aromatic groups of Phe89 and Tyr444 of COI1, stabilized by hydrophobic packing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The cyclohexene ring of coronatine provides a rigid surface area for close packing with Phe89, whereas the more flexible and extended pentenyl side chain of JA-Ile is more loosely accommodated by a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ala86, Phe89, and Leu91 from Loop-2 as well as Leu469 and Trp519 from the LRRs (Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Differences at this interface likely explain the approximately 10-fold higher affinity of coronatine over (3R,7S)-JA-Ile, as detected in our binding assays. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Deeper in the ligand binding pocket, the common amide and carboxyl groups of JA-Ile and coronatine bind to the bottom of the binding site by forming a salt bridge and hydrogen bond network with three basic residues of COI1, Arg85, Arg348, and Arg409 (Fig. 2d, e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Together, these arginine residues constitute the charged floor of the ligand pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Tyr386 reinforces the interactions from above by making a hydrogen bond with the amine group of the ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In doing so, Tyr386 approaches the cyclopentanone ring of the ligand, narrowing the pocket entrance, and creating a hydrophobic cave below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The rest of the basin is carved out by Val411, Ala384, and the aliphatic side chain of Arg409 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The ethyl-cyclopropane group of coronatine and the isoleucine side chain of JA-Ile can both comfortably fit in this space due to their similar size and hydrophobicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The nature of the cave explains the preference of COI1 for JA conjugates containing a moderately-sized hydrophobic amino acid13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Although most of the ligand is buried inside the binding site, the keto group at the top and the carboxyl group at the bottom remain exposed, available for additional interactions with the JAZ portion of the co-receptor (Fig. 2g). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The JAZ1 degron peptide adopts a bipartite structure with a loop region followed by an α-helix to assemble with the COI1-JA complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of the JAZ1 degron is the N-terminal five amino acids identified in the radioligand binding assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In a largely extended conformation, this short sequence lies on top of the hormone-binding pocket and simultaneously interacts with both COI1 and the ligand, effectively trapping the ligand in the pocket (Fig. 3a, b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>At the N-terminal end, Leu201 of the JAZ1 peptide is embedded in a hydrophobic cavity presented by surface loops on top of COI1 (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>At the C-terminal end, Ala204 of JAZ1 uses its short side chain to pack against the keto group of the ligand and Phe89 of COI1 (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The same alanine residue of JAZ1 also donates a hydrogen bond through its backbone amide group to the keto moiety of the ligand emerging from the pocket (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The middle region of the five amino acid sequence is secured to the COI1-JA complex through a hydrogen bond formed between the backbone carbonyl of Pro202 in JAZ1 and the ligand-interacting COI1 residue Arg496, which is critical for hormone-dependent COI1-JAZ interaction (Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In agreement with its important role in forming the JA-Ile co-receptor, this short N-terminal region of the JAZ1 degron completely covers the opening of the ligand-binding pocket, conferring high affinity binding to the hormone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The close interaction between the hormone and the co-receptor complex provides a plausible structural explanation for the favorable binding of (3R,7S)-JA-Ile isomer, as the stereochemistry at the 7 position of (3R,7R)-JA-Ile may place the aliphatic chain unfavorably close to nearby JAZ1 and COI1 residues (Supplementary Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Within the JAZ1 degron, two conserved basic residues, Arg205 and Arg206, were previously shown to play an important role in hormone-induced COI1 binding17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In the structure, Arg205 contributes to COI1 binding by directly interacting with Loop-12, whereas Arg206 points in the opposite direction and inserts deeply into the central tunnel of the COI1 solenoid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Approaching the bottom of the ligand-binding pocket, the guanidinium group of the Arg206 side chain joins the three basic COI1 residues that form the pocket floor and interacts directly with the carboxyl group of the ligand (Fig. 3d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Thus, the N-terminal seven amino acids (ELPIARR) of the JAZ1 degron peptide acts as a clamp that wraps the ligand-binding pocket from top to bottom, closing it completely (Fig. 3b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The highly conserved C-terminal half of the JAZ1 degron forms an amphiphathic α-helix that strengthens JAZ1-COI1 interaction by binding to the top surface of the COI1 LRR domain, adjacent to the ligand-binding site (Fig. 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>With its N-terminal end directly packing against Loop-2 of COI1, the Jas motif helix blocks the central tunnel of the COI1 LRR solenoid like a plug. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The N-terminal half of the Jas motif helix is characterized by three hydrophobic residues, Leu209, Phe212, and Leu213, which are aligned on the same side of the helix and form a hydrophobic interface with COI1 (Fig. 3e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>By soaking the COI1-ASK1 crystals with coronatine and a sufficiently high concentration of JAZ1 degron peptide lacking the N-terminal ELPIA sequence, we were able to trap a complex formed by COI1, coronatine, and the isolated Jas motif helix in the crystal (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the α-helix may provide a low affinity anchor for docking the JAZ protein on COI1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>In support of this idea, single amino acid mutations at the complementary surface on COI1 readily disrupt hormone-induced COI1-JAZ1 interaction (Fig. 3f). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the binding of a small molecule cofactor, the crystal structure of COI1 showed strong unexplained electron densities clustered in the middle of the COI1 LRR domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Like InsP6 in TIR1, these extra densities in COI1 are located directly adjacent to the bottom of the ligand-binding pocket of the JA co-receptor, interacting with multiple positively charged COI1 residues (Fig. 4e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, these islands of electron density cannot be explained by an Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 molecule. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Because a high concentration of ammonium phosphate was used as the major precipitant for crystallizing the JA co-receptor, we postulate that the InsP5 molecule co-purified with COI1 was later displaced by phosphate molecules in the crystallization drops. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>To assess the functional role of Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 in the COI1-JAZ1 co-receptor, we took advantage of our crystallographic observation and developed a protocol to strip the co-purified InsP5 from COI1 without denaturing the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The resulting COI1-ASK1 complex was then tested in a ligand binding-based reconstitution assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 5a, untreated COI1 formed a high affinity JA co-receptor with JAZ1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Addition of exogenous Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 did not significantly change its activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>From this reconstitution result, we conclude that Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 binding is crucial for the JA co-receptor to perceive the hormone with high sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Although further effort is needed to reveal how InsP5 binds to COI1, a close examination of the phosphate molecules in the available COI1 structure suggests a mechanism by which the inositol phosphate molecule may modulate the activity of the JA co-receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Among four COI1-bound phosphates, one stands out by binding at a critical position in the JA co-receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>This phosphate molecule interacts simultaneously with four basic residues at the bottom of the ligand-binding pocket, namely Arg206 in the JAZ1 degron and the three COI1 arginine residues that form the floor of the pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>As a result, a tetragonal bipyramidal interaction network is formed among four molecules at the core of the JA co-receptor assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>The four arginines from COI1 and JAZ1 sit at the four corners of the central plane, interacting with the hormone above and the phosphate below (Fig. 5f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>As the free phosphate molecule likely mimics the action of a phosphate group on InsP5, this four-molecule junction, together with additional phosphate-COI1 interactions seen in the crystal, conceivably represents the structural basis for InsP5 potentiation of the JA co-receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this interpretation, coronatine-induced formation of a COI1-JAZ1 complex was readily abolished by mutations of select COI1 residues adjacent to the phosphates, but not in contact with the hormone (Supplementary Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>We used the reconstitution assay to further investigate the specificity of JA co-receptor regulation by inositol phosphates (Fig. 5d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, inositol (1,4,5,6) tetrakisphosphate supports the activity of the COI1-JAZ1 co-receptor, whereas the second messenger signaling molecule inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate does not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Addition of a phosphate to InsP5, which gives rise to InsP6, is also not favorable for activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Although saturation binding of 3H-coronatine is stimulated by both Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 with similar Kd values (30 nM and 37 nM, respectively), the two inositol phosphates yield drastically different Bmax values for coronatine binding, indicating that InsP6 is significantly less efficacious in activating the co-receptor despite having equal affinity as Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 (Fig. 5e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Functional selectivity of COI1 for the inositol phosphate cofactor is consistent with the conservation of the putative inositol phosphate-binding site, which is distinct in amino-acid sequence from the InsP6-binding site in TIR120 (Supplementary Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>

With extensive dialysis to remove the co-purified InsP5 cofactor, 100 nM 3H-coronatine no longer binds dialyzed COI1 in the presence of JAZ1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Synthetic Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 rescues binding. c. Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 rescues the binding of 100 nM 3H-coronatine to dialyzed COI1-ASK1 in the presence of JAZ1 with an EC50 of 27±12 nM. d. Binding assays performed with 100 nM 3H-coronatine, dialyzed COI1, and 1 µM synthetic Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 (InsP5), Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 (InsP4), or Ins(1,4,5)P3 (InsP3). e. Saturation binding of 3H-coronatine to dialyzed COI1 in the presence of 1 µM of Ins(1,2,4,5,6)P5 (InsP5) and Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6 (InsP6) at a Kd of 30±5 nM and 37±8 nM, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>All results are the mean ± S.E. of up to three experiments performed in duplicate. f. A phosphate-binding site in the complex structure reveals an interwoven hydrogen bond network that may explain the mechanism by which the InsP cofactor potentiates the JA co-receptor. </plain></SENT>
