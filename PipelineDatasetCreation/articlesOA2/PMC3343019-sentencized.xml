<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An antigenic fragment encoded by spr1875, designated R4, was identified using a Streptococcus pneumoniae phage displayed genomic library after selection with a human convalescent serum. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is an extracellular human respiratory pathogen causing sinusitis, otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Invasive pneumococcal infections are an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, especially among young children and the elderly [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Pneumococci cause at least 1 million deaths worldwide every year, mostly as a result of community-acquired pneumonia [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, antibiotic resistance is increasing at an alarming rate among pneumococcal clinical isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine provides partial, serotype-specific protection in adults, but has limited efficacy in young children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although conjugate vaccines are effective also in children, protection is limited to the serotypes present in vaccine formulation and serotype replacement is threatening to decrease vaccine efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>This is exemplified by the increase, in the 7-valent vaccine era, of invasive disease caused by strains of serotype 19A, a serotype not included in this vaccine [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the development of serotype-independent vaccines targeting protein virulence factors is being actively pursued and several pneumococcal proteins have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We have recently used a lambda phage displayed whole genome library to identify several antigenic pneumococcal fragments, based on their ability to bind to serum antibodies from patients convalescing from pneumococcal infection or from experimentally infected mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This powerful approach allowed the identification of a large panel of B-cell epitopes within known virulence factors or protective antigens, including members of the choline-binding, histidine-triad and zinc metalloproteinase families [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we identified new antigenic regions matching the sequence of a novel pneumococcal adhesin, which was designated as plasminogen and fibronectin binding protein B [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We report here on the identification of a novel fragment designated as R4, which is encoded by ORF spr1875 in the R6 genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The spr1875 gene was found to be conserved amongst pneumococcal strains isolated from different geographical areas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In an experimental model of sepsis, a mutant strain devoid of Spr1875 was attenuated in virulence. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the identification and characterization of a novel protein antigen, Spr1875, and of recombinant fragments encompassing the length of this protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Spr1875 was found to elicit antibodies in the course of human pneumococcal infection, since it was identified by the ability of its R4 fragment to bind antibodies in a convalescent serum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Moreover, further data indicated that the R4 fragment is recognized by a high proportion of sera from patients recovering from pneumococcal disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Little is presently know on the biological function of Spr1875. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The spr1875 gene was previously found to be strongly upregulated by the VicR component of the VicRK two-component regulatory system together with three other genes encoding one known virulence factors (pspA) and putative membrane (spr0709) and cell wall (spr0096) proteins [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Spr0096 and Spr1875 are the only two proteins in S. pneumoniae to contain LysM peptidoglycan-binding motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Several LysM proteins are known to be virulence factors and/or protective antigens of human bacterial pathogens and some function as adhesins [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>For example, Staphylococcus aureus produces five LysM proteins, which are all involved in virulence [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Similar to Spr1875, protein Sip of Streptococcus agalactiae, which is considered a promising candidate for an S. agalactiae vaccine [12], [13], contains one N-terminal LysM domain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In the first part of this study, we focused on the expression of the spr1875 gene and on the impact of Spr1875 upon pneumococcal virulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry assays demonstrated that Spr1875 is displayed on the surface of pneumococcal strains belonging to different serotypes, although the presence of the polysaccharide capsule largely masked the antigen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with other studies reporting that the pneumococcal capsule may mask to varying degrees several surface proteins and adhesins [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we found that the spr1875 gene was remarkably conserved amongst serotypes and showed a low degree of polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Virulence experiments demonstrated that Spr1875 is required for in vivo pneumococcal growth, as evidenced by the decreased ability of a Δspr1875 deletion mutant to produce lethal infection in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The effects of such deletion were marked and equalled or exceeded those observed with a ΔpspA deletion mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Therefore our data indicate that Spr1875 may behave as an important virulence factor, although further studies are clearly needed to elucidate the function of this protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>In the second part of the study, we focused on the immunoprotective activity of Spr1875 and on its potential use as a component of a protein-based vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>After immunization with the recombinant R4 fragment, we observed significant protection against lethal pneumococcal infection as 50–70% of R4-GST-immunized mice were protected, while only 10–20% of GST-immunized animals survived. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the whole Spr1875 protein was devoid of immunoprotective activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to analyze in greater detail the nature of the antibody response induced by whole Spr1875. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>It was found that 80–90% of the reactivity of serum antibodies in Spr1875-immunized animals was directed against the C-terminal portion of the molecule located outside of the R4 fragment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Therefore, only low levels of anti-R4 antibodies were generated by Spr1875 immunization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we did not observe protective effects after immunization with a recombinant fragment (R5-GST) encompassing the whole length of the C terminal fragment external to R4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Thus, lack of immunoprotection by the whole Spr1875 protein was linked to the production of antibodies predominantly directed against non-protective, immunodominant epitopes located outside of the R4 fragment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, immunoprotection was associated with the induction of anti-R4 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Little is known on the molecular factors that determine the immunodominance of some epitopes over others, although this phenomenon is known to occur after immunization with virtually any protein antigen [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It is generally thought that antigens bearing immunodominant epitopes are attractive vaccine candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>However the opposite may be true. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>As recently noted [16], from the pathogen standpoint it would be useful if the host antibody response was directed against the non-protective portion of a virulence factor containing potentially protective epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In other words, immunodominance of some protein regions may reflect an immune evasion mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In this case, it would be appropriate, in terms of vaccine development, to redirect the response against the non-immunodominant, protective portion of an antigen, by synthesizing protein fragments that don't incorporate the immunodominant epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This seemed to be the case using Rib and a proteins of S. agalactiae and the M antigens of S. pyogens, in which non immunodominant regions proved to be of particular interest as vaccine components [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in the present study, another Spr1875 fragment (designated as R2) showed, in addition to R4, protective activity against pneumococcal infection after immunization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Since the R2 and R4 fragments overlap in a relatively short (54 aa long) portion of the Spr1875 protein, our data raises the possibility that this overlap region contains the protective epitope(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Further studies are clearly needed to test this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Our data showing that transfer of anti-R4 antibodies protected mice from lethal challenge against the encapsulated D39 strain could, at first glance, appear in contradiction with the inability of such antibodies to bind to the surface of in vitro grown D39, due to the masking effect of the capsule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>However, it is likely that in vivo, at least temporarily or in specific host microenvironments, capsular material is shed from the bacterial surface and/or capsule expression is down-regulated, resulting in exposure of underlying antigens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>In support of this notion, several surface pneumococcal antigens whose ability to interact with host components is well documented, are inaccessible to specific antibodies when grown in vitro [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have identified a novel immunogenic surface protein with an essential role in virulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Although complete protection was not observed, these data indicate that selected fragments of the 1875 protein may help, in conjunction with other antigens, in the development of effective vaccines based on pneumococcal proteins. </plain></SENT>
