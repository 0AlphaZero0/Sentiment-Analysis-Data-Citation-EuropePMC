</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Combining the structural data with those obtained from in silico docking allows formulating a working hypothesis for the mechanism of desaturation carried out by CRTI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Chemically, this reaction corresponds to the dehydrogenation of a -CH2-CH2- fragment that is flanked by a group capable of exerting activation (Scheme S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>This can be compared to the situation found in the αβ-dehydrogenation of acyl-CoAs, a reaction catalyzed by the intensively studied members of the family of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (ACADs) and acyl-CoA oxidases (ACOs) [42], [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>This dehydrogenation is initiated by abstraction of the substrate α-H as a proton, the β-H then being transferred to the flavin as a hydride. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>Activation/acidification of the α-H is brought about by two strong H-bridges to the substrate thioester carbonyl (Scheme S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>For CRTI, it is assumed that a functional group (∼B2 in Scheme S1) carries out a corresponding activation by (transiently) protonating the -C = C- double bond flanking the substrate α-H. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>In the ACAD/ACO family a carboxylate is the base abstracting the α-H. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>It is thus tempting to suggest a similar role for D149 (Figure 12) as the base B1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>This would agree with the pH dependences of the activities (Figure S1B, [42]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>In both enzyme groups the rates are low at low pH, where the carboxylate is likely to be protonated, and increase to a plateau with apparent pK’s near pH 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>Following abstraction of the α-H as a H+ the β-H would be transferred as a hydride onto the oxidized flavin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>This could occur concertedly or via intermediates as with the ACADs and ACOs [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Possibly, the function of bases ∼B1 and ∼B2 could also be exerted by a single bidentate functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Candidate amino acids would be R148, D149 and R152 (Figure 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Which of these are involved, acting singly or in combination, cannot be decided and must await corresponding mutagenesis of candidate amino acids singly and in combination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>The presence of a group that protonates a -C = C- function is also required for isomerization reactions in the presence of FADred, which – in analogy to suggestions developed for CRTY and CRTISO [11], [24] - would serve as a stabilizer of an intermediate carbocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>There is an additional, mechanistically relevant similarity between CRTI and MCAD: Both enzymes reconstituted with 5-deaza-FAD are not active in dehydrogenation turn-over, although with MCAD transfer of a hydride to the cofactor occurs [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>This would be consistent with a similar, basic mechanism of dehydrogenation for both enzyme classes. </plain></SENT>
