</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of bacterial cell-cell communication that relies on the production, release, detection, and response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>QS allows groups of bacteria to synchronously alter behavior in response to changes in the population density and species composition of the vicinal community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>QS controls collective behaviors including bioluminescence, sporulation, virulence factor production, and biofilm formation (Reviewed in [1], [2]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Impairing virulence factor production or function has gained increasing attention as a method to control bacterial pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The advantage of anti-virulence strategies over traditional antibiotics is presumed to be reduced pressure on bacteria to develop resistance [3]–[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Because QS controls virulence in many clinically relevant pathogens, disrupting QS is viewed as a promising possibility for this type of novel therapeutic development [6]–[8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria use acylhomoserine lactones (HSLs) as QS autoinducers, which are detected by either cytoplasmic LuxR-type or membrane-bound LuxN-type receptors [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To date, efforts to interfere with HSL QS in Gram-negative bacteria have yielded several potent antagonists [10]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While these strategies are exciting, some globally important Gram-negative pathogens do not use HSLs as autoinducers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Thus, additional strategies that target non-HSL based QS systems are required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a set of small-molecule inhibitors that act on the non-HSL QS system of Vibrio cholerae by targeting two independent steps in the signal transduction pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>V. cholerae is the etiological agent of the disease cholera and its annual global burden is estimated to be several million cases [16]. V. cholerae produces and detects two QS autoinducer molecules called CAI-1 and AI-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>CAI-1 ((S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one) is produced by the CqsA synthase [17], [18] and AI-2 ((2S, 4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran borate) is produced by the LuxS synthase [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Detection of CAI-1 and AI-2 occurs through transmembrane receptors CqsS and LuxPQ, respectively [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>CqsS and LuxPQ are two-component proteins that possess both kinase and phosphatase activities (Figure 1 shows the CqsA/CqsS system). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>At low cell density (LCD), when the receptors are devoid of their respective ligands, their kinase activities predominate, resulting in the phosphorylation of the response regulator LuxO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>LuxO∼P is the transcriptional activator of four genes encoding small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), Qrr1-4 [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The Qrr sRNAs target the mRNAs encoding the quorum-sensing master transcriptional regulators AphA and HapR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>At LCD, facilitated by the RNA chaperone Hfq, Qrr1-4 stabilize and destabilize the aphA and hapR mRNA transcripts, respectively [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AphA protein is made while HapR protein is not (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>When autoinducer concentration increases above the threshold required for detection (which occurs at high cell density (HCD)), binding of the autoinducers to their cognate receptors switches the receptors from kinases to phosphatases (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Phosphate flow through the signal transduction pathway is reversed, resulting in dephosphorylation and inactivation of LuxO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Therefore, at HCD, qrr1-4 are not transcribed, resulting in cessation of translation of aphA and derepression of translation of hapR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>This QS circuitry ensures maximal AphA production at LCD and maximal HapR production at HCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>AphA and HapR each control the transcription of hundreds of downstream target genes [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Hence, reciprocal gradients of AphA and HapR establish the QS LCD and HCD gene expression programs, respectively (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>However, in V. cholerae, which causes an acute disease, HapR production at HCD represses genes important for biofilm formation and virulence factor production [22], [26]–[30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This peculiar pattern of virulence gene regulation can be understood in terms of the disease caused by V. cholerae [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Following successful V. cholerae infection, the ensuing diarrhea washes huge numbers of bacteria from the human intestine into the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Thus, expression of genes for virulence and biofilm formation at LCD promotes infection, while repression of these genes by autoinducers at HCD promotes dissemination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Thus, molecules that activate QS have the potential to repress virulence in V. cholerae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Moreover, QS plays an essential role in virulence in other pathogenic vibrios including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus [32]–[35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The components of the QS circuits in these species are similar to those of V. cholerae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Therefore, QS-activating molecules identified for V. cholerae could be broadly useful for controlling diseases caused by other vibrios. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the identification of a set of small molecules that activate the QS system of V. cholerae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We classify the QS-activating molecules as either QS receptor agonists or LuxO inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Because we have already reported analyses of QS receptor agonists, we focus here on the LuxO inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>At LCD, LuxO∼P activates production of the Qrr sRNAs, which repress HapR; inhibitors of LuxO thus activate QS due to derepression of HapR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>LuxO belongs to the NtrC protein family, σ54-binding transcriptional activators that rely on ATP hydrolysis to promote open complex formation [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The LuxO inhibitors identified here function uncompetitively to perturb LuxO ATPase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of LuxO mutants that are insensitive to the inhibitors suggests that the inhibitors interact with a region adjacent to the ATP binding pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Finally, using a set of phenotypic assays, we show that the inhibitors broadly activate different vibrio QS circuits and, in turn, repress virulence factor production and reduce cytotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Because LuxO is conserved among vibrio QS circuits, the molecules we characterize here are capable of inhibiting HSL-based and non-HSL-based vibrio QS systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Numerous NtrC-type proteins homologous to LuxO act in two-component signaling systems and their roles in controlling nitrogen metabolism, virulence, motility, and other important processes have been extensively studied (Reviewed in [37]). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We are interested in identifying small molecules that activate QS in V. cholerae, in order to induce the HCD state and thus repress virulence factor production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>To do this, we developed a whole-cell high-throughput screen that relies on QS-dependent induction of bioluminescence (lux) in V. cholerae [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>We exploited V. cholerae mutants genetically locked into the LCD state and carrying the lux operon from V. harveyi to screen for molecules that induce light production, indicating that they activate QS responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We performed the screen on two different LCD mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The first mutant lacks the two autoinducer synthases, CqsA and LuxS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both CqsS and LuxPQ QS receptors function as kinases and constitutively phosphorylate LuxO, resulting in transcription of the Qrr regulatory RNAs, and repression of translation of HapR (see INTRODUCTION). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>In the absence of HapR, there is no transcription of the heterologous lux operon, and thus, this strain is dark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The second strain carries the luxO D47E allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>This luxO mutation mimics LuxO∼P, rendering LuxO constitutively active [23], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Therefore, HapR is repressed and the strain is dark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>We anticipated identifying two classes of molecules that could induce light production: Class 1) Molecules that induce bioluminescence in the double synthase mutant but not in the luxO D47E mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>These compounds are predicted to be QS receptor agonists; and Class 2) Molecules that induce bioluminescence in both the double synthase mutant and the luxO D47E mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Class 2 compounds likely target QS components that lie downstream of the receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>We screened 90,000 molecules and identified eight Class 1 compounds and three Class 2 compounds (Figures 2A and 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The EC50 of Class 1 compounds are comparable to that of CAI-1 and generally lower than those of Class 2 compounds (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>These differences support the idea that the two classes of molecules potentiate QS responses by distinct mechanisms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, all three known response regulator activities; phosphorylation, DNA binding, and ATPase, are potential targets for inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Analyses of LuxO inhibitor-resistant mutants suggest that our inhibitors bind to a region close to the predicted Walker B motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Additional support for this idea comes from studies of other NtrC-type proteins, which show that mutations that affect ATP hydrolysis but do not interfere with ATP binding also map to the Walker B motif and to amino acid residues preceding the conserved GAFTGA domain [43], [53], [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Indeed, one of the LuxO inhibitor-resistant mutations identified here (L242F) lies immediately upstream of the predicted Walker B motif, while both the I211F and L215F mutations map to the helix containing the GAFTGA domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In addition, the residue identified in the final inhibitor-resistant mutant, V294L, is predicted to sit facing the putative catalytic arginine (R306). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The GAFTGA domain is important for interaction with the σ54-RNAP holoenzyme [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Thus, it was possible that the mutations we isolated in this region (I211F and L215F) suppress inhibition by compounds 11 and 12 by stabilizing the LuxO-σ54-RNAP interaction without affecting inhibitor binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>If this were the case, the ATPase activity of the purified LuxO D47E/I211F and D47E/L215F variants would be inhibited by these compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However, we purified LuxO D47E/I211F protein and found that the ATPase activity is not inhibited (Figure S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with the idea that these mutations abolish inhibitor binding and, in so doing, prevent ATP hydrolysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>High sequence conservation in the ATPase domain exists between different NtrC-type response regulator family members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Thus, we were interested to test whether the LuxO inhibitors could inhibit other NtrC-type response regulators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Compounds 11 and 12 only modestly inhibit (∼10%) the ATPase activity of purified E. coli NtrC at 250 µM (a concentration at which &gt;80% of the LuxO ATPase activity is inhibited, Figure S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This finding is surprising because the key residues (I211, L215, L242, and V294) that, when mutated, confer resistance to the inhibitors in LuxO are all present in E. coli NtrC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Thus, NtrC must possess additional structural features that render it resistant to inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Structural comparisons between these two related RRs, coupled with identification of inhibitor-sensitive NtrC mutants, should allow us to understand the basis of the differences in inhibitor sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Two-component signaling (TCS) proteins are widely distributed in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In addition to their global importance in microbial physiology, the absence of TCSs in mammalian cells makes them attractive drug targets in pathogenic bacteria [56], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Even though significant effort has been devoted to identifying novel TCS inhibitors, to date, none has been developed into a new class of anti-infective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Problems such as undesirable properties associated with lead molecules have been encountered [56], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In particular, inhibitors that generally target the conserved hydrophobic kinase domains of TCS histidine kinases suffer from drawbacks such as low cell permeability, poor selectivity, and unfavorable non-specific off-target effects (e.g. membrane damaging) [58]–[60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>By contrast, approaches to target the sensory domains of histidine kinases have yielded a handful of promising TCS inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>For instance, LED209, an antagonist of the QseC histidine kinase, which regulates motility and pathogenicity in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, reduces virulence in several pathogens both in vitro and in vivo [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>In addition, in Staphylococcus aureus, inhibitory Agr peptide analogs antagonize the AgrC histidine kinase receptors and block abscess formation in an experimental murine model [62]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Targeting response regulators as a broad-spectrum anti-infective strategy has been considered challenging because response regulator functions, such as phosphorylation and DNA binding, are thought to be specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, a handful of molecules that inhibit particular response regulator functions have been reported [50]–[52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>For example, as mentioned, Walrycins, molecules that inhibit the phosphorylation of the essential WalR response regulator, are active in suppressing growth in multiple Gram-positive bacteria [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In the context of our work, the ATPase domain is highly conserved between all members of the NtrC response regulator family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Therefore, molecules that specifically target the ATPase domain of a single response regulator in this family (e.g., LuxO) could potentially be developed into general inhibitors of NtrC-family of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Because NtrC-type proteins control virulence, nitrogen metabolism, motility, and other vital processes in bacteria [37], targeting the ATPase domain offers an additional route for anti-TCS drug development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>The LuxO inhibitors identified here possess certain favorable drug-like characteristics: potent inhibition, water-solubility, good stability, and cell-permeability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>The molecules also display low host-cell cytotoxicity (undetectable cytotoxicity at 500 µM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>These broadly-active LuxO inhibitors are not broad-spectrum NtrC-type inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Microarray analyses reveal that fewer than 40% of genes affected by the inhibitors are non-LuxO targets (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, our LuxO inhibitors could be used as preliminary scaffolds for building a general NtrC-type RRs inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Future improvements to these molecules will be focused on the structure-activity relationships of the thio-azauracil core, combined with simultaneously screening for molecules that inhibit LuxO and other NtrC type response regulators. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Although NtrC is not affected by the inhibitors discovered here, multiple LuxO response regulators from different Vibrio species are targeted by our inhibitors. Vibrio species detect a wide array of autoinducers (HSLs, CAI-1, and AI-2), thus, molecules that interrupt QS in Vibrio species by targeting the cognate receptors/synthases are likely to be autoinducer-specific and will have a limited spectrum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>By contrast, because LuxO is nearly identical in all Vibrio species, our inhibitors can broadly activate vibrio QS irrespective of what type of autoinducer is detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>More importantly, we showed here that treatment of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus with the LuxO inhibitors reduces virulence factor production and impedes cytotoxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Thus, our LuxO inhibitors, upon refinement, can at a minimum be used broadly to control virulence factor production in a variety of Vibrio species that use QS to repress pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>The central ATPase module of the NtrC-type RR is classified as AAA+ type [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>This module is present in multiple domains of life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>For example, AAA+ ATPases are important in functions including protein unfolding and degradation (ClpXP, FtsH, and p97), organelle function and maintenance (PEX1 and VPS4), replication and recombination (RuvBL1 and helicases), and intracellular transport (Dyneins). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Some eukaryotic AAA+ ATPases have been proposed to be drug targets [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it will be particularly fascinating to investigate whether the thio-azauracil core discovered here can be developed into an inhibitor of AAA+ ATPases across different domains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Antagonizing QS in bacteria represents a promising new approach that is an alternative to traditional antibiotics [8], [12], [14], [15], [61], [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Likewise, using pro-QS agents to treat acute infections, in which bacteria use QS to repress virulence, should be further explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Using the native CAI-1 ligand, we previously showed that V. cholerae virulence factor production is repressed in vitro [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In the same vein, we show here that our synthetic pro-QS molecules reduce virulence by inhibiting LuxO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>March et al reported that pretreatment with commensal E. coli over-producing the V. cholerae autoinducer CAI-1 increases the survival rate of mice following V. cholerae infection [66], which further supports the idea of QS potentiators as drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Use of CAI-1, LuxO inhibitors, or other QS-activating molecules as prophylactics could conceivably prevent V. cholerae or other pathogenic vibrios from initiating the LCD virulence gene expression program that is required for colonization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, inhibiting the launch of virulence factors would provide sufficient time for the host immune system to eliminate the pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In contrast to traditional antibiotics that target essential bacterial processes, growth is not affected by interfering with QS, so development of resistance could potentially be minimized [8], [14]. </plain></SENT>
