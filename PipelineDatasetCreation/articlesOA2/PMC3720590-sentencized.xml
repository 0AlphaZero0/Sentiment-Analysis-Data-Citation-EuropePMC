</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Usually regarded as the smallest known self-replicating organisms, mycoplasmas are widely distributed among a huge range of hosts, and many are infectious agents of animals and humans. Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) was first isolated in the United States in 1961 [1] and can lead to persistent respiratory disorders, arthritis, and tenosynovitis in feedlot cattle, as well as mastitis, otitis media, and keratoconjunctivitis in younger calves [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although many efforts have been taken to explore its pathogenesis, little progress has been made because this organism’s lack of a cell-wall renders traditional genetic tools used in classical bacterial agents ineffective in Mollicutes [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Many researchers have shown that the surface lipoproteins of mycoplasma play an important role in infection and organ lesion [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Lipoproteins have been shown to function in apoptosis [6], ABC transporter operation [7], strain virulence diversity [8], [9], and cytoadhesion [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The family of variable surface lipoproteins (Vsps) in M. bovis PG45 and HB0801 has attracted the most research interest in recent studies, and some members in this family, such as VspA, VspB, VspE, and VspF, were successfully proved to possess adhesion ability [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, a previous study demonstrated that vsp gene cluster was deleted in the M. bovis strain Hubei-1 [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Because adhesion to the host cell is a prerequisite for the colonization and infection of the host, the identification of adhesion proteins in pathogens is important for understanding the mechanisms of its pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Several surface proteins and lipoproteins in mycoplasmas have been identified and implicated to play roles in cell adherence: the P1 and P30 proteins of Mycoplasma pneumonia [13], [14], the Maa1 and Maa2 proteins of Mycoplasma arthritidis [15], the GapA and CrmA proteins of Mycoplasma gallisepticum [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In M. bovis, several putative adherence proteins were identified, such as P26 [17], α-enolase [18], and members of the Vsps family [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Previous reports that investigated the whole genome of M. bovis [19], [20] allowed for the identification of adhesion proteins in this organism. M. bovis infection is increasingly pervasive in China, and the strain M. bovis Hubei-1 was first isolated in the Hubei province of China [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>A previous report demonstrated that this strain was able to adhere to embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells, even despite the absence of the vsp gene cluster in its genome; this implies that other adhesion proteins exist in the Hubei-1 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Our lab has reported that a surface-located α-enolase is an adhesion-related protein in M. bovis Hubei-1 [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyzed the entire M. bovis Hubei-1 genome [20], and we identified the gene vpmaX (GenBank: AEI90145.1) that encodes a protein named “variable surface lipoprotein A” (VpmaX) according to GenBank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, it is absolutely different from the VspA protein in PG45 (GenBank: ADR25410.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Our report aims to characterize Hubei-1 vpmaX and the adhesion ability of its encoded protein. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>There are two distinct repetitive units that begin at the N-terminal and extend 100 aa towards the C-terminal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The longer reiterated sequence, KPSEQGSGTNSQQGSG,is directly repeated 3 times, and the shorter repetitive unit, QGSG, is repeated 7 times. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Blasting these two reiterated units against mycoplasma genomes reveals that the two repetitive sequences repeat only in VpmaX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the vsp genes in M. bovis HB0801 and PG45 reveals that the 71-bp region upstream of the ATG initiation codon contains a putative ribosome binding site and exhibits 99% homology among all vsp genes [12], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>The region upstream of vpmaX shows only 48.7% identity to the same region in the vsp genes in PG45 and HB0801. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The Vsp N-terminal region containing 31 aa is also a highly conserved domain that displays 99% amino acid identity among the Vsps in M. bovis HB0801 and PG45 [12], [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>However, there was only a 40.6% identity in this area between VpmaX and Vsps in HB0801 and PG45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Another structural characteristic was the high serine (12.2%) and lysine (11.8%) content of VpmaX; in PG45 VspA, VspB, and VspE, the abundant amino acid was proline [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Although VpmaX possesses a different N-terminal sequence than Vsps from PG45, its N-terminal region is consistent with the typical structure of a prokaryotic prolipoprotein signal peptide [23], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>It begins with two leucine and isoleucine residues (three leucines in Vsps of PG45) followed by a core of 20 hydrophobic aa and terminates with the tetrapeptide Ala-Ala-Ser-Cys. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>M. bovis is the causative agent of chronic pneumonia in feedlot cattle and dairy calves [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Due to the frustrating result of antibiotic therapy in its treatment, this organism causes substantial economic losses for the cattle industry worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>It has been fifty-two years since the identification of this microbe [1], but its pathogenesis is still unclear, mainly because the research techniques available for this organism are limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Because adhesion to susceptible host cells is a prerequisite for colonization and infection for many bacteria, current research is focused on the adhesion component of mycoplasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Vsps in the M. bovis strain PG45 was confirmed to be involved in M. bovis cytoadhesion to host cells [11], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as immunodominant lipoproteins in M. bovis, Vsps underwent high-frequency phase and size variations during natural infection [26] and have therefore attracted the most interest in M. bovis research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The Vsps gene family has been reported to be a characteristic region in M. bovis [23] and was reported to be completely deleted in the M. bovis strain Hubei-1 [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>However, our study identified a surface protein in M. bovis Hubei-1, the VpmaX, that contains some traits similar to those of the Vsp proteins in PG45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>First, it has seven short repetitive units of four aa and three long repetitive sequences comprising sixteen aa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Research in M. pulmonis revealed that a long Vsa protein with many tandem repeats (35 or 40 repeats) contributed less to adhesion than a short Vsa containing fewer repeats (3, 4, or 5 repeats) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesized that VpmaX would have a substantial ability to adhere host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This was affirmed by the CLSM and sandwich ELISA assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Second, although VpmaX possesses no conserved sequence in the N-terminal protein region and upstream DNA sequence like the Vsps family in PG45, it does have a typical lipoprotein signal sequence, which likely anchor it to the M. bovis membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The VpmaX localization assay confirmed our speculation that VpmaX existed in the membrane fragment of M. bovis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Finally, M. bovis VpmaX expressed in E. coli displayed an abnormal migration in SDS-PAGE gel: the rVpmaX molecular weights calculated from the deduced sequence is 28 kDa, but its molecular mass according to the position of the band after SDS-PAGE is approximately 35 kDa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>A similar phenomenon was also observed in PG45 VspB [23], a protein of 268 aa with a predicted mass of 25 kDa that has an electrophoretic migration that suggests the product expressed in E. coli and in mycoplasma has a mass of 46 kDa. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A comparison between VpmaX and its counterpart in HB0801, VspX, shows that the sequences of the two proteins are identical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>However, there is some variation between VpmaX and its corresponding protein in PG45, PL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>This is also consistent with a previous study that high frequency of variation occurred within the products of the various vsp genes due to spontaneous insertions or deletions of repetitive units in M. bovis [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Because M. bovis Hubei-1 and HB0801 were both isolated in Hubei province, it is reasonable that the two strains contain identical protein sequences in VpmaX. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Many surface proteins in mycoplasma function as adhesions to host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Our study verified that recombinant VpmaX and natural VpmaX can strongly adhere to EBL cells using CLSM and sandwich ELISA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Previous research demonstrated that M. bovis Vsp antigens were constantly present in the cytoplasm of macrophages and were also present on the surfaces of epithelial cells in larger airways when cattle were experimentally infected with M. bovis strain 1067 [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>We observed a similar distribution of rVpmaX in EBL cells. Figure 2C and Figure 3 indicate that rVpmaX adhesion is pervasive on the EBL membrane and in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>The widespread existence of proteins in EBL cells that VpmaX can adhere to implies that M. bovis VpmaX may relate to some critical and common mechanism when M. bovis evading host body. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>The variability of mycoplasma surface antigens under immune pressure has been reported for several mycoplasma species [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>For example, the expression of the protein pMGA in Mycoplasma gallisepticum ceased when grown in broth containing an antibody against pMGA, and the organism instead expressed an antigenically unrelated new polypeptide (p82) [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>We also have done some preliminary works to examine the antigenic variation of VpmaX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>However, our immune pressure test [28] showed that M. bovis grown in broth containing anti-rVpmaX serum still expressed VpmaX, but after the fifth passage under immune pressure, the organism expressed a new protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa that reacted with the rabbit anti-rVpmaX serum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The isolation and identification of this newly observed 55 kDa protein using mass spectroscopy is still in progress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>However, the persistent expression of VpmaX under immune pressure may indicate that this protein may plays an important role in the survival of M. bovis strain Hubei-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This speculation can also be supported by the prevalence of VpmaX interacting proteins in EBL cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="s4a"><title><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized various aspects of the M. bovis Hubei-1 protein VpmaX, including the existence of repetitive units, its localization in the membrane, unusual migration in SDS-PAGE; these features are shared with Vsps in PG45 and HB0801. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, VpmaX has been confirmed to be an adhesion-related protein that is able to strongly adhere to EBL cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The pervasive VpmaX adhesion in EBL cells suggests that this protein may play a role in some important process during M. bovis infection, which is worth further exploration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Understanding the interplay between adhesion proteins and host cells will allow for a better understanding of M. bovis infection and may facilitate its prevention. </plain></SENT>
