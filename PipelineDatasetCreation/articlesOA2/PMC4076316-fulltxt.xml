In the present study, the fine structure of TKGs was studied to shed light on this unusual symbiosis with stereomicroscopy and thin sections. The results reveal that TKGs consist of numerous small grain units, which are characterized by a hollow globular structure with a diameter between 2.0 and 9.0 mm and a wall thickness of approximately 200 &#x000b5;m. A polyhedron-like net structure, formed mainly by the bacteria, was observed in the wall of the grain units, which has not been reported previously to our knowledge. Towards the inside of the grain unit, the polyhedron-like net structures became gradually larger in diameter and fewer in number. Such fine structures may play a crucial role in the stability of the grains. Subsequently, the distribution, diversity, and shift of yeasts in TKGs were investigated based on thin section, scanning electron microscopy, cloning and sequencing of D1/D2 of the 26S rRNA gene, real-time quantitative PCR, and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with specific fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes. These show that (i) yeasts appear to localize on the outer surface of the grains and grow normally together to form colonies embedded in the bacterial community; (ii) the diversity of yeasts is relatively low on genus level with three dominant species &#x02013; <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces marxianus</italic>, and <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>; (iii) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the stable predominant yeast species, while the composition of <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> and <italic>Yarrowia</italic> are subject to change over time. Our results indicate that TKGs are relatively stable in structure, and culture conditions to some extent shape the microbial community and interaction in kefir grains. These findings pave the way for further study of the specific symbiotic associations between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> bacteria in TKGs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41376135), the Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar, 20101222) from Shanghai Municipal Education Commission and Shanghai Talent Development Fund (2011010) from Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, China.

Tibetan kefir (TK) is a fermented milk made using TKGs.

Thus far, however, little has been known about the fine structure of the grains, knowledge which is crucial to shed light on the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and yeasts. Our studies confirm that the cauliflower-like shaped TKGs are grown into from a single hollow globular structure unit of TKG and comprise numerous such units as well. Given the fact that TKGs are produced in milk, it is conceivable to speculate that the hollow globular structures contribute to the uptake of nutrients by their designers and residents of bacteria and yeasts as well as to the structural stability of the grains. Coincidently, this idea is further supported by the observation of the polyhedron-like net structures in TKGs, which are formed densely on the outer surface and decrease in density towards the inner surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101387-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus far, similar structures have not been observed in other KGs. It has been confirmed that the formation of the polyhedron structure is attributed to the high stability of the S-Au-S structural unit <xref rid="pone.0101387-Pei1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, the majority of viruses found so far possess icosahedral structure of their capsid shell, which is believed to contribute to its stability <xref rid="pone.0101387-Rossmann1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, the polyhedron-like net structure in TKGs may also play a crucial role in the stability of the grains. Interestingly, this structure seems to result from a long time coevolution of the bacterial and yeast symbionts, since the attempts have failed to reproduce the grains by coculture of the pure culture bacteria and yeast strains isolated from kefir grains <xref rid="pone.0101387-Libudzisz1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Marshall1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although the bacteria appear to be the major players responsible for the net structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101387-g002">Figure 2</xref>), the net structure is completely disrupted when the yeasts are removed from the grains (Wang et al., unpublished data). Whether the yeasts are directly involved in forming the polyhedron-like net structure or the structure breaking is due to the death of bacteria resulting from the elimination of their symbiotic partners of yeasts, remains open for further study.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Diversity of yeasts</title><p>Thus far, the bacterial diversity in TKGs has been studied by using culture-dependent and independent methods, e.g., metagenomics and pyrosequencing <xref rid="pone.0101387-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Gao2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Members of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> turn out to be the most common bacterial species in TKGs, which also holds true to our grains (data not shown) and most other kefir grains <xref rid="pone.0101387-Kowalczyk1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Leite1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In contrast, as for yeasts in TKGs, their diversity is far from complete <xref rid="pone.0101387-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. We observed that the cauliflower-like structure of TKGs is friable, and that the bacterial density decease greatly when the yeasts are removed from the grains (Wang et al., unpublished data). This suggests that the bacteria and yeasts share an unknown close symbiotic relationship, and both of them contribute to the formation of the grains. Accordingly, the culture-independent method of cloning and sequencing was initially used to reveal the diversity of the yeast community as well as the predominant yeast species.</p><p>Analysis of the 26S rRNA gene clone library showed three genera of yeasts in TKGs &#x02013; <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, and <italic>Yarrowia</italic>. <italic>Yarrowia</italic> has not been identified in other TKGs and kefir grains (KGs) and may come initially from the house environment where the TKGs used in this study once grew. FISH confirmed that these three yeast lineages originated from the TKGs and not from the environment. Additionally, it also indicates that <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> are the dominant yeasts in TKGs. These two kinds of yeasts are also present in TKGs sourced from geographically distinct regions of China <xref rid="pone.0101387-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and are common yeast species in most other KGs worldwide. Interestingly, although <italic>Kazachstania</italic> is commonly detected in TKGs as well as other KG lineages, it is absent in our samples. On the whole, yeasts were characterized by a high diversity over the whole family of KGs but a relatively low diversity in a single KG <xref rid="pone.0101387-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-ChinWen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0101387-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In addition, like <italic>Yarrowia</italic>, some species are solely associated with one or two lineages of KGs <xref rid="pone.0101387-Gao1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0101387-Marsh1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Taken together, these suggest that certain yeast species in KGs may be subject to change due to the competition of other yeast species present in the grains or to the natural selection by the culture milk with different nutrient ingredients. Since the culture milk used in our study is different from others, it possibly better meets the growth needs of <italic>Yarrowia</italic> than those of <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Shift of yeasts</title><p>It has been shown that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is an adapted yeast species to grow in a low pH, low dissolved oxygen, and alcohol-rich environment <xref rid="pone.0101387-Uetz1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, an environment with which the TKs are typically characterized. Recently, Mendes et al. have reported the direct interaction between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</italic> based on transcriptome assay, which indicates that these two partners cooperate well with each other in order to take advantage of carbon and nitrogen resources, and have evolved metabolism strategies to cope with the challenging conditions of low pH and ethanol <xref rid="pone.0101387-Mendes1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In the present study, both the real-time quantitative PCR and clone library assays revealed that the number of total yeasts and <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeast remained relatively stable, but <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> and <italic>Yarrowia</italic> yeasts shifted greatly over the 10 months of subculture of TKGs. This finding suggests that (i) <italic>Kluveromyces</italic> and <italic>Yarrowia</italic> are less resilient to the laboratory culture condition than <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>; (ii) <italic>Yarrowia</italic> is more adapted to the laboratory culture condition than <italic>Kluveromyces</italic>; (iii) <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> may be a more generalist species than <italic>Kluveromyces</italic> sp. and <italic>Yarrowia</italic> sp. as well as play a leading role among other yeast species in the symbiotic associations with the bacteria in the TKGs.</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> yeasts decreased heavily but <italic>Yarrowia</italic> yeasts revealed a remarkable increase from nearly zero to being the dominant population. As for <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>, whose carbon substrate spectrum is much broader than that of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0101387-Breunig1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, they are able to metabolize lactose in milk. Accordingly, <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> yeasts are the major competitor to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> bacteria as well as to other yeast species, such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>, which are unable to utilize lactose directly. However, why did it drop down significantly 10 months later? We speculate that the culture milk was the key cause. The TKGs examined in our study had been grown in skimmed milk by a private householder for years. In our study, given that KGs originated in natural fresh milks, e.g., cow, sheep, goat milk, which contains &#x0003e;3.5% fat, the whole milk instead of skimmed milk was used in the laboratory to cultivate TKGs. Consequently, although it is unable to utilize lactose, <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> in the grains is able to grow by utilizing fat. Since <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is able to grow with or without oxygen, but <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> and <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> depend on oxygen for growth, <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> may compete with <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> but not <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> in the grains. In addition, the fatty acids produced by <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> may inhibit the growth of <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0101387-Viegas1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Taken together, these suggested that <italic>Kluyveromyces</italic> decreased over time due to the competition of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, the dominant bacteria in TKGs (data not shown), and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>. It also explained why <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> was solely observed in this study but not in others using the skimmed milk instead of whole milk for the KG culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>NCTKGs and ACTKGs</title><p>In comparison with the NCTKGs, the ACTKGs tended to grow faster, and the grains were tighter together (data not shown), which may result from the lack of microbial competition from the environment. In addition, under SEM, more yeast cells were observed localized on the inner surface of the ACTKGs than the NCTKGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0101387-g004">Figure 4</xref>). They seemed to not be <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> since they need oxygen for growth <xref rid="pone.0101387-Nicaud1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. More work needs to be done in order to give insights into this difference. However, no obvious differences were observed between the NCTKGs and ACTKGs with respect to the fine structure of grains, as well as diversity, distribution, and shift of yeast species, which demonstrated that the TKGs are relatively stable and able to compete for growth with alien microorganisms when cultivated continuously in similar milk and under similar conditions. Accordingly, culture conditions, to some extent, shape the microbial community and interaction in KGs.</p><p>In conclusion, TKGs, comprising numerous small hollow globular grain units with polyhedron-like net structures, represent one of the unusual microbial symbiotic systems in nature, which possibly resulted from a long-term symbiotic interaction among the microbial community colonizing the grains. The diversity and distribution of yeast species mainly depend on the culture milk and conditions. The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> bacteria appear to be the stable dominant microbes in the studied TKGs. These findings pave the way for further study of the specific symbiotic associations in TKGs and furthermore give insight into how the grain structure is formed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0101387.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>FISH analysis of bacteria in TKGs.
