</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Template instruction is a general feature of most members of the human X family of polymerases, with the exception of Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TdT is the only known deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase that is strictly DNA template independent, as it is able to add nucleotides to a DNA primer molecule only in the absence of a template chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This feature is crucial for its function in V(D)J recombination, where TdT generates variability as it creates new information (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Polμ shows hybrid biochemical properties: it has an intrinsic terminal transferase activity, but it is strongly activated by a template DNA chain to insert both deoxy- and ribonucleotides (4–7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The structural and functional basis of the template independence of TdT was understood with the resolution of the crystal structure of the Polß-like core of TdT (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A loop region between β-strands 3 and 4, referred to as Loop1, has a similar position in all three TdT structures and is located in a region of the DNA binding cleft that would normally be occupied by the template strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this loop could occlude binding of any DNA substrate possessing a template strand, explaining TdT inactivity on these substrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>On that basis, and by extrapolation of the structural model of TdT to Polμ, it was predicted that Loop1, specifically present in these two enzymes, could be directly responsible for their template-independent terminal transferase activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In Polμ, however, Loop1 must be flexible enough to allow template-directed polymerization, being fully dispensable for gap filling (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this prediction, when the crystal structure of Polμ bound to a gaped DNA was solved (10), the DNA duplex was bound in the usual fashion within the DNA binding cleft, whereas Loop1 was disordered suggesting conformational flexibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It was then clear that Polμ Loop1 cannot occupy the same position as that of TdT when a template strand is present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the ends of the ß-strands flanking the loop shows that TdT's Loop1 extrudes towards the DNA binding cleft, whilst that of Polμ appears to turn away from the cleft. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Although no crystal structure is available of Polμ with a single-stranded or 3′-protruding DNA substrate, it is likely that Loop1 would then be found in the same conformation as in TdT, i.e. interacting with the primer strand, somehow mimicking a ‘pseudo’ template strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The structural evidence suggested that Loop1 in Polμ may adopt different conformations depending on the nature of the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Studies including the Loop1 chimeras of Polμ (9) and TdT (11) confirmed this hypothesis: replacement of the TdT Loop1 with that of Polμ is sufficient to allow template-dependent additions, whilst the reciprocal chimera (Polμ with the TdT Loop1) is much less inclined to perform template-dependent additions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The importance of this structural feature is emphasized by its possible role as a regulatory element of the most mutagenic Polμ activities during the S phase of the cell cycle (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The equivalent regions in Polß and Polλ would be less likely to interfere with binding of the template strand because they have a much shorter Loop1: small enough in Polß to be described as a turn, and of intermediate length in Polλ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>When Loop1 in Polμ is shortened to a length similar to that of Polλ, the altered polymerase has higher catalytic efficiency on template-containing substrates, but is incapable of template-independent synthesis (9,13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Consistent with all this, Polλ has strongly reduced ability to catalyze template-independent synthesis, but retains the ability to perform template-instructed additions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Polλ Loop1 may be involved in a function somehow related to that in Polμ: modulation of fidelity by controlling deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP)-induced movements of the template strand and 3′-primer terminus in the transition from an inactive to an active conformation of the enzyme (14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Both Polμ and Polλ have been involved in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Compelling evidence indicates that the NHEJ pathway minimizes loss of genetic material by using any template available (15–18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, highly specialized polymerases perform ‘alignment-based gap fill-in’ by dealing with two DNA ends: one providing the primer (a protruding 3′-OH) and a second DNA molecule (with a recessive 5′-P and a 3′-protruding template strand) providing a template in trans (the present study does not focus on blunt or 5′-protruding ends since these do not require specialized polymerases to be repaired). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies indicate that one Polμ monomer is able to bind both sides of the break at once (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>But the opportunity to act during NHEJ is dictated by the enzyme's template preference, a property that follows a gradient ranging from Polß, which only polymerizes on substrates with a continuous template strand; to Polλ, which is active in NHEJ only when the template strand is stabilized by complementarity with the primer strand; to Polμ, which can direct template-instructed primer extension even when there is no base pairing between the two ends; to TdT, which also acts on unpaired primer termini but does not allow the use of a template strand [reviewed in (20)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that this variable degree of template dependence relies on structural differences amongst the four polymerases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have deciphered some of these structural determinants, in particular a network of interactions for substrate recognition and end-bridging, conferring Polμ the unique handiness of trans-polymerizing without the help of a single base pair connection amongst the two DNA ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This network is formed by the previously uncharacterized thumb mini-loop (NSH motif) and the positively charged helix N. The role of Loop1 during these nucleotide additions has been treated in depth here, including a highly detailed study of how Polμ fixes and/or orients this mobile part of the protein in accordance with the substrate on which it is polymerizing. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Loop1 is a specific subdomain in Polμ, shared with TdT, which is flexible and thus can adopt multiple conformations, and probably acts as a pseudo-template when a proper template DNA strand is not available for instructing polymerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>This subdomain could be resolved in the crystal structure of TdT, but not in that of Polμ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Supplementary Figure S1A shows a superimposition of the conformation adopted by Loop1 of TdT in the murine apoenzyme (PDB ID: 1JMS), modelled on the ternary structure of murine Polμ with gaped DNA and incoming nucleotide (PDB ID: 2IHM, wheat). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In agreement with its location in the core structure, Loop1 has been implicated in the terminal transferase activity of human Polμ (9) and in NHEJ of non-complementary ends assisted by accessory factors (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>To corroborate the importance of Loop1 for the bridging activity inherent to human Polμ we tested a Loop1-deletion mutant [Polμ-Δloop1; (9)] that lacks amino acids 369 to 385. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>It has been previously shown that binding of 5′P-containing gaped substrates by Polμ-Δloop1 is even higher than that displayed by the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that Loop1 is dispensable and even detrimental for binding to template-containing substrates perhaps via steric hindrance (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Wild-type Polμ can form two different complexes when binding a 5′P-containing 3′-protruding substrate (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The first shifted band corresponds to the binding to one DNA molecule (with the protrusion oriented as template), whilst the second band likely represents the synapsis of two DNA molecules (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Mutant Polμ-Δloop1 was able to bind the downstream side of the break (Figure 1A); however, the synapsis could not be stably formed in the absence of Loop1, not even in the presence of metal and incoming nucleotide (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the activity of this mutant was undetectable in NHEJ assays, both with complementary and non-complementary ends, even using substrates that can form two and three base pairs of complementarity (Figure 1B, top panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Having shown that Loop1 is dispensable for binding the 5′P-containing DNA as a downstream end, the defective NHEJ reaction observed can only be explained if Loop1 plays a role in the correct juxtaposition of the incoming end acting as a primer, in line with the EMSA (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay) results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>NHEJ by this mutant was partially recovered when using manganese as activating metal ion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>However, we realized that the substrate preference for the mutant lacking Loop1 changes with respect to the wild-type enzyme: the mutant version achieves better NHEJ mediated by longer connections (Figure 1B, lower panel; as would be expected due to the help of complementary base pairing), whilst wild-type Polμ strikingly prefers the shortest 3′-overhangs over longer ones, even in the presence of manganese (3 and 4 nts; Figure 1B, middle and lower panels). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Loop1 appears to be conferring the unique Polμ property of bridging ends with very short overhangs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>This observation also implies that a minimal distance between the two gaps formed during end joining allows the optimal location, and thus performance, of Loop1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>This proposal is supported by the available crystal structures of TdT and Polμ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Supplementary Figure S1B and C show two different versions of the superimposition described above: in (B), the DNA substrate has been modified to show a 2-nt 3′-protruding substrate bound as a template/primer, a scenario in which Loop1 would help to maintain the orientation of the primer strand to achieve the untemplated addition of an incoming nucleotide, shown in blue; in (C), the original DNA substrate is lacking template bases A6 and T7 in order to mimic two non-complementary NHEJ substrates: the ‘template end’ having a 3′ overhang of 1 nucleotide (purple) and the ‘primer end’ with a 2-nt 3′-protrusion (green). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>As we show here, Loop1 would fit in the space corresponding to -1 and -2 positions of a continuous template strand, and, therefore, it could be conveniently positioned to help preferential bridging of NHEJ substrates with very short overhangs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In Polμ the role of this loop is dual: depending on the substrate used and the desired conformation of Loop1, this mini-loop may interact with the template strand (through Asn457) or with Loop1 (through His459). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the asparagine is only needed during templated additions, and was dispensable for terminal transferase activity of Polμ, whilst the histidine mutation had the opposite effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>We propose a regulatory function for the NSH motif of the thumb mini-loop in Polμ: helping to accommodate either the template strand (as in Polß of Polλ) or Loop1 (as in TdT) as suits best for each individual situation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Regarding the downstream template binding, Polμ has a positively charged helix that holds the phosphate backbone by means of four arginine residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Of this four positive charges, only two are conserved in Polλ or Polß, which contribute to fidelity via their interaction with the template of the nascent base pair (23–26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In Polλ, these residues seem to be involved in controlling the motion of part of the thumb occurring during the transition from the binary (E:DNA) to the ternary (E:DNA:dNTP) complex (®-strand 8), which has the pursued effect of bringing the template strand closer to the thumb into its final catalytic position (22,30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>A proposal that these residues play a similar role in Polμ was initially supported by molecular dynamics simulations (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Our results further confirm this hypothesis, both using substrates with continuous template such as DNA gaps, which are correctly configured on their own, but specifically and more drastically during stabilization of two DNA ends during NHEJ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that these arginines do not contribute too much to general binding to the downstream end, given that the presence of the 5′-P group will provide the binding strength, but most likely these arginines are implicated in the bridging and positioning of the DNA substrates in a proper register to maximize efficiency and fidelity during NHEJ by Polμ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Based on our results with single-stranded substrates we are able to propose a second function for this arginine-containing helix: by establishing indirect interactions with the thumb mini-loop, it could be improving the stabilization of Loop1 in the case of maximal closure, i.e. during terminal transferase addition of nucleotides as well as during NHEJ reactions involving non-complementary ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In this last scenario the involvement of the arginine helix could be dual, mediating protein–protein as well as protein–DNA interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This idea is further supported by new rounds of molecular dynamics in which these residues were individually mutated to alanine (27): these simulations, in the first place, displayed a conformation of the template strand similar to that observed for the binary complex in Polλ, demonstrating in silico the effect of these positive charges in pulling the downstream part of the substrate to its correct position; secondly, the final distance between Loop1 (modelled for the simulations) and the arginine helix is unusually large, and the former is in a conformation that may hamper its interactions with the DNA substrate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Thus, having already discussed the roles of Loop1, the thumb mini-loop and the arginine helix, during untemplated additions and also during catalysis on discontinuous substrates, it seems now clear that these three portions of Polμ work coordinately, and together with another residue, His329, are involved in the terminal transferase and end-joining mechanisms (3,10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In Polμ, Loop1 is considered to be a highly flexible piece that could eventually adopt an indefinite number of conformations, but we argue that this is not so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>At the time this manuscript was being finished for publication, a new set of crystal structures of human Polμ, including the apoenzyme, was obtained (29), This last one, although not showing the full conformation of Loop1 due to its flexibility, indicates that it would be anchored close to the active site, in a manner similar to that of TdT Loop1, where it would preclude binding of a template strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The movements of His329 throughout the catalytic cycle can also be observed in these structures, and they are in agreement with our predictions (3), i.e. His329 points towards the active site only when primer and incoming nucleotide are present, whereas in the apoenzyme and pre- and post-catalytic binary complexes (with gaped and nicked DNA, respectively), this residue is oriented outwards and is not establishing any interactions via the side chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>The apoenzyme structure also fully supports our current findings since Phe385 and even His381 from Loop1 are found to be interacting with the thumb mini-loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>These interactions explain the dual phenotype observed with our NSH motif mutants: Asn457 is very important for NHEJ since it can interact with both His381 in Loop1 and Arg445 in the arginine helix, being the central connector of this network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>His459, on the other hand, is mainly interacting with residues in Loop1 but not in the arginine helix, and thus its mutation would partially affect only one side of the network, primarily needed for untemplated additions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Based on all these data, we propose that Loop1 would maintain a fixed (TdT-like) initial position in a binary complex in which the DNA substrate (either ssDNA or a double-stranded DNA end containing long [+3 nt] 3′-protrusions and no 5′-phosphate group) is extended via untemplated insertions; in this case His381 could even act as a pseudo-template residue to help stabilize the primer terminus (Figure 6, left panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when Polμ binds a substrate containing a continuous template strand (i.e. a gap), Loop1 would become more disordered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>This would probably be due to the new Loop1–NSH motif interaction (Glu386-His459) substituting that in the apoenzyme (Phe385-His459) and to the labile nature of other interactions keeping it in place (Figure 6, middle panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A similar transition occurs even in the case of the smaller Loop1 present in Polλ: as dNTP binding induces the transition from binary to a ternary complex, β-strands β3 and β4 partially unravel to form Loop1, a nine-residue loop that repositions as the DNA template strand assumes its active conformation (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In fact, one of the initial ß-strands is occupying the path that is filled by the template strand in the ternary complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Finally, when Polμ binds two 3′-protruding NHEJ substrates, Loop1 needs to adopt a third conformation of inherent flexibility, to accommodate and stabilize the several possible locations and lengths of the gap formed in the template strand after synapsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Direct protein–protein interactions with the thumb mini-loop, and indirect ones with the arginine helix, would assist Loop1 to be positioned in the correct orientation needed in each case (Supplementary Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In the specific case of non-complementary ends that form 1-nt gaps after synapsis, this network would be of special importance to keep the discontinuous template strand in frame, as shown in Figure 6 (right panel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Binding of the downstream end (through the 5′-P group) would cause the rearrangement of the arginines in helix N, and both Arg449 and Arg445 would be in a perfect position to contact the thumb mini-loop at Asn457. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>These three residues would be in charge of stabilizing the 1-nt gap formed in the template strand, whilst His459 and Ser458 would contact Loop1 to keep it in the right conformation. </plain></SENT>
