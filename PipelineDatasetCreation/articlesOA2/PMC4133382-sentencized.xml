</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>As one of the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, nitrotyrosine is a product of tyrosine nitration mediated by reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite anion and nitrogen dioxide ( Fig. 1 ). Compared with the fluids from healthy people, a remarkably increased level of nitrotyrosine is detected in those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, and coeliac disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, knowledge of nitrotyrosine sites in proteins is very useful for both basic research and drug development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although conventional experimental methods did provide useful insight into the biological roles of tyrosine nitration [1]–[3], it is time-consuming and expensive to determine the nitrotyrosine sites based on the experimental approach alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Particularly, identification of endogenous 3-NTyr modifications remains largely elusive (see, e.g., [4]–[7]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational methods for identifying the nitrotyrosine sites in proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The present study was initiated in an attempt to propose a new method for identifying the nitrotyrosine sites in proteins in hope that it can play a complementary role with the existing methods in this area. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>According to Chou’s scheme, a potential nitrotyrosine peptide, i.e., a peptide with Tyr (namely Y) located at its center ( Fig. 2 ), can be expressed as(1)where the subscript  is an integer,  represents the  upstream amino acid residue from the center,  the  downstream amino acid residue, and so forth. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Feature Vector and Pseudo Amino Acid Composition </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>One of the most important but also most difficult problems in computational biology today is how to effectively formulate a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector, yet still keep considerable sequence order information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This is because all the existing operation engines, such as correlation angle approach [29], covariance discriminant [30], neural network [31], support vector machine (SVM) [32], random forest [33], conditional random field [28], K-nearest neighbor (KNN) [34], OET-KNN [35], Fuzzy K-nearest neighbor [36], ML-KNN algorithm [37], and SLLE algorithm [30], can only handle vector but not sequence samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>However, a vector defined in a discrete model may totally miss the sequence-order information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>To deal with such a dilemma, the approach of pseudo amino acid composition [38] or Chou’s PseAAC [39] was proposed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Ever since it was introduced in 2001 [38], the concept of PseAAC has been rapidly penetrated into almost all the areas of computational proteomics, such as in identifying bacterial virulent proteins [40], predicting anticancer peptides [41], predicting protein subcellular location [42], predicting membrane protein types [43], analyzing genetic sequence [44], predicting GABA(A) receptor proteins [45], identifying antibacterial peptides [46], predicting anticancer peptides [41], identifying allergenic proteins [47], predicting metalloproteinase family [48], identifying GPCRs and their types [49], identifying protein quaternary structural attributes [50], among many others (see a long list of references cited in a 2014 article [51]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Recently, the concept of PseAAC was further extended to represent the feature vectors of DNA and nucleotides [9], as well as other biological samples (see, e.g., [52]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Because it has been widely and increasingly used, recently three types of powerful open access soft-ware, called ‘PseAAC-Builder’ [53], ‘propy’ [54], and ‘PseAAC-General’ [51], were established: the former two are for generating various modes of Chou’s special PseAAC; while the 3rd one for those of Chou’s general PseAAC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>According to a comprehensive review [8], PseAAC can be generally formulated as(6)where  is the transpose operator, while  an integer to reflect the vector’s dimension. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The value of  as well as the components  in Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>6 will depend on how to extract the desired information from a protein/peptide sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Below, let us describe how to extract the useful information from the benchmark datasets to define the peptide samples via Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>For convenience in formulation, let rewrite Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>1 as follows(7)where , the residue at the center of the peptide, is tyrosine (Y), and all the other residues  can be any of the 20 native amino acids or the dummy code X as defined above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Hereafter, let us use the numerical codes 1, 2, 3, …, 20 to represent the 20 native amino acids according to the alphabetic order of their single letter codes, and use 21 to represent the dummy amino acid X. Accordingly, the number of possible different dipeptides will be , and the number of dipeptide subsite positions on the sequence of Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>7 will be . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Now, let us introduce a positive and a negative PSDP (position-specific dipeptide propensity) matrix, as given below(8a) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Metrics for Scoring Prediction Quality </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In literature the following four metrics are often used to score the quality of a predictor at four different angles(17)where TP represents the number of the true positive; TN, the number of the true negative; FP, the number of the false positive; FN, the number of the false negative; Sn, the sensitivity; Sp, the specificity; Acc, the accuracy; MCC, the Mathew’s correlation coefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>To most biologists, unfortunately, the four metrics as formulated in Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>17 are not quite intuitive and easy-to-understand, particularly the equation for MCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Here let us adopt the formulation proposed recently in [9], [11], [28] based on the symbols introduced by Chou [25], [55] in predicting signal peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>According to the formulation, the same four metrics can be expressed as(18)where  is the total number of the nitrotyrosine peptides investigated while  the number of the nitrotyrosine peptides incorrectly predicted as the non-nitrotyrosine peptides;  the total number of the non-nitrotyrosine peptides investigated while  the number of the non-nitrotyrosine peptides incorrectly predicted as the nitrotyrosine peptides [57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Now, it is crystal clear from Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>18 that when  meaning none of the nitrotyrosine peptides was incorrectly predicted to be a non-nitrotyrosine peptide, we have the sensitivity . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>When  meaning that all the nitrotyrosine peptides were incorrectly predicted as the non-nitrotyrosine peptides, we have the sensitivity . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Likewise, when  meaning none of the non-nitrotyrosine peptides was incorrectly predicted to be the nitrotyrosine peptide, we have the specificity ; whereas  meaning all the non-nitrotyrosine peptides were incorrectly predicted as the nitrotyrosine peptides, we have the specificity . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>When  meaning that none of nitrotyrosine peptides in the positive dataset  and none of the non- nitrotyrosine peptides in the negative dataset  was incorrectly predicted, we have the overall accuracy  and ; when  and  meaning that all the nitrotyrosine peptides in the positive dataset  and all the non- nitrotyrosine peptides in the negative dataset  were incorrectly predicted, we have the overall accuracy  and ; whereas when  and  we have  and  meaning no better than random prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>As we can see from the above discussion based on Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>18, the meanings of sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and Mathew’s correlation coefficient have become much more intuitive and easier-to-understand. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>It is instructive to point out, however, the set of metrics in Eqs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>17–18 is valid only for the single-label systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>For the multi-label systems, such as those for the subcellular localization of multiplex proteins (see, e.g., [58]–[62]) where a protein may have two or more locations, and those for the functional types of antimicrobial peptides (see, e.g., [63] where a peptide may possess two or more functional types, a completely different set of metrics is needed as elaborated in [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Jackknife Cross-Validation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>With a set of clear and valid metrics as defined in Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>18 to measure the quality of a predictor, the next thing we need to consider is how to objectively derive the values of these metrics for a predictor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In statistical prediction, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to calculate the metrics of Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>18 for evaluating the quality of a predictor: independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>However, of the three test methods, the jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary that can always yield an unique result for a given benchmark dataset [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>The reasons are as follows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>(i) For the independent dataset test, although all the samples used to test the predictor are outside the training dataset used to train it so as to exclude the “memory” effect or bias, the way of how to select the independent samples to test the predictor could be quite arbitrary unless the number of independent samples is sufficiently large. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>This kind of arbitrariness might result in completely different conclusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>For instance, a predictor achieving a higher success rate than the other predictor for a given independent testing dataset might fail to keep so when tested by another independent testing dataset [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>(ii) For the subsampling test, the concrete procedure usually used in literatures is the 5-fold, 7-fold or 10-fold cross-validation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The problem with this kind of subsampling test is that the number of possible selections in dividing a benchmark dataset is an astronomical figure even for a very simple dataset, as demonstrated by Eqs.28–30 in [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in any actual subsampling cross-validation tests, only an extremely small fraction of the possible selections are taken into account. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Since different selections will always lead to different results even for a same benchmark dataset and a same predictor, the subsampling test cannot avoid the arbitrariness either. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>A test method unable to yield an unique outcome cannot be deemed as a good one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>(iii) In the jackknife test, all the samples in the benchmark dataset will be singled out one-by-one and tested by the predictor trained by the remaining samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>During the process of jackknifing, both the training dataset and testing dataset are actually open, and each sample will be in turn moved between the two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The jackknife test can exclude the “memory” effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Also, the arbitrariness problem as mentioned above for the independent dataset test and subsampling test can be avoided because the outcome obtained by the jackknife cross-validation is always unique for a given benchmark dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the jackknife test has been increasingly used and widely recognized by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [33], [41], [43], [45]–[47], [66]–[72]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, in this study we also used the jackknife cross-validation method to calculate the metrics in Eq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>18 although it would take more computational time. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>As one of the important posttranslational modifications (PTMs), nitrotyrosine is a product occurring in proteins when their tyrosine (Tyr or Y) residue is nitrated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Since a remarkably increasing level of nitrotyrosine is detected for those patients who have suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, and coeliac disease, knowledge of nitrotyrosine is very useful for developing drugs against these diseases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>A new predictor was developed for identifying the nitrotyrosine sites in proteins based on a set of 19-tuple peptides generated as follows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Sliding a window of 19 amino acids along each of the 546 protein sequences taken from a protein database, collected were only those peptide segments with Y (tyrosine) at the center, i.e., the potential nitrotyrosine-site-containing peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The benchmark dataset thus obtained contains 1,044 experiment-confirmed nitrotyrosine peptides and 7,669 non-nitrotyrosine peptides. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The new predictor is called iNitro-Tyr, in which each of the potential nitrotyrosine-site-containing peptides was formulated with a 18-D vector formed by incorporating the position-specific dipeptide propensity (PSDP) into the general form [8] of pseudo amino acid composition [38], [75] or Chou’s PseAAC [39], [51], [54]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>It has been observed by the rigorous cross validations that the iNitro-Tyr not only yields higher success rates but also is more stable and less noisy as reflected by a set of four metrics generally used to measure the quality of a predictor from different angles. </plain></SENT>
