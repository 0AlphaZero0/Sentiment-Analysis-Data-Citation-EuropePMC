Since reducing levels of disease proteins improves pathology in animals, we investigated how ataxin-3 is degraded. Here we show that, unlike most proteins, ataxin-3 turnover does not require its ubiquitination, but is regulated by Ubiquitin-Binding Site 2 (UbS2) on its N terminus. Mutating UbS2 decreases ataxin-3 protein levels in cultured mammalian cells and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> by increasing its proteasomal turnover. Ataxin-3 interacts with the proteasome-associated proteins Rad23A/B through UbS2. Knockdown of Rad23 in cultured cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in lower levels of ataxin-3 protein. Importantly, reducing Rad23 suppresses ataxin-3-dependent degeneration in flies. We present a mechanism for ubiquitination-independent degradation that is impeded by protein interactions with proteasome-associated factors. We conclude that UbS2 is a potential target through which to enhance ataxin-3 degradation for SCA3 therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Deubiquitinase</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>Neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>Neuroprotection</kwd><kwd>Polyglutamine</kwd><kwd>Proteasome</kwd><kwd>hHR23</kwd><kwd>Spinocerebellar Ataxia</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P3">Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), which is also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the family of polyglutamine (polyQ)-dependent disorders<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The maladies that comprise this group result from abnormal expansions in the polyQ region of different proteins. PolyQ diseases also include Huntington's, Spinobulbar Muscular Atrophy, Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy and five more SCAs<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">SCA3, considered to be the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world, is caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in the <italic>ATXN3</italic> gene that is normally 12&#x02013;42 repeats in length, but is expanded to ~52&#x02013;84 repeats in diseased individuals<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. PolyQ expansion occurs in the protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase (DUB) that is involved in protein quality control. Ataxin-3 protects mammalian cells against various forms of stress<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and serves a protective role against toxic polyQ proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. How pathogenic expansion of the polyQ region of ataxin-3 causes SCA3 is unknown. There is presently no cure for this disease.</p><p id="P5">Reducing the levels of disease proteins improves degeneration in various animal models of proteinopathies, including polyQ diseases<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Consequently, a potential therapeutic strategy for SCA3 entails reducing the levels of the ataxin-3 protein. This concept is supported by recent work that used viral-mediated delivery of RNA-interference (RNAi) constructs to reduce levels of ataxin-3 protein in mouse brain<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and alleviated SCA3-like pathology in one study<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">The mechanism of degradation of the ataxin-3 protein is not clear<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Most cellular proteins are degraded by being post-translationally modified with the small protein ubiquitin, which targets them for proteasomal degradation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Here, we present evidence that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 is not necessary for its proteasomal degradation, and find that the turnover of this polyQ protein is regulated by Ubiquitin-Binding Site 2 (UbS2) on its N terminus. UbS2 mediates the interaction of ataxin-3 with the proteasome-associated proteins Rad23A and Rad23B<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. According to our studies, this interaction prevents the proteasomal turnover of ataxin-3. Our findings describe a precise molecular target through which to enhance the degradation of ataxin-3 protein for SCA3 therapeutics, perhaps by designing molecules that bind UbS2 and prevent its interaction with Rad23A/B.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Ataxin-3 does not require ubiquitination to be degraded</title><p id="P7">Previous reports presented evidence that the turnover of normal and pathogenic ataxin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>) depends on the proteasome<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, and we showed that ataxin-3 protein is ubiquitinated in mammalian cells, in mouse brain and in <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Based on these observations, one would expect ataxin-3 to be degraded by becoming ubiquitinated and thus targeted for the proteasome. Yet, while the role of the proteasome in ataxin-3 degradation is well supported<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>, it is not entirely clear that ataxin-3 needs be ubiquitinated in order to be degraded.</p><p id="P8">To examine this possibility, we used a version of ataxin-3 whose lysine residues are mutated into the similar but non-ubiquitinatable amino acid arginine (K-Null). We do not detect ubiquitinated species with K-Null ataxin-3 in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>) or in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, as well as other supportive data published by us<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>). Mutating all of the fifteen lysine residues of ataxin-3 into arginines does not affect its subcellular localization in mammalian cells, or disrupt its ability to cleave ubiquitin chains in reconstituted systems <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Lysine-less ataxin-3 retains some of its functions: similarly to the wild type version of this DUB, the K-null variant is able to somewhat suppress neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, although this function cannot be enhanced by its own ubiquitination in order to reach the full protective effect of ubiquitinatable ataxin-3<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">We first examined the turnover of K-Null ataxin-3 protein compared to its wild type counterpart in cultured cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> summarizes cycloheximide (CHX)-based pulse-chase studies, where we observe that the turnover of K-Null ataxin-3 is not slower than that of WT ataxin-3. In fact, based on quantification of data from multiple western blots, K-Null ataxin-3 might be degraded slightly more quickly than the normal version of this DUB in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1C</xref>, 360 min time point; 1D, 120 min time point). Both WT and K-Null ataxin-3 proteins are stabilized in cells by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), a finding that is in accordance with previous reports that ataxin-3 turnover in cells is proteasome-dependent<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P10">Subsequently, we used the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to investigate whether K-Null ataxin-3 accumulates <italic>in vivo</italic> in an intact organism. We utilized the Gal4-UAS system<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> to express ataxin-3 constructs throughout the fly<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We generated flies that express WT, K-Null or K-117 (the lysine predominantly ubiquitinated <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cell culture<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>) ataxin-3 by using the ubiquitous Gal4 driver sqh-Gal4<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. We compared fly lines that express the various ataxin-3 transgenes at similar mRNA levels, according to quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2B</xref>, K-Null ataxin-3 protein does not accumulate compared to WT or K-117 ataxin-3. Together, results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> lead us to conclude that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 is not absolutely necessary for its degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>UbS2 regulates ataxin-3 protein levels and turnover in cells</title><p id="P11">Since ubiquitination of ataxin-3 does not appear to be necessary for its turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we wondered whether protein-binding domains of this DUB are involved in its degradation. Several domains on ataxin-3 enable its direct interaction with other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). Starting at the N-terminus, first is UbS1 on the catalytic domain. UbS1 binds ubiquitin and is necessary for the catalytic activity of ataxin-3<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Next is UbS2, which binds ubiquitin as well as Rad23A and Rad23B<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Rad23A/B facilitate substrate protein degradation by reversibly associating with the proteasome<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Previous structural work focusing on the catalytic domain of ataxin-3 indicated that mutating the amino acid tryptophan (W) at position 87 disrupts the ability of UbS2 to interact with the isolated ubiquitin-like domain of Rad23<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Through an <italic>in vitro</italic> pulldown assay that utilized recombinant, full-length ataxin-3 and Rad23A, we confirmed that mutating W87 into an alanine residue diminishes the ability of these two proteins to interact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1A</xref>). We also verified in mammalian cell culture that this mutation reduces the capacity of an otherwise normal, full-length ataxin-3 to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous Rad23A and Rad23B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 1B</xref>). Mutating UbS2 does not abrogate the catalytic activity of ataxin-3<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> or affect its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 2</xref>). In the C-terminal half of ataxin-3 are three ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), which bind ubiquitin chains at least four moieties long<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The C-terminal portion also contains an arginine-rich region that binds the AAA ATPase protein VCP (also known as p97)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. VCP functions at least in part as a proteasomal shuttle protein<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Mutating one or more of the arginine residues of the VCP-binding site of full-length ataxin-3 into histidines or alanines has been demonstrated to disrupt its interaction with VCP in reconstituted systems <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mammalian cells<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P12">Because ataxin-3 binds to proteins that associate with the proteasome, we examined whether UbS2 or the VCP-binding site regulates its stability. For the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A&#x02013;3F</xref>, we utilized ataxin-3 constructs that do not contain lysine residues in order to eliminate any potentially confounding effects from ubiquitination at this stage of our study.</p><p id="P13">Surprisingly, mutating UbS2 (denoted as UbS2*; mutation is W87A unless noted otherwise) markedly reduces ataxin-3 steady-state protein levels in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). Mutating the VCP-binding site (denoted as VCP*) does not consistently alter steady-state protein levels. In most experimental repeats we did not detect a difference in the steady-state levels of K-Null ataxin-3 with the VCP-binding site mutated compared to versions with intact VCP-binding, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>. There were a few instances where the levels of ataxin-3 with mutated VCP-binding were lower, as summarized by the quantification of multiple blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Mutating both UbS2 and the VCP-binding site has an effect similar to that observed when only UbS2 is mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>). The studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref> were conducted in HeLa cells. A similar effect is observed in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementaey figure 3A</xref>).</p><p id="P14">The effect from mutating UbS2 does not result from differences at the mRNA level, as those levels are not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3B</xref>). However, the difference in steady-state levels depends on the proteasome. Inhibiting proteasomal activity with MG132 equalizes the levels of ataxin-3 protein with mutated UbS2 to those of ataxin-3 with intact UbS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 3B</xref>). Two other amino acid residues important for UbS2 are tyrosine (Y) at position 27 and phenylalanine (F) at position 28<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Mutating those amino acids also leads to reduced steady-state levels of ataxin-3 protein in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3D</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Next, we examined the turnover rate of ataxin-3 with intact or mutated UbS2 by using CHX-based pulse-chase assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3E</xref>, ataxin-3 protein with mutated UbS2 is turned over markedly more rapidly than ataxin-3 with intact UbS2. Mutating only the VCP-binding site does not significantly affect turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3F</xref>). CHX-based analyses are consistent with steady-state examinations, indicating that UbS2 inhibits ataxin-3 degradation in cells, while VCP-binding does not appear to have a significant effect. Based on these findings, we focus the rest of the studies in this report on UbS2.</p><p id="P16">As already stated, for experiments in panels 3A&#x02013;F we used K-Null ataxin-3 that contains intact or mutated UbS2. We next investigated whether the protein levels of ataxin-3 with all of its lysines present are also regulated by UbS2. Mutating UbS2 in an otherwise normal ataxin-3 dramatically reduces its steady-state protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3G</xref>) and turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3H</xref>), similar to what we observed with non-ubiquitinatable ataxin-3. Collectively, these results from mammalian cell culture indicate that UbS2 inhibits the proteasomal turnover of non-pathogenic ataxin-3.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>UIMs of ataxin-3 have an opposite effect to UbS2 on turnover</title><p id="P17">For ataxin-3 to be degraded by the proteasome, it needs to come into contact with this cellular machinery. One possibility through which this interaction could occur would be through ataxin-3 ubiquitination. However, our results argue against ubiquitination being necessary for ataxin-3 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Another mechanism that could bridge ataxin-3 to the proteasome could be the poly-ubiquitin binding UIMs of this polyQ protein, which could bind ubiquitinated proteins targeted for the proteasome.</p><p id="P18">We mutated a conserved serine residue in each UIM of non-pathogenic ataxin-3 into an alanine, disrupting its interaction with ubiquitin chains<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4</xref> indicate that the UIMs regulate the turnover of ataxin-3. Mutating all three UIMs counteracts the degradative effect of UbS2 mutation both at the steady-state level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 4</xref>) and turnover rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4B</xref>).

Therefore, we examined whether Rad23A/B affect ataxin-3 protein levels in cultured cells by using RNA-interference (RNAi). Knockdown of endogenous Rad23A or Rad23B through different, non-overlapping siRNA constructs noticeably decreases levels of Rad23A or Rad23B protein. Their reduction is concomitant with a statistically significant reduction in the levels of endogenous ataxin-3 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>). Simultaneous knockdown of Rad23A and Rad23B has an even stronger effect in reducing normal, endogenous ataxin-3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>). Together, these RNAi-based data are indicative of a protective role from Rad23A and Rad23B on ataxin-3.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>UbS2 regulates normal ataxin-3 protein levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p id="P20">Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> make the case that UbS2 of ataxin-3 is important for its stability in cultured cells.

We generated new transgenic fly lines that express non-pathogenic ataxin-3 with mutated UbS2 and selected lines that express WT and UbS2* ataxin-3 transgenes at similar mRNA levels, as well as ones that express the UbS2* variant more strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">figure 5B</xref>, the protein levels of UbS2* ataxin-3 are dramatically lower than those of WT ataxin-3 that is expressed similarly at the mRNA level. Even in transgenic lines where the mRNA levels of UbS2* ataxin-3 are approximately 6 fold higher than WT ataxin-3, those protein levels don&#x02019;t quite approach the levels of normal ataxin-3. These data from an intact organism are consistent with our findings from cultured cells, and collectively support our overall conclusion that UbS2 regulates ataxin-3 protein levels by inhibiting its degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>UbS2 and Rad23 regulate pathogenic ataxin-3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p id="P21">Finally, we examined whether mutating UbS2 on pathogenic ataxin-3 affects its stability (pathogenic variant denoted as SCA3; polyQ length of 81 for the intact version and 84 for UbS2*; these constructs contains all lysine residues). We found that mutating UbS2 of SCA3-causing ataxin-3 reduces its steady-state levels in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6A</xref>). Just as we observed with normal ataxin-3, mutating UbS2 enhances the turnover rate of pathogenic ataxin-3 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6B</xref>). Also, proteasomal inhibition diminishes the marked difference in protein levels between ataxin-3 versions that have an intact or mutated UbS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6C</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the proteasomal turnover of pathogenic ataxin-3 in cells is also regulated by UbS2.</p><p id="P22">Because knockdown of Rad23A/B leads to lower levels of ataxin-3 protein in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">figure 4C</xref>), we reasoned that reducing Rad23 levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic> should suppress degeneration caused by its pathogenic version by lowering the levels of the polyQ protein. Whereas humans have separate genes for Rad23A and Rad23B, flies appear to have one gene for Rad23<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">We utilized a transgenic fly line generated by the Bonini lab that expresses a full-length version of pathogenic ataxin-3 with 84 polyQ repeats and has intact UbS2, VCP-binding site and UIMs<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. First, we examined ataxin-3(SCA3) protein levels in fly eyes when Rad23 levels are reduced by either knocking down this gene through RNAi, or by using a chromosomal deletion in the genomic area that contains Rad23 (line Df(4)ED6369). This deficiency deletes chromosomal segment 102A1--102C1, which includes Rad23 at locus 102B3; these flies are hemizygous viable. As shown in western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6D</xref>, knocking down Rad23 or removing one copy of this gene leads to lower levels of ataxin-3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes. Knocking down other proteins related to ubiquitin (ubiquilin, nedd8 or SUMO, all of which reportedly interact with ataxin-3<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>) does not reduce ataxin-3 protein levels <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary figure 5</xref>), indicating a specific role for Rad23 in regulating ataxin-3.</p><p id="P24">We then examined whether reduction of Rad23 suppresses degeneration caused by pathogenic ataxin-3. When expressed selectively in fly eyes, this ataxin-3 variant does not greatly impact the external eye compared to wild type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6E</xref>, compare columns I and II). However, retinal sections show marked degeneration (disruption and loss of the radial ommatidial array and less defined inter-ommatidial boundaries) and the presence of densely staining structures/aggregates, which contain pathogenic ataxin-3<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6E</xref> column III, knockdown of Rad23 dramatically suppresses degeneration caused by pathogenic ataxin-3 in fly eyes. We recapitulated these findings from the RNAi targeting Rad23 with the deficiency line described above. When we express pathogenic ataxin-3 on a Rad23 hemizygous background, we again observe suppressed SCA3-dependent retinal degeneration (columns IV and V in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6E</xref>). Together, data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">figure 6</xref> indicate that pathogenic ataxin-3 protein is also regulated by UbS2 and Rad23.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S9"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P25">The degradation of most short-lived, abnormal and misfolded proteins in eukaryotic cells is accomplished by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In this pathway, proteins destined for the proteasome are tagged post-translationally with ubiquitin chains, which enable their recognition by proteasome-associated ubiquitin-binding proteins. Once bound to the proteasome, these ubiquitinated substrates are deubiquitinated and ultimately degraded<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In our search to determine how the disease protein ataxin-3 is degraded, we collected evidence that the turnover of this polyQ protein does not require its own ubiquitination: ataxin-3 that does not become ubiquitinated is degraded similarly to its wild type version in cells and does not accumulate <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p id="P26">According to a previous report, the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP may ubiquitinate ataxin-3 as well as other polyQ proteins to target them for degradation<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.

However, recent work indicated that CHIP ubiquitinates ataxin-3 to modify its catalytic activity during the process of substrate ubiquitination, where ataxin-3 and CHIP cooperate to enhance CHIP substrate degradation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Additionally, CHIP knockout mice do not show accumulation of ataxin-3 protein, and knockdown of CHIP in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not detectably impact ataxin-3 protein levels<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. Based on these previously published findings and our present results, we propose that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 serves to regulate its DUB functions, rather than directly dictate its proteasomal turnover. This is not to say that ubiquitination of ataxin-3 might not enhance its turnover under some circumstances. What our results indicate is that ataxin-3 does not need to be ubiquitinated to be degraded. Other proteins have been reported to be degraded by the proteasome in the absence of their own ubiquitination, including p21/CiP1<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, calmodulin<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, thymidylate synthase<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, tau<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, etc.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P27">We found that ataxin-3 degradation is regulated by its UbS2. Mutation of this domain accelerates the turnover of ataxin-3 in cells and leads to markedly lower levels of this protein <italic>in vivo</italic>. The general structural organization of the catalytic domain of ataxin-3 appears to not be impacted by mutating residue W87 of UbS2, according to previously published NMR studies<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. The localization of full-length ataxin-3(UbS2*) in cultured mammalian cells is not different from versions of this protein with intact UbS2. Full-length ataxin-3 with mutated UbS2 is capable of cleaving ubiquitin chains <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and this site is dispensable for the ubiquitination-dependent activation of ataxin-3 that we have reported previously<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, mutating UbS2 does not detrimentally impact ataxin-3&#x02019;s folding and localization, or abrogate its basic catalytic activities.</p><p id="P28">UbS2 binds directly to Rad23A/B<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Knockdown of Rad23A and/or B in cultured cells leads to significantly lower levels of ataxin-3 protein. Importantly, Rad23 knockdown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to lower levels of pathogenic ataxin-3 and ameliorates retinal degeneration caused by this protein. Based on our collective results, we propose a model for ataxin-3 degradation whereby its UIMs bind ubiquitinated proteasome substrates and &#x0201c;bring&#x0201d; this protein quality control DUB into the proximity of the degradative machinery. Once near the proteasome, the interaction of ataxin-3 with Rad23 prevents it from being degraded, perhaps because the direct binding of this polyQ protein to Rad23 is stronger than its association with the proteasome. If ataxin-3 does not bind Rad23, it is then degraded.</p><p id="P29">Our finding that UbS2 controls ataxin-3 degradation is of critical importance to SCA3 therapeutics. The structure of the N-terminal half of ataxin3, including UbS2, has been solved by NMR spectroscopy and its interaction with the ubiquitin-like domain of Rad23 has been modeled at this level<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We propose that this structural information be utilized to generate compounds that bind ataxin-3 at UbS2 and inhibit its interaction with Rad23 in order to increase the degradation rate of pathogenic ataxin-3 in SCA3 patients.</p><p id="P30">The work that we presented might be also of significance to diseases other than SCA3. Rad23A is reported to also interact directly with ataxin-7<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, mutations in which cause SCA7<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. It would be of interest to determine if Rad23A inhibits the degradation of ataxin-7, similar to its effect on ataxin-3. Moreover, a recent study by Coulson and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> provided convincing evidence that ataxin-3 restricts the transcription of the tumor suppressor PTEN. PTEN is considered a viable therapeutic target for various malignancies<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. The mechanism of ataxin-3 degradation that we presented leads us to suggest that enhancing the turnover of this enzyme could conceivably be utilized for cancer therapeutics: lowering ataxin-3 levels would be expected to increase the levels of PTEN.</p><p id="P31">Lastly, our findings suggest additional complexity in basic mechanisms of protein quality control. The general view of proteasome-associated proteins is that they enhance the degradation of client proteins with which they interact<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Our data propose that some proteasome-associated proteins, e.g. Rad23, can also inhibit, not just enhance, protein turnover. This novel finding suggests that proteasome shuttles need not always function in one direction, and expands the overall understanding of how individual components perform during protein quality control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S10"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S11"><title>Cell lines</title><p id="P32">HeLa and HEK-293 cells were purchased from ATCC and were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS under conventional tissue culture conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Constructs</title><p id="P33">HA-tagged ataxin-3 constructs are in pCDNA3.1-HA; this includes all non-pathogenic ataxin-3 variants.

Once at the proteasome, in the absence of interaction with Rad23A/B through UbS2, ataxin-3 is degraded by the proteasome. If UbS2 interacts with Rad23A/B, ataxin-3 is rescued from degradation, perhaps as a result of higher affinity for Rad23A/B compared to the proteasome.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms612186f7"/></fig></floats-group></article>
