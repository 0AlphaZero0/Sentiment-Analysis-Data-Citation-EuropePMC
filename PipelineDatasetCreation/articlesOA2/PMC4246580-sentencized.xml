</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, it has become apparent that skeletal muscle is a major endocrine organ (Pedersen and Febbraio 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle can synthesize and secrete several hundred proteins (Bortoluzzi et al. 2006; Henningsen et al. 2010; Norheim et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Proteins that are expressed, synthesized, released by myofibers, and exert either paracrine or endocrine effects, are classified as “myokines” (Pedersen and Febbraio 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although skeletal muscle hypertrophy and regeneration may enhance myokine secretion for a long period (Ambrosio et al. 2009; Norheim et al. 2011; Shan et al. 2013), acute muscle fiber contraction can induce myokine secretion rapidly, as shown for IL‐6 (Pedersen and Febbraio 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>ANGPTL4 is a multifunctional signal protein synthesized by most tissues (Grootaert et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is involved in regulation of angiogenesis, glucose and lipid metabolism, and cell differentiation (Grootaert et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Several studies show that ANGPTL4 inhibits the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for hydrolysis of plasma triacylglycerols (TG) to monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids (FFAs) (Yoshida et al. 2002; Mandard et al. 2006; Desai et al. 2007; Grootaert et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>ANGPTL4 may also stimulate adipose tissue lipolysis, and thereby release of glycerol and FFAs to the circulation (Yoshida et al. 2002; Mandard et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, the net effect of ANGPTL4 will represent a shift of FA oxidation derived from lipoproteins toward FAs originating from adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ANGPTL4 is positively associated with body fat mass (Smart‐Halajko et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Expression of ANGPTL4 is increased via different peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in hepatocytes and adipocytes (Kersten et al. 2000; Koliwad et al. 2009; Grootaert et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Studies on cultured human myotubes show that secretion of ANGPTL4 is stimulated by fatty acids (FAs) as well as the PPARδ‐specific activator GW501516 (Kersten et al. 2009; Staiger et al. 2009; Robciuc et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The impact of exercise on ANGPTL4 expression during exercise is not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest that ANGPTL4 is an exercise‐responsive myokine regulated by circulating factors (Kersten et al. 2009; Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Kersten et al. (2009) reported that the plasma concentration of ANGPTL4 after endurance activity is less enhanced in subjects given oral glucose, and Catoire et al. (2014) demonstrated in a human one‐legged exercise study a stronger induction of ANGPTL4 mRNA in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect of glucose on ANGPTL4 transcription is probably caused by increased release of insulin, causing suppression of lipolysis and reduced plasma FFA concentration (Kersten et al. 2009; Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of plasma FFA on skeletal muscle ANGPTL4 expression might be counteracted by the activation of AMPK‐activated kinase (AMPK) in exercising muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, it is not known if ANGPTL4 produced in skeletal muscle mainly act on the local tissue or whether the protein also convey an endocrine effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The main aim of this study was to examine the importance of skeletal muscle in regulating circulating ANGPTL4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We also investigated if transcription of ANGPTL4 in skeletal muscle is regulated solely via PPARδ or if additional exercise‐related factors such as glucocorticoids may play a role. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>We have performed an exercise intervention study in normal weight controls and overweight dysglycemic subjects and seen that the mRNA level of ANGPTL4 is increased in skeletal muscle during and after acute exercise which may be caused by increased levels FFAs as well as cortisol in the circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>We also provide evidence suggesting that ANGPTL4 from muscle has limited impact on the serum level and show that muscle and adipose tissue contain two identical ANGPTL4 mRNA isoforms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>One of the aims of this study was to investigate the contribution of skeletal muscle to the serum levels of ANGPTL4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Others have shown that muscle mRNA as well as fasting plasma levels of ANGPTL4 were enhanced in response to endurance exercise, especially after 4‐h recovery (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>We also show that acute exercise increases ANGPTL4 mRNA levels in muscle and protein in serum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>In addition, we now provide evidence suggesting that ANGPTL4 from muscle has a minor impact on the serum level compared to adipose tissue and the liver. Firstly, we show that the induction of ANGPTL4 expression is more pronounced in skeletal muscle from exercising healthy controls as compared to overweight dysglycemic subjects, whereas the opposite is observed in serum, suggesting that other organs than skeletal muscle might be responsible for regulation of circulating ANGPTL4 in response to exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>In mouse experiments, we demonstrate that Angptl4 mRNA is induced in response to exercise in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver, and show that liver and adipose tissue have a higher basal expression of Angptl4 mRNA levels compared to skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Also, we show that the Angptl4 mRNA induction in response to exercise is higher in the liver as compared to muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, the fact that skeletal muscle accounts for about 40% of body mass in a lean individual might make it an important contributor to blood levels of ANGPTL4, although it has low ANGPTL4 expression in muscle tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that skeletal muscle might be a more important source of circulating ANGPTL4 in subjects with more muscle mass and less adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In our human exercise study, the group with the most adipose tissue exhibits the highest basal serum levels of ANGPTL4 and the highest induction of circulating ANGPTL4 in response to exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>It has also been suggested that the liver is the main contributor to circulating ANGPTL4 during fasting (Dijk and Kersten 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests that this is also the case in response to exercise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>The fact that during a one‐legged exercise intervention ANGPTL4 mRNA expression was more induced in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg suggests that circulating factors can induce ANGPTL4 transcription in skeletal muscle (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of FFA are known to increase during acute exercise and are hypothesized to increase transcription of ANGPTL4 in skeletal muscle after PPARδ activation (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Studies on cultured human myotubes have revealed that secretion of ANGPTL4 is stimulated by FAs as well as a PPARδ‐specific activator (Kersten et al. 2009; Staiger et al. 2009; Robciuc et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>In our study, we provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence for a robust increase of Angptl4 transcription by PPARδ in mouse skeletal muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate by gavage feeding mice that a PPARδ‐specific ligand enhances muscle Angptl4 transcription in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>We also show that the FFA‐induced Angptl4 expression was reduced in myotubes by an inhibitor specific for PPARδ, but not by inhibitors directed against PPARα and PPARγ. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Several circulating factors are increased in response to acute exercise in addition to FFAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>One of the hormones that are known to be increased in response to exercise is the glucocorticoid cortisol (Nieman et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>Because it has been shown that ANGPTL4 is a direct GR target in hepatocytes as well as in adipocytes (Koliwad et al. 2009), one of the aims of this study was to investigate if human myotubes also respond to glucocorticoids by increasing ANGPTL4 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>We show that the serum concentration of cortisol is indeed increased in response to acute exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>We also show that ANGPTL4 transcription is elevated in cultures of primary human muscle cells incubated with the GR ligand, dexamethasone, comparable to the effects of dexamethasone on primary rat hepatocytes and human adipocytes (Koliwad et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that circulating ANGPTL4 is not elevated by exercise when glucose is consumed (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both the plasma level of FFAs and cortisol are reduced when glucose is ingested during exercise (Nieman et al. 2005; Catoire et al. 2014) and may thus both explain some of the suppressive effects of glucose on circulating ANGPTL4 (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ANGPTL4 mRNA in muscle can be regulated by the cortisol‐GR axis during acute exercise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>One function of ANGPTL4 may be to inhibit the uptake of FAs derived from lipoproteins by regulating LPL activity in skeletal muscle during exercise (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Catoire et al. (2014) suggested that during a one‐legged exercise intervention ANGPTL4 mRNA expression was more increased in the resting leg as compared to the exercising leg because of the counteracting effect of AMPK on ANGPTL4 transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The repression of ANGPTL4 production and hence enhanced LPL activity might promote use of circulating TG in the exercising muscle (Catoire et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>We show in our human exercise intervention that acute exercise induces both LPL and ANGPTL4 transcription in skeletal muscle to a higher degree in control subjects as compared to the dysglycemic subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>However, the serum levels of ANGPTL4 were more increased after exercise in the overweight dysglycemic subjects than in the controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Because the relative contribution of skeletal muscle to circulating ANGPTL4 during exercise remains unknown, it is difficult to predict in which group ANGPTL4 has the largest inhibitory effect on LPL activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Coexpression of ANGPTL4 with LPL in skeletal muscle might suggest that ANGPTL4 acts mainly via local inhibition (Dijk and Kersten 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Future studies should address the relative contribution of skeletal muscle to circulating ANGPTL4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Thereby, it would be possible to evaluate the inhibitory potential ANGPTL4 may have on LPL activity during exercise. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In summary, our data suggest that ANGPTL4 produced in skeletal muscle during and after exercise has limited impact on the serum protein level and probably acts mostly in local tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Our data also indicate that FFAs and cortisol increase transcription of ANGPTL4 in muscle during exercise via activation of PPARδ and GR. </plain></SENT>
