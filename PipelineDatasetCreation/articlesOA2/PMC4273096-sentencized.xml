</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reason for the close attention paid by researchers to sea anemones, marine coelenterates, is their toxins that are complex mixtures of biologically active compounds of a protein nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurotoxins (modulators of Nav, ASICs and Kv ion channels), proteinase inhibitors differing in their structure and mechanism of action, and actinoporins belonging to the α-pore-forming toxin (α-PFT) family are of great interest for future use as pharmacological agents [1-3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Actinoporins have a unique spatial structure that allows them to exist both in the water-soluble and in membrane-bound states and determines their ability to bind to sphingomyelin- containing membranes and to form ion channels or pores in them [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A wide range of pharmacological activities exhibited by these polypeptides, such as anti- tumor, anti-parasitic, dermatonecrotic, and cardiac stimulatory [5-7] activities is associated with the pore formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It was found that EqtII actinoporin from Actinia equina at a concentration of 0.1–1 nM has a cardiotoxic effect, but at higher concentrations it stimulates platelet aggregation [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tenebrosins (actinoporins from A. tenebrosa) at low concentrations (~ 10-9 M) were demonstrated to also act as cardiac stimulants [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>EqtII and Bc2 actinoporins from Bunodosoma caissarum [10] were found to be effective anticancer agents affecting fibrosarcoma and glioblastoma [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recently, using HeLa, THP-1, MDA-MB-231, and SNU-C4 cells, we demonstrated that RTX-A actinoporin from Heteractis crispa, at nontoxic concentrations, exhibits antitumor effect and suppresses the epidermal-growth-factor-induced tumor transformation of JB6P+Cl41 mouse epithelial cells [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This effect was found to be due to the induction of p53-independent apoptosis and inhibition of the activity of the oncogenic nuclear factors AP-1 and NF-κB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In recent years, α-pore-forming toxins from sea anemones have been used to develop pharmaceutical drugs on the basis of immunoconjugates of actinoporins with ligands, such as monoclonal antibodies, hormones, or growth factors, whose action is directed at the cytoplasmic membranes of tumor and/or parasitic cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In this regard, investigation of the molecular basis of the actinoporin pharmacological effects seems to be of interest. </plain></SENT>
