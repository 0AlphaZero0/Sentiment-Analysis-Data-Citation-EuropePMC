Since the emergence of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%. Most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For this reason WHO [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and CDC [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation.</p><p>It is known that influenza virus infections are often accompanied by other viral pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5&#x02013;83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The detection frequency with immunofluorescence was found to be even higher (90&#x02013;100%) [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Potential concomitant viral pathogens of influenza virus infections include human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>As a result of the multiple infections, a specific anti-influenza mono-therapy treats the influenza virus infection only, but not the infection with the concomitant viral pathogen. Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms. Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations.</p><p>One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (<italic>Rhodophyceae</italic>) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and has been reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and influenza A [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. In good accordance with the literature [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries.</p><p>At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea). Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and farming [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi) [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). 156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections&#x02014;including influenza&#x02014;with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections. In the present work we investigate the therapeutic effect of a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir <italic>in-vitro</italic> and in an animal model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Compounds</title><p>Kappa-carrageenan and iota-carrageenan were purchased from FMC Biopolymers (Philadelphia, PA).

For the H7N7 lethal infection the minimal effective dose of Zanamivir as mono-therapy ranged between 1 and 3 mg/kg BW/day (data not shown). Next, we compared the antiviral activity of carrageenan (12 mg/kg BW/day) and Zanamivir (1 and 3 mg/kg BW/day) mono-therapies with the respective combination versus placebo treatment.

We have previously shown that a combined therapy of iota-carrageenan with the NI Oseltamivir led to significantly enhanced survival in mice infected with H1N1 PR/8/34 in comparison with the respective mono-therapies [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, Oseltamivir is an orally administered prodrug, which has to be converted into its active form by metabolic processing. Therefore, a further development of a combination nasal spray was not possible with Oseltamivir. Instead Zanamivir&#x02013;a NI that is applied as active drug&#x02014;was chosen for the development of a compound combination.</p><p>During the evaluation process we found that the binding efficiency of different carrageenan subtypes on different influenza strains varies. The combined use of iota- and kappa-carrageenan for the treatment of lethally influenza infected C57Bl/6 mice revealed a better therapeutic effect than the use of iota-carrageenan alone (<xref rid="pone.0128794.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, to provide a broader spectrum of activity against different influenza virus strains, a mixture of iota- and kappa-carrageenan (designated as carrageenan) was used for further evaluation.</p><p>For investigation of the effect of a compound combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir, we examined their inhibition efficiency, individually and in combination, against influenza viruses in an adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells. The combination showed a synergistic inhibition of virus replication in <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays with all tested influenza viruses (<xref rid="pone.0128794.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). This indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the inhibition of the neuraminidase by Zanamivir. This was confirmed in <italic>in-vitro</italic> tests examining a potential influence of the polymer on the neuraminidase inhibiting activity of Zanamivir (data not shown). Hence, the observed synergistic effect is based on the combination of two distinct underlying mechanisms. As a result, in the proposed combination both mechanisms would complement each other to provide more efficient protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds.</p><p>The synergistic effect was also shown in lethal mice models (<xref rid="pone.0128794.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0128794.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mice varies and is dependent on the strain and its adaptation to the host. Depending on virus dose and strain, influenza viruses can induce lethal infections in certain mouse strains usually within two weeks [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In our model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). In such a model, early virus replication takes place in the upper respiratory tract. From there, virus spreads to the lung and causes lethal pneumonia. The effect of the treatment on mortality is assessed in comparison to placebo-treated control mice. Of all <italic>in-vitro</italic> tested influenza strains the H1N1(09)pdm and the LP H7N7 are particularly interesting for two reasons. First, they are highly relevant pathogens, as both are involved in recent influenza outbreaks. The H1N1(09)pdm is associated with more than 18,400 deaths in the season 2009/2010 while the LP H7N7 carries an HA closely related to that of the avian influenza H7N9 virus which has caused more than 175 deaths until October 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Second, they are of special interest for the carrageenan/Zanamivir combination approach. They have shown to differ in <italic>in-vitro</italic> susceptibility to carrageenan, Zanamivir (<xref rid="pone.0128794.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the combination thereof (<xref rid="pone.0128794.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). While H1N1(09)pdm was highly sensitive to inhibition by both substances alone, H7N7 required much higher concentrations of carrageenan and Zanamivir, respectively, to achieve similar inhibition efficiencies. Therefore, both virus strains were chosen to further explore the efficiency of the combination therapy in a mouse model.</p><p>We established lethal mouse models with both viruses that resulted in 6.8 and 8.5 mean survival days for LP H7N7 and H1N1(09)pdm, respectively. These results are in good accordance to similar already published lethal influenza models [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In our models the lowest effective dose for Zanamivir at a treatment start 24 hpi was found to be between 1 to 3 mg/kg BW/day for both viruses. This concentration range is relatively high in comparison to other published studies. However, these studies were done under anesthesia with different viruses and a prophylactic therapy start [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The fact that a higher dose of NI is needed for an effective treatment when the therapy starts 24 hpi is already known for Oseltamivir [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Nonetheless, also data with much higher effective concentrations (&#x02265;10 mg/kg BW/day [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]) and with similar concentrations of Zanamivir (2.5 mg/kg BW/day [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]) were published as well.</p><p>We found that the combination of carrageenan with 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir used for treatment of H7N7 infected mice resulted in significantly enhanced survival of mice in comparison to both mono-therapies (<xref rid="pone.0128794.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The significantly enhanced survival compared to the placebo treated group was also found after a delayed treatment start 48 hpi. Furthermore, in the H1N1(09)pdm model the combination of carrageenan with 1 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir showed statistically significant enhanced survival in comparison to placebo treatment even after a treatment start 72 hpi. This is a remarkable finding since NIs are normally not effective when applied 72 hpi.</p><p>The finding supports the development of the Zanamivir and carrageenan combination approach. As the intranasal treatment regime is incapable to effectively treat virus infections of the lung, the primary target of such a product is the prophylaxis and therapy of uncomplicated influenza. Since the majority of influenza infections causes uncomplicated illnesses and practically all cases of influenza start with an infection of the nasal cavity or the upper respiratory tract, the therapeutic potential is huge. However, clinical studies are required to elucidate and demonstrate the potential of the proposed combination therapy.</p><p>Combination of antiviral strategies has led to impressive achievements in the combat against other viral disease like HIV. In particular the problem of antiviral resistance could be addressed with this strategy. In the last decade concerns have been raised about the increased emergence of Oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses. The augmented appearance of viruses carrying the mutation H275Y in the neuraminidase of H1N1(09)pdm viruses that confers resistance to Oseltamivir left Zanamivir as only treatment option for symptomatic patients infected with an Oseltamivir resistant influenza strain [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In contrast to Oseltamivir, resistance to Zanamivir is less frequent. To date, Zanamivir resistant influenza has been detected only once, in an immunocompromised patient [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. However, lessons should be learned from previous anti-influenza interventions which resulted in occurrence of resistance against currently approved drugs [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, concerns are comprehensible that an increased Zanamivir use may also lead to the rapid emergence of resistances [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. To overcome this threat, a combination of antivirals which inhibits virus replication by distinct mechanisms is a valid strategy. We checked for the possibility of generating double compound escape mutant viruses while passaging viruses in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound combinations. After 10 passages in MDCK cells no resistance to the compound combination for any tested influenza virus could be found (data not shown). However, this finding does not guarantee that emergence of Zanamivir escape mutants can be completely halted.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that the anti-influenza mechanisms of both single compounds complement each other. The combination provides synergistically better protection against a broader spectrum of influenza viruses than the individual compounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A nasal spray containing carrageenan together with Zanamivir provides an easy to apply treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in patients under suspicion to be influenza infected. Patients would benefit from the fast and efficient treatment of uncomplicated influenza in the upper respiratory tract. Due to the faster influenza virus clearance from the upper respiratory tract and the independent antiviral mechanism of carrageenan and Zanamivir the likelihood to develop escape mutations against Zanamivir will be reduced. Both individual compounds are able to reduce severity and/or duration of the influenza illness and a combination is expected to work similarly. Additionally, due to the broad antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan, patients will receive in parallel a treatment of concomitant viral infections. Therefore, patients will benefit from a decreased probability to develop complications. In consideration of the complications known to accompany an influenza virus illness this combinational therapy meets an urgent medical need.</p><p>A second scope of this combination is the protection against newly emerging pandemic viruses during the time until identification of the virus followed by manufacturing and distribution of vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Even if, due to new reverse genetic techniques, less time for production of vaccines is needed, it still takes months before large quantities of vaccine are available [<xref rid="pone.0128794.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. During this time the human population should be protected to decelerate viral spread. At the moment the only available opportunities for personal protection are hygiene measures and the use of Tamiflu (brand name of Oseltamivir).</p><p>Novel protection and treatment options for influenza are desperately needed. Based on our encouraging results in mice we suggest testing a nasal spray containing carrageenan in combination with the neuraminidase inhibitor Zanamivir in clinical trials for prevention or treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0128794.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Therapeutic efficacy of iota-carrageenan solely or together with kappa-carrageenan in influenza H7N7 lethal infected mice.</title><p>Mice (n = 20 per group) were lethally intranasally infected without anesthesia on day 0 and accordingly intranasally treated twice per day either with placebo or with iota-carrageenan or with a mixture of iota- and kappa-carrageenan.
