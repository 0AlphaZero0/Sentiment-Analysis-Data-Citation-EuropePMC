</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The periodic appearance of new influenza variants poses a worldwide pandemic threat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Since the emergence of the new A(H7N9) virus, more than 400 human cases were reported to the WHO with a mortality rate of more than 35%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Most patients with A(H7N9) infections had contact with poultry or visited live animal markets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, some sporadic cases seemed to be a result of human to human transmissions [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In contrast to pandemic viruses which fulminantly enter the human population and cause high mortality rates, seasonal influenza viruses generally cause uncomplicated and transient infections in humans, with virus replication localized to the upper respiratory tract [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, in its fully developed form influenza is an acute respiratory disease resulting in hospitalizations and deaths mainly among high-risk groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Worldwide, annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For this reason WHO [6] and CDC [7] recommend antiviral treatment for any patient with suspected influenza who is at risk for influenza complications without previous laboratory confirmation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is known that influenza virus infections are often accompanied by other viral pathogens [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Depending on the detection method (qRT-PCR or immunofluorescence) different ratios of co-infections have been found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed that 54.5–83.3% of influenza A or B positive patients were found to have at least one concomitant respiratory viral infection [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The detection frequency with immunofluorescence was found to be even higher (90–100%) [13,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Potential concomitant viral pathogens of influenza virus infections include human rhinovirus (hRV), respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus [14,15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>As a result of the multiple infections, a specific anti-influenza mono-therapy treats the influenza virus infection only, but not the infection with the concomitant viral pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Hence, the therapy often fails to sufficiently resolve symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>This is also reflected by the fact that neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) are highly efficacious in animal models investigating influenza mono-infections [16,17] but show lower efficacy against influenza symptoms in clinical trials in adults with natural infections [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a high medical need for a broadly acting antiviral therapy in combination with a specific anti-influenza therapy for treatment of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Ideally, the substances present in the combination complement each other by different modes of action, leading to a treatment that provides full protection against a broad range of different respiratory viruses as well as different influenza strains with a low probability to induce escape mutations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>One approach for a broad antiviral therapy is the creation of a protective physical barrier in the nasal cavity using carrageenan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Carrageenan is a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) that has been extensively used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry and is generally recognized as safe by the FDA (GRAS) (reviewed in [19]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Three main forms of carrageenans are commercially used: kappa, iota and lambda. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>They differ from each other in the degree of sulfation, solubility and gelling properties [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The antiviral mechanism of carrageenan is based on the interference with viral attachment; as a consequence, viral entry is inhibited [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Its antiviral activity is dependent on the type of polymer as well as the virus and the host cells [23–32] and has been reviewed in [33–35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We published that iota-carrageenan is a potent inhibitor of hRV [36] and influenza A [37] replication and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy of iota-carrageenan against common cold viruses by intranasal application in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials [38–40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The pooled analysis of two studies conducted in 153 children and 203 adults revealed that patients infected with any respiratory virus, who were intranasally treated with iota-carrageenan showed a 1.9 day faster recovery from common cold symptoms than placebo treated patients in the intention-to-treat population [41,42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The anti-influenza activity was shown by subgroup analysis of 49 influenza infected patients who benefited from a 3.3 days faster recovery from symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The use of carrageenan nasal spray was associated with a significant reduction of the influenza viral load in nasal fluids and a significant increase in the number of virus free patients within the treatment period of 7 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In good accordance with the literature [9–14] we observed that the majority of influenza virus infected patients suffered from a concomitant respiratory viral infection (66%) as determined by real-time PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Carrageenan containing nasal sprays are already marketed for the treatment of respiratory viral infections under different brand names in 18 countries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>At present the only available effective drugs for treatment and post exposure prevention of influenza are the NI (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir worldwide; Peramivir in Japan and South Korea). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Since the large-scale use of M2 blockers for prophylaxis and treatment in humans [43] and farming [44], the currently circulating influenza viruses already lack sensitivity to this drug group [45]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We have already shown an additive therapeutic effect of a combination therapy with intranasally applied iota-carrageenan and orally administered Oseltamivir in lethally H1N1 A/PR/8/34 infected mice and a treatment start 48 hours post infection (hpi) [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Due to these very promising results we further developed the concept of combining carrageenan with an NI therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Oseltamivir, which needs to be activated by metabolic conversion, Zanamivir is directly applied as active drug and can also be administered intranasally [46–52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The potential of an intranasal administration of Zanamivir was investigated by GlaxoSmithKline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In seven clinical challenge trials 66 volunteers were infected with influenza B/Yamagata/16/88 and 213 with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>156 of these participants got intranasally applied Zanamivir at different doses (daily dose levels from 6.4 mg to 96 mg) for prophylaxis or therapy [46,47,53,54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>These challenge trials showed that treatment starting before and up to 36 hours post virus inoculation was associated with prevention of laboratory confirmed influenza and febrile illness as well as a reduction in viral titers, duration of shedding and symptoms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In total, safety data from 1092 patients after intranasal application of Zanamivir were published and no evidence for Zanamivir induced adverse events or increased frequencies of local nasal intolerance in comparison to placebo groups was found [46,49,52]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the combination of a carrageenan nasal spray that provides broad antiviral activity against upper respiratory infections—including influenza—with Zanamivir, a specific anti-influenza drug, meets the existing medical need to treat multiple viral infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>In the present work we investigate the therapeutic effect of a combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir in-vitro and in an animal model. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that a combined therapy of iota-carrageenan with the NI Oseltamivir led to significantly enhanced survival in mice infected with H1N1 PR/8/34 in comparison with the respective mono-therapies [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, Oseltamivir is an orally administered prodrug, which has to be converted into its active form by metabolic processing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a further development of a combination nasal spray was not possible with Oseltamivir. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Instead Zanamivir–a NI that is applied as active drug—was chosen for the development of a compound combination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>During the evaluation process we found that the binding efficiency of different carrageenan subtypes on different influenza strains varies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The combined use of iota- and kappa-carrageenan for the treatment of lethally influenza infected C57Bl/6 mice revealed a better therapeutic effect than the use of iota-carrageenan alone (S1 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Thus, to provide a broader spectrum of activity against different influenza virus strains, a mixture of iota- and kappa-carrageenan (designated as carrageenan) was used for further evaluation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>For investigation of the effect of a compound combination of carrageenan and Zanamivir, we examined their inhibition efficiency, individually and in combination, against influenza viruses in an adapted plaque reduction assay with semi-liquid overlay in MDCK cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The combination showed a synergistic inhibition of virus replication in in-vitro assays with all tested influenza viruses (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the physical interaction of the polymer with the virus does not disturb the inhibition of the neuraminidase by Zanamivir. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>This was confirmed in in-vitro tests examining a potential influence of the polymer on the neuraminidase inhibiting activity of Zanamivir (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Hence, the observed synergistic effect is based on the combination of two distinct underlying mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>As a result, in the proposed combination both mechanisms would complement each other to provide more efficient protection against a broader spectrum of influenza virus strains than the individual compounds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The synergistic effect was also shown in lethal mice models (Fig 2 and Fig 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The pathogenicity of influenza viruses in mice varies and is dependent on the strain and its adaptation to the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Depending on virus dose and strain, influenza viruses can induce lethal infections in certain mouse strains usually within two weeks [37,63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In our model, C57Bl/6 mice are challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of the respective virus and treated with different regimens in comparison to a vehicle control (placebo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In such a model, early virus replication takes place in the upper respiratory tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>From there, virus spreads to the lung and causes lethal pneumonia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The effect of the treatment on mortality is assessed in comparison to placebo-treated control mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Of all in-vitro tested influenza strains the H1N1(09)pdm and the LP H7N7 are particularly interesting for two reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>First, they are highly relevant pathogens, as both are involved in recent influenza outbreaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The H1N1(09)pdm is associated with more than 18,400 deaths in the season 2009/2010 while the LP H7N7 carries an HA closely related to that of the avian influenza H7N9 virus which has caused more than 175 deaths until October 2014 [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Second, they are of special interest for the carrageenan/Zanamivir combination approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>They have shown to differ in in-vitro susceptibility to carrageenan, Zanamivir (Table 1) and the combination thereof (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>While H1N1(09)pdm was highly sensitive to inhibition by both substances alone, H7N7 required much higher concentrations of carrageenan and Zanamivir, respectively, to achieve similar inhibition efficiencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Therefore, both virus strains were chosen to further explore the efficiency of the combination therapy in a mouse model. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>We established lethal mouse models with both viruses that resulted in 6.8 and 8.5 mean survival days for LP H7N7 and H1N1(09)pdm, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>These results are in good accordance to similar already published lethal influenza models [65–67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In our models the lowest effective dose for Zanamivir at a treatment start 24 hpi was found to be between 1 to 3 mg/kg BW/day for both viruses. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>However, these studies were done under anesthesia with different viruses and a prophylactic therapy start [65,66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The fact that a higher dose of NI is needed for an effective treatment when the therapy starts 24 hpi is already known for Oseltamivir [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, also data with much higher effective concentrations (≥10 mg/kg BW/day [69]) and with similar concentrations of Zanamivir (2.5 mg/kg BW/day [67]) were published as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>We found that the combination of carrageenan with 3 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir used for treatment of H7N7 infected mice resulted in significantly enhanced survival of mice in comparison to both mono-therapies (Fig 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>The significantly enhanced survival compared to the placebo treated group was also found after a delayed treatment start 48 hpi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the H1N1(09)pdm model the combination of carrageenan with 1 mg/kg BW/day Zanamivir showed statistically significant enhanced survival in comparison to placebo treatment even after a treatment start 72 hpi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>This is a remarkable finding since NIs are normally not effective when applied 72 hpi. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Since the majority of influenza infections causes uncomplicated illnesses and practically all cases of influenza start with an infection of the nasal cavity or the upper respiratory tract, the therapeutic potential is huge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>However, clinical studies are required to elucidate and demonstrate the potential of the proposed combination therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Combination of antiviral strategies has led to impressive achievements in the combat against other viral disease like HIV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>In particular the problem of antiviral resistance could be addressed with this strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>In the last decade concerns have been raised about the increased emergence of Oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The augmented appearance of viruses carrying the mutation H275Y in the neuraminidase of H1N1(09)pdm viruses that confers resistance to Oseltamivir left Zanamivir as only treatment option for symptomatic patients infected with an Oseltamivir resistant influenza strain [70]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Oseltamivir, resistance to Zanamivir is less frequent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>To date, Zanamivir resistant influenza has been detected only once, in an immunocompromised patient [71,72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>However, lessons should be learned from previous anti-influenza interventions which resulted in occurrence of resistance against currently approved drugs [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Therefore, concerns are comprehensible that an increased Zanamivir use may also lead to the rapid emergence of resistances [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>To overcome this threat, a combination of antivirals which inhibits virus replication by distinct mechanisms is a valid strategy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>We checked for the possibility of generating double compound escape mutant viruses while passaging viruses in the presence of increasing concentrations of compound combinations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>After 10 passages in MDCK cells no resistance to the compound combination for any tested influenza virus could be found (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, this finding does not guarantee that emergence of Zanamivir escape mutants can be completely halted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>In summary, we demonstrated that the anti-influenza mechanisms of both single compounds complement each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The combination provides synergistically better protection against a broader spectrum of influenza viruses than the individual compounds. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>A nasal spray containing carrageenan together with Zanamivir provides an easy to apply treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in patients under suspicion to be influenza infected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Patients would benefit from the fast and efficient treatment of uncomplicated influenza in the upper respiratory tract. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Due to the faster influenza virus clearance from the upper respiratory tract and the independent antiviral mechanism of carrageenan and Zanamivir the likelihood to develop escape mutations against Zanamivir will be reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Both individual compounds are able to reduce severity and/or duration of the influenza illness and a combination is expected to work similarly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Additionally, due to the broad antiviral effectiveness of carrageenan, patients will receive in parallel a treatment of concomitant viral infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients will benefit from a decreased probability to develop complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In consideration of the complications known to accompany an influenza virus illness this combinational therapy meets an urgent medical need. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>A second scope of this combination is the protection against newly emerging pandemic viruses during the time until identification of the virus followed by manufacturing and distribution of vaccines [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Even if, due to new reverse genetic techniques, less time for production of vaccines is needed, it still takes months before large quantities of vaccine are available [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>During this time the human population should be protected to decelerate viral spread. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>At the moment the only available opportunities for personal protection are hygiene measures and the use of Tamiflu (brand name of Oseltamivir). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Novel protection and treatment options for influenza are desperately needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Based on our encouraging results in mice we suggest testing a nasal spray containing carrageenan in combination with the neuraminidase inhibitor Zanamivir in clinical trials for prevention or treatment of uncomplicated influenza infections. </plain></SENT>
