For bioengineering purposes, there is a pressing interest in identifying and characterizing the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of lignin. Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT; EC 2.3.1.133) is a key metabolic entry point for the synthesis of the most important lignin monomers: coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols. In this study, we investigated the substrate promiscuity of HCT from a bryophyte (<italic>Physcomitrella</italic>) and from five representatives of vascular plants (Arabidopsis, poplar, switchgrass, pine and <italic>Selaginella</italic>) using a yeast expression system. We demonstrate for these HCTs a conserved capacity to acylate with <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA several phenolic compounds in addition to the canonical acceptor shikimate normally used during lignin biosynthesis. Using either recombinant HCT from switchgrass (PvHCT2a) or an Arabidopsis stem protein extract, we show evidence of the inhibitory effect of these phenolics on the synthesis of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate in vitro, which presumably occurs via a mechanism of competitive inhibition. A structural study of PvHCT2a confirmed the binding of a non-canonical acceptor in a similar manner to shikimate in the active site of the enzyme. Finally, we exploited in Arabidopsis the substrate flexibility of HCT to reduce lignin content and improve biomass saccharification by engineering transgenic lines that overproduce one of the HCT non-canonical acceptors. Our results demonstrate conservation of HCT substrate promiscuity and provide support for a new strategy for lignin reduction in the effort to improve the quality of plant biomass for forage and cellulosic biofuels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>Bioenergy</kwd><kwd>Cell wall</kwd><kwd>HCT</kwd><kwd>Lignin</kwd><kwd>Saccharification</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plant biomass is routinely utilized in diverse agro-industrial sectors such as pulp and paper, forage, bio-manufacturing and bioenergy. Among several sustainable energy strategies, the conversion of plant cell walls into fermentable sugars offers the possibility for microbial production of bio-based products including materials (e.g. biopolymers), commodity chemicals, fine and specialty chemicals, and liquid fuels (<xref rid="pcw016-B52" ref-type="bibr">Vickers et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B22" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 2015</xref>). Lignin is a hydrophobic polymer that permeates plant cell walls and impedes the biochemical processes used for plant biomass conversion into fermentable sugars (<xref rid="pcw016-B60" ref-type="bibr">Zeng et al. 2014</xref>). Lignin from ferns and gymnosperms contains <italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl (H) and guaiacyl (G) units derived from <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol, respectively; and lignin from certain lycophytes and angiosperms additionally contains syringyl (S) units (<xref rid="pcw016-B5" ref-type="bibr">Boerjan et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B57" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al. 2010</xref>). These lignin monomers (or monolignols) are synthesized from phenylalanine in the cytosol and exported to the cell wall for oxidative polymerization (<xref rid="pcw016-B5" ref-type="bibr">Boerjan et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the lignin pathway, the metabolic entry point responsible for the production of both coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols involves hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT), which catalyzes the coupling of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA with shikimate to produce <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcw016-F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="pcw016-B26" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2004</xref>). Following this step, the hydroxycinnamoyl moiety of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate is hydroxylated by <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate 3&#x02032;-hydroxylase (C3&#x02032;H) to produce caffeoyl shikimate which is then transesterified by HCT to release caffeoyl-CoA, or, as recently described in Arabidopsis, cleaved by caffeoyl shikimate esterase (CSE) to release caffeate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcw016-F1">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref rid="pcw016-B21" ref-type="bibr">Franke et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B51" ref-type="bibr">Vanholme et al. 2013a</xref>). Reduction of HCT activity limits the synthesis of coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols and causes a backlog of upstream metabolites, which leads to a redirection of part of the metabolic flux of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA into <italic>p</italic>-coumaryl alcohol. Therefore, the lignin from plants exhibiting strong HCT down-regulation is enriched in H units and its content is heavily reduced due to the poor capacity of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl alcohol to incorporate the polymer (<xref rid="pcw016-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B50" ref-type="bibr">Vanholme et al. 2013b</xref>). Considering its central role in lignin biosynthesis, HCT has been a target in genetic engineering strategies for improving the commercial utility of plant biomass. For example, down-regulation of <italic>HCT</italic> expression reduces lignin content and improves forage digestibility and saccharification efficiency in alfalfa (<xref rid="pcw016-B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Dixon 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B43" ref-type="bibr">Shadle et al. 2007</xref>).

These transferases are capable of acylating a wide variety of acceptors, and some of them exhibit broad substrate flexibility (<xref rid="pcw016-B30" ref-type="bibr">Landmann et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B38" ref-type="bibr">Molina and Kosma 2014</xref>). For example, it is well known that some HCTs can use quinate as a substrate in addition to shikimate (<xref rid="pcw016-B26" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lallemand et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B55" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B14" ref-type="bibr">Escamilla-Trevi&#x000f1;o et al. 2014</xref>). Moreover, HCT from globe artichoke (CcHCT) was shown to accept 3-hydroxyanthranilate as a substrate (<xref rid="pcw016-B37" ref-type="bibr">Moglia et al. 2010</xref>), and similar substrate promiscuity was described for HCT from <italic>Coleus blumei</italic>, which can also use 3-amino- and 3-hydroxybenzoates as acceptor substrates, forming both <italic>p</italic>-coumarate ester and amide conjugates (<xref rid="pcw016-B42" ref-type="bibr">Sander and Petersen 2011</xref>). Although HCT is a well-conserved enzyme among land plants (<xref rid="pcw016-B59" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. 2009</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B49" ref-type="bibr">Tohge et al. 2013</xref>), characterization of its substrate flexibility remains poorly described. Furthermore, until now, it had yet to be tested whether the substrate promiscuity of HCT could be exploited for lignin engineering and improving plant biomass.</p><p>In this study, using a yeast expression system, we investigated the substrate promiscuity of HCT from a bryophyte (<italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>), a lycophyte (<italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic>), a coniferous gymnosperm (<italic>Pinus radiata</italic>), a monocot angiosperm (<italic>Panicum virgatum</italic>) and two dicot angiosperms (<italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) toward a series of benzene and benzoate derivatives. Recombinant yeast strains that individually co-express these phylogenetically related HCTs with 4-coumarate-CoA ligase were capable of producing <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl conjugates when fed with <italic>p</italic>-coumarate and shikimate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate (gentisate), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate), 3-aminobenzoate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, 5-hydroxyanthranilate, <italic>ortho-</italic>hydroxyphenol (catechol) and <italic>para-</italic>hydroxyphenol (hydroquinone). Purified recombinant HCT from switchgrass showed activity towards these new &#x02018;non-canonical&#x02019; substrates, which confirmed their capacity to bind the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, we demonstrate that in vitro formation of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate by either a switchgrass recombinant HCT (PvHCT2a) or an Arabidopsis stem protein extract is partially inhibited in the presence of the non-canonical acceptors, presumably via a mechanism of competitive inhibition. Finally, we extended this characterization to in vivo inhibition assays by engineering Arabidopsis lines to overproduce one of these HCT-competitive inhibitors (protocatechuate) in lignifying tissues, and showed an approximately 30% reduction of lignin content, providing a significant improvement of biomass saccharification efficiency. Our results demonstrate the potential of inhibiting HCT in various bioenergy crops by overproducing unusual HCT acceptors in planta. The substrate promiscuity of HCT was observed in all the plant taxa we tested, and it appears to have been conserved since plants first appeared on land about 450 Ma ago. This novel approach could be particularly valuable to reduce lignin in crops for which genomic information is still unavailable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Selection and identification of HCT sequences</title><p>For this study, we selected HCT from Arabidopsis (AtHCT) since it has been shown to be genetically implicated in lignin biosynthesis (<xref rid="pcw016-B25" ref-type="bibr">Hoffman et al. 2004</xref>). A HCT from the woody dicot poplar was also selected. In particular, out of seven HCT genes found in the poplar genome, <italic>PtHCT1</italic> and <italic>PtHCT6</italic> have been associated with lignin biosynthesis because of their xylem-specific expression profile (<xref rid="pcw016-B45" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2010</xref>). PtHCT6 was selected for this study since it has higher catalytic efficiency towards coumaroyl-CoA (<xref rid="pcw016-B56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2014</xref>). In the monocot switchgrass, two enzymes (PvHCT1a and PvHCT2a) have proven HCT activity (<xref rid="pcw016-B14" ref-type="bibr">Escamilla-Trevi&#x000f1;o et al. 2014</xref>). PvHCT2a was selected for this study based on its predicted involvement in lignin biosynthesis according to gene expression profiling experiments (<xref rid="pcw016-B44" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. 2013</xref>). For gymnosperms, we selected a HCT from pine (PrHCT) for which the silencing in cell cultures results in reduction of lignin content (<xref rid="pcw016-B54" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al. 2007</xref>). Moreover, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis using biochemically characterized hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA-dependent BAHD transferases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>) and confirmed that AtHCT, PtHCT6, PvHCT2a and PrHCT belong to the same clade along with other characterized HCTs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). In order to include a HCT from a lycophyte, we searched the <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> genome for the presence of putative HCT homologs using AtHCT as bait. Five sequences were retrieved by selecting proteins whose sequence share at least 35% identity with that of AtHCT, and two of which, SmHCT1a and SmHCT1b (60% and 61% identical to AtHCT, respectively), fall into the &#x02018;HCT clade&#x02019; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>). These two proteins (98% identical) are products of allelic variants of the same gene, and SmHCT1a was selected for further characterization. Similarly, the genome of the bryophyte <italic>P. patens</italic> was analyzed for the identification of putative HCT homologs using AtHCT as bait. Out of the seven sequences retrieved (using a protein sequence identity cut-off of 30%), one protein (PpHCT1) falls into the &#x02018;HCT clade&#x02019; and was selected for this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Screening of HCT substrate promiscuity using a yeast heterologous expression system</title><p>AtHCT, PtHCT6, PvHCT2a and PrHCT, as well as putative HCTs from <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> (SmHCT1a) and <italic>P. patens</italic> (PpHCT1), were individually co-expressed with Arabidopsis 4-coumarate-CoA ligase 5 (4CL5) in yeast to investigate their substrate affinity toward various acceptors. In these in vivo assays, the different recombinant yeast strains were fed individually with <italic>p</italic>-coumarate in combination with shikimate (as a positive control) or one of the potential phenolic acceptors listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link>.

Subsequently, we performed liquid chromatography&#x02013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the yeast culture medium for the detection of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl conjugates produced by the different HCTs. Out of 20 phenolics tested, the analysis indicated that all six HCTs produced <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl conjugates in the presence of shikimate, 3-hydroxybenzoate, gentisate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, protocatechuate, 3-aminobenzoate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate, 5-hydroxyanthranilate, catechol and hydroquinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcw016-F2">Fig. 2</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S3</ext-link>). None of these products was found in the culture medium of a control yeast strain expressing 4CL5 alone and fed with <italic>p</italic>-coumarate and the corresponding acceptors. For these yeast-feeding assays, the limited control of enzyme expression, substrate penetrability and secretion of products does not allow direct comparisons of activities between the different HCTs and the various acceptors tested.

Substrate saturation curves using shikimate or the non-canonical acceptors were attempted to determine the affinity of PvHCT2a for these different substrates. Apparent substrate saturation of the enzyme could be achieved only in the case of shikimate, 3-hydroxyanthranilate and protocatechuate; double reciprocal plots indicated <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of 699 &#x000b5;M, 830 &#x000b5;M and 1.48 mM, respectively, for these three acceptors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7</ext-link>). For the other acceptors, the lack of enzyme saturation at high concentrations indicates higher <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values and much lower affinity of PvHCT2a for these substrates compared with shikimate (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S7</ext-link>).</p><p>Because HCT acylates non-canonical acceptors in the presence of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA, we tested the influence of these potential competitive inhibitors on the formation of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate catalyzed by PvHCT2a in vitro. We observed that <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate synthesis was reduced in reactions containing <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA and an equimolar amount of shikimate and the non-canonical acceptors, in comparison with control reactions containing only <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA and shikimate. In particular, inhibitions of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate synthesis ranged from 11% to 48%, depending on the acceptors present, and were stronger at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcw016-F3">Fig. 3</xref>).

Although PpHCT1 falls into the clade of known HCTs in the phylogenetic tree of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA-dependent BAHD transferases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pcp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/pcp/pcw016/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1)</ext-link>, it may instead be involved in the synthesis of alternative phenylpropanoid conjugates such as chlorogenic acid (3-<italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid) which has been identified in <italic>P. patens</italic> (<xref rid="pcw016-B19" ref-type="bibr">Erxleben et al. 2012</xref>).

Both ester and amide linkages are possible for the formation of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl 3-hydroxyanthranilate and <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl 5-hydroxyanthranilate, but only one product was observed in our assays when these acceptors were tested. For these two cases, an amide bond can be anticipated, as previously determined for the <italic>p</italic>-coumarate conjugate formed by CcHCT using 3-hydroxyanthranilate (<xref rid="pcw016-B37" ref-type="bibr">Moglia et al. 2010</xref>). In this work, the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value observed for PvHCT2a towards shikimate (&#x0223c;700 &#x000b5;M) is comparable with the values observed for tobacco HCT (750 &#x000b5;M), which has been genetically implicated in lignin biosynthesis (<xref rid="pcw016-B26" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. 2003</xref>), and for poplar HCT (895 &#x000b5;M; <xref rid="pcw016-B28" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. 2011</xref>), but higher than the values reported for HCT from coffee (75 &#x000b5;M; <xref rid="pcw016-B29" ref-type="bibr">Lallemand et al. 2012</xref>), sorghum (153 &#x000b5;M; <xref rid="pcw016-B55" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al. 2013</xref>) and <italic>Coleus blumei</italic> (332 &#x000b5;M; <xref rid="pcw016-B42" ref-type="bibr">Sander and Petersen 2011</xref>). The slightly different structure of the new HCT acceptors described in this study could influence their binding to the active site of the enzyme and explain the higher apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values of HCT for these substrates compared with shikimate.</p><p>The catalytic mechanism of HCT has been elegantly described previously by <xref rid="pcw016-B55" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al. (2013)</xref>. In their mutagenesis experiments using shikimate as a substrate, the mutant T384A-SbHCT (equivalent to Thr382 in PvHCT2a) showed only 9% of the enzyme activity compared with wild-type SbHCT (<xref rid="pcw016-B55" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al. 2013</xref>). We therefore propose that the loss of the C5 hydroxyl interaction with Thr382 in the PvHCT2a&#x02013;<italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA&#x02013;protocatechuate complex affected the effective binding of protocatechuate, thus engendering a similar effect to the T384A mutation in SbHCT on the turnover rate of the substrate. This is most probably the reason why it was possible to capture crystallographically the substrate PvHCT2a&#x02013;<italic>p</italic>-coumaryl-CoA&#x02013;protocatechuate ternary complex, compared with the product state when shikimate was used in soaking experiments.</p><p>Our goal was to use the substrate promiscuity of HCT to reduce lignin. In this attempt, we generated Arabidopsis lines that overproduce protocatechuate, a non-canonical acceptor and competitive inhibitor of HCT in vitro. The engineered plants accumulate approximatey 25-fold more protocatechuate than wild-type plants, and showed significant lignin reductions (31&#x02013;37%) in biomass. Interestingly, transgenic lines expressing the <italic>pobA</italic> gene alone accumulated approximately 1.8-fold more protocatechuate than wild-type plants presumably from the conversion of the endogenous pool of <italic>p-</italic>hydroxybenzoate but showed no reduction of lignin content, suggesting that a threshold amount of protocatechuate is necessary to inhibit significantly HCT activity in vivo. Since lignin is reduced in the protocatechuate-overproducing plants, either the amount of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl protocatechuate produced by HCT is too low to sustain lignin biosynthesis, or <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl protocatechuate is not metabolized further in the lignin biosynthetic pathway. In particular, it is not known whether C3&#x02032;H can hydroxylate <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl protocatechuate, and whether CSE would cleave the putative resulting <italic>p</italic>-caffeoyl protocatechuate. Neither <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl protocatechuate nor putative <italic>p</italic>-caffeoyl protocatechuate were detected in the metabolite extracts from <italic>ubiC-pobA</italic> transgenic plants, possibly because of their conjugation to other metabolites such as sugars, as was recently shown for other lignin oligomers (<xref rid="pcw016-B12" ref-type="bibr">Dima et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our dual transgene strategy consists of a two-step conversion of chorismate into protocatechuate. Steady-state levels of phenylalanine and salicylate, two metabolites derived from chorismate, are not significantly changed in the <italic>ubiC</italic>, <italic>pobA</italic> and <italic>ubiC-pobA</italic> transgenics compared with the wild type, suggesting that chorismate is not limiting in these lines, as previously hypothesized in the case of tobacco plants that express <italic>ubiC</italic> and show normal growth characteristics (<xref rid="pcw016-B46" ref-type="bibr">Siebert et al. 1996</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B53" ref-type="bibr">Viitanen et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore, the reduction of lignin observed only in the <italic>ubiC-pobA</italic> lines (and not in the <italic>ubiC</italic> single lines) is unlikely to be the consequence of phenylalanine depletion, although our data cannot rule out a possible slowing down of the metabolic flux. In addition, the height reduction observed in the <italic>ubiC-pobA</italic> lines at the mature stage is probably a consequence of lignin reduction rather than drastic changes in levels of salicylic acid, a metabolite whose overaccumulation in some transgenic plants often results in dwarf phenotypes (<xref rid="pcw016-B40" ref-type="bibr">Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia 2011</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to previous studies of plants in which HCT activity was down-regulated, the lignin composition of our transgenic lines does not show any enrichment in H units, possibly due to a lower degree of inhibition of activity and the consumption of <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-CoA by HCT for the formation of both <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl protocatechuate and <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl shikimate. Nevertheless, the increase of the S:G ratio in our transgenics, which results from the decrease of G units in favor of an increase in S units, is a lignin feature predicted by metabolic flux analysis in the case of HCT down-regulation, and was previously observed in plants affected in HCT activity (<xref rid="pcw016-B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Dixon 2007</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B62" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B50" ref-type="bibr">Vanholme et al, 2013b</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B56" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2014</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B18" ref-type="bibr">Eudes et al. 2015</xref>).

For example, plant lines could be engineered to express anthranilate 3-hydroxylase, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate synthase/dehydrogenase, salicylate 5-hydroxylases, 3-aminobenzoate synthase or 3-hydroxybenzoate synthase for the accumulation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 3-aminobenzoate or 3-hydroxybenzoate respectively, using the metabolites anthranilate, isochorismate, salicylate, 3-dehydroshikimate and chorismate as substrates (<xref rid="pcw016-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gehring et al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B33" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B1" ref-type="bibr">Andexer et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B24" ref-type="bibr">Hirayama et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B61" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2013</xref>, <xref rid="pcw016-B20" ref-type="bibr">Fang and Zhou 2014</xref>). It is interesting to note that very low amounts of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoates could be detected in our metabolite extracts from wild-type plants (&#x0223c;10 nmol g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> FW), whereas hydroxyanthranilates, 3-hydroxybenzoate and 3-aminobenzoate were below the detection limit, and, to our knowledge, have never been measured in plant extracts.

It is unclear why such promiscuity has been retained, and this question will require further study. However, a strategy of exploiting this substrate promiscuity of HCT offers a novel way to reduce lignin in plants. Because this enzymatic activity appears to be conserved among land plants, this strategy can be valuable to affect HCT activity in bioenergy crops for which no HCT gene has been cloned or for which multiple, functionally redundant copies are present. In this respect, particular attention should be paid to the spatio-temporal activity of the transgene promoters employed for the overproduction of HCT alternative substrates to limit possible growth defects associated with lignin reduction as observed in this study using Arabidopsis. Lastly, as we show here in the case of protocatechuate overproduction, such an approach has the potential to add value to plant biomass by increasing the amount of valuable metabolites utilized in the bio-based chemical industry (<xref rid="pcw016-B32" ref-type="bibr">Linger et al. 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of HCTs and activity assays using yeast</title><p>For the cloning of AtHCT and PpHCT1, total RNA (1 &#x000b5;g) from <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedlings and total RNA (5 &#x000b5;g) from <italic>P. patens</italic> protonemal tissue were extracted using the Plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science).

For extraction of methanol-soluble metabolites, 200&#x02013;300 mg of frozen stem powder was mixed with 1 ml of 80% (v/v) methanol&#x02013;water and shaken at 1,400 r.p.m. for 15 min at 70 &#x000b0;C.

Phenylalanine was quantified in the filtered extracts using HPLC-ESI-TOF MS analysis. For measurement of 4-hydroxybenzoate, protocatechuate and salicylic acid, an aliquot of the filtered extracts was dried under vacuum, resuspended with 1 N HCl and incubated at 95 &#x000b0;C for 3 h. The mixture was subjected to three ethyl acetate partitioning steps.
