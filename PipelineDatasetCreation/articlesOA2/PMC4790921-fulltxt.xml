It is frequently detected in lung samples suggesting some pathological role of the virus in diseases. To study this possibility an indirect ELISA was developed to detect PPV2 specific antibodies and to examine the serological profile of an infected swine herd where 185 serum samples collected from different age groups including sows were analyzed. According to the results maternal antibody levels decreased until 14 days of age and PPV2 specific antibodies started to rise between 28 to 43 days of age when respiratory signs were also observed in the examined swine herd. At 57 days of age the clinical signs disappeared and a rapid increase of PPV2 specific antibody levels could be measured simultaneously, peaking at 57 days of age. The viraemic status of different age groups was determined by qPCR using serum samples. At least a low level of viraemia was measured in every age group, but higher copy number of PPV2 was only detected at 57 days of age and the level decreased in older age groups. The changes in virus load and antibody levels together with the onset and decrease of clinical signs suggested that PPV2 had a role in the development of respiratory signs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Research was funded by OTKA PD 100405, KK-UK 2014, KTIA-AIK and 9877-3/2015/FEKUT grants of the Hungarian Government.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of molecular biology based detection methods led to the discovery of several new viruses among them a new parvovirus of pigs, namely porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV2) [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Parvoviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded, linear DNA genomes of approximately 5&#x02013;6 kilobases (kb). According to the current taxonomic classification (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp">http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp</ext-link>) <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> family is divided into two subfamilies: <italic>Densovirinae</italic> and <italic>Parvovirinae</italic>. Members of <italic>Densovirinae</italic> infect various arthropods, while viruses belonging to the <italic>Parvovirinae</italic> subfamily are detected in vertebrates and form eight distinct genera, including Tetraparvovirus.</p><p>PPV2 (proposed name Ungulate tetraparvovirus 3), a member of the Tetraparvovirus genus, was discovered in 2001 during a survey for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in swine sera collected in Myanmar [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The HEV-specific primers non-specifically amplified a DNA fragment, which later proved to be of parvovirus origin. The amplification of nearly complete genetic material of the virus resulted a 5 kb long genome (H-1 virus, Myanmar-type PPV2), showing the highest similarity to Muscovy duck parvovirus and Bovine parvovirus 3 [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The occurrence of PPV2 appeared to be unique until many years later a genetically highly similar virus (Cnvirus) was detected in China [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in blood samples collected between 2006&#x02013;2007 from pigs affected by porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) associated disease (PCVAD) and "high fever" disease (caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, PRRSV). Genetic comparison of H-1 (Myanmar) and Cnvirus revealed approximately 95% identity [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further studies indicated that PPV2 was presumably present worldwide as it was detected not only in Asia but also in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and North America [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The report by Opriessnig et al. [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] showed that PCVAD affected pigs were infected with PPV2 with high prevalence and suggested a role of the virus as co-factor also in the porcine respiratory disease complex. Attempts to propagate the virus <italic>in vitro</italic> failed so far therefore animal experiments to fulfill Koch's postulates and to study the pathogenicity of PPV2 are not yet possible. In order to assess the possible pathogenic role of PPV2 without the use of animal experiments it is necessary to develop diagnostic methods for the <italic>in situ</italic> detection of the virus in tissue environment and also to detect and monitor the antibody response to PPV2 in context with the appearance of clinical signs.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop an ELISA method suitable for the detection of PPV2 specific antibodies. Using this method we measured the specific humoral immune response against PPV2 in an infected swine herd and compared the antibody levels with the presence of the virus in serum samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the Szent Istv&#x000e1;n University and with EU Directive 2010/63/EU.

Based on the results, one PPV2 (GenBank code: KP765690) positive swine herd with 1600 sows producing 35000 pigs a year, was selected and examined further. All of the production phase was on the same farm, following the all in all out system. The examined herd was a farrow to finish herd where weaning was practiced at 4 weeks after farrowing when the piglets were transferred to the nursery units. In nursery units, there were two rooms per barns and 42 batteries in each rooms. Ten pigs were placed in each battery. At 55 days of age, pigs were delivered to the fattening units and remained there until slaughter weight was reached. There were two rooms per barns in fattening units, too, where 550 pigs were placed in 28 pens in each rooms. The herd is infected with swine influenza virus (SIV) and PCV2, but free from PRRSV and Pseudorabies virus. The pigs are vaccinated against PCV2 (3 weeks of age) and <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</italic> (4 weeks of age), the sows against porcine parvovirus 1 (PPV1, Ungulate protoparvovirus 1), PCV2, erysipelas and <italic>Eserichia coli</italic> enterotoxemia. According to the herd veterinarian coughing, sneezing, conjunctivitis, fever and decrease of appetite was observed at 2 to 3 weeks after weaning. These signs were typically observed in several consecutive cohorts on the farm over a 1.5 year period.</p><p>Altogether 185 serum samples from different age groups were collected in this herd, by supplying veterinarian.

Briefly, one colony of plasmid-containing cells was cultured overnight (37&#x000b0;C) in 5ml LB Medium (containing 100&#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin, Fluka). The overnight cultured cells were grown for one hour in 100 ml fresh, pre-warmed (37&#x000b0;C) LB Medium (containing 100&#x003bc;g/ml ampicillin) after which one ml of 20% L-Arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to induce gene expression. The induced cells were incubated for 4 hours, harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until purification.

Clarification of the pathogenic role of the new parvoviruses including PPV2 is still pending mainly due to the lack of reliable <italic>in vitro</italic> virus propagation techniques for experimental infections. Swine herds are frequently infected not only with PPV2 but simultaneously also with one or more other pathogens like PCV2, PRRSV, SIV, <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> and other microorganisms that hinder or make very difficult to clarify the pathogenicity of PPV2. Fortunately <italic>in situ</italic> detection methods and serological techniques at least in part may be of help to determine the importance of a PPV2 infection. In this study, we developed a serological method to examine the specific humoral immune response against PPV2 and determined the PPV2 specific antibody profile of on affected swine herd. The potential GH loop of capsid proteins of both Myanmar-type and Cnvirus-type viruses were chosen because the GH loop forms a large part of the parvoviral capsid surface around the threefold axis. Several important functions are localized in this region in different parvoviruses including tissue tropism, pathogenicity determining amino acids and most importantly antibody binding sites [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to our best knowledge, this is the first description of serological examination of this virus infection. Based on our results, the piglets suckling colostrum from their PPV2 positive sows and absorbing high amounts of specific antibodies have very good passive, maternal protection. On the second day of life PPV2 specific maternal antibody level is higher in piglets than in their corresponding mothers, but this protection decreases rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151036.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The increase of PPV2 specific antibody level starts after 28&#x02013;36 days of age and calculating with the usual 7 to 10 days required for the primary immune response of B lymphocytes the estimated time of infection is suggested to be earlier than or between 21&#x02013;36 days of age. In the examined swine herd, respiratory signs were observed 2 to 3 weeks after weaning (around 42&#x02013;49 days of age) and the animals recovered, by 57 days of age these clinical signs disappeared. Along with this, after 43 days of age a rapid rise of PPV2 specific antibody levels could be observed, resulting high amounts of antibodies in the 57 days old group. The serum samples were also tested for PCV2 and SIV specific antibodies (data not shown), but the rise of PCV2 specific antibodies was observed only after 120 days of age and increase of SIV specific antibodies was not detected in pigs before, at and over 57 days of age. The examined swine herd was free of PRRSV, and the bacteriological examinations for common respiratory pathogens were also negative. These data suggest that PPV2 may have played a role in the development of the respiratory signs around 40&#x02013;50 days of age. This assumption is supported by the frequent detection of PPV2 in pigs exhibiting respiratory diseases. In a previous study in Hungary 10.5% of the examined lung samples were positive for PPV2 [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In a Japanese swine herd, all of the 69 examined tonsil samples, collected from unhealthy 8 to 900 days old pigs were PPV2 positive [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the USA the highest levels of PPV2 nucleic acid were present in lung samples originating from nursery and grow-finish pigs with a history of respiratory disease [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], covering the age of pigs where the respiratory clinical signs and PPV2 specific antibody rise were detected in our study. Based on a retrospective study PPV2 was present with high prevalence in archived North American lung samples from 1998 not only in PCVAD affected (33.3&#x02013;55.6%) but also in PCV2 negative pigs (20%) [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The detection rate of viraemia in samples collected between 2006 and 2013 in North America was 27.3&#x02013;41.4% in PCV2 positive and 33.3% in PCV2 negative sera [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previously in China, PPV2 was identified in 9.66% of serum samples of PCV2 and PRRSV caused disease affected pigs 3 weeks prior the disease onset [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similarly in the USA the peak of PPV2 viraemia was detected at 15 weeks of age, 2 weeks before the development of PCVAD [<xref rid="pone.0151036.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In our study, low level of viraemia was detectable in every age group, but the peak was measured in 57 days old pigs (<xref rid="pone.0151036.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), earlier than in previous studies. It is likely that the antibodies produced by this age in increasing quantity and quality started to eliminate PPV2 from the blood stream. After the initial IgM antibody production the immune response normally produces IgG antibodies of increasing affinity and larger quantity. The more specific antibodies produced in later phase of the immune response showed stronger reaction with the homologous Myanmar-type antigen then the heterologous Cnvirus-type antigen as confirmed by the statistical analysis (<xref rid="pone.0151036.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and shown by the ELISA results obtained for different age groups. This relatively small difference however did not influence the usability of the heterologous antigen in the serological diagnostic test.</p><p>Taking into account the few studies about PPV2 the results of this study suggest a pathological role of PPV2 in respiratory disease of pigs, but to clarify the importance of this virus further, well designed studies including experimental infections are needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PPV2 is the most frequently detected emerging porcine parvovirus, usually present in the background of respiratory diseases.

The results and the few available studies on PPV2 suggest a possible pathological role of this virus in respiratory diseases of pigs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151036.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Sampling protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151036.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151036.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Detailed ELISA results.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151036.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Research was funded by OTKA PD 100405, KK-UK 2014, KTIA-AIK and 9877-3/2015/FEKUT grants of the Hungarian Government.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0151036.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hijikata</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Abe</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Win</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Shimizu</surname><given-names>YK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Keicho</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yoshikura</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>. <article-title>Identification of new parvovirus DNA sequence in swine sera from Myanmar.
