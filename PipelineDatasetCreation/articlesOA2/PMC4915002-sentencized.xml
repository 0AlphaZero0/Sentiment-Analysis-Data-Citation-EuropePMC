<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Primary structure analysis predicts MtrC, MtrD and MtrE as integral membrane proteins with at least six transmembrane helices, MtrA, MtrB, MtrF and MtrG as peripheral proteins with one transmembrane helix anchor, and MtrH as a peripheral protein without a membrane anchor156. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The only prosthetic group required for catalysis is vitamin B12 (cobalamin) bound to MtrA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to a previous electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis analyses7891011, cobalt of the corrinoid in the inactive Co(II) state is axially coordinated by a histidine (His84 of MtrA from Methanothermobacter marburgensis) imidazolium group (base-off/His-on configuration) rather than by the dimethylbenzimidazole base as a fifth ligand91011. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This finding points towards the participation of the demethylation reaction in sodium-ion translocation12, which is probably localized on MtrE as it contains a characteristic aspartate in the transmembrane helix15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Based on the intensively studied coordination and redox chemistry of cobalamins, the histidine ligand is not coordinated to cobalt in the reduced non-methylated cob(I)alamin form (base-off/His-off), which is in contrast to the methylated cob(III)alamin form (base-off/His-on)1813. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it has been proposed that the dissociation of the His ligand during formation of cob(I)alamin from methyl-cob(III)alamin induces conformational rearrangements of parts of MtrA1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These cytoplasmic MtrA homologues consist only of a soluble cobalamin-binding domain of 170–180 amino acids, which is in contrast to the approximately 250 amino acids of membrane-associated MtrA. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The use of the cytoplasmic MtrA homologues as models for MtrA in order to increase the crystallization space is justified because of the high sequence identity, e.g. 97% between membrane-associated MtrA and the MtrA homologue of M. fervidus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Because of the stability of bound B12, we used the MtrA homologue of M. fervidus and the genetically truncated MtrA of M. jannaschii (see Materials and methods). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Phases were determined by using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method with cobalt as the anomalous scatterer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The structure revealed three cytoplasmic MtrA molecules in an asymmetric unit arranged as a homotrimer with a three-fold symmetry (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The trimer was mainly linked together by a covalent bond between the cobalt of cobalamin of one molecule and His35 of its neighbour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Cytoplasmic MtrA in complex with methyl-cobalamin did not crystallize under these conditions; the methyl group bound to cobalamin may prevent the coordination between cobalt and His35 of the neighbouring molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The occupancy of the upper axial ligation site by a histidine is presumably not physiologically relevant because the enzyme needs to switch from Co(I) to CH3-Co(III) during the reaction1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The absence of a significant contact area between the subunits is in line with this assumption (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>We therefore partially digested reconstituted MtrA with trypsin to remove this region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the cobalamin content decreased to less than 50%, which suggested a role of the juxtamembrane segment in stabilizing the prosthetic group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The proteolysis product of MtrA yielded colourless cobalamin-free crystals that diffracted to 1.85 Å resolution (Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the model of cytoplasmic MtrA homologue as a search template. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The overall structures of the two MtrA variants were almost identical (Fig. 3), which was reflected by a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.37 Å for a 127 Cα backbone and a sequence identity of 65%. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The two MtrA variants studied here consist of a single domain with a Rossmann-like open α/β fold (Fig. 4a) that, except for dioldehydratases2324, ribonucleotide reductases27 and reductive dehalogenases22, is characteristic of B12 enzymes (such as the cobalamin-containing fragment of methionine synthase from E. coli, MetH, shown in Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Although they share a common core topology motif β2α1β1α2β3α3β4α4 (Fig. 4), the β-sheet–α-helix arrangements, strand twisting and secondary structure linkers drastically vary between MtrA and other Rossmann-type B12 domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In fact, MtrA is structurally more related to the functionally distinct pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDB code: 1ik6) or succinyl-CoA synthetase (PDB code: 1euc) domains than to any B12 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The Z-scores28 of the superimposed structures of MtrA and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDB code: 1ik6) and succinyl-CoA synthase (PDB code: 1euc) are 8.4 and 8.1; the Z-scores of MtrA and the most related B12 domains of methionine synthase (1bmt) and methanol cobalamin methyltransferase (2i2x) are 4.5 and 5.5, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The B12-binding protein, which has the highest Z-score (5.6) to MtrA, is monomethylamine corrinoid protein from M. barkeri (3ezx). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>In MtrA, the core motif is extended by an N-terminally fused segment that is partly associated as an antiparallel β-strand (β0) to the central β-sheet and an expanded insertion region between helix α3 and strand β4 consisting of a unique meander-like segment and an α-helix (α3′). β0 and the unique meander-like segment are involved in cobalamin binding (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>The B12 domains of the corrinoid iron-sulphur proteins also contain an extra N-terminal antiparallel strand, whereas those of methanol cobalamin methyltransferase, methionine synthetase (MetH) and mutases are alternatively extended at the C-terminal end of the shared core by one strand (β5) and one helix (α5) (Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal stretch (amino acids 156–170) of truncated MtrA from M. jannaschii, which is classified as part of the juxtamembrane segment, turns back from helix α4 towards the C-terminal side of the central β-sheet (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>This chain trace does not appear to be due to crystal lattice effects because several salt bridges and hydrophobic contacts between this stretch and the core domain were formed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The remaining 40–50 residues of the juxtamembrane segment appear to be flexible, at least in the truncated form because of the accessibility of this segment for proteolytic cleavage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A flexible connection of the B12 domain to the transmembrane helix is functionally useful for juggling between the methyl donor and acceptor in analogy to methionine synthetase25, corrinoid iron-sulphur protein methyltransferase18 and methanol-corrinoid methyltransferase17, although parts of the juxtamembrane segment might be attached to other subunits of the MtrA–H complex. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, several functionally characteristic features were designed in an equivalent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>They include an exposed corrinoid ring at the top of loops at the C-terminal side of the central β-sheet, an elongated conformation of cobalamin with the nucleotide tail between the β-sheet–α-helix layer, albeit on opposite sides, and a His-Glu-proton donor linkage on the lower axial side of the corrinoid ring. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The structure of cytoplasmic MtrA complexed with cobalamin and the structure of the soluble domain of MtrA without cobalamin were essentially identical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>This finding suggested that the MtrA structures observed in this work were relaxed forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The possible repellent effect of cob(I)alamin towards the histidine residue probably causes a conformational change in the MtrA protein structure (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
