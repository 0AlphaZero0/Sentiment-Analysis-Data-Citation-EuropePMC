<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases are decreased levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)3 and elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In plasma, cholesteryl ester transfer proteins (CETPs) transfer cholesteryl esters (CEs) from high density lipoprotein (HDL) to low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Human plasma CETP is a 476-amino acid hydrophobic glycoprotein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Genetic deficiency of CETP increases HDL-C levels and decreases LDL cholesterol levels (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>As a result, CETP has become a promising drug target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To date, four synthetic CETP inhibitors, torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, anacetrapib, and evacetrapib, have been evaluated in Phase III clinical studies in the past decade (7–10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The clinical data have shown that all CETP inhibitors elevate HDL-C levels, and nearly all CETP inhibitors decrease LDL cholesterol levels (7–10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although anacetrapib is still being tested in clinical studies, the failures of torcetrapib (due to off-target effects) (7) and dalcetrapib and evacetrapib (due to their unexpected low efficacy) (8, 11) highlight that the detailed mechanism underlying the CETP-mediated transfer of CE molecules between HDL and LDL/VLDL needs to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Three hypotheses of the CETP mechanism have been proposed: a shuttle mechanism in which CETP collects CEs from HDL and then delivers them through the aqueous environment to LDL/VLDL (12); a ternary complex mechanism in which CETP simultaneously interacts with HDL and LDL/VLDL, thus forming a ternary complex that induces CE transfer from HDL to LDL/VLDL (13); and a modified ternary complex mechanism that implicates a CETP dimer instead of a monomer (14). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of CETP revealed a banana-shaped molecule composed of N- and C-terminal β-barrel domains, a central β-sheet, and an ∼60-Å-long hydrophobic central cavity (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Two pores near the central β-sheet domain occupied by two phospholipid molecules have been suspected to be the gates between which the central cavity would interact with the aqueous environment or lipoproteins, thus favoring the shuttle mechanism (15). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies on the kinetics of the plasma protein-catalyzed exchange of phosphatidylcholine and CE between plasma LDL and HDL have suggested that the exchange occurs by a sequential mechanism involving an HDL-CETP-LDL ternary complex (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Recent electron microscopy (EM) studies have shown the presence of a ternary complex among CETP, HDL, and LDL/VLDL (16) in which the CETP N-terminal distal end interacts with HDL via a hydrophobic interaction (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Independently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have revealed that the CETP distal ends are structurally flexible (18), and the N-terminal end penetrates into the HDL surface and takes up a CE molecule (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A tunnel mechanism has been proposed because the CETP crystal structure displays a long hydrophobic central cavity containing two CE molecules (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Here, we used all-atom MD simulations to evaluate the tunnel mechanism by testing whether a long tunnel could be formed and is large enough to allow CE to pass through the entire CETP molecule. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In the tunnel mechanism, CETP interacts with HDL and LDL simultaneously and forms a ternary complex (see Fig. 1, A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>EM experiments have suggested that the flexible N-terminal β-barrel domain of CETP penetrates into the phospholipid monolayer on the HDL surface via hydrophobic interactions (16, 17) and that the distal end reaches the HDL CE-rich pool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, the flexible C-terminal β-barrel domain penetrates into the phospholipid monolayer of the LDL surface and interacts with the inner LDL triglyceride (TG)-rich pool (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>To test whether the ternary complex could form a tunnel within CETP that allows a CE molecule to transfer through the entire CETP molecule, we constructed an MD simulation system to match the observed EM ternary complex as closely as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this system, a CETP molecule was embedded into an aqueous environment with its two distal β-barrel domain ends penetrating into the two opposite phospholipid monolayers that envelop the CE and TG pools (Fig. 1, C and D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>After releasing all constraints, the system was subjected to 40-ns MD simulations at 310 K and 1 atm with NAMD2 software to achieve equilibration (27). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Given that the CE transfer from HDL to LDL is on an approximately second time scale, a driving force was used to detect the transfer pathway within a practical time period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>A CE located near but not directly contacting the distal end of the N-terminal β-barrel domain (the minimum distance between CE and CETP was more than 2.4 Å, the diameter of the hydrogen van der Waals surface) was selected as a representative molecule to probe the CE transfer pathway within the equilibrated CETP after the CEs and phospholipids it contained were removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>A step-by-step method for pathway searching was conducted as described below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>When the selected CE molecule was pulled toward the center of a “pore” located in the distal end of the CETP N-terminal β-barrel domain under an example force of 8 kcal/mol/Å (applied onto the CE acyl chain end), the pore became larger (∼7 Å in diameter) and deeper (calculated by the MOLE 2.0 program (33)). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Because the time required to transfer a CE molecule from HDL to LDL is on an approximately second time scale (described under “Experimental Procedures”), all-atom simulations on such a large simulation system for nearly a second are quite challenging for the current advanced supercomputers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Although some coarse grain and implicit model methods can speed up the simulation by simplifying a group of atoms as one united bead or the solvent/lipid as a continuous medium and are highly successful in simulating protein dynamics, modeling, design, and prediction (37, 38), this simplification may also reduce the accuracy of the simulation and distort the protein structure. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Our intermediate solution was to introduce a driving force on the transferred CE molecule to speed up the CE transfer process on the basis of the following reasons. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The hydrophobicity analysis showed that the entire tunnel/pathway is relatively hydrophobic (Fig. 6C), thus providing the condition required for CE transfer through CETP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The geometric analysis showed that the tunnel diameter near the central region was only ∼6.0 ± 0.6 Å. This narrow region (called the “neck” of the tunnel in the crystal structure (15)) is similar to or slightly larger than the width of a CE molecule (∼6 Å wide and ∼4 Å thick (15)), thus suggesting that it may be possible to transfer an entire CE molecule through this region (Fig. 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>We found that the residues surrounding this narrow region (within ∼10-Å distance range), including Ile15, Leu23, Ala202, Ile205, Leu206, Phe263, Phe265, and Met433 (Fig. 6D, central panel), participated in physical contacts with the CE molecule (distance within 2.4 Å, the diameter of a hydrogen van der Waals surface), which might contribute to this local high energy barrier. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In addition to the above energy barrier, a low energy well was observed within both the N-terminal and C-terminal β-barrel domains (Fig. 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The Phe115, Arg158, and Phe167 residues contributed the greatest energy to the N-terminal energy well (Fig. 6D, left panel), which may attract CE molecules from the CE pool into the CETP tunnel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The Phe301 and Met412 residues contributed the greatest energy to the C-terminal energy well (Fig. 6D, right panel), which may orient or facilitate the rotation of the CE steroid ring to allow exit from the C-terminal pore (Fig. 5A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Because the residues identified above can form physical contacts or strong interactions with the transferred CE, mutation of these residues may change their contacts or interactions with CE, thus affecting the CE transfer rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments have shown that mutating the Ile15 and Met433 at the CETP central narrow region to the bulky residue tryptophan (i.e. I15W and M433W) and the F301D mutation at the C-terminal distal end decreases CETP transfer activities by ∼60, ∼40, and ∼20%, respectively (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>For the other identified residues, there have been no reported results from mutational experiments to the best of our knowledge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Additional mutational analyses of these residues are needed to further verify the tunnel transfer mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Notably, the mutations of several residues, such as L468Q (48), T138Y, and L457W (15), have shown effects on CE transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>However, those residues were not identified in our energy and physical interaction analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The failure to identify these residues may be because only the mutated residues may form direct interactions with the transferred CE, or their mutation may generate a secondary effect on other nearby residues that interact with the transferred CE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>CE Transfer Mechanisms </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Our previous EM studies have demonstrated the existence of a ternary complex of HDL-CETP-LDL/VLDL (16), suggesting a tunnel mechanism for CETP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The simulations indicated that it is possible for a hydrophobic CE molecule to transfer through an entire CETP via a continuous hydrophobic tunnel between the two distal ends of CETP (Fig. 6E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>This tunnel might facilitate CE uptake into the tunnel without using energy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Upon entering the tunnel, hydrophobic interactions among the CE fatty tails and residues Phe115 and Phe167 may mediate the penetration of the CE molecule further into the tunnel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>During subsequent penetration of the hydrophobic CE molecule through this hydrophobic tunnel, a narrow region might act as a rate-limiting site, leading to a prominent energy barrier for CE transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The internal pressure difference between HDL and LDL might provide the additional energy required for CE to pass through this energy barrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Upon passing through this region, no further major energy barrier would prevent the exit of CE from the C-terminal opening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Residues Phe301 and Met412 may even assist the exit of CE by facilitating the rotation of the CE steroid ring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This observed CE flow from HDL to LDL requires no external energy input, thus suggesting that CE may transfer through the CETP tunnel by diffusion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>The prominent interaction energy barrier for CE transfer through CETP is ∼21 kcal/mol (Fig. 6B) (estimated under a driving force of 11 kcal/mol/Å and transfer time of ∼0.5 ns and without including entropy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>To understand this barrier, we estimated the energy barrier for CE transfer into an aqueous phase through a lipid monolayer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that the peak free energy barrier is ∼140 kJ/mol (i.e. ∼33.5 kcal/mol) for transfer of a cholesteryl oleate through a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid monolayer into an aqueous phase (49, 50) in which the interaction energy (without including the entropy) has been estimated to be ∼28.6 kcal/mol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This energy barrier is higher than our energy barrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because the transfer time (under a driving force of 11 kcal/mol/Å) is 109–1010 times faster than the transfer time measured experimentally (approximately seconds) (34, 35), the energy barrier under the experimental transfer time should be even much lower than ∼21 kcal/mol, thus suggesting that it would be even easier for the CE molecule to transfer through the CETP molecule than through the lipid monolayer into an aqueous phase. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Although the tunnel model was favored by our test, some other experiments have not favored this model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>For example, by incubating small peptides of the CETP C terminus with HDL (49), small micelle-like structures have been generated through secondary structure disorder-to-order transitions of these small peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>The authors of this previous study have proposed a small micelle-like structure transfer model in which those micelle-like structures mediated CE transfer from HDL to LDL/VLDL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In this proposed model, the authors have not explained how those micelle-like particles, which contain no protein, could function to sense, target, and bind to LDL/VLDL (instead of HDL, other plasma vesicles, and cells in plasma) for directional CE transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these micelle-like structures have not been observed after incubation of full-length CETP with HDL (16, 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>A recent, independent EM study has concluded that CE transfer does not require a ternary tunnel complex with CETP according to negative evidence, i.e. the lack of an observation showing the existence of the CETP-LDL complex or the HDL-CETP-LDL complex (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>The weakness of the logic in this study is that this failure to observe the complex has been used as evidence of its non-existence instead of being used as non-supporting evidence. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Although our simulations support the possibility of CE transfer through the CETP tunnel, a study directly observing the CE molecule transfer process or more convincing experiments are still necessary to validate this mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>An indirect validation study could be designed by using new CETP inhibitors to target the CETP hydrophobic tunnel, particularly the narrow central region and distal end pore regions, to introduce energy barriers for CE passage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Our insights into the CE transfer pathway through CETP may provide important clues for the design of new CETP inhibitors to efficiently treat cardiovascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
