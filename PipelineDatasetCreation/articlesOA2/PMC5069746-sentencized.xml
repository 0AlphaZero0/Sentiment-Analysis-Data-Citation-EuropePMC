</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The omics field is expanding rapidly, driven by the plummeting cost of DNA sequencing, the widespread availability of DNA sequencers and mass spectrometers, and the seemingly unlimited breadth of its applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, generating, processing, analyzing, and interpreting the data typically takes months and requires substantial technical expertise in large multidisciplinary teams, in part, due to the rapidly evolving nature of the component techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The speed of mass spectrometry and nucleic acid sequencing (the tools required to generate omics data) has increased rapidly in the last decade, and they have separately been applied to clinical diagnostics in a targeted fashion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>For example, high-throughput sequencing for the detection and typing of single pathogens in complex samples has achieved turnaround times of hours to days (1–5), and mass spectrometry analysis of metabolites has been performed in the clinic and laboratory in essentially real time (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>However, the integration of multi-omics technologies and their application to the microbiome field have not yet achieved time frames compatible with clinical needs in human health, industrial microbiology, or routine laboratory experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Multi-omics studies of the human microbiome can have enormous impact, providing a more comprehensive picture of a microbial community than a single omics approach on its own (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These studies have led to an understanding of how microbial communities in our bodies produce metabolites that affect our health and transform the drugs we consume (10–13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>One of the first integrated omics analysis related to the human microbiome was by Li et al. (14), who revealed an association between the gut microbiota and host metabolites in a cohort of Chinese subjects by using clone library sequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>This, and more recent multi-omics studies (15, 16), had multiyear gestation times. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Today, when considering the time between receipt of samples with informed consent and statistical conclusions from integrated omics data, these studies still require months to years to complete. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>In order to develop rapid multi-omics pipelines with broad applicability, they must first be tested using subjects and samples that are strongly influenced by their exposure to microbes and microbial chemical products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The subjects in this study are tightly linked to their microbial partners through their active involvement with fermented foods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This mutualistic relationship is believed to have existed since the Paleolithic era (17) and continues around the globe today. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Modern human evolution is intertwined with the influence of microbial fermentation processes in the foods we eat and within our own bodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Depending on the type of food and conditions used during fermentation, different types of microbial communities form, composed of various bacterial and fungal species (18), and the metabolic products of these communities can impact human health (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Previous studies found that species originating from microbially diverse fermented foods, such as cheese and salami, are able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, with the significant effects of antibiotics and a processed food-based diet on our microbiomes (13, 20, 21), there is an interest in the health benefits of fermented foods as alternatives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Here, we present the results from a simple, robust multi-omics platform integrating analyses of human, environmental, and animal samples in the clinically relevant time frame of less than 48 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This pipeline is now possible because of rapid advances in the development of software for the analysis and integration of omics data and standardized protocols that allow streamlined insertion of matched samples into multi-omics pipelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate how individuals commonly exposed to fermented foods show influences of these microbes on and in their bodies. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="s1.1"><title><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>General description of the 48-h analysis and multi-omics pipeline. </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected by seven volunteers (two families and two individuals, designated households 1 to 4) who regularly prepare and eat fermented foods (specifics of the fermented foods are presented in Table S1 in the supplemental material) and who were recruited to the American Gut Project (AGP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americangut.org">http://www.americangut.org</ext-link>) via word-of-mouth through the Second Annual San Diego Fermentation Festival in San Diego, CA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The AGP is an IRB-approved citizen science project comprising more than 7,000 samples from more than 6,500 individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Consenting participants received an AGP sampling kit after they gave consent and took a survey online, and the data were stored in a secure database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The deidentified metadata were then immediately downloaded into a file formatted for use in Qiita (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://qiita.ucsd.edu/">https://qiita.ucsd.edu/</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Due to the infrastructure surrounding the process, participant consent and sample-associated metadata were obtained before the samples arrived in the laboratory, facilitating immediate preparation for sample processing upon arrival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Notably, the metadata can be used for both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analyses, further streamlining the multi-omics approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected by cotton swab and subjected to DNA and metabolite extraction to describe the composition and activity of the corresponding microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Samples were subjected to a streamlined, high-throughput process involving preparation for 16S rRNA gene (variable region 4 [V4]) sequencing via the Earth Microbiome Project protocols (22, 23) and for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The first description of both the microbial communities and molecules, including alpha and beta diversity, and specific effects of fermented foods on the microbial and chemical ecology of the subjects, occurred within 48 h after samples were delivered to the laboratory (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Computational resources, including the Barnacle cluster available through the UCSD center for microbiome innovation connected to the Comet supercomputer located at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, allowed &gt;50 central processing unit (CPU) h of processing in &lt;11 h of wall time (note that some of the component steps are not parallelized), giving results back to the researchers fast enough to interpret the data in a timely manner. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="sys0021620170001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>There are four main components that enabled the development of this rapid multi-omics pipeline and its implementation in less than 48 h (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>First, subjects easily and efficiently enrolled themselves as part of an already existing, IRB-approved project (the AGP), enabling the use of on-the-spot informed consent and standardized metadata collection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Second, the protocols used to collect metadata and process samples have been extensively benchmarked and standardized (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/">http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/</ext-link>), allowing rapid assimilation with existing datasets and facilitating meaningful comparisons with other cohorts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Third, community analysis infrastructures, including Qiita, the microbial analysis infrastructure that houses microbiome analysis tools, and GNPS, a crowdsourced analysis infrastructure and public metabolomics knowledge repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnps.ucsd.edu">http://gnps.ucsd.edu</ext-link>), allowed rapid data processing and interpretation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>And fourth, the servers that host Qiita and GNPS are linked, enabling normalization, processing, and cross-platform analysis of multi-omics data in an integrated fashion. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Rather than multi-omics analysis being an arduous and highly technical procedure, this study demonstrates that it can be performed on a rapid time scale with a small team of people (six authors of the manuscript contributed to data analysis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>A major advantage to this pipeline is the ability to compare data to large data repositories, such as the AGP and GNPS, for sample relationships and metabolite identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>This more easily facilitates the identification of microbiome dysbiosis or metabolome changes that indicate disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Context is required in any clinical or industrial application of multi-omics data, to better determine how the current structure of a microbial community compares to previous states or sample types, enabling diagnosis of an active dysbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The present study focused on fermented foods and their effects on the people who prepared and consumed them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>These foods are of enormous medical importance given that yogurt, a fermented food, is the single food most correlated epidemiologically with weight loss in the U.S. population (35), and they are of economic importance due to the billions of dollars per year that fermented foods contribute to the economy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Although this sample cohort did not require rapid data analysis, such as that required in a medical emergency or the potential loss of a large industrial fermentation, this study shows that consent could be obtained, samples collected, and data generated on microbiome-related samples collected from people located up to 100 miles away from the laboratory in a time frame matching that of classic microbiological culturing of common pathogens (approximately 2 days). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The ability to do rapid-response multi-omics analysis and systems biology will have far reaching implications, from monitoring industrial fermentation processes, to guiding oil and gas drilling and fracking decisions, to providing rapid molecular analysis for patient care in infectious diseases and guiding the use of microbiome-based therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) (36) and probiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The combination of standardized protocols for subject recruitment and consent, sample collection, metadata capture, DNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, molecular networking, and data analysis and visualization now puts this technology in the hands of a broad spectrum of users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Broader and more rapid use of multi-omics methods will begin a sea change towards their implementation in clinical medicine. </plain></SENT>
