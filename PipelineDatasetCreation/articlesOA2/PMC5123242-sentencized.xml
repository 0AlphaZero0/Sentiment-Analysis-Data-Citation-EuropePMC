<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have reported an incidence of POCD of up to 41% in surgical patients older than 60 years (Table 1) [2]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>This observational cohort study prospectively evaluates the relationship of cerebral grey matter volume and POCD in elderly patients after major noncardiac surgery under sevoflurane anesthesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The primary hypothesis of this investigation is that POCD is accompanied by a loss of cerebral grey matter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Our secondary hypothesis is that the degree of POCD correlates with the loss of grey matter in brain areas relevant for cognitive functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>There are several potential implications of this study for future clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The validation of reproducible anatomical parameters or biomarkers, such as the specific brain volumes examined in our cohort, will help to identify high-risk patients and may serve to evaluate the effect of preventive strategies and treatment interventions for POCD in clinical follow-up studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>In summary, findings of this study may contribute to improve the diagnosis and prevention of POCD in the future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>In the following, we discuss considerations regarding study design, endpoints, choice of study collective, surgical procedures and anesthetic technique. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec19"><title><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Study design </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The cohort study design chosen for our study enables investigative research in a real-life clinical context without influencing state-of-the-art medical care of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>No study-related intervention is planned in participating patients, and risks are minimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Given the lack of clinical data and missing preventive and/or clinical treatment approaches towards POCD, our study is aimed to investigate an association between the cognitive decline and an anatomical biomarker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>At this point, POCD research is limited to noninterventional clinical studies, hence the prospective observational design of this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Endpoints </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The choice of radiological endpoints of our investigation is based on the findings of AddNeuroMed study [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Liu et al. reported that the degree of atrophy in specific cortical areas correlates with the results of neuropsychological assessment tests obtained by subjects with various cognitive disorders (unrelated to surgery) [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We assume that brain areas affected in POCD are comparable to those concerned in Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Methodological considerations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><sec id="Sec22"><title><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Choice of study collective </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Although POCD was described in middle-aged patients [3], the disorder has its highest incidence among patients over the age of 65 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>As most research on POCD was done in this age group, we decided to set the cut-off for participant age at 65 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>We excluded subjects with conditions known to induce changes in cerebral anatomy such as Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, a history of severe neurological disease, or chronic pain in order to obtain a patient sample free of pre-existing cognitive disorders that might confound the relationship between brain volumes and POCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>The addition of a group of nonsurgical participants serves to control for practice effects related to neuropsychological assessment, to observe the physiological cerebral atrophy rates in volunteers matched to the surgical group, and to establish a paradigm for further research on POCD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Choice of surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>We carefully considered the range of surgical procedures to include in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>We excluded cardiac surgery because of potential issues with cardiopulmonary bypass, surgery of the brain or extracranial blood vessels, and any type of surgery of the face or neck that would preclude patients’ active participation in the postoperative neuropsychological assessments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Emergency procedures were also excluded, since we would be unable to measure the patient’s baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>At our institution, abdominal, gynecologic, urologic, vascular and orthopedic procedures are the most commonly performed major noncardiac surgeries in older adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Most of these surgeries involve a hospital stay of at least 5 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Although this study is monocentric, we strongly believe that the resulting study cohort is representative of a general surgical population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Choice of anesthetic technique </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this study with pilot character, we chose to investigate exclusively Sevoflurane-based general anesthesia, in order to standardize anesthetic management as a measure to minimize bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Sevoflurane anesthesia is delivered by the attending anesthetist primarily based on BIS targets (40–60) and clinical judgement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Given that the choice of anesthetic technique only marginally influences the risk of developing POCD in surgical patients [35], we intend to examine the effect of other anesthetic drugs (e.g., propofol as total intravenous anesthesia) and other anesthetic techniques (e.g., neuraxial or regional anesthesia) on brain volumes and POCD in follow-up studies with similar research protocols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Airway management is standardized as all patients participating in this study are intubated and mechanically ventilated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Other aspects of intraoperative anesthetic management such as the use of opioids or muscle relaxants and hemodynamic management are left at the discretion of the attending physician following existing institutional guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of POCD </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>POCD is a complex neuropsychological disorder presenting as a decline in various cognitive domains after surgery and may at times be difficult to diagnose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Clinical cognitive outcomes research is complicated by the fact that there is no universal definition of POCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Assessment for POCD comprises a time-intensive combination of neurocognitive function tests, and expert evaluation is mandatory for a valid diagnosis of POCD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In the literature, large differences in methodology (e.g., the test batteries used, the interval between sessions, the endpoints to be analyzed, statistical methods) and diagnostic criteria for POCD are apparent [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In our study, the diagnosis of POCD is based on a decrease of standard scores in the CERAD-NAB. </plain></SENT>
