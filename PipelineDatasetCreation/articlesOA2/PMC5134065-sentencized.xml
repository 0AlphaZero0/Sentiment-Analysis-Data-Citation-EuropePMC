</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (LUTIs) are very common (i.e. 10% of all women has it each year and 60% of all women experience at least one episode during their lifetime) [1], and we presume there are about 200,000 patients treated for this in Denmark annually. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Most patients are otherwise healthy women, and these infections are often the main reason of exposure to antibiotics for these patients [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Uncomplicated LUTIs are primarily community acquired and diagnosed as well as treated in primary care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli [2, 3], and diagnosis can be made clinical with 90% positive predictive value (i.e. new onset dysuria, pollakisuria and urgency, together with absence of vaginal discharge or pain) [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In Denmark, the current clinical practice recommendations is pivmecillinam (i.e., 400 mg t.i.d for 3 days) as the first line drug against uncomplicated LUTIs [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Pivmecillinam is a prodrug of mecillinam. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is an amidinopenicillin, selective and highly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, especially E. coli. The side effects are few; most commonly reported are mild gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>It has for a long time primarily been used for UTIs in the Scandinavian countries [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown pivmecillinam to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of LUTIs [6, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Even in countries where it is well used, there seems to be low rates of resistance [3, 8, 9] (e.g. 5% resistance in E. coli of the Danish primary sector [10]), and indications of a low rate of collateral damage and low risk of clonal spread of resistance [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The current international and European clinical practice guidelines for acute uncomplicated UTI recommend pivmecillinam as one of the first line drugs, the therapy is recommended to be 400 mg b.i.d for 5 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although, at the same time saying 400 mg b.i.d in any duration between 3 and 7 days is an appropriate choice, but pointing out a 5-day or a 7-day course probably is superior to a 3-day course [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The recommended duration is, however, based on evidence showing a 7-day course is better than a 3-day course [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies on pivmecillinam treatment of LUTI caused by ESBL producing bacteria shows different success rates, i.e. 56% (200 mg t.i.d.) and 80% (mainly 400 mg t.i.d) [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The higher success rate of 400 mg is supported by Monte Carlo simulations [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, evidence point to a superiority of 400 mg dose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>With this knowledge, we wanted to compare the efficacy of a 400 mg t.i.d. 3-day versus 5-day regimen of pivmecillinam against uncomplicated LUTI. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Pivmecillinam is an excellent choice against urinary tract infections, and has shown to be both safe and effective against UTI [6, 12, 22], with a clear superiority to placebo [12] and superiority to sulftamethiazole [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In these days, with the concerning rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, pivmecillinam has shown to be of an especial advantage; demonstrating low collateral damage (i.e. minor impact on the normal microflora [21], low resistance [3, 9], low selectivity and clonal spread of resistance [11]), as well as indication of clinical and bacteriological effective against ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae [13, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Hence, there are good evidences backing pivmecillinam as a first line of drug in the treatment of LUTI, as stated in the international guidelines [2], and as long time practiced in the Scandinavian countries. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Ferry et al. [12] have demonstrated that a 7-day regimen is superior to a 3-day regimen against uncomplicated LUTI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>However, the current guidelines do not recommend a 7-day therapy, because of the increased risk of side effects (i.e. GI-problems). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are no data comparing the 3-day vs. the 5-day therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>With the 5-day therapy possibly to be more effective and with non-significant increased risk of side effects than the 3-day; a 5-day therapy might be a more cost-beneficial duration for the patient in the treatment of uncomplicated LUTI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Thus, with this study we want to strengthen and fill the gaps of evidence in our guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We have chosen the 400 mg dose t.i.d., since that is the dose we recommend in Denmark; and we believe 200 mg t.i.d to be an insufficient dose (i.e. supported by pharmacokinetic mouse models [15] and the recent study from Soraas et al. [14]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>With this knowledge, we believe it to be unethical of us to use a 200 mg dose, and have therefore excluded a treatment arm with 200 mg. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec32"><title><text><SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Design and definitions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>We designed this protocol similarly to previous similar clinical studies on uncomplicated LUTI [12, 22, 24, 25], in order to be able to compare results in the future in a more accurate way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>We define uncomplicated LUTI in concordance with the acknowledged definition [1, 26], with one difference; we choose to include post-menopausal women in our study, since we do not necessarily believe them to always be of complicated LUTI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Hence, if a post-menopausal woman has no other complicated conditions (see exclusion criteria) we believe her to be a potential candidate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Procedures </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>We want the inclusion procedures to be as realistic as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the consulting with the GPs will be changed as little as possible and restricted to the inclusion day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>However, patients will be clearly instructed to return to the GP as usual at sign of treatment failure, or if they wish to consult for any other reason. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title><text><SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Outcomes </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome we want to focus on is the clinical effect, since that is of most importance to the patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to know that the bacteria disappear and not cause clinical relapses in the future; therefore, we included two follow-up urine sample at day-4 and day-28, respectively. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec35"><title><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Scientific and societal perspective </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This study will give us the knowledge of what drug therapy of pivmecillinam that is most effective and sufficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>If the 5-day therapy will show to be significantly superior to the 3-day regimen, the current guidelines will have to be changed in best interests of the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Also through the perspective of the patients, it will be beneficial if the 3-day regimen is proven to be non-inferior to the 5-day regimen (i.e. higher rate of compliance, and less antimicrobial consumption cause less economic and ecological loads), and we can keep using the 3-day regimen in concordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine. </plain></SENT>
