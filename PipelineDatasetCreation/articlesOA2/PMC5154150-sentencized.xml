</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>More than 230 million major surgical procedures are undertaken every year worldwide (Weiser et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most operations were performed under general anaesthesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>A survey in 2013 in the UK showed over 2,766,600 general anaesthesia during 1 year (Sury et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Morbidity rates &gt;25% have repeatedly been reported after major surgery (Ghaferi et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, strategies to improve outcome and prevent postoperative complications are required in surgical patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis suggest that perioperative goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) decreases postsurgical complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing major abdominal procedures (Benes et al. 2010; Gan et al. 2002; Grocott et al. 2012; Hamilton et al. 2011; Lopes et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, (1) larger and multicentre studies have yielded conflicting results (Pearse et al. 2014; Pestaña et al. 2014; Scheeren et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Pearse et al. demonstrated in their randomized trial of high-risk patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery that the use of a cardiac output-guided haemodynamic therapy algorithm when compared did not significantly reduce postoperative complications and 30-day mortality (Pearse et al. 2014); (2) RCTs are done in highly selected patients with extra human and financial resources, such that the extrapolation of their results to the real world may be questioned (Vincent 2009); and (3) only a few studies have been done in orthopaedic patients and none in patients undergoing hip revision arthroplasty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing revision hip surgery are usually old and often have comorbidities, increasing their risk of complications after surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we made the decision to implement GDFT in patients undergoing hip revision arthroplasty and to assess its effects on postoperative outcome as an enhanced recovery project for these patients. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>All consecutive patients admitted for revision hip surgery were screened for inclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years and one of the following surgical procedures (hip revision arthroplasty): hip revision with change of the prosthesis, explantation of existing hip arthroplasty, or patients after Girdlestone resection arthroplasty, who underwent new implantation of hip prosthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Patients from the GDFT group were compared to 130 historical matched control patients (control group) who underwent the same surgical procedure from January 1, 2011, to August 30, 2012, before we developed the algorithm for the prospective group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>During this time frame, no patients were treated with additional monitoring that could measure intraoperative stroke volume. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The study protocol was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01753050) and approved by the ethics committee at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA1/315/12). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Anaesthesia was induced according to our written SOP with fentanyl (1–2 μg kg−1), propofol (1–2 mg kg−1), and cisatracurium (0.15 mg kg−1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>After endotracheal intubation, the maintenance of anaesthesia was performed at the discretion of the attending anaesthesiologist with either sevoflurane or propofol continuously. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>None of the patients from the retrospective group was monitored with a device that was able to measure stroke volume (SV) or any other flow-related parameter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>In all patients of the GDFT group, invasive blood pressure was monitored via right or left radial artery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic optimization in this group was done as follows: SV was monitored using a pulse contour method (Vigileo 03.06, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) and a special pressure transducer (FloTrac system, Edwards Lifesciences). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Baseline SV was measured after induction of anaesthesia and patient positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>An intravenous colloid bolus of 250 mL (Volulyte® 6%, Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany, or Gelafundin ISO 40 mg mL−1, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) was given within 5 min and repeated until reaching a SV plateau value (increase in SV &lt; 10%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The optimum stroke volume (SVopt) was defined as the last successful fluid challenge, e.g. the last SV value just before reaching the plateau value, and SVtrigger as SVopt minus 10%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Our GDT protocol is shown in Fig. 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>During surgery, our goal was to maintain SV above SVtrigger using fluid boluses, or inotropes (dobutamine or enoximone at 3 μg kg−1 h−1), when fluid loading was unable to restore SV values above SVtrigger. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Inotropes were not used in patients with two or more of the following conditions: existing coronary heart disease or angina pectoris, presence of diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, or stroke in the patient’s history (Kristensen et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Compliance to the haemodynamic treatment protocol was monitored using case report forms (CRFs) and evaluated postoperatively by two independent anaesthesiologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Disagreement, if any, was solved by discussion with a third anaesthesiologist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The compliance rate was calculated as the number of protocol deviations divided by the total number of interventions during surgery and expressed as a percentage.Fig. 1Graphical representation of our GDFT protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Fluid was administered until stroke volume reached a plateau value (SVmax). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In this matched cohort study and quality improvement project, we implemented into clinical routine a goal-directed fluid therapy protocol in patients undergoing revision hip surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>The implementation was successful with a high protocol compliance rate of 87%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Patients from the GDFT had a significantly reduced postoperative morbidity (relative decrease of 26.5% (p = 0.006)), as well as a 2-day shorter length of hospital stay (p = 0.003) and also a shorter ICU stay (p &lt; 0.001, when the patients were admitted to the ICU postoperatively). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Many studies have demonstrated the ability of GDFT to improve postoperative outcome in patients undergoing major abdominal and vascular procedures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests a 25–50% reduction in postoperative morbidity that was associated with a 1–2-day reduction in hospital length of stay (Grocott et al. 2012; Hamilton et al. 2011; Pearse et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, only few studies were done in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>In 1996, Sinclair et al. showed in 40 patients undergoing repair of proximal femoral fractures that fluid loading to an optimal stroke volume resulted in a more rapid postoperative recovery and a significantly reduced hospital stay (Sinclair et al. 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In 2002, Venn et al. showed that an invasive intraoperative haemodynamic monitoring concept using fluid challenges during repair of femoral fracture reduced the recovery time and also length of hospital stay (Venn et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>More recently, Cecconi et al. reported that in patients undergoing primary hip replacement under regional anaesthesia a goal-directed haemodynamic therapy changes the intraoperative fluid management and reduces postoperative complications (p = 0.05) (Cecconi et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, our study is the first investigating the effects of GDFT in patients undergoing more complex hip revision surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast to this overwhelming evidence coming from RCTs, only little attention has been put on clinical implementation at the bedside and the value of GDFT in real life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Kuper et al. published in 2011 a multicentre trial where they implemented GDFT into clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>In spite of a lower than expected (65%) adoption rate during the implementation phase, they observed a significantly shorter length of hospital stay with GDFT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Cannesson et al. recently published another real-life implementation programme of GDFT in patients undergoing major abdominal procedures and observed a 14% decrease in postoperative morbidity associated with decrease in median hospital length of stay from 10 (6–16) days to 7 (5–11) days (p = 0.0001) (Cannesson et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>In line with these publications, our study shows that implementation of GDFT is not only possible in a tertiary university medical centre but also might be beneficial for patients in whom the postoperative morbidity rate decreased by 26.5% and hospital length of stay decreased from 11 (9–15) days to 9 (8–12) days during the implementation phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Our protocol was pretty simple and part of a newly created standard operating procedure officially approved by the departments of anaesthesiology and orthopaedic surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Both factors may have contributed to the high compliance rate and the clinical benefits we observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>One point of discussion is the increased use of inotropes during surgery that might put the GDFT patients at an increased risk of myocardial ischemia and other cardiac complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of arrhythmia was significantly reduced in the GDFT group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The risk of myocardial ischemia and cardiac complications might have been mitigated by the fact that we used the risk assessment algorithm from the ESA/ESC to prevent patients being treated systematically with inotropes that are at high risk for myocardial ischemia (Kristensen et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The adequate use of inotropes during surgery, based on SV data, may be helpful without increasing myocardial complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This is in line with a recent meta-analysis which showed that the use of GDFT is associated with a decrease and not an increase in cardiac complications and in particular arrhythmias which are often triggered by hypovolemia (Arulkumaran et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Other underlying factors that might have contributed to the reduced rate of cardiovascular complications might have been an improved microvascular perfusion leading to reduced systemic inflammation (Jhanji et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Another interesting finding was the reduced transfusion rate after surgery seen in the GDFT group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>We did not change our transfusion guidelines during the study period, so it is unlikely that a change in transfusion practice could have explained it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>It could be speculated that due to an improved intraoperative microcirculation in the optimized group, early bleeding during surgery is better recognized by the surgeon, and therefore, surgical haemostasis might be performed more effectively preventing later bleeding complications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this is speculative and needs to be reproduced by further research. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Our study has several limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Given its before-after design, we cannot claim causality between the GDFT intervention introduced as a new standard of care and the observed changes in postoperative outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, RCTs also have their limitations, particularly when blinding is not possible, as is the case when studying changes in clinical behaviour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when performing a RCT where fluid management is standardized by the use of a predefined treatment protocol, clinicians are inevitably sensibilized and trained about the risk of giving too little or too much fluid during the perioperative period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>As a result, they may change their usual practice and the so-called control group may not reflect anymore what used to be standard management in their institution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>This “training effect” will tend to decrease the likelihood to show a difference between the intervention and the control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, when performing RCTs, clinicians usually benefit from extra human and financial resources, helping them to ensure the new strategy is properly implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>This “resource effect” tends in contrast to increase the probability to show a difference between groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>In our study, the fluid management of the historical control group was not influenced at all by GDFT training and use since we introduced it only at the end of 2012. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>And when GDFT was introduced, it was used for all patients undergoing hip revision surgery as part of a new standard operating procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>As a result, we believe our quality improvement study provides a pretty fair idea of the impact of GDFT implementation in real-life conditions and is complementary of previous RCTs done in orthopaedic patients, showing a benefit in more controlled conditions. </plain></SENT>
