</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stringent response (SR) is a central bacterial adaptation mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In response to various environmental stimuli, the RelA/SpoT Homologue (RSH) proteins modulate the intracellular concentration of the alarmone nucleotides guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), commonly referred to as (p)ppGpp (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Production of (p)ppGpp mediates global rewiring of the cellular transcriptional program and general metabolism, leading to stress adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The SR has been shown to play an important role in regulation of bacterial virulence (4), survival during host invasion (5), as well as antibiotic resistance (6) and persistence (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Together with the absence of a cytoplasmic (p)ppGpp-mediated SR system in eukaryotes, this makes the RSH enzymes involved in (p)ppGpp metabolism promising new targets for drug development (3,8,9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Historically, investigations of the SR were focused on the γ-proteobacterium Escherichia coli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In E. coli, the SR is orchestrated by two multi-domain long form RSH enzymes: RelA (10) and SpoT (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The activity of the two proteins is regulated by different sets of stress signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>SpoT has a strong (p)ppGpp hydrolytic activity and a weak (p)ppGpp synthesis activity (12–14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>By contrast, RelA has no hydrolytic activity, but possesses a strong ribosome-dependent (p)ppGpp synthetic activity that is activated by amino acid starvation via sensing of deacylated tRNA in the ribosomal A-site (15–17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown that there is another activator of RelA, namely its product ppGpp (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There are conflicting models for the mechanism of action of RelA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies suggested that (p)ppGpp synthesis causes RelA to ‘hop’ between ribosomes to sample the translational status of the cell (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Subsequent live cell single molecule tracking experiments suggested that while activation of RelA by starved ribosomes induces RelA dissociation, RelA can perform multiple rounds of catalysis off the ribosome (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>This is hard to reconcile with recent live cell single molecule tracking experiments suggesting that under starvation conditions RelA remains bound to the ribosome and synthesis multiple rounds of (p)ppGpp synthesis (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sequence analysis (2) and biochemical studies (21–23) suggest that RelA has a two domain architecture: An N-terminal domain (NTD) bearing hydrolase (HD) and synthetase (SYNTH) subdomains, the structure of which is available from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis Rel protein (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To date, there is no atomic structure of the RelA C-terminal domain (CTD), however, sequence homology suggests the presence of a TGS (Thr-RS, GTPase and SpoT) motif followed by a helical linker region connected to the C-terminal conserved cysteine (CC) and Aspartokinase, Chorismate mutase and TyrA (ACT) subdomains (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Although the precise function of these subdomains is unclear, the CTD is critical for ribosome binding (25) as well as autoinhibition of the synthetase activity of RelA in the absence of the ribosome (21–23,26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Structural insights into the RSH interaction with the ribosome come from a cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of E. coli RelA bound to the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome programmed with tRNAfMet in the P-site and tRNAPhe in the A-site (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The structure reveals that on the ribosome RelA interacts with a distorted A/T-tRNA (25), similar but distinct from the A/T-tRNA observed on the ribosome in the presence of EF-Tu (27–29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The limited resolution (∼11 Å) and conformation flexibility of the bound RelA, however, precluded assignment of the NTD and CTD (25). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of E. coli RelA in complex with a translating ribosome stalled with a deacylated-tRNA in the A-site, with an average resolution of 3.7 Å and local resolution of 4 to &gt;10 Å for RelA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The structure reveals that the HD and SYNTH domains within the NTD of RelA are highly flexible and protrude into the solvent where no contact with the ribosome is apparent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the CTD of RelA adopts an open conformation on the ribosome that stabilizes an A/T-like conformation of the deacylated tRNA in the A-site, which we term the A/R-tRNA state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The TGS domain of RelA interacts with the CCA-end, suggesting its involvement in discriminating deacylated- from aminoacylated-tRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>A long helical linker region extends from the TGS domain, wraps around the A/R-tRNA and positions the CC and ACT domains deeper within the intersubunit cavity, where they interact with H38 of the 23S rRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Overall, the structure enables a model to be proposed for how the open conformation of the CTD of RelA on the ribosome leads to stimulation of the (p)ppGpp activity of the NTD. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>As in our previous studies (30,41,43), the SRCs were obtained using a dicistronic 2Xerm-mRNA encoding two identical Erm-stalling leader peptides (Figure 1A).

<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>We first used this disome approach to determine cryo-EM structures of ErmBL-SRCs, revealing that the sample contained a large population of ribosomes bearing A- and P-tRNAs (30) and was thus unsuitable for binding of ligands to the A-site. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In agreement with previous studies (48,49), mutation of the Ser10 codon, which would be in the A-site of an erythromycin-stalled ErmCL-SRC (41,49), did not noticeably affect the stalling efficiency, and resulted in disome formation in the presence of erythromycin (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The reason for using the ErmCL_S10K construct rather than the wild type ErmCL was simply that, unlike deacylated tRNASer, deacylated tRNALys is commercially available. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Although the deacylated tRNAs are not bound by EF-Tu or delivered by EF-Tu to the ribosome, it is possible for deacylated tRNAs to bind non-enzymatically to the A-site of the ribosome (Figure 5C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>RelA has been proposed to recognize the deacylated tRNA bound in the A-site and catalyze (p)ppGpp synthesis (15–17). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Specifically, it has been shown that the CTD of RelA is responsible for the observed autoinhibition (21–23,26), leading to the hypothesis that the autoinhibition results from direct interaction between the CTD and NTD of RelA (23), which we term here the ‘closed’ conformation (Figure 5F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>While interaction of deacylated tRNA with the CTD of RelA in the absence of the ribosome promotes a slight increase in (p)ppGpp synthesis activity (26,51,52) (Figure 5E), full activity requires the additional presence of the ribosome (15–17,53,54) (Figure 5D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The structure of RelA-SRC provides a rationale for this increased activity, namely, that the ribosome and A/R-tRNA stabilize an ‘open’ conformation of RelA, which relieves the inhibitory interaction that the CTD imparts on the NTD, and thereby allows the uninhibited NTD to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of (p)ppGpp from GTP/GDP and ATP (Figure 5D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>This model is consistent with the observation that deletion of the CTD of RelA prevents interaction of RelA with the ribosome (25) and allows the NTD to synthesize (p)ppGpp in a ribosome-independent manner (21,26,55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the RelA-SRC structure indicates that the TGS domain of RelA directly contacts the 3′-end of the deacylated tRNA (Figure 4D), explaining how RelA can monitor and distinguish the aminoacylation state of the A-tRNA (56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that ppGpp itself dramatically stimulates the ribosome-dependent RelA-mediated synthesis of itself (18), presumably by acting allosterically through a second, as yet undetermined, binding site on the factor, similar to the allosteric regulation of pppGpp observed recently for the small alarmone synthetase 1 (SAS1) RelQ from Bacillus subtilis (57) and Enterococcus faecalis (58). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>This suggests to us that following dissociation from the ribosome, but still in the presence of deacylated tRNA, RelA can adopt a ‘semi-open’ conformation that can retain (p)ppGpp synthesis activity for an extended period of time (Figure 5G), consistent with the interpretation of single molecule experiments examining RelA action in living cells (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, RelA has low affinity for deacylated tRNA in the absence of the ribosome (51), suggesting that either the RelA-tRNA complex becomes stabilized by rebinding to the ribosome and stimulating higher levels of (p)ppGpp synthesis, or the RelA-tRNA complex disassembles, allowing RelA to adopt the less active closed conformation (Figure 5F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>It seems probable that the former pathway of rebinding would be favoured under conditions of starvation where a high ratio of deacylated tRNAs over aminoacylated tRNAs exists in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the latter pathway of disassembly would be favored as the nutrient deprivation is alleviated and the ratio is reversed, such that the increased intracellular levels of charged aminoacyl-tRNA promote A-site binding and thereby allows translation to resume (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Our findings are in perfect agreement with their results and lead to the same conclusion: The ribosome and A/R-tRNA stabilize an ‘open’ conformation of RelA, which relieves the inhibitory interaction that the CTD imparts on the NTD, and thereby allows the uninhibited NTD to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of (p)ppGpp from GTP/GDP and ATP. </plain></SENT>
