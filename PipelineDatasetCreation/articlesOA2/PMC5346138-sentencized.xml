</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) are essential for the genome maintenance of all known cellular organisms (Mushegian and Koonin 1996; Ashton et al. 2013) and are present in many viruses (Sun and Shamoo 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They play a vital role in DNA metabolism (Dickey et al. 2013), sequestering and protecting transiently formed ssDNA during DNA replication and recombination, melting double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and detecting DNA damage and recruiting repair proteins (Ashton et al. 2013; Sun and Shamoo 2003; Dickey et al. 2013; Theobald et al. 2003; Suck 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>SSBs from the three domains of life share little sequence similarity and diverse subunit organisation (Dickey et al. 2013), but a common evolutionary feature of the SSB protein family is the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold (five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel), which can bind ssDNA with high affinity (Theobald et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Although the persistence of the OB fold in all SSBs suggests a common ancestor for these proteins (Suck 1997), the organisation of OB folds in SSBs varies considerably (Theobald et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For example, Escherichia coli SSB (EcoSSB) is a homotetramer, with each subunit consisting of a single OB domain for ssDNA binding, in conjunction with a flexible C-terminal extension involved in protein–protein interactions (Raghunathan et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Deinococcus/Thermus SSBs, whilst still utilising the tetrameric functional binding mode, arrive at this arrangement by combining two SSB homodimers: each SSB monomer encoding two OB folds linked by a conserved spacer sequence (Dabrowski et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>All eukaryotes utilise a heterotrimeric SSB known as replication protein A (RPA) with six OB folds; two that mediate subunit interaction and four that are involved in ssDNA binding (Theobald et al. 2003; Bochkarev et al. 1999), whilst many also encode a second SSB (hSSB1/NABP2/OBFC2B) with a single OB fold, which is involved in the maintenance of genome stability (Richard et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The arrangement of euryarchaeal SSBs is similar to eukaryotic RPA: a polypeptide or polypeptides with multiple OB folds, including a characteristic OB fold interrupted by a zinc-binding domain (White 2003; Komori and Ishino 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This zinc-domain is also found in the large RPA70 subunit in eukaryotic RPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It appears that some euryarchaeal SSBs form heterotrimers and others heterodimers (Komori and Ishino 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the crenarchaeal SSB has a bacterial-like domain structure, with a single OB fold followed by a flexible C-terminal tail that is not involved in DNA binding and coats ssDNA with a stoichiometry of approximately 5 nucleotides (nt) DNA per SSB molecule (Wadsworth and White 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of the OB fold of Sulfolobus solfataricus SSB (SsoSSB) demonstrated its close structural relationship with the ssDNA-binding domains of human RPA70 (Kerr et al. 2003) and that of hSSB1 (Touma et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The monomeric structure of SsoSSB in solution, both in the absence and presence of ssDNA, was recently confirmed by cross-linking experiments (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015) and by EPR and single-molecule molecule FRET (Morten et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Organisms inhabiting extreme environments where DNA damage is more frequent have a particular need to protect ssDNA, which is much more sensitive to damage than dsDNA (Ashton et al. 2013; Dickey et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans maintains a high level of SSB in the cell and increases that level nearly three-fold in response to ionising radiation (Bernstein et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Likewise, hyperthermophilic organisms, such as S. solfataricus, are also likely to experience elevated levels of DNA damage and it has been shown that SsoSSB expression is stimulated after UV irradiation (Wadsworth and White 2001; Gotz et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Mutants of the archaeal halophile Halobacterium sp NRC1 with enhanced resistance to ionising radiation were shown to have enhanced expression of RPA (DeVeaux et al. 2007). E. coli, on the other hand, maintains a constant level of SSB that does not increase significantly in response to any DNA damage (Meyer and Laine 1990). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The previous studies of eukaryotic and bacterial SSBs have suggested efficient discrimination between ssDNA and RNA (Mushegian and Koonin 1996; Ashton et al. 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>In mesophilic organisms, this discrimination may serve to ensure that SSB is reserved for binding to ssDNA during replication and repair, not distributed over the much more abundant and omnipresent RNA in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The ability of these proteins to discriminate between ssDNA and ssRNA is not entirely understood, but it is thought to result from a combination of factors, including the lower plasticity of the RNA sugar pucker and the steric clash due to the presence of the 2′ hydroxyl group that increases the energy barrier for binding and limits the conformational landscape of ssRNA (Shamoo 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Usually, SSB proteins have only modest affinities for ssRNA (Meyer and Laine 1990). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>In the absence of SsoSSB, the fluorescence spectra obtained when exciting the Cy3 donor (λ exc ~ 547 nm) showed a significant emission from the Cy5 acceptor dye (λ em ~ 670 nm), indicative, as expected, of a high degree of energy transfer from the Cy3 to the Cy5 for the intact hairpin (Fig. 2d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>However, in the presence of 20 nM SsoSSB, the spectrum was dominated by the emission from the Cy3, suggesting that the inter-dye distance had increased and, as a result, the FRET efficiency had decreased substantially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>We interpreted this as evidence that SsoSSB can efficiently disrupt the secondary structure of the hairpin RNA as previously observed for duplex DNA (Cubeddu and White 2005). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated using the interaction of SsoSSB with ssDNA that these FRET bursts are not caused by acceptor photobleaching (Morten et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>

Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pot1 is the most extensively studied example of a protein that can selectively bind to ssDNA and it achieves this in a number of ways, including preferentially binding to thymine rather than uracil (Nandakumar et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A strong hydrophobic interaction is formed between the deoxythymine and a protein binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>In contrast, uracil lacks a methyl group, producing an energetically unfavourable gap between the RNA and protein, weakening the strength of binding to RNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Steric clashes between the 2′ hydroxyl group with Pot1 residue Ser123 and a phosphate group on the neighbouring nucleotide have also been identified as barriers to any strong affinity between RNA and the OB fold, and so facilitate the selective binding of ssDNA (Nandakumar et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for discrimination by RPA and EcoSSB between ssDNA and RNA is less well studied, but presumably arises from similar energetic penalties for the accommodation of the extra 2′ hydroxyl group in the binding site of the protein, or from differences in the conformational flexibility of DNA and RNA (Chen et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Having established that SsoSSB binds ssRNA with a similar affinity and similar kinetics as ssDNA, we next sought to determine whether there are any major structural differences between DNA and RNA recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>We carried out NMR HSQC experiments of 15N-SsoSSB in the absence and presence of RNA revealing that the same residues that exhibit chemical shift changes upon binding of ssDNA are also significantly perturbed when RNA is added (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Indeed, mapping of the observed chemical shift changes onto the crystal structure of SsoSSB (PDB ID 1O7I) confirmed that ssDNA and RNA recognise essentially the same binding interface on the protein (Fig. 4b–e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>We have recently solved the structure of SsoSSB bound to ssDNA and have shown that the defining feature of the complex structure is the base-stacking of three aromatic residues (W56, W75 and F79) with three ssDNA bases (PDB ID 2MNA) (Gamsjaeger et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
