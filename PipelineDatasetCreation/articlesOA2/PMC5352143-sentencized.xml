</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Neisseria meningitidis is a diplococcal, Gram-negative bacteria that lives commensally in the nasopharyngeal tract of approximately 10–20% of humans [1]. N. meningitidis is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause serious invasive infections including meningitis and sepsis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This pathogen acquires iron–an essential cofactor required for redox reactions in biological processes–from the iron-loaded host glycoproteins, human transferrin (hTf) and human lactoferrin (hLf) using a set of specialized receptors with specific affinity for these host glycoproteins[2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The transferrin and lactoferrin receptors from N. meningitidis are both comprised of an integral outer-membrane ‘A’ protein (TbpA, LbpA) and a bi-lobed, lipidated ‘B’ protein associated with the outer membrane (TbpB, LbpB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>hTf is present in serum, within interstitial fluids and on mucosal surfaces, whereas hLf is localized to the mucosal surface, secretions, and sites of inflammation–possibly providing different niches for the functionality of these receptors [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism by which the transferrin receptor hijacks iron from hTf has been well studied from a structural and biophysical perspective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Crystal structures of TbpB, TbpB:hTf, and TbpA:hTf from N. meningitidis have all been determined [4, 5], providing an in-depth picture of the iron acquisition pathway (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The N-lobe of TbpB captures the iron-loaded C-lobe of hTf and brings it to TbpA where iron is removed, transported across the outer membrane, captured by FbpA and transported into the cytoplasm through the FbpBC complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="ppat.1006244.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006244.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Model for iron acquisition from hTf and hLf. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>TbpA extracts iron from hTf and transports it across the outer membrane where it is bound by FbpA and subsequently transported into the cytoplasm by the FbpBC inner membrane complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether hLf directly binds LbpA or is it first bound by LbpB, analogous to the TbpBA receptor or whether cleavage by NalP would compromise the role of LbpB in iron transport. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1006244.g001"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>LbpA is required for acquiring iron from hLf [6] and binds to both domains of the C-lobe of hLf [7], suggesting that its removal of iron from hLf is analogous to the TbpA:Tf complex [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, there is uncertainty in the interaction of LbpB with Lf and whether or not it plays a role in the iron acquisition process, particularly since it has been shown to be released from the meningococcal outer membrane by NalP [8] (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Although the structures of the N-terminal lobe of LbpB from N. meningitidis and Moraxella bovis have been determined [9, 10], attempts to crystallize the intact LbpB protein from N. meningitidis have failed [10], likely due to large flexible clusters of anionic amino acids present in the C-terminal lobe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Computational docking with the structure of the N. meningitidis LbpB N-lobe predicted a binding interaction with the hLf N-lobe that contrasts the binding interface seen in the TbpB:hTf interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Noinaj and Cornelisson et al. [11] proposed a model in which LbpB binds to the C-lobe of hLf. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Neither of these models are based on experimental data and ignore the presence of LbpB’s defining characteristic–the presence of negatively charged loops in its C-lobe. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recent work [12–14] has also implicated LbpB in defending the bacteria against neutrophil exudates and anti-microbial peptides (including human lactoferricin; a peptide proteolytically derived from human lactoferrin), indicating this protein may perform additional functions outside of iron-acquisition in vivo–or this may now be its primary or sole function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This function would not be compromised by the release of LbpB by NalP-mediated cleavage of the anchor peptide [8] but NalP-mediated release would impact iron acquisition if LbpB played a similar role as TbpB in the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These observations, coupled with the conflicting models and incomplete molecular picture of LbpB call for an in-depth characterization of this protein if we are to understand N. meningitidis pathogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this study, we employ the use of several biophysical and biochemical strategies in order to characterize the interaction between LbpB and lactoferrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>We provide a more comprehensive picture of the binding mechanisms of LbpB to hLf and novel insights as to how the interactions may serve different roles under iron-limited and inflammatory conditions N. meningitidis would experience within the host. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The published structures of the LbpB N-lobes [9, 10] confirm that the core structural features of the individual lobes, the antiparallel beta-strand handle and barrel domains, are conserved between TbpBs and LbpBs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The relatively conserved composition and structural features of the bipartite Tf receptor amongst these diverse hosts argue for the presence of these receptors in bacteria that resided in ancestral hosts prior to the divergence of birds and mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The demonstration that positive selection in regions of Tf involved in binding to TbpA drove the evolution of transferrin responsible for the host specificity amongst these pathogens in primates [29], suggests that these same forces are responsible for the host specificity observed in pathogens from other vertebrate hosts [2, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The ability to proliferate independently from other members of the upper respiratory or genitourinary microbial communities due to direct utilization of host Tf provides a selective advantage, to the extent that some bacteria have become dependent upon this mechanism for survival [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The ability to directly use host Tf also enables these bacteria to proliferate in serum and interstitial tissue fluids inside the body, one reason that these bacteria are also important pathogens in their respective hosts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The bipartite Lf receptors were likely derived from ancestral Tf receptors after establishment of the mammalian lineage and have also been shown to be important for growth and survival on the mucosal surface [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>However, the Neisseria LbpB has been shown to protect against cationic peptides derived from the Lf N-terminal region [12, 13] and to be selectively released from the bacterial surface by NalP [8], raising questions about its role in the iron acquisition process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The fact that positive selection analysis of lactoferrin evolution in mammals primarily identified residues in the N-terminal lactoferricin and lactoferrampin regions [33], highlights the importance of the interaction of Lf with bacterial factors such as the Lf binding protein PspA [34] and LbpB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Computational docking was used to develop two recent models for the LbpB:Lf interaction that proposed that the LbpB N-lobe bound to the Lf C-lobe [11] or to the Lf N-lobe [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Since both models were developed without any supporting experimental data, it was important to implement experimental studies to probe the LbpB-Lf interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In this study the combined results from the biolayer interferometry binding studies (Fig 3), crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry (XL-MS) and hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HX-MS) (Fig 5) clearly indicate that the LbpB N-lobe binds to the hLf C-lobe analogous to what has been demonstrated for the Tf-TbpB interaction [4], thus supporting its potential role in iron acquisition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our crosslinking studies support the orthogonal orientation of the N-lobe and C-lobe (S1 Fig, S1 Table, S2 Table) and preferential association of the anchor peptide with the C-lobe (S1 Fig, S1 Table), features that have been proposed to be important for the transfer of iron-loaded Tf to TbpA [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Although hLf is secreted from mucosal glandular cells in the apo form, due to its ability to sequester iron, there may be a substantial proportion of holo (iron-loaded) hLf at the relatively low levels present under normal conditions on the mucosal surface [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Similarly, during invasive infection within the bloodstream hLf may predominantly be in the iron-loaded form. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The ability to discriminate between the holo and apo forms of hLf (Fig 2) suggests that LbpB could serve an analogous function as TbpB by preferentially capturing holo-hLf under these conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Since the prevalence of the NalP gene is estimated to only be 88% in carriage and invasive isolates and the gene is subjected to phase variation by the presence of poly C tracts [36], there would be opportunities to select for isolates with efficient acquisition from hLf under these conditions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Since activated neutrophils secrete large concentrations of apo-Lf, this mode of binding may be particularly important at sites of inflammation, potentially inhibiting the release of cationic antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic cleavage of apo Lf or directly complexing the released cationic peptides. </plain></SENT>
