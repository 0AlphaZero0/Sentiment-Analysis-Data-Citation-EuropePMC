We examined how SEP inequalities in inflammation &#x02013;assessed using C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen&#x02013; varied across the adult age span. Current (household income) and distal (education) markers of SEP were used. Data from 7,943 participants (aged 25+) of <italic>Understanding Society</italic> (wave 2, 1/2010-3/2012) were employed. We found that SEP inequalities in inflammation followed heterogeneous patterns by age, which differed by the inflammatory marker examined rather than by SEP measures. SEP inequalities in CRP emerged in 30s, increased up to mid-50s or early 60&#x02009;s when they peaked and then decreased with age. SEP inequalities in fibrinogen decreased with age. Body mass index (BMI), smoking, physical activity and healthy diet explained part, but not all, of the SEP inequalities in inflammation; in general, BMI exerted the largest attenuation. Cumulative advantage theories and those considering age as a leveler for the accumulation of health and economic advantages across the life-span should be dynamically integrated to better understand the observed heterogeneity in SEP differences in health across the lifespan. The attenuating roles of health-related lifestyle indicators suggest that targeting health promotion policies may help reduce SEP inequalities in health.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although it is well established that socio-economically disadvantaged groups experience poor health, less is known about how the association between socio-economic position (SEP) and health evolves over the lifecycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The cumulative advantage hypothesis (SEP and health disadvantages interact and accumulate over time, indicating higher inequalities by age) and/or the age-as-leveler hypothesis (the inevitable decline of health dominates social differences at older ages) are the predominant explanations, and studies find evidence in favour of the former<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the latter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, or both hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Integrating a life-course perspective to explore associations at different ages, therefore, is important for understanding the pathways through which SEP gets &#x0201c;under the skin&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Systemic inflammation has been proposed as a physiological process linking SEP to health, and it can emerge though several pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>; the more widely held of which are stress-mediated factors and psychosocial processes involving the hypothalamic axis and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Inflammation, therefore, may be crucial in understanding the evolution of SEP inequalities in morbidity and mortality risks at different ages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Most existing studies do not explicitly consider the full adult age span when analysing the association between SEP and inflammation (often assessed using C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen biomarkers), they are limited to describing associations between measures of SEP at various life stages (such as childhood and adulthood) and the inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In general, these studies have found a negative association between SEP and CRP and fibrinogen, which in some reports shows sex differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; however it is unclear how these associations differ across the lifespan. Although the SEP-inflammation association has been hypothesized to vary by age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, this has received limited attention in the literature, being explicitly explored in very few studies and revealing no consistent pattern. For example, studies in the USA and Finland found a negative SEP-CRP association for those aged less than 60 years but not for older age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, while another US study found systematic (but diminishing with age) educational differences in CRP for those aged 50+<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Over and above the psychosocial pathway (such as stress, affective states etc.), health-related lifestyle indicators (such as Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking, physical activity, and diet quality) have been found to be important pathways though which SEP might impact inflammation burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, with BMI appeared to exert the most prominent role<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, no consensus has been found on the importance of their mediation roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Age could be also an important factor in understanding the extent to which these behaviours explain the SEP-inflammation association because age may moderate the association of health-related behaviours with both SEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, the effects of health-related lifestyle factors on the incidence of adverse health outcomes are often characterized by cumulative, long-lasting processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These indicate the importance of taking a life span perspective with respect to the relationships between SEP, health-related lifestyle indicators and inflammation.</p><p>The current study examines the association of two measures of SEP (education and household income) with inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fibrinogen) across the adult age span using a large national representative sample (<italic>Understanding Society</italic>: the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study; UKHLS). We capitalize on the wide age range available to investigate how the association of SEP with CRP and fibrinogen varies by age, allowing for flexible associations between age, SEP and the inflammatory biomarkers. This is the first study that examines whether SEP inequalities in inflammatory markers are apparent across the full adult age span, and if not when they emerge and/or converge. Finally, we explore the role of health-related lifestyle indicators in attenuating the SEP-inflammation gradients across the age span.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From the study potential sample of 9,181 respondents (UKHLS, wave 2), 754 had missing CRP (including those with CRP&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;mg/L) or fibrinogen values, 267 had no or invalid BMI data and 217 lacked information on the remaining variables, giving an analytical sample of 7,943 individuals. Comparisons between the raw means of the potential and analysis sample showed limited differences in the utilized variables, suggesting that the impact of item missingness might be negligible.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bivariate analysis across age groups</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the mean levels of CRP (Panel A) and fibrinogen (Panel B) by gender, household income (in tertiles), education and lifestyle indicators for different age groups and for the total sample. Mean CRP levels were lower for those belonging to higher versus lower socio-economic groups for both education and income markers of SEP in all age groups except the younger (25&#x02013;34) and the older (80+). To allow for a clearer presentation of how the unadjusted associations of the inflammatory biomarkers with each of the variables used in our analysis varied by age groups, percentage differences in the inflammatory biomarkers by categories of these variables across age groups are also presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For example, differences in mean CRP levels between the lowest and the highest income tertiles reached a maximum of about 0.565&#x02009;mg/L at the 35&#x02013;49 age group (i.e., moving from the highest to the lowest income tertiles there is a 35.4% increase in the mean CRP levels). Similarly, the education gradient in CRP emerged in the 35&#x02013;49 age group after which it peaked in the 50&#x02013;64 age group (lowest/highest education group mean CRP differences of 0.931&#x02009;mg/L, which corresponded to a 54.8% increase in CRP when switching from &#x0201c;degree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;no qualifications&#x0201d;) and then began to narrow.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mean CRP and fibrinogen levels by gender, SEP and health-related lifestyle indicators across different ages<sup>a</sup>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="6">Age groups</th></tr><tr><th>25&#x02013;34 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;964)</th><th>35&#x02013;49 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2357)</th><th>50&#x02013;64 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2516)</th><th>65&#x02013;79 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1771)</th><th>80&#x02009;+&#x02009;(n&#x02009;=&#x02009;335)</th><th>Total sample (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7943)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="7">

In order to simplify the visualisation of the education differences in inflammation by age (Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), we group the middle three education categories into one, while for the rest of our analysis the detailed set of education categories was employed; the corresponding graphs in the case of the detailed education categories revealed practically identical patterns to those in Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> (see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To facilitate interpretation, the corresponding absolute differences in CRP levels between the lowest and the highest SEP groups (i.e., income and education gradients in CRP) are also presented (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c and d</xref>). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref> show increasing predicted CRP levels with increasing age for all SEP groups. Those with lower SEP have higher CRP levels compared to those of higher SEP across most of the age groups; except young adulthood and very old ages where non-statistically significant SEP differences in CRP were observed (chi-squared tests: two-tailed p-values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c and d</xref> further illustrate the presence of age heterogeneity in SEP differences in CRP (SEP-age interactions: p-values&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Specifically, income-related inequalities in CRP emerged around the age of 30 (zero lies outside the 95% CI), after which they peaked at the age of 55 (difference between lowest/highest income group: 0.569&#x02009;mg/L; 95% CI: 0.400, 0.737) and then began to narrow, converging around the age of 75. The education gradient in CRP emerged and peaked slightly latter (around the age of 37 and 60 years, respectively); the largest education difference in CRP is about 0.983&#x02009;mg/L (95% CI: 0.752, 1.215). This gradient then reduced with age and became non-significant at around the age of 80 years.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trajectories of CRP (mg/L) and the predicted CRP gradients by household income and education across age.

The fact that the CRP differences by SEP reduced in magnitude after adjusting for lifestyle factors suggested that each of these lifestyle factors partially (but not fully) attenuated the SEP gradients in CRP (F-test for the joint significance of SEP main effects and their age interactions across models accounting for lifestyle indicators; p-values&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000).

</p><p>Notable age variations were observed in the SEP differences in CRP that attributed to the role of each lifestyle factor (i.e., health behaviour pathways; obtained by comparing the SEP gradient with and without accounting for each of the lifestyle indicators at different ages). Specifically, accounting for BMI or smoking resulted in lower reductions in the income gradients in CRP with increasing age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). For example, following adjustments for BMI, the difference in the CRP levels between the lowest and the highest income group (income gradient in CRP) reduced by about 55% at the age of 35 (from 0.359&#x02009;mg/L to 0.165&#x02009;mg/L; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), while the corresponding reduction was 22% at the age of 70 (from 0.322&#x02009;mg/L to 0.247&#x02009;mg/L; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). On the other hand, accounting for physical activity or healthy diet habits, a higher reduction in the income gradients in CRP was evident at early and later middle life rather than at younger ages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).</p><p>BMI played the greatest role in attenuating the education gradients in CRP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Focusing at the age interval for which education differences in CRP are evident (i.e., 40s to late 70s; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), we found limited age variations in the attenuating roles (i.e. percentage of the SEP gradient explained) of BMI and physical activity. Following BMI adjustments, the education gradients in CRP reduced by about 35% vs 30% at the age of 40 and 70, respectively. The attenuating roles of smoking and healthy diet habits were larger at early and later middle life compared to older ages (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). For example, smoking status accounted for 40% of the education gradients in CRP at the age of 40 compared to 9% at around the age of 75; similar in magnitude was the attenuating role of our healthy diet indicators (i.e., accounted for about 35% and 9% of the education gradients in CRP at the age of 40 and 75, respectively).</p><p>The income gradients in fibrinogen are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. BMI became less relevant in attenuating the income differences in fibrinogen as age increases, while the opposite holds for physical activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). For example, 33% of the income differences in fibrinogen are attributed to the role of BMI at the age of 25 versus 8% at the age of 70. Smoking seemed to explain a larger (percentage) part of the income gradients in fibrinogen by age; smoking adjustments reduced the income gradient in fibrinogen by about 15% (from 0.194&#x02009;g/L to 0.167&#x02009;g/L; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) around the age of 25 versus 35% (from 0.072&#x02009;g/L to 0.046&#x02009;g/L; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) for those at 70&#x02009;s. On the other hand, there were limited age variations in the attenuating role of healthy diet in the income gradient in fibrinogen. Simultaneously accounting for all the lifestyle indicators resulted in reduced, but still evident income gradient in fibrinogen (f-test for the joint significance of income main effects and their age interactions; two-tailed p-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.000). The results for education are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>; however, as had been already stated, the education gradients in fibrinogen did not systematically vary by age (education-age interactions; two-tailed p-values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.10).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Predicted SEP gradients in fibrinogen (g/L) by age: the role of &#x00392;&#x0039c;&#x00399;, healthy diet, smoking and physical activity.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>Sensitivity analysis with medications resulted in practically identical results compared to those presented in the main analysis. Specifically, accounting for medications did not change the observed inequality patterns by age or the explanatory role of each of the health-related lifestyle indicators on the pertinent inequalities. Moreover, our finding did not substantially differ after excluding people taking medications that may affect CRP or fibrinogen levels (about 18% of the sample) from the analysis, suggesting that our conclusions are not subject to potential biases associated with the role of medications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using data from a large nationally representative sample of adults aged 25 and older (UKHLS), we find that the negative association between higher SEP (assessed by education attainment and equivalised household income) and inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fibrinogen) follows heterogeneous patterns as a function of age. These age patterns vary by the inflammatory biomarker examined (CRP or fibrinogen) rather than the utilised marker of SEP. In general, we find that SEP inequalities in CRP emerge in people aged in their 30&#x02009;s, and increase up to mid-50s or early 60&#x02009;s, when they peaked. They then begin to narrow, converging at older ages (75 and 85 for income- and education-related inequalities, respectively). The SEP inequalities in fibrinogen monotonically decrease with age; however, these inequalities systematically vary with age only when income is used as an SEP marker.</p><p>Accounting for BMI, smoking status, physical activity and healthy diet habits - either separately or jointly - explains part (but not all) of SEP gradients in CRP as a function of age. In general, BMI exerted the largest explanatory role compared with other health-related lifestyle indicators. We find considerable age heterogeneity in the SEP differences in inflammation that attributed to the role of each lifestyle indicator; these age variations are specific to both the inflammatory biomarker and the SEP measure considered. Most of the lifestyle indicators either become gradually less relevant in attenuating the magnitude of the SEP differences in inflammation with increasing age or exerts attenuating roles that accumulate with age, becoming more evident at early and later middle life than at younger ages.</p><p>Allowing for flexibility in the negative association between SEP and inflammatory biomarkers with age, this study demonstrated strong age-specific patterns that have often been masked in the previous literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In relation to age heterogeneity in SEP-CRP association, our findings are broadly consistent with the few studies available that suggest negative associations in individuals younger than 60 but not in older age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A US study on people aged 50+ have found that the educational differences in CRP diminish with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Our evidence regarding reduced income-inequalities in fibrinogen by age extends the limited number of previous studies that have compared similar associations across arbitrarily defined age groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, to a representative Great Britain sample of the whole age range.</p><p>In general, these findings highlight that no single hypothesis explains the observed age patterns in the SEP inequalities in inflammation. Features from both the cumulative advantage and the age-as-leveler hypotheses can be integrated in a dynamic relationship, with their relative importance varying across the lifespan. Specifically, the fact that SEP inequalities in CRP are concave with age, peaking in later middle life, is consistent with the cumulative advantage hypothesis until midlife, and the age-as-leveler hypothesis may be the leading driving force thereafter. However, this finding is not universal because the age patterns associated with SEP inequalities in fibrinogen appear to imply the dominant role of the age-as-leveler over the cumulative advantage hypothesis across the lifespan. This indicates that deterioration in health as an inevitable biological process (age-as-leveler hypotheses) is more relevant for SEP association across the whole adult lifespan on fibrinogen than CRP; perhaps because CRP purely reflects inflammatory load that may accumulate and interact over time, while fibrinogen also reflects other physiological processes such as haemostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>The fact that health-related lifestyle indicators partially but not fully attenuate SEP inequalities in inflammation is consistent with several previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and indicates that although the health behaviours are important pathways in the SEP-inflammation association, additional mechanisms &#x02013; such as stress-related physiological responses to disadvantaged SEP &#x02013; may be part of the process. Moreover, the dominant role of BMI in explaining these inequalities is not unexpected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; excess adiposity is strongly associated with elevated CRP <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and is socially patterned<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Of particular importance, our results about the prominent role of BMI -as opposed to all the other lifestyle factors considered (smoking, physical activity and diet quality)- are confirmed by a recent SEP-inflammation study, where a wider array of inflammatory markers and a more comprehensive diet quality measure was examined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our findings that the explanatory role of these lifestyle indicators is age specific and varies by the measure of the SEP may reflect disparities in the association between the lifestyle indicators and both inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and SEP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> across different ages. However, our results imply that health promotion policies aimed toward supporting disadvantaged people in adopting healthy behaviours at younger ages may be beneficial in both the short and long term. This is because accounting for health-related lifestyle indicators resulted in substantial attenuations in the magnitude of the SEP inequalities in inflammation at young adulthood, or their health impacts may accumulate and thus be more effective later in life.</p><p>In accordance with some<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but not all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, of the existing reports, our findings indicated that there was no moderating role of sex on the association between SEP and inflammation. These disparities may be attributed to differences in both age ranges and population composition across different studies. For instance, although some US studies have suggested gender differences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, such studies were limited to a narrow age range and their findings were not always confirmed by evidence from the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>This paper is the first to provide a thorough examination of SEP inequalities in CRP and fibrinogen allowing for flexible age gradients as well as both current (household income) and more distal (education) SEP measures. However, there are a number of potential limitations. Firstly, the analyses are broadly cross-sectional in nature and, thus, we are not able to make assertions about causality or to disentangle age and cohort effects. However, van Kippersluis <italic>et al</italic>. found no consistent cohort effects on income-related inequalities in health for the UK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Although further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate these issues, our study highlights the importance of considering a wide age span in the case of the SEP inequalities in health. Secondly, our inflammatory biomarkers do not capture all aspects of inflammation given the complexity of the inflammatory profiles and their regulation (such as synergistic effects of inflammation biomarkers or the resolving role of anti-inflammatory mechanisms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For example, CRP captures inflammatory load and therefore does not provide information of specific pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways or other aspects of immunity. However, more specific biomarkers such as the interleukins, other cytokines, interferons or complement factors were not available in UKHLS. Our results seemed to be broadly in line with studies that examine a wider range of measures of inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and further research is needed to confirm the generalisability of the proposed age patterns in the case of a broader set of inflammatory biomarkers. A further concern is that smoking status, physical activity and adoption of healthy diet habits are based on self-reported data which may be subject to measurement error. Moreover, even though similar diet variables were used in previous SEP-inflammation studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, our diet indicators are only partial markers of diet quality. Future research that allows for more detailed diet information may be useful to better understand its role on shaping the SEP inequalities in inflammation across the life-cycle. Thirdly, our sample, while representative of the GB population, is predominantly composed of White/European participants and therefore we cannot generalize to non-White groups. Studies suggesting ethnic differences in SEP-inflammation associations originate from the US<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and may not apply to the UK ethnic minority groups. Fourthly, our results may be biased because of selective dropout and exclusion of those on anti-inflammatory medications at blood sample collection. However, sample weights account for these unequal selection effects. Finally, mortality selection may distort associations at older ages, although it has been shown that needs not necessarily be true<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Mortality rates in 2013 in the UK did not exceed 2% before the age of 72 years and 5% before the age of 80 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>; this may indicate that our results for those 80+ should be treated with caution.</p><p>By focusing on inflammatory biomarkers, which have been proposed as a physiological process linking SEP to health, we highlight the importance of considering a life span perspective in order to better understand the process through which SEP gets &#x0201c;under the skin&#x0201d;. We find that SEP inequalities in inflammation are concave or diminish with age, depending on the inflammatory biomarker considered. These results may indicate the importance of integrating features from both existing life-course theories (cumulative advantage and the age-as-leveler hypothesis), with their relative role varying across the lifespan, in order to explain the observed heterogeneity in the SEP inequalities in health across the life span. The attenuating role of health-related lifestyle indicators suggests that targeting health promotion policies may help to reduce SEP inequalities in health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data source and sample</title><p>This study used data from the General Population Sample (GPS) of the UKHLS, which is a large, national representative panel survey covering about 32,000 households in the UK at wave 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.
