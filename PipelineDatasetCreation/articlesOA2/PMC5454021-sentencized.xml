</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although it is well established that socio-economically disadvantaged groups experience poor health, less is known about how the association between socio-economic position (SEP) and health evolves over the lifecycle1–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The cumulative advantage hypothesis (SEP and health disadvantages interact and accumulate over time, indicating higher inequalities by age) and/or the age-as-leveler hypothesis (the inevitable decline of health dominates social differences at older ages) are the predominant explanations, and studies find evidence in favour of the former1, 2, the latter6, or both hypotheses4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Integrating a life-course perspective to explore associations at different ages, therefore, is important for understanding the pathways through which SEP gets “under the skin”4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Systemic inflammation has been proposed as a physiological process linking SEP to health, and it can emerge though several pathways7–10; the more widely held of which are stress-mediated factors and psychosocial processes involving the hypothalamic axis and the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems8–11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Inflammation, therefore, may be crucial in understanding the evolution of SEP inequalities in morbidity and mortality risks at different ages12. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most existing studies do not explicitly consider the full adult age span when analysing the association between SEP and inflammation (often assessed using C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen biomarkers), they are limited to describing associations between measures of SEP at various life stages (such as childhood and adulthood) and the inflammatory biomarkers in adulthood13–19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In general, these studies have found a negative association between SEP and CRP and fibrinogen, which in some reports shows sex differences17; however it is unclear how these associations differ across the lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Although the SEP-inflammation association has been hypothesized to vary by age20, 21, this has received limited attention in the literature, being explicitly explored in very few studies and revealing no consistent pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For example, studies in the USA and Finland found a negative SEP-CRP association for those aged less than 60 years but not for older age groups20, 22, while another US study found systematic (but diminishing with age) educational differences in CRP for those aged 50+21. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Over and above the psychosocial pathway (such as stress, affective states etc.), health-related lifestyle indicators (such as Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking, physical activity, and diet quality) have been found to be important pathways though which SEP might impact inflammation burden8, 14, 16, 17, 23, with BMI appeared to exert the most prominent role8, 13, 14, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, no consensus has been found on the importance of their mediation roles14, 17, 18, 23, 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Age could be also an important factor in understanding the extent to which these behaviours explain the SEP-inflammation association because age may moderate the association of health-related behaviours with both SEP3 and inflammation25, 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the effects of health-related lifestyle factors on the incidence of adverse health outcomes are often characterized by cumulative, long-lasting processes27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These indicate the importance of taking a life span perspective with respect to the relationships between SEP, health-related lifestyle indicators and inflammation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The current study examines the association of two measures of SEP (education and household income) with inflammatory biomarkers (CRP and fibrinogen) across the adult age span using a large national representative sample (Understanding Society: the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study; UKHLS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We capitalize on the wide age range available to investigate how the association of SEP with CRP and fibrinogen varies by age, allowing for flexible associations between age, SEP and the inflammatory biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This is the first study that examines whether SEP inequalities in inflammatory markers are apparent across the full adult age span, and if not when they emerge and/or converge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Finally, we explore the role of health-related lifestyle indicators in attenuating the SEP-inflammation gradients across the age span. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>From the study potential sample of 9,181 respondents (UKHLS, wave 2), 754 had missing CRP (including those with CRP &gt; 10 mg/L) or fibrinogen values, 267 had no or invalid BMI data and 217 lacked information on the remaining variables, giving an analytical sample of 7,943 individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Comparisons between the raw means of the potential and analysis sample showed limited differences in the utilized variables, suggesting that the impact of item missingness might be negligible. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Table 1 presents the mean levels of CRP (Panel A) and fibrinogen (Panel B) by gender, household income (in tertiles), education and lifestyle indicators for different age groups and for the total sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Mean CRP levels were lower for those belonging to higher versus lower socio-economic groups for both education and income markers of SEP in all age groups except the younger (25–34) and the older (80+). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To allow for a clearer presentation of how the unadjusted associations of the inflammatory biomarkers with each of the variables used in our analysis varied by age groups, percentage differences in the inflammatory biomarkers by categories of these variables across age groups are also presented in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>For example, differences in mean CRP levels between the lowest and the highest income tertiles reached a maximum of about 0.565 mg/L at the 35–49 age group (i.e., moving from the highest to the lowest income tertiles there is a 35.4% increase in the mean CRP levels). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the education gradient in CRP emerged in the 35–49 age group after which it peaked in the 50–64 age group (lowest/highest education group mean CRP differences of 0.931 mg/L, which corresponded to a 54.8% increase in CRP when switching from “degree” to “no qualifications”) and then began to narrow.Table 1Mean CRP and fibrinogen levels by gender, SEP and health-related lifestyle indicators across different agesa.Age groups25–34 (n = 964)35–49 (n = 2357)50–64 (n = 2516)65–79 (n = 1771)80 + (n = 335)Total sample (n = 7943) Panel A.

<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>We find considerable age heterogeneity in the SEP differences in inflammation that attributed to the role of each lifestyle indicator; these age variations are specific to both the inflammatory biomarker and the SEP measure considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Most of the lifestyle indicators either become gradually less relevant in attenuating the magnitude of the SEP differences in inflammation with increasing age or exerts attenuating roles that accumulate with age, becoming more evident at early and later middle life than at younger ages. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In relation to age heterogeneity in SEP-CRP association, our findings are broadly consistent with the few studies available that suggest negative associations in individuals younger than 60 but not in older age groups20, 22. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In general, these findings highlight that no single hypothesis explains the observed age patterns in the SEP inequalities in inflammation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Features from both the cumulative advantage and the age-as-leveler hypotheses can be integrated in a dynamic relationship, with their relative importance varying across the lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the fact that SEP inequalities in CRP are concave with age, peaking in later middle life, is consistent with the cumulative advantage hypothesis until midlife, and the age-as-leveler hypothesis may be the leading driving force thereafter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>However, this finding is not universal because the age patterns associated with SEP inequalities in fibrinogen appear to imply the dominant role of the age-as-leveler over the cumulative advantage hypothesis across the lifespan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>This indicates that deterioration in health as an inevitable biological process (age-as-leveler hypotheses) is more relevant for SEP association across the whole adult lifespan on fibrinogen than CRP; perhaps because CRP purely reflects inflammatory load that may accumulate and interact over time, while fibrinogen also reflects other physiological processes such as haemostasis28. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The fact that health-related lifestyle indicators partially but not fully attenuate SEP inequalities in inflammation is consistent with several previous studies8, 14, 16, 17, 23 and indicates that although the health behaviours are important pathways in the SEP-inflammation association, additional mechanisms – such as stress-related physiological responses to disadvantaged SEP – may be part of the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the dominant role of BMI in explaining these inequalities is not unexpected13, 14, 23; excess adiposity is strongly associated with elevated CRP 14 and is socially patterned29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Of particular importance, our results about the prominent role of BMI -as opposed to all the other lifestyle factors considered (smoking, physical activity and diet quality)- are confirmed by a recent SEP-inflammation study, where a wider array of inflammatory markers and a more comprehensive diet quality measure was examined23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Our findings that the explanatory role of these lifestyle indicators is age specific and varies by the measure of the SEP may reflect disparities in the association between the lifestyle indicators and both inflammation25, 26 and SEP3 across different ages. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>This is because accounting for health-related lifestyle indicators resulted in substantial attenuations in the magnitude of the SEP inequalities in inflammation at young adulthood, or their health impacts may accumulate and thus be more effective later in life. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>These disparities may be attributed to differences in both age ranges and population composition across different studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>For instance, although some US studies have suggested gender differences14, 17, such studies were limited to a narrow age range and their findings were not always confirmed by evidence from the UK33. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>However, there are a number of potential limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the analyses are broadly cross-sectional in nature and, thus, we are not able to make assertions about causality or to disentangle age and cohort effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>However, van Kippersluis et al. found no consistent cohort effects on income-related inequalities in health for the UK5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Although further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate these issues, our study highlights the importance of considering a wide age span in the case of the SEP inequalities in health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Secondly, our inflammatory biomarkers do not capture all aspects of inflammation given the complexity of the inflammatory profiles and their regulation (such as synergistic effects of inflammation biomarkers or the resolving role of anti-inflammatory mechanisms)23, 34, 35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>For example, CRP captures inflammatory load and therefore does not provide information of specific pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways or other aspects of immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>However, more specific biomarkers such as the interleukins, other cytokines, interferons or complement factors were not available in UKHLS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Our results seemed to be broadly in line with studies that examine a wider range of measures of inflammation23 and further research is needed to confirm the generalisability of the proposed age patterns in the case of a broader set of inflammatory biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>A further concern is that smoking status, physical activity and adoption of healthy diet habits are based on self-reported data which may be subject to measurement error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Moreover, even though similar diet variables were used in previous SEP-inflammation studies33, our diet indicators are only partial markers of diet quality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Future research that allows for more detailed diet information may be useful to better understand its role on shaping the SEP inequalities in inflammation across the life-cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, our sample, while representative of the GB population, is predominantly composed of White/European participants and therefore we cannot generalize to non-White groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Studies suggesting ethnic differences in SEP-inflammation associations originate from the US14, 17, 21 and may not apply to the UK ethnic minority groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Fourthly, our results may be biased because of selective dropout and exclusion of those on anti-inflammatory medications at blood sample collection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>However, sample weights account for these unequal selection effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Finally, mortality selection may distort associations at older ages, although it has been shown that needs not necessarily be true36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in 2013 in the UK did not exceed 2% before the age of 72 years and 5% before the age of 80 years37; this may indicate that our results for those 80+ should be treated with caution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>By focusing on inflammatory biomarkers, which have been proposed as a physiological process linking SEP to health, we highlight the importance of considering a life span perspective in order to better understand the process through which SEP gets “under the skin”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>We find that SEP inequalities in inflammation are concave or diminish with age, depending on the inflammatory biomarker considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>These results may indicate the importance of integrating features from both existing life-course theories (cumulative advantage and the age-as-leveler hypothesis), with their relative role varying across the lifespan, in order to explain the observed heterogeneity in the SEP inequalities in health across the life span. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>A cubic age polynomial provided the best statistical fit, and was included in the models and interacted with gender in order to capture gender differences in the age trajectories of these biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>To explore if the association of SEP with CRP and fibrinogen varied with age, the polynomial age variables were interacted with SEP (“age interacted base models”). </plain></SENT>
