</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Meiotic recombination is a fundamental genetic process that generates new combinations of alleles on which natural selection can act and, in most sexually-reproducing organisms, plays critical roles in the proper alignment and segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (Coop and Przeworski, 2007; de Massy, 2013; Lam and Keeney, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Meiotic recombination is initiated by a set of double strand breaks (DSBs) deliberately inflicted throughout the genome, whose repair leads to crossover and non-crossover recombination events (Lam and Keeney, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Most of the molecular machinery involved in this process in vertebrates has been conserved since the common ancestor of plants, animals and fungi (de Massy, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Notably, in all sexually reproducing species that have been examined, the SPO11 protein generates DSBs, which localize to histone H3 lysine K4 trimethylation marks (H3K4me3) along the genome (Borde et al., 2009; Buard et al., 2009; Lam and Keeney, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Yet not all features of meiotic recombination are conserved across species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>As one example, in many species, including all yeast, plant and vertebrate species studied to date, recombination events are localized to short intervals (of hundreds to thousands of base pairs; Lange et al., 2016) known as recombination hotspots, whereas in others, such as in flies or worms, the recombination landscape seems more uniform, lacking such hotspots (Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009; Chan et al., 2012; Heil et al. 2015) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Among species with recombination hotspots, there are at least two mechanisms directing their location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In mammalian species, including apes, mice and likely cattle, the locations of recombination hotspots are specified by PRDM9 binding (Baudat et al., 2010; Myers et al., 2010; Parvanov et al., 2010; Sandor et al., 2012; Great Ape Genome Project et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In these species, PRDM9 has four major functional domains: a KRAB, SSXRD and PR/SET domain (referred to as the SET domain in what follows), followed by a C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) array (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>During meiosis, PRDM9 binds sequences throughout the genome, as specified by its ZF array (reviewed in Ségurel et al., 2011), and the SET domain of PRDM9 makes H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks nearby (Eram et al., 2014; Powers et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>These actions ultimately serve to recruit SPO11 to initiate DSBs, by a mechanism that remains unknown but is associated with the presence of both histone marks (Grey et al., 2017; Getun et al., 2017) and may involve KRAB and SSXRD domains (Parvanov et al., 2017).10.7554/eLife.24133.003Figure 1.Phylogenetic distribution and evolution of PRDM9 orthologs in vertebrates.Shown are the four domains: KRAB domain (in tan), SSXRD (in white), PR/SET (in light green) and ZF (in gray/dark green; the approximate structure of identified ZFs is also shown). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>A common feature of the recombination landscape in these species is that recombination tends to be directed away from PRDM9-independent H3K4me3 peaks (Brick et al., 2012) and, in particular, only a small proportion of hotspots occurs at transcription start sites (TSSs; Myers et al., 2005; Coop et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in yeasts, plants, and vertebrate species (such as birds and canids) that lack functional PRDM9 orthologs, recombination events are concentrated at or near promoter-like features, including TSSs and CpG islands (CGIs), perhaps because they are associated with greater chromatin accessibility (Lichten and Goldman, 1995; Auton et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2013; Hellsten et al., 2013; Lam and Keeney, 2015; Singhal et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in mouse knockouts for PRDM9, recombination events appear to default to promoter-like features that carry H3K4me3 peaks (Brick et al., 2012; Narasimhan et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The two mechanisms by which recombination events are targeted to the genome are associated with dramatic differences in the evolution of recombination hotspots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>When recombination is directed by PRDM9, hotspot locations are not shared between closely related ape species or between mouse subspecies and differ even among human populations (Ptak et al., 2004; Myers et al., 2005; Ptak et al., 2005; Coop et al., 2008; Hinch et al., 2011; Auton et al., 2012; Great Ape Genome Project et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This rapid evolution appears to be driven by two phenomena. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>First, the binding specificity of the PRDM9 ZF leads to the existence of ‘hotter’ and ‘colder’ alleles, that is, sequences that are more or less likely to be bound by PRDM9 (Myers et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In heterozygotes carrying a colder and a hotter allele, this asymmetry in binding leads to the hotter alleles more often experiencing a DSB (Baker et al., 2015; Davies et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Since repair mechanisms use the intact, colder allele as a template, the sequences to which PRDM9 binds are preferentially lost (Boulton et al., 1997; Kauppi et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>This process of under-transmission of the hotter allele in hot/cold heterozygotes acts analogously to selection for the colder allele (Nagylaki and Petes, 1982) and is thus expected to drive the rapid loss of hotspots from the population (leading to the ‘hotspot paradox’; Pineda-Krch and Redfield, 2005; Coop and Myers, 2007), consistent with empirical observations in humans and mice (Berg et al., 2010; Myers et al., 2010; Baker et al., 2015; Smagulova et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In addition to this loss of hotspots in cis, changes in the PRDM9 binding domain can also lead to the rapid loss—and gain—of whole sets of hotspots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PRDM9 has the fastest evolving C2H2 ZF array in the mouse and human genomes (Oliver et al., 2009; Myers et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>More generally, mammalian PRDM9 genes show strong evidence of positive selection at known DNA-binding sites of ZFs (Oliver et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Thus, in mammals carrying PRDM9, individual hotspots are lost quickly over evolutionary time, but changes in the PRDM9 ZF generate novel sets of hotspots, leading to rapid turnover in the fine-scale recombination landscape between populations and species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The mechanism driving the rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF is unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that the under-transmission of hotter alleles eventually leads to the erosion of a sufficient number of hotspots that the proper alignment or segregation of homologs during meiosis is jeopardized, strongly favoring new ZF alleles (Coop and Myers, 2007; Myers et al., 2010; Ubeda and Wilkins, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Whether hotspot loss would exert a sufficiently strong and immediate selection pressure to explain the very rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation has emerged recently from the finding that in mice, widespread asymmetric binding by PRDM9 on the two homologs is associated with hybrid sterility (Davies et al., 2016; Smagulova et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Since older PRDM9 motifs are more likely to have experienced erosion and hence to be found in heterozygotes for hotter and colder alleles, there may be an immediate advantage to new ZFs that lead to greater symmetry in PRDM9 binding (Davies et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the explanation, the rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF is likely tied to its role in recombination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in species that do not use PRDM9 to direct meiotic recombination events, the rapid evolution of recombination hotspots is not seen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In birds that lack an ortholog of PRDM9, the locations of recombination hotspots are conserved over long evolutionary time scales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both the location and heats of recombination hotspots are conserved across highly diverged yeast species, in which H3K4me3 marks are made by a single gene without a DNA binding domain (Lam and Keeney, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>In these taxa, it remains unknown whether the coincidence of recombination with functional genomic elements, such as TSSs and CGIs, is facilitated by specific binding motifs or simply by greater accessibility of the recombination machinery to these genomic regions (Brick et al., 2012; Auton et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2013; Lam and Keeney, 2015; Singhal et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Even if there are specific motifs that increase rates of recombination near functional genomic elements, they are likely to have important, pleiotropic consequences (Nicolas et al., 1989). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Thus, there may be a strong countervailing force to the loss of hotspots by under-transmission of hotter alleles in these cases, leading to the evolutionary stability of hotspots. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>These observations sketch the outline of a general pattern, whereby species that do not use PRDM9 to direct recombination target promoter-like features and have stable fine-scale recombination landscapes, whereas those that employ PRDM9 tend to recombine away from promoters and experience rapid turnover of hotspot locations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This dramatic difference in the localization of hotspots and their evolutionary dynamics has important evolutionary consequences for genome structure and base composition, for linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels along the genome, as well as for introgression patterns in naturally occurring hybrids (Fullerton et al., 2001; McVean et al., 2004; Duret and Galtier, 2009; Janoušek et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>It is therefore important to establish the generality of these two mechanisms and characterize their distribution across species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>To date, studies of fine-scale recombination rates are limited to a handful of organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In particular, although it has been previously reported that the PRDM9 gene arose early in metazoan evolution (Oliver et al., 2009), direct evidence of its role in recombination is limited to placental mammals (mice, primates and more circumstantially cattle). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>The first line of evidence is that there is no observation of rapid evolution of the ZF domains in PRDM9 orthologs from which KRAB and SSXRD domains have apparently been lost (including a subset of species in which the catalytic activity of the SET domain is seemingly conserved), suggesting that there has not been rapid evolution of binding specificity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Since plausible models suggest that the rapid evolution of PRDM9 binding affinity is a consequence of the role of this gene in directing recombination (see Introduction), this observation suggests that all four domains are required for this role. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>The second piece of evidence is that swordtail fish with a truncated copy of PRDM9 that is missing KRAB and SSXRD domains behave like PRDM9 knockouts in their fine-scale recombination patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>It is unclear if this behavior can be attributed to loss of the N terminal domains, since two key catalytic residues within the SET domain were also substituted in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>However, substitutions at catalytic residues are only seen in PRDM9 genes that have lost KRAB and/or SSXRD domains or have lost the ZF entirely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>When the ZF is lost, PRDM9 obviously cannot induce DSBs by binding DNA and its new role may not require the same methyltransferase specificities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the absence of KRAB and SSXRD domains in a PRDM9 ortholog may similarly signify that PRDM9 is no longer used to direct recombination and lead to reduced constraint on the catalytic activities of the SET domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent paper suggests that the KRAB domain may play a role in recruiting the recombination machinery (Parvanov et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>If the partial ortholog of PRDM9 is not used to direct recombination at all, then the overall conservation of the protein points to another role of the gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>In that regard, we note that partial PRDM9 orthologs share their domain architecture with other members of the PRDM gene family, many of which act as transcription factors (Hayashi et al., 2005; Vervoort et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Conversely, if the presence of all four domains, conservation of catalytic residues, and the rapid evolution of the ZF array are sufficient indications of PRDM9-directed recombination, then the role of PRDM9 in directing recombination appears to have originated before the diversification of vertebrates. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>It further appears that the intact PRDM9 has often been duplicated, with more than one copy associated with recombination rate variation in cattle (Sandor et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Based on the RAxML tree of the SET domain, we count 55 independent cases of duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>How commonly more than one copy of PRDM9 retains a role in directing recombination remains to be investigated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>More generally, the distribution of PRDM9 across vertebrates raises the question of why species switch repeatedly from one recombination mechanism to another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Although PRDM9-directed recombination clearly confers enough of an advantage for it to be widely maintained in vertebrates, at least six taxa of vertebrates carry only partial PRDM9 orthologs and the gene has been lost entirely at least three times (based on 227 orthologs; Figure 1, Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Thus, PRDM9 is not essential to meiotic recombination in the sense that SPO11 is, for example (Lam and Keeney, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Instead, the role of PRDM9 is perhaps best envisaged as a classic, trans-acting recombination rate modifier (Otto and Barton, 1997, Otto and Lenormand, 2002; Coop and Przeworski, 2007), which was favored enough to be adopted at some point in evolution, but not so strongly or stably as to prevent frequent losses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In this regard, it is worth noting that in mammalian species studied to date, recombination rates are lower near promoters than in species lacking PRDM9 (Myers et al., 2005; Coop et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Because recombination hotspots have higher rates of point mutations, insertions and deletions, and experience GC-biased gene conversion, there may be an advantage conferred by directing recombination to non-genic regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Recombination at the TSS could have the further disadvantage of uncoupling coding and regulatory variants, potentially uncovering negative epistasis, and therefore leading to indirect selection for decreased recombination at the TSS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Alternatively (but non mutually-exclusively), because PRDM9 binding motifs are strongly associated with certain transposable element classes in mammals (Myers et al., 2008), the role of PRDM9 in recombination could be related to the regulation of certain families of transposable elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>With a more complete picture of recombination mechanisms and their consequences across the tree of life, these hypotheses can start to be tested in an evolutionary context. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>For all groups in which we confirm that there is only a partial PRDM9 ortholog based on the above analyses, we asked whether the PRDM9 gene in question has likely become a pseudogene (as it has, for example, in canids; Oliver et al., 2009; Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2011), in which case the species can be considered a PRDM9 knockout. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>Though such events would be consistent with our observation of many losses of PRDM9, they would not be informative about the role of particular PRDM9 domains in recombination. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>While it is possible that some of these cases represent very recently pseudogenized genes, the widespread evidence for purifying selection on the SET domain strongly suggests that these PRDM9 orthologs are functionally important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>We also investigated constraint in all mammalian Ref-seq orthologs that appear to lack only an annotated KRAB or SSXRD domain; for this larger number of genes, we did not confirm all domain losses, due to the large number of genome searches that would be required and lack of RNAseq data for most species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>We found evidence of purifying selection in all cases except for five PRDM7 orthologs from primates, for which we had been unable to identify a KRAB domain (Supplementary file 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>PRDM7 is thought to have arisen from a primate specific duplication event and to have undergone subsequent losses of the C2H2 ZF array and of some catalytic specificity of its SET domain (Blazer et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Thus, PRDM7 orthologs are unlikely to function in directing recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Our findings further suggest they are evolving under very little constraint, and may even be non-functional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>More generally, within placental mammals, the majority of partial PRDM9 orthologs that we identified lack the ZF array completely or have truncated arrays (notably, there are fewer than four tandem ZFs in 24 of 28 orthologs), in sharp contrast to other taxa in which partial orthologs to PRDM9 lack the N terminal domains, yet have conserved ZF arrays and are constrained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the paralogs lacking a long ZF tend to be found in species that already carry a complete PRDM9 ortholog (21 of 24). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>It has further been observed that DNA-binding residues show high levels of amino acid diversity, suggestive of positive selection acting specifically at DNA-binding sites, that is, on binding affinity (e.g. Oliver et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>These signals have been previously studied by comparing site specific rates of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) between paralogous ZFs in PRDM9’s tandem ZF array (Oliver et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>For each map, we calculated the distance to the nearest TSS and to the nearest CGI by from the midpoint of each 10 kb window. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>To visualize these patterns, we fit a Gaussian loess curve using the distance to nearest TSS or CGI and recombination rate for each species, using only windows within 100 kb of a representative element. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>For visual comparison, we scaled the resulting curves by setting the y-value (recombination rate) of the last point to one. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>A caveat is that other than for swordtail and sheep, we relied on LD based genetics maps, which estimate population recombination rates 4Ner, where Ne is the effective population size and r the recombination rate per meiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>Because estimates of Ne decrease near genes as a consequence of diversity-reducing linked selection (e.g., Wright and Andolfatto, 2008; Hernandez et al., 2011), a decrease in estimated population recombination rates near genes may not reflect a reduction in the recombination rate r. To explore the potential importance of this caveat, we considered two species where both LD maps and pedigree or admixture maps were available: dogs and humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>In both cases, the qualitative results were the same as for the LD-based maps (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>Since diversity-reducing linked selection should give rise, if anything, to a trough in diversity levels, it cannot explain the observed peaks at these features in species lacking PRDM9 or swordtail fish; in fact, since these species also experience this form of selection (e.g., Singhal et al., 2015), the true peaks in recombination rates near promoter-like features are likely somewhat more pronounced. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>We note further that although the peak in recombination rate at these features in swordtail fish appears to be less prominent than in dog or birds, quantitative comparisons of different species are difficult because these maps differ in their resolution. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="503" pm="."><plain>Peak files were converted to bed files and bedtools2 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) was used to analyze overlap between the locations of H3K4me3 peaks and predicted PRDM9 binding motifs in the swordtail genome (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="504" pm="."><plain>Based on Homer analysis, which identified 20,662 peaks in the testis and 15,050 in the liver, the IP efficiency was estimated to be 38% for the testis sample and 40% for the liver sample; the peak width was estimated to be 229 bp for the testis sample and 238 for the liver sample. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="505" pm="."><plain>Having identified H3K4me3 peaks in testis and liver tissue, we next asked about the relationship between these peaks and predicted PRDM9 binding sites (see above). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="506" pm="."><plain>If PRDM9 is generating H3K4me3 peaks during meiosis, we expect to see an association between predicted PRDM9 binding motifs in the swordtail genome and H3K4me3 peaks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="507" pm="."><plain>To test for such an association, we generated 500 null motifs by randomly shuffling without replacement the position weight matrix of the X. birchmanni PRDM9 and re-running FIMO as described above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="508" pm="."><plain>We then asked how frequently randomly shuffled PRDM9 motifs overlap H3K4me3 peaks compared to the real motif. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="509" pm="."><plain>We found that no evidence that the real motif overlapped H3K4me3 peaks more frequently than the shuffled versions of the motif (Figure 4C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="510" pm="."><plain>As a secondary approach, we compared H3K4me3 peaks that are specific to the testis to H3K4me3 peaks that are specific to the liver, defined as peaks in the testis where there is no overlapping peak in the liver. Using a Chi-squared test, we asked whether H3K4me3 peaks found only in the testis are more likely to overlap a PRDM9 binding motif than those that are liver specific (where the definition is analogous) (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="512" pm="."><plain>Because the size of H3K4me3 peaks will impact the expected overlap with PRDM9 binding motifs, we also constrained the size of the H3K4me3 peaks in the liver analysis to be the same as that inferred from the testis using the –size flag in homer (229 bp). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="513" pm="."><plain>Results were not qualitatively different with the original analysis, using liver H3K4me3 peaks that were inferred to be 238 bp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>Counterintuitively liver-specific H3K4me3 peaks appear to overlap predicted PRDM9 motifs more often than testes-specific peaks (χ = 14.8; p=1.2e-4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>However, performing this same analysis with the 500 null motifs (generated as described above), we found that liver-specific peaks were significantly enriched in shuffled motifs in 85% of simulations (at the 0.05 level). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>This analysis suggests that base composition differences between liver and testes-specific H3K4me3 peaks explain the difference in overlap results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="517" pm="."><plain>We also repeated the above analysis for clusters of three ZFs in the swordtail PRDM9 ZF array, using a smaller number of shuffled sequences (n = 20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="518" pm="."><plain>We observed the same qualitative patterns for each of the ZF clusters as reported above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>Finally, we used a third approach to ask about the association of H3K4me3 peaks and PRDM9 binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="520" pm="."><plain>We generated five replicate datasets of H3K4me3 sequences and their flanking 250 bp regions from both the testis and the liver. We ran the program MEME to predict motifs enriched in the testis-specific H3K4me3 peaks using the liver as a background sequence set on these five replicate datasets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="522" pm="."><plain>We then examined the top ten predicted motifs to ask whether any of these motifs resembled the computationally predicted PRDM9 binding motifs (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="523" pm="."><plain>The above analyses suggest that in swordtail fish, PRDM9 does not make H3K4me3 marks but they do not indicate whether H3K4me3 peaks are associated with recombination events in swordtails. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="524" pm="."><plain>We therefore verified that recombination rates in 10 kb windows are significantly correlated with the distance of that window to the nearest H3K4me3 peak (rho = −0.072, p=2.3e-69; Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="525" pm="."><plain>This relationship weakens but remains significant when accounting for distance both to TSSs and CGIs by a partial correlation analysis (rho = −0.026, p=5.4e-10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="526" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, windows that contain a testis-specific H3K4me3 peak have a higher recombination rate than windows that contain a liver-specific peak (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="527" pm="."><plain>Finally, there is a significant positive correlation between the number of bp in a 10 kb window overlapping an H3K4me3 peak and the number of recombination events observed in that window in the testis but not in the liver (testis: rho = 0.044, p=2.8e-29; liver: rho = 0.002, p=0.66). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="528" pm="."><plain>Together, these analyses suggest that a relationship between H3K4me3 peaks and recombination exists in swordtails, but not one mediated through PRDM9 binding. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this manuscript, the authors perform extensive computational analyses to recover 227 PRDM9 orthologs from 149 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They confirm that PRDM9 has been lost independently in several lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They show that the domain architecture of PRDM9 in placental mammals (KRAB, SSXRD, PR/SET and ZF) corresponds to the ancestral state, at the root of vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>They also identified many lineages in which PRDM9 orthologs have lost the KRAB and/or SSXRD domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These 'truncated' PRDM9 orthologs are subject to strong negative selection, which implies that they are functional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Their zinc finger domain does not show however evidence for positive selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This observation leads to the conclusion that the presence of KRAB/SSXRD domains is most probably required for the DSB-targeting function of PRDM9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>To test this prediction, a recombination map of swordtail fish, which has a truncated PRDM9 has been generated, and the authors conclude that this map shows a pattern similar to that of Prdm9 knock-outs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Essential revisions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The phylogeny of Prdm9 is very convincing and the reviewers recognize the quality of this work which provides important information about maintenance or loss of Prdm9 in vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The association between the presence of KRAB/SSXRD domains and the rate of evolution of the ZF domain is clear, and the authors propose that the KRAB and SSXRD domains are required for the DSB-targeting function of PRDM9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However the conclusion drawn by the authors that recombination sites are preferentially located near TSS in swordtail fish similarly to other species lacking Prdm9 is not convincing; First the increase of recombination rate near TSS is very weak (about 1.2x) compared to that observed in dog (about 4-7x, see Figure 2 and 4 in Auton et al. 2013 Plos Genet) or finches (about 2-3x, see Figure 5 in Singhal et al. 2015 Science). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the increase in recombination rate in the vicinity of TSS and CGIs in swordtail fish is similar to that observed in human and chimpanzee (see Figure 3 in Auton et al. 2012 Science), two species that have PRDM9-directed hotspots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In addition, the power of detecting an increase of recombination near motifs is limited by the resolution of their map. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Having a zinc finger with a normal evolution rate does not automatically means that PRDM9 is not involved in targeting recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms may be used such as DNA binding at distance from DSB sites for instance and one cannot interpret the data with only two possible hypotheses to be tested: “the motif mode” or “the promoter/CpG mode”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>It is thus essential to obtain accurate mapping data if one wishes to answer this question. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The editor and reviewers feel you may already have the data in hand (with more sequencing data from your fish hybrid and with sequencing/poylmorphism data on other species if available) in which case you could potentially answer these major concerns, or have the possibility to rapidly obtain a high resolution genetic map for the swordtail fish (or another species of interest). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the phylogeny is of great interest but by itself is better suited for a more specialized journal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A major revision with clear conclusions on the functional consequences on the localization of recombination sites in species such as swordtail fish expressing a truncated Prdm9 and possibly in a non-mammalian species expressing a full length Prdm9 would be needed for publication in eLife. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In response to these concerns, we have added a number of analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Notably: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We collected additional genomic data in the hybrid swordtail population (specifically ~1X genome-‐wide coverage for 268 individuals) and have thereby increased the resolution of our genetic map (resolving crossover events to a median of 13 kb). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The increase near the TSS is higher than what we initially reported, but weaker than in some other species without PRDM9 (see Figures 4 and 5). We believe the smaller peak in swordtail fish reflects the lower resolution of our map, consistent with it being higher now than what it was previously (and with differences between pedigree and LD map </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>in dogs, for example). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>In that sense, maps from different species are not strictly comparable, a caveat we now state explicitly in the text. We note that another complication in interpreting the depth of troughs and peaks is that maps based on LD confound differences in Ne along the genome with variation in recombination rates; nonetheless, we show our findings to be robust to the use of pedigree/admixture maps or LD-‐based maps (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These caveats notwithstanding, we have conducted a comparative analysis of recombination maps in four species with an intact PRDM9 (human, gorilla, mouse, sheep) and three species with no PRDM9 (zebrafinch, long-‐tailed finch, dog) to contrast those patterns with the ones seen in swordtail fish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This analysis shows that swordtail fish behave like PRDM9 knockouts with regard to patterns of recombination around the TSS and CpG islands (Figure 5), and highlights qualitative differences between vertebrates with and without PRDM9 among species studied to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We agree that this observation does not rule out other roles of PRDM9 in recombination (i.e., roles unlike the ones it plays in mammals). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Based on findings from yeast to mice, we would expect that a role for PRDM9 in recombination would be associated with H3K4me3 marks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For that reason, we have added H3K4me3 chip-‐seq experiments from swordtail testis and liver tissue samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our expectation, we see increased recombination near H3K4me3 peaks in testes, and no effect of the TSS once these peaks and the locations of CpG islands are taken into account (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, however, when we analyzed the conservation of catalytic residues of the SET domain for each PRDM9 ortholog in our dataset, we found that ‘PRDM9β’ genes such as the one carried by swordtail fish lack conservation of key residues (see Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Moreover, analyzing the correspondence of H3K4me3 peaks and the predicted PRDM9 binding motif in swordtails, we find no association between these H3K4me3 peaks and the predicted PRDM9 binding motif (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Together 4) and 5) suggest that the SET domain does not lay down H3K4me3 marks in swordtail fish. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Together, we believed these different lines of evidence provide compelling evidence that swordtail fish, although they carry a constrained, truncated ortholog to PRDM9, do not use PRDM9 to direct recombination, at least through any mechanism that has been reported. </plain></SENT>
