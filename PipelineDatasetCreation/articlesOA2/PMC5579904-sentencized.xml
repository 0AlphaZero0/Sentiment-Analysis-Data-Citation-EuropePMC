</text></title><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Post-stroke cognitive impairment is a major problem that affects up to 70% of stroke survivors [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Persistent cognitive impairment after stroke not only causes deterioration in patients’ ability to relearn motor skills due to memory problems or poor judgment, but also significantly impairs the activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QOL) [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Post-stroke cognitive impairment and rehabilitation have recently been identified as the top research priority for post-stroke survivors [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Current evidence indicates that targeted cognitive rehabilitation after stroke, including exercise training [6–8] or cognitive training [9, 10], provides potential means of promoting cognitive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A recent overview of the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for stroke survivors suggests that cognitive training targeting specific cognitive domains has some positive effects [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>For example, Starovasnik Žagavec et al. [12] studied the effect of computer-based cognitive rehabilitation on work-active patients after stroke and reported a moderate to strong effect on the divided attention and a mild effect on the alertness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>They suggested that the attention system can be rehabilitated by training the reaction speed and learning the awareness and selection of suitable stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Another randomized controlled trial examined the effects of 5 weeks working memory training in stroke survivors and found training effects on attention and subjective experience of cognitive functioning in daily living (as measured by the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that intensive cognitive training can improve cognitive function in stroke survivors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A recent study suggests that the increased resting-state functional connectivity of the hippocampus with the frontal and parietal lobes may be an important mechanism of cognitive recovery after stroke [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Another important approach that has been proposed to enhance cognitive function is aerobic exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition to the well-known benefits of exercise in improving physical function and reducing the risk of secondary complications, exercise has been found to lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related cognitive disorders [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Cumming and colleagues conducted a systematic review and reported that increased physical activity after stroke improves cognitive functions [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that aerobic exercise may increase the arousal level and reduce depressive symptoms, which in turn leads to better cognitive function [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The improvement in cognitive function after exercise could be induced by the upregulation of neurotrophic and vascular growth factors, which may facilitate neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and other cognition-related cortical areas [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in regulating synaptic connectivity [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recently, several clinical studies have demonstrated that BDNF may be act as a biomarker of memory and general cognitive function in healthy adults [20], and in patients with schizophrenia [21] and Parkinson’s disease [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although BDNF has been widely investigated, the mechanism of action and the biological correlates of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with stroke are still unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Also, it remains unclear whether BDNF serum levels may be used as a biomarker of cognitive training in patients with stroke. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Current evidence is insufficient to establish clinical practice recommendations due to the small sample sizes, unclear treatment details and different measurements of the outcome variable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>There is urgent need to perform a high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) that is adequately powered, using the optimum intervention and validated outcome measurements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, few of the prior studies included outcome measures of changes in physiological markers, ADLs, and QOL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Growing evidence suggests that a hybrid combination of aerobic exercise and cognitive training may provide additional benefits in cognitive performance that go beyond the effects of a single type of training in animals [23], community-dwelling elderly [24, 25], and stroke survivors [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A systematic review of combining exercise and cognitive intervention in older adults suggests that exercise sessions delivered before the cognitive training session prepares the brain for the compensatory recruitment process in the subsequent cognitive training sessions [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Aerobic exercise before cognitive training may increase arousal level, facilitate neurogenesis and enhance memory consolidation, which may benefit the memory retrieval and cognitive task performance that follows [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Aerobic exercise training combined with cognitive training might be a plausible intervention to augment cognitive function and intensify rehabilitation outcomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We are conducting a single-blind, adequately powered, high-quality RCT to test the hypothesis that a sequential combination of aerobic exercise and cognitive training will promote cognitive performance in stroke survivors with cognitive impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Specifically, we aim to determine the treatment effects of the hybrid training, compared with exercise or cognitive training alone, on: (1) cognitive function and (2) physiological markers, daily function, quality of life, physical function, and social participation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>No published research to date has investigated the effects of combining aerobic exercise with cognitive training on cognitive functions in patients with stroke; therefore, the sample size calculation was based on the effects of a similar study conducted by Kim et al. [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The study investigated the effects of 4 weeks of cognitive, combined, motor dual-task training on cognitive and motor function in stroke survivors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The Stroop test, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), Figure-of-8 Walk Test (F8WT) and gait speed were used to measure cognitive and motor abilities and were evaluated three times (before and after training and at the 2-week follow up). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared to the single-task training, the active control group, dual-task training improves cognitive and motor functions in stroke survivors, and these training benefits were maintained for 2 weeks. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>There is no consensus about pharmacologic interventions [58], and the use of medicines alone for cognitive decline after stroke is not highly recommended. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par76"><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Aerobic exercise is considered to be effective in improving cognitive function and has the advantages of being simple, convenient, efficient, inexpensive, and without severe adverse effects [59]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>A systematic review has proposed that despite the increase in the number of studies that have focused on training for cognitive function after stroke, the lack of high-quality research has prevented the development of evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice [11]. </plain></SENT>
