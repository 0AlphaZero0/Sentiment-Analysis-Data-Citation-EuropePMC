</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful method for profiling the TCR repertoire, including sequences encoding the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), and provides a broad view of the immune response alterations resulting from perturbations such as infection, vaccination, and cancer1, 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Several different NGS platforms, using genomic DNA or cDNA from T cells, have been used for sequencing the TCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Whole transcripome sequencing (RNA-seq) provides adequate coverage to study the TCR repertoire and has been utilized to profile tissue-resident T cell repertoires3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) constitute about 10% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and comprise a heterogeneous group of relatively rare and aggressive malignancies derived from mature T cells4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>PTCL is characterized by clonal expansion of T cells and can be further classified into many subtypes based on their distinct morphological, immunophenotypic, molecular, and clinical differences, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Pathological diagnosis remains challenging, and there is a large of group of cases that cannot be further classified and are grouped under PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>TCR rearrangement assays improve clinical diagnostics by demonstrating the presence of dominant clones in PTCL, and the unique rearrangement is useful in monitoring minimal residual disease5–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, preferential TCR usage in a T-cell lymphoma subtype may suggest immune perturbations and antigen selection that predispose to lymphomagenesis8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although TCRαβ-expressing tumors represent 90% of T-cell malignancies, T-cell clonality is routinely evaluated with a PCR-based method to detect TCRγ and, less frequently, β chain rearrangement using genomic DNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The TCRα and β loci are too complex and cumbersome for routine DNA clonal analyses, but flow cytometry can also detect TCRβ gene usage and thus imply clonality9, 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, these approaches are also limited by the lack of sequence information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>RNA-seq provides information about the usage of variable (V), diversity (D) if applicable, and joining (J) regions of the TCRα, β, γ, and δ chains and yields the unique sequence of the CDR3, which includes the V(D)J junctions as well as N-nucleotides added by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>One was to directly quantify the transcripts in FPKM values to show usage of individual V genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The other method was to identify the clonotypes based on the sequence of the CDR3, which contains unique V-N-(D)-N-J junctions, nontemplated nucleotide insertions, and base deletions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>These two strategies provided generally concordant assessment of monoclonality (Supplementary Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In a few cases, however, clonality of TCRα and TCRβ was discrepant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>21 cases showed two clonal transcripts for either Vα or Vβ, and two thirds of them contain one nonproductive allele (containing a frameshift or nonsense codon) (Supplementary Table S3), suggesting the possibility of dual receptor expression25, 26 in some of the cases, resulting from transcription from biallelic in-frame rearrangements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among the biallelic clonal TCRα or TCRβ transcripts, the ratio between the top 2 clones (C1/C2) is significantly higher when the second-largest clone contains nonproductive CDR3 sequences (p = 0.0008, Welch two sample t-test; Figure 1), which may be due to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay mechanism27.Figure 1Ratio of CDR3 transcript levels of the first and second largest clones (C1/C2) in monoclonal PTCL cases with two TCRα or TCRβ clones. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Vα and Vβ transcripts were abundant in AITL and PTCL-NOS cases compared to ALCL and NKCL cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Although Vγ and Vδ transcripts were rare in these entities, a single γδ-TCL case showed low expression of TCR-Vα and -Vβ but clonal TCR-Vγ and -Vδ expression; this was confirmed by PCR analysis of TCRγ chain (Supplementary Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Unlike normal tonsillar T-cell populations, multiple small CDR3 clones in addition to the presumed neoplastic ones were often observed in tumors and were particularly prominent if a limited number of normal infiltrating T-cells were present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>When the neoplastic TCR was not expressed or few tumor cells were present, such clones could appear as the largest clones accounting for a large fraction of the total and be falsely considered as the neoplastic clone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>To avoid such a situation, we tried to derive a threshold for TCR transcript levels below which the assessment was considered unreliable. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The clonal rearrangement of TCR genes is useful in supporting the diagnosis of a T-cell lymphoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The current clinical approach consists of PCR amplification and fragment analysis of the VJ junction region (CDR3) of the rearranged TCRG and, sometimes, the VDJ region of the TCRB locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the size of these amplified regions in normal polyclonal T-lymphocytes reveals numerous peaks with a Gaussian distribution of their lengths, whereas in tumors, the PCR products are present as a single major peak (monoallelic) or as two peaks (biallelic arrangement). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>T-cells follow a pattern of T-cell receptor rearrangement, with TCRD rearranged first, followed by TCRG and incomplete rearrangement of TCRB (Dβ-Jβ)36, 37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>All mature T-cells have TCRG rearrangement; thus, it is a good clonal marker for all T-cell lymphomas derived from mature T-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>However, TCRG transcripts are present only in γδ T-cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In AITL and PTCL-NOS, clonal rearrangements of TCR genes are reported to be detected in about 80% of cases38. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we evaluated the clonal expansion and TCR repertoire at the nucleotide level in 108 PTCLs (40 AITLs, 35 ALCLs, 17 PTCL-NOS, 15 NKCLs, and one γδ-TCL). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>V gene transcripts and CDR3 sequences were extracted from RNA-seq data to assess clonality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>The assessment results that were based on V gene usage and CDR3 sequences were mostly concordant (Supplementary Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>However, there were still a few cases which were assessed to be monoclonal based on CDR3 sequences but polyclonal based on V-usage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This could result from reads that were falsely or ambiguously mapped to parts of V genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>For CDR3 sequences, we filtered out these reads based on global alignment results using BLAT, but they might still be counted in the V-usage results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the CDR3 sequences should serve as a more reliable basis for clonality assessment, whereas the V-usage method could be used for a quick assessment based on a normalized table of gene transcript levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Both methods were based on general RNA-seq technology, with limited read coverage on the TCR genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Thus, only major clones (&gt;0.1%) were expected to be detected in samples with active TCR transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Therefore, RNA-seq data could be used for clonality analysis for tumor samples, but for other purposes which require more complete TCR repertoire profiles, techniques enabling target deep sequencing should be considered1–3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal CDR3 sequences were found in 66 PTCL samples, accounting for 86% out of a total of 77 samples with sufficient TCR expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This result agrees with a recent study, which explored the TCR clonality of AITLs and PTCL-NOS, and found that 91% were clonal39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The slightly higher proportion of clonal samples may be because tumor cells were enriched by antibodies before sequencing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>At least one clonal transcript was observed in most of the cases of PTCL with sufficient expression of TCR transcript levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>We have not observed any preferential Vβ usage in the tumors examined, which would suggest the role of antigen-driven lymphomagenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in a few cases, there was in-frame expression of two clonal TCRα and TCRβ transcripts suggesting that two TCR molecules could be expressed by the tumor cells as observed in some cases of PTCL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>While concordant TCR-Vα and TCR-Vβ clonal expression was often observed in AITL and PTCL-NOS, one of these was missing in some of the cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>This is particularly prominent in ALCL with 9 of 18 cases showing expression of only CDR3α or CDR3β. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>It is unclear why surface TCR expression is absent in other ALCL cases with TCR mRNA expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>For surface expression, TCR heterodimers must be noncovalently bound to all CD3 subunits40, 41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>In particular, lack of CD3γ severely reduces TCR surface expression40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The very low expression of CD3 subunits and in particular CD3γ in ALCL (Figure 6C) potentially may explain the abnormal TCR expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms behind the abnormalities in TCR expression require further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Absent or decreased surface TCR and CD3 protein expression was found in the majority of AITL cases32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that in some cases, this may result from loss of expression of one or both of the α and β TCR subunits; in other cases, it may be due to low expression of CD3 subunits (Figure 6C), as postulated for ALCL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>The frequent partial or complete loss of surface TCR expression in AITL is surprising, given the importance of TCR signaling in T-cell survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>Activating mutations affecting genes involved in TCR signaling are frequent in AITL11, 42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These activating mutations presumably allow signaling for survival and proliferation in the absence of tonic TCR signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>BCR and TCR rearrangement can also be investigated by NGS using genomic DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This is generally performed after PCR amplification of the CDR3 of the locus of interest43, 44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>However, the massive number of PCR reactions that are needed and the difficulty of ensuring unbiased amplification make such an analysis difficult to replicate in academic molecular diagnostic laboratories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>RNA-seq is far easier to perform but will miss rearrangements in TCR loci that are not expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>However, this is a very useful approach in determining the TCRα and TCRβ repertoire in non-neoplastic infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment or in inflammatory settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that RNA-seq is a useful approach in determining clonality in PTCL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Some cases do not show clonal transcript expression due to either low tumor content or abnormal biology, which is much more frequent in ALCL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The sequencing approach allows the study of the TCR repertoire of the tumor cells and infiltrating normal T-cells and potentially, the monitoring of minimal residual disease. </plain></SENT>
