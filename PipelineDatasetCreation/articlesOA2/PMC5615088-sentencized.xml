</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The popularity of probiotics has expanded exponentially recently, but along with their increased use, debate rages on how probiotics should be regulated and whether probiotics should be considered as a medical food, drug or a food supplement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Bacterial spore formers, mostly of the genus Bacillus constitute a major probiotic product in use today. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>They have to be adequately characterized for content, stability, and health effects, to be categorized as probiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Bacilli being ubiquitous consistently enter the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of healthy people through food, water and air. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>They have been isolated from gut and can reach upto 107 cfu/g [2] and hence are considered to be one of the dominant components of the normal gut microflora. Bacillus strains offer some advantages over the more common Lactobacillus products in that they can be stored indefinitely in a desiccated form [3] without any deleterious effect on viability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In addition, they can also survive the low pH of the gastric barrier [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Bacillus species exert their beneficial effects, through immunomodulation i.e. induction of cytokines, competitive exclusion of gastrointestinal pathogens by competing for adhesion sites and secretion of antimicrobial compounds [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Potential benefits of Bacillus sps include improved nutrition and growth, enhanced immunity and prevention of various gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, necrotizing enterocolitis), respiratory disorders, allergies, skin disorders, bacterial vaginosis and cancer [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The production and use of probiotics has increased worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>As probiotics are strain specific, toxicity studies need to be carried out in order to establish safety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Though probiotics are Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS), safety must not be taken for granted and every product must be evaluated on a case by case basis [8] Assessment of the acute and repeat dose toxicity must be carried out for all potential strains in order to establish safety. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Lack of appropriate safety assessment can lead to probiotics being a source of food borne infectious disease and food poisoning as observed in a study for Bacillus cereus strain in China [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The FAO/WHO report has laid down a set of guidelines for a product to be used as a probiotic or novel supplement that must be judiciously followed [1], [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A few animal studies that include acute and sub-chronic toxicity testing as well as in vitro studies have been performed on some Bacillus species − B. subtilis, B. indicus [11], B. coagulans [12], [13] and B. licheniformis [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>No adverse effects were reported in any of the studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, there are some bacillus species which were found to be pathogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Bacillus anthracis [15] being involved in systemic and hospital acquired infections and Bacillus cereus [16], [17] in diarrhea and food poisoning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Widespread use of probiotic bacteria in conjunction and in close association with antibiotic use or rather misuse, can over time establish a reservoir of antibiotic resistant genes in probiotic bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>While intrinsic antibiotic resistance can be a desirable trait as probiotics help restore host gut microflora during a course of antibiotics, the transfer of resistant genes to humans offers serious clinical threats [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Bacillus clausii (B. clausii) UBBC07 has been isolated by Unique Biotech Ltd, India. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is well characterized and has been deposited in MTCC (Microbial Type Culture Collection), India under Indian Patent deposit with the number MTCC 5472. B. clausii UBBC07 exhibits probiotic properties and being a spore forming probiotic, is stable over a wide range of temperatures with potential applications in a variety of formulations and foods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It was hence of interest to confirm its safety as time and again emphasis is laid on the importance of strain specificity in probiotics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Bacterial pathogenicity is strain specific and hence every bacterial strain promising as a probiotic should be tested individually [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Safety assessment of B. clausii UBBC07 was carried out through (a) acute and subacute oral toxicity studies in rats, (b) whole genome analysis and screening for absence of toxin genes and (c) establishing antibiotic resistance is intrinsic and not transferable. </plain></SENT>
