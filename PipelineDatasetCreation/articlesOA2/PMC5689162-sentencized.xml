</text></title><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Physical activity has been associated with numerous beneficial health outcomes [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>An accumulation of international research on physical activity promotion has led to a systematic review [3] and eventual recommendations by the Guide to Community Preventive Services for increasing physical activity [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These recommendations include the use of community-wide campaigns [4], which are typically highly visible and employ multiple components including the use of media, social support, risk factor screening, health education and environmental changes, as a cost-effective strategy to increase physical activity [3, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, this recommendation was based on a body of work that included few studies with Hispanics, and none which were conducted recently or specifically analyzed results among the Hispanic subgroup included in the sample [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although community-wide campaigns have been evaluated in Brazil [9, 10], to our knowledge, despite the dissemination of a successful model to other parts of Latin America [11], it has not been formally evaluated in any Spanish-speaking population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite the Guide to Community Preventive Services’ review and recommendation for community-wide campaigns, other systematic reviews concluded that further research is needed to conclude that community-wide interventions are effective [12], especially with study designs that include intervention and control groups [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we detail the results of a community-wide campaign designed to increase physical activity among Hispanic adults that compares intervention and control communities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A multi-dimensional view of physical activity has recently been promoted, that is, one that recognizes that sedentary behavior is a separate behavior from physical activity [14] with independent, negative effects [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Sedentary behavior has been independently associated with cancer risk and mortality [17–19], cardiovascular disease and mortality [20–22] and all-cause mortality [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Currently, there are no recommendations from the Guide to Community Preventive Services for reducing sedentary behavior in adults and there is a need to test behavioral interventions and strategies to reduce sedentary behavior in adults [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>One starting point for developing behavioral strategies to reduce sedentary behavior could come from evaluating the association of existing evidence-based physical activity strategies with sedentary behavior [27], as there is some evidence that even physical activity targeted interventions can still have effects on sedentary behavior in adults [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In this study, we aimed to build the evidence base for the association of physical activity-targeted community-wide campaigns with lower levels of sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par17"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to compare predominantly Hispanic intervention and control communities on the Texas-Mexico border to assess the associations of being in the intervention community and exposure to a physical activity-targeted, community-wide campaign with meeting moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) guidelines and excessive sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We expect that those exposed to the community-wide campaign, compared with controls or those unexposed in either condition, will participate in more MVPA and less excessive sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We also expect that all campaign components (newsletter, community health worker (CHW) discussion, and TV and radio segments) will be associated with both outcomes, though the more intensive, interpersonal component (CHW discussion) will produce the greatest associations with both behavioral outcomes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>(Your Health Matters!, TSSC) community-wide campaign development and implementation from 2005 to 2010 has been described in detail elsewhere [29–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Briefly, the TSSC campaign was established to address low MVPA and unhealthy food choices among Mexican-American populations living on the Texas-Mexico border, who have been shown to have high obesity rates and low levels of MVPA [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The campaign was designed and implemented by community partners, including city officials, health professionals, community leaders, and non-profit organizations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The components of the campaign included a newsletter, community health worker (CHW) discussion, and TV and radio segments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The components were delivered primarily in the Spanish language and have been layered in over the past decade, as funding and community input have allowed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The TSSC campaign was based on the Transtheoretical Model [34] and Social Cognitive Theory [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The Stages of Change and the Processes of Change from the Transtheoretical Model framed campaign messages that were used in all the components of the campaign, as we focused on reaching people who were physically inactive or not active enough to meet MVPA guidelines (those in the Precontemplation, Contemplation and Preparation Stages). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We relied heavily on some of the Processes of Change by creating awareness of the needs and benefits of MVPA (Consciousness Raising) through emotional role model stories (Dramatic Relief) and encouragement to envision one’s self as more physically active (Self-reevaluation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Building on the cornerstone of the Social Cognitive Theory, we designed the campaign to promote Self-efficacy, or the confidence to be physically active in the face of obstacles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>As such, the campaign messages gave specific examples of struggles commonly faced when trying to be physically active (e.g., no time, parenting/job responsibilities, no safe place) and showed how other local role models have overcome such barriers, thus aiming to improve their confidence to meet MVPA guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Additional details about the behavioral change strategies incorporated into the campaign are published elsewhere [29]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>TSSC was evaluated as a quasi-experimental design with intervention (Brownsville) and control (Laredo) Texas communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Both cities are located on the Texas-Mexico border, though at a distance of 200 miles to limit contamination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>The control community was selected based on its match to the intervention community on location on Texas/Mexico border, size, percent Hispanic and low-income status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Within each city, unique panels of individuals were sampled every 2 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>These cross-sectional samples were collected at baseline (2006), first (2008) and second (2010) follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>At each time point the sampling frame of a neighborhood areas was matched again on size, percent Hispanic and low-income status based on the US Census data (2000) by tract and block. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>An adapted two-stage cluster sampling methodology was then used [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>A random sample was drawn in each neighborhood area using a 1-in-10 systematic sampling of housing units. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>That is, after the closest cross-street to the center of the neighborhood area was identified, data collectors selected every 10th house in all four Cardinal Directions from that central cross-street. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>If an individual from that 10th house was not home, not eligible or not interested in participating, then data collectors approached the 11th house, followed by the 9th house. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>If none of those three houses was enrolled (to obtain the 1-in-10 house for that segment), then the data collector proceeded to the next segment of 10 homes, repeating the process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In regards to comparability of the sample at baseline, analysis conducted on the baseline sample (2006) showed comparability of the intervention and control samples in regards to the outcome of physical activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>A single question, “During the last month, not counting your regular work, did you participate in some form of exercise such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening or walking for exercise?” with 200 intervention and 193 control community participants responding showed no significant difference between the two communities in past month physical activity (p = .43), even when controlling for covariates (p = .26). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Measurement of TSSC exposure and imputation of missing values for this variable has been described elsewhere [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Briefly, exposure was assessed in two stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In stage 1, participants recalled, without the use of aids, exposure to the TSSC campaign or its messages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>They were then asked whether they had been exposed to each individual TSSC component, regardless of their response to the initial question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>For participants in either the intervention or the control community who reported no TSSC campaign exposure, we recorded that they were not exposed to the individual TSSC components if that data were missing (n = 592, 74.1%). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In stage 2, participants were asked to describe one of the health messages included in TSSC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>If a participant indicated he/she had been exposed to TSSC in stage 1 but was unable to confirm that exposure in stage 2, we reclassified the individual as not having been exposed (N = 13, 1.6%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>None of the individuals who indicated in stage 1 they had not been exposed to TSSC were able to confirm exposure in the stage 2. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>At the second follow-up (2010), when additional funding was present, we assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Given that our intervention was designed to impact leisure-time physical activity only, we limited our measures to that domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>For example, one question was “During the last 7 days, on how many days did you do vigorous physical activities in your leisure time?” Individuals reported the frequency and duration of MVPA in hours and minutes per week over the previous 7 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>We determined whether U.S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>MVPA guidelines were met [38] by calculating the metabolic equivalent (MET) adjusted minutes of MVPA reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Total activity &lt; 600 MET adjusted minutes was considered as not meeting MVPA guidelines [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Based on the recommended scoring protocols, 10 (1.3%) participants with extreme values (≥ 7680 MET adjusted minutes) of MVPA were excluded from the analyses (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>For a subset of the surveys (n = 84) the directions to data collectors indicated that if a participant reported “0” minutes of activity that a “0” should be entered into minutes of moderate activity and that no response should be entered in vigorous activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>During analysis, we recoded the missing responses for vigorous activity for this subset as “0” because this pattern represented no activity for either moderate or vigorous physical activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Later the survey collection instructions were modified so that 0 min of moderate and vigorous activity data were actually recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>For participants where minutes of vigorous activity were recorded (n = 89) but moderate activity was missing, we excluded these individuals from the analysis because there was no way to accurately estimate their level of moderate activity (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Previous research indicates that it is more likely for Hispanics adults to perform moderate rather than vigorous activity [40, 41], therefore making “0” minutes of moderate physical activity an unsatisfactory recoding option if it was missing when a response for vigorous activity was present.Fig. 1Analytic samples </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>At second-follow up (2010), participants also reported the frequency and duration of sitting in the previous 7 days, including weekdays and weekends, using the IPAQ [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For example, one question was “During the last 7 days, how much time did you usually spend sitting on a weekday?” with individuals reporting hours and minutes per day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Given the lack of a well-recognized cut-point for excessive sedentary behavior in the literature, we used the cut point of ≥ 540 min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>This is similar to the threshold of the highest quintile for sitting time, assessed by the IPAQ in a 20-country study [43], and is similar to the cut point previously used to define excessive sedentary behavior [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>These two studies used weekdays only to reflect usual behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>However, given the low representation in the highest quintile for the only Spanish-speaking, low- or middle-income country included (Columbia) in the 20-country study [43], as well as the low representation above this threshold for weekday sitting in our own sample, we believe that using the combined weekday and weekend variable is appropriate and identifies extreme sedentary behavior in our sample. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence of association between exposure to a community-wide campaign and meeting MVPA guidelines in Hispanic adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>It also provides additional evidence that this physical activity-targeted strategy was associated with lower levels of excessive sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>All TSSC components were associated with higher odds of meeting MVPA guidelines and lower odds of excessive sedentary behavior, except the radio segment, when compared to either comparison group (intervention-unexposed or control-unexposed). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Given that only 6.8% of the sample was exposed to the radio segments, it is not surprising that we were unable to detect sedentary behavior differences between the groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Our hypotheses that the exposure to the CHW discussion would have the greatest association with the two outcomes was only partially confirmed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Although exposure to this component had the greatest association with meeting MVPA guidelines when comparing the intervention-exposed to the control-unexposed, this was not true for the comparison between intervention-exposed and intervention-unexposed, where newsletters had the greatest association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>For excessive sedentary behavior, TV segments were the individual component with the greatest association (i.e. strongest protective effect), regardless of the comparison group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The contrasts between the intervention-exposed and intervention-unexposed groups were not significant for several components, and when there was a significant difference, there were smaller ORs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The lack of significance and smaller ORs when comparing intervention-exposed and intervention-unexposed (as opposed to intervention-exposed to control-unexposed) could potentially be due to factors outside of the TSSC in the intervention community that influenced the outcomes but that were not captured by our data collection or controlled by our study design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>For example, our method of assessing exposure to the TSSC components was conservative, requiring that an individual remember specific messaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Perhaps TSSC messaging was unconsciously registered and acted upon by individuals in the unexposed-intervention group without being able to consciously recall TSSC components and messaging. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there may have been positive side effects of TSSC, such as other community-led efforts or environmental changes, which led to increased activity and less sedentary behavior but that were not measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Despite these drawbacks, our findings point to a positive association of exposure to the TSSC community-wide campaign with meeting MVPA guidelines and an inverse association of exposure to TSSC with excessive sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In previous studies, mass media (radio and TV segments) [45–49], along with newsletters [50, 51], and individualized, interpersonal components akin to our CHW discussions [46, 47, 51, 52] have been successfully used in community-wide interventions and campaigns to increase physical activity in adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>However, our results differ from studies that showed no association of community-wide campaigns [53, 54] and interventions [55–58] with physical activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Although some of these interventions that were not associated with physical activity used models or theory, such as marketing principles [56] principles of community development [57], and the Hierarchy of Effects model [59], several of these unsuccessful interventions did not use behavioral theories that are known to be useful within the context of physical activity interventions generally and even community-wide campaigns specifically, such as the Transtheoretical Model [60–62] and the Social Cognitive Theory [48, 49, 63, 64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>One unsuccessful program did use two other behavior change theories, though it is not clear how (and how well) the constructs were operationalized [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Another program that did use the Transtheoretical Model and was still unsuccessful [55] appears to have only used the Stages of Change, rather than also incorporating strategies elucidated by the constructs from Processes of Change, which is one reason why some physical activity interventions based on the Transtheoretical Model have inconsistent and null findings [65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In contrast, our use of behavioral change techniques and theory [29] likely contributed to our findings [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>There are limited community-wide campaigns with Latin Americans or Hispanics against which to compare our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Results from Agita Sao Paulo indicated that TV and radio, among other components [11], effectively increased physical activity; however, the impact of individual components was not evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>One study that did include Hispanics as a sub-group successfully used TV, radio segments, newsletters and individualized discussions with participants as a whole; however, despite the increase in leisure-time MVPA overall, there was not a clear indication that adding individualized discussion to media components resulted in increased physical activity beyond the effect of the media components alone [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>A similar result was seen in another study that included a small Hispanic sample where a support group generated little effect on physical activity above that resulting from media components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Though the additional effect of the CHW discussion over the other components was not directly assessed in our study, the significant associations of exposure to the CHW discussion and physical activity indicates that the more personal CHW discussion could complement the all-purpose print or media components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, campaigns that have included policy and environmental changes, which often have no individualized, interpersonal discussions or support, have been successful in Latin America [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to assess the association of community-wide campaigns and their component parts with various behavioral outcomes in Hispanic and Latin American communities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Sedentary behavior has been measured in only a few community-wide campaigns targeting physical activity in adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>For example, as in our study, De Cocker et al. showed that their physical activity–targeted campaign decreased sitting time significantly more in the intervention community as compared to the control community [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that interventions that targeted sedentary behavior only had more consistent findings and resulted in larger reductions in sedentary time, as compared to interventions that targeted only physical activity or both physical activity and sedentary behavior [28], while yet another systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that only sedentary behavior-targeted interventions had an effect on sedentary behavior [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>However, given the independent, detrimental effects of not meeting MVPA guidelines and exhibiting excessive sedentary behavior [70–73], even greater benefits could be achieved if we can design interventions that effectively impact both behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Future community-wide campaigns could, for example, be designed to impact sedentary behavior and be tested against campaigns targeting both behaviors or physical activity only, using a stepped-wedge design or three-arm study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec16"><title><text><SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par43"><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>TSSC emerged from participatory processes and community needs, and, given funding limitations, study staff were not able to conduct rigorous evaluations with extensive measures that followed the same individuals over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there was neither a rigorous physical activity/sedentary measure used at baseline nor could we conduct longitudinal analysis or assess change over time with stronger measures of these outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Given this limitation, our use of one data collection time point limits our ability to infer causality and to say that differences between the intervention and control community were due to exposure to TSSC rather than some other factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>However, our measure of physical activity at baseline points to similarities in the two communities on the outcomes at the start of the intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Moreover, our exposure measure rigorously assessed exposure to TSSC, reclassifying individuals as necessary if they were unable to confirm TSSC messaging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par44"><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we were limited by self-report data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This is especially problematic for our two behavioral outcomes, as individuals are known to misreport MPVA and sedentary behavior [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, funds were not available to collect device-based measurements, which may provide a better indication of ambulatory movement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Conversely, devices would not be able to supply domain-specific information to assess leisure-time specific behavior [75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>A combination of the two approaches might be best for future research in this area [76]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Another limitation was our use of PAPI for data collection, as it allowed questions related to physical activity to be overlooked and left blank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) or Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) methods could have forced documentation on the part of the interviewer or reduced routing errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>However, given the limited resources of this project and the need to approach randomly selected individuals from specific neighborhoods within the larger the community, PAPI was the only feasible way to collect data in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Despite the intention to match the intervention and control communities on important characteristics, the random samples for each community were statistically significantly different on employment and education. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Lastly, despite being initially aware of the inability of community-wide campaigns to reach the full community, there were many randomly selected individuals from the intervention community that were not exposed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the lack of reach for the campaign resulted in the additional comparison group (intervention-unexposed) that provides a sample that was more similar on employment and education, and helps to control some threats to internal validity from history effects, or events that were naturally occurring in the region that could have affected MVPA or sedentary behavior. </plain></SENT>
