</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Epidemiological observations have linked increased host iron with malaria susceptibility, and perturbed iron handling has been hypothesized to contribute to the potentially life-threatening anemia that may accompany blood-stage malaria infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To improve our understanding of these relationships, we examined the pathways involved in regulation of the master controller of iron metabolism, the hormone hepcidin, in malaria infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We show that hepcidin upregulation in Plasmodium berghei murine malaria infection was accompanied by changes in expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/sons of mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) pathway target genes, a key pathway involved in hepcidin regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated known agonists of the BMP/SMAD pathway and found that Bmp gene expression was not increased in infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, activin B, which can signal through the BMP/SMAD pathway and has been associated with increased hepcidin during inflammation, was upregulated in the livers of Plasmodium berghei-infected mice; hepatic activin B was also upregulated at peak parasitemia during infection with Plasmodium chabaudi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of the closely related protein activin A increased in parallel with hepcidin in serum from malaria-naive volunteers infected in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, antibody-mediated neutralization of activin activity during murine malaria infection did not affect hepcidin expression, suggesting that these proteins do not stimulate hepcidin upregulation directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we present evidence that the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway is perturbed in malaria infection but that activins, although raised in malaria infection, may not have a critical role in hepcidin upregulation in this setting. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Malaria is one of the world's deadliest and most geographically widespread human infectious diseases, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths per year (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Malaria infections contribute significantly to the worldwide burden of anemia (2), and measures taken to decrease malaria at the population level frequently decrease anemia prevalence (3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of malarial anemia include increased clearance of infected and uninfected red blood cells (iRBC and uRBC, respectively), dyserythropoiesis as a consequence of cytokine upregulation, and inadequate absorption and utilization of iron, for which the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin has been implicated (reviewed in references 4â7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin controls iron stores and localization by causing internalization and degradation of the iron export protein ferroportin (8), which mediates iron release into the circulation from erythrophagocytic macrophages and across the basolateral membrane of enterocytes (9â11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Raised hepcidin therefore inhibits both recycling of red cell iron through macrophages and iron absorption from the diet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin is upregulated during many bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (12â15) and also during symptomatic and asymptomatic natural human malaria infections (16â18), in volunteers undergoing controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in clinical trials (19), and in malaria-infected mice (20, 21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Raised hepcidin during asymptomatic malaria infection is associated with poor iron absorption (22), and, in children with postmalarial anemia, with diminished erythrocyte incorporation of orally administered iron (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin renders mice infected with blood-stage malaria resistant to secondary sporozoite infection by decreasing the amount of iron in hepatocytes (20), and hepcidin-mediated macrophage iron sequestration has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to the increased growth of macrophage-tropic bacteria in malaria-infected hosts (24). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin levels increase homeostatically under high-iron conditions (7) and in response to inflammation and infection (25) via the BMP/SMAD and interleukin-6 (IL-6)/STAT3 pathways, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Appropriate regulation of hepcidin levels in response to fluctuations in iron is complex and requires many proteins, including Bmp6, HJV, Bmp type I and type II receptors, Hfe, and TfR2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>These molecules combine to sense iron and to modulate transcription of hepcidin via the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during anemia and under conditions of erythroid demand, hepcidin suppression occurs to facilitate iron release to plasma for erythropoiesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A recently identified bone marrow-derived erythropoietin-induced hormone named erythroferrone likely plays a key role in hepcidin suppression in this context (27), which also appears to act via BMP/SMAD signaling (28). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The SMAD pathway also may be involved in the hepcidin response to inflammation, since the transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²) superfamily member, activin B, is upregulated by inflammation in mice, associating it with hepcidin upregulation, independently of the IL-6 pathway (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Activin B, a homodimer of two inhibin Î²B subunits, is known to be stimulated by inflammatory and infectious stimuli (30) and to contribute to hepcidin upregulation in vitro (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear whether activin B is an essential component of the hepcidin response to inflammatory stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>One study noted that hepcidin upregulation in response to LPS was preserved in activin B knockout mice (Inhbbâ/â) (31), suggesting that activin B is not required for hepcidin upregulation in this context, while a second noted that the activin binding protein follistatin blunted the hepcidin increase to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a murine model (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the roles of related proteins activin A (a homodimer of two inhibin Î²A subunits) and activin AB (a heterodimer of inhibin Î²B and inhibin Î²A subunits) are less defined with regard to hepcidin upregulation, with some studies (33) showing that activin A upregulates hepcidin but others demonstrating no effect of activin A or activin AB (32, 34). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Here, we study molecular regulation of hepcidin expression in the context of murine malaria infections and CHMI studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We find evidence that the BMP/SMAD pathway is involved in hepcidin upregulation but that although activin B and activin A are increased in malaria, these molecules are unlikely to play a major role in controlling hepcidin expression. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Iron is required for Plasmodium growth, and host iron-handling proteins can influence outcome of infection; for example, lipocalin-2, which can sequester iron, controls the severity of Plasmodium yoelii infection in mice (49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on regulation of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin during malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin is raised in uncomplicated malaria infection in mice and humans (18â20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin redistributes iron into the macrophage compartment and away from the serum and so may contribute to dyserythropoiesis and the development of malarial anemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In established severe malarial anemia, hepcidin then is suppressed (50) through a pathway that likely involves the erythroid progenitor-derived factor erythroferrone (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The initial hepcidin upregulation blocks oral iron absorption during and after infection (22, 23) and plays a role in determining host susceptibility to malaria superinfection (20) and, possibly, coinfections with other pathogens (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Understanding the mechanisms of hepcidin induction during uncomplicated malaria therefore is important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>IL-6 upregulates hepcidin and this cytokine increases in malaria infection, and in some studies, IL-6 has been correlated with hepcidin in human serum (50, 52, 53); however, in one study of infected children, urinary IL-6 and hepcidin were not associated (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Murine studies have also shown different outcomes: one study found a close correlation between pSTAT3 levels and Hamp1 (21), but another noted only minor IL-6 upregulation, without pSTAT3 increase, in infected mice (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin induction in primary hepatocytes treated with serum from infected mice was shown to be abrogated by the BMP pathway inhibitor dorsomorphin, while IL-6 neutralizing antibodies were less effective (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Finally, PBMC, when cocultured with P. falciparum-infected red blood cells, upregulated hepcidin expression without appreciable IL-6 increases (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The role of IL-6 in hepcidin upregulation in malaria infection is unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>During blood-stage P. berghei ANKA malaria infection in mice, we found that hepcidin expression correlated most closely with hepatic expression of the BMP/SMAD response genes Id1 and Atoh8 and less so with IL-6/STAT3 pathway response gene Fga or Saa-1 or STAT3 phosphorylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that hepcidin upregulation in this model co-occurs with BMP/SMAD pathway signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>The expression of Bmp genes in infected mice was unchanged or moderately downregulated as parasitemia increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Of relevance, previous work demonstrated that Bmp gene expression was not elevated in mice injected with LPS despite evidence of BMP/SMAD pathway activity occurring concurrently with Hamp1 elevation (29). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>A previous study noted a marginal increase in hepatic message levels of activin B, and a decrease in Bmp6, in a murine model of malaria infection (51). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Activin proteins were initially discovered as reproductive factors, but increasing evidence has demonstrated a role in the acute host response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli, as well as shaping the subsequent immune response (54). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Activin A increases in serum of septic human patients (55, 56) and in animals following LPS injection (30, 34, 42, 57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Notably, although activin A protein levels increase in sera post-LPS injection, hepatic expression of Inhba mRNA decreases (30, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This disconnect between activin A serum protein and liver expression have led researchers to hypothesize that activin A is at least partially regulated at the posttranscriptional level and/or produced by tissues other than the liver, such as bone marrow-derived cells (42, 58), peripheral blood monocytes (45), or dendritic cells (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Activin B previously has been thought to be functionally similar to activin A, possibly with slightly weaker effects (59â61), although studies of knockout mice have identified some differences in the roles of the two proteins (62â64). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The effect of activin A and activin B on hepcidin regulation has been debated (32â34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In our in vitro system, we found some effects of activin A on hepcidin upregulation, although it was less potent than activin B. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>We found increased hepatic Inhbb expression in P. berghei-infected mice, occurring concurrently with hepcidin and Id1 expression increase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Hepatic activin A (Inhba) mRNA was decreased (as described in reference 29) as Hamp1, Inhbb, and parasitemia increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Similarly, increased hepatic Inhbb expression and decreased Inhba expression were observed during the peak parasitemia of Plasmodium chabaudi infection of C57BL/6 mice, together with upregulation of Serpine1 (consistent with activin signaling). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Importantly, an increase in Inhbb expression does not formally indicate an increase in activin B protein, as activin Î²B subunits can also combine with activin Î²A subunits to form activin AB protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>However, given the message decrease in Inhba in the liver, decreasing the local concentration of activin Î²A subunits, it is likely that the Inhbb increase we observed did result in an increase in circulating activin B and not activin AB. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for human activin B protein has been reported (65) but was not available at the time of experimentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>However, given the known independence of activin A liver mRNA and serum protein levels in animal models (30, 42), a possible role of activin A in hepcidin upregulation, and several studies that indicate that serum levels of activin A and B are coupregulated in different inflammatory and infectious states (66â68), we next chose to extend our studies by quantifying serum activin A and hepcidin concentrations from humans infected with P. falciparum as part of CHMI clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>We found that hepcidin was increased during untreated blood-stage parasite infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>A previous CHMI study also reported increased hepcidin (19), although importantly this prior study only noted hepcidin increases subsequent to the initiation of antimalarial treatment, which likely induces transient inflammation due to release of parasite-derived material into the bloodstream. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The increase in hepcidin we observed was accompanied by increases in acute-phase markers, decreased transferrin saturation, and increased serum activin A. Moreover, changes in activin A and hepcidin during infection were correlated, with the volunteers who exhibited the greatest hepcidin induction also demonstrating the most marked increases in activin A concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of activin A induction in the context of malaria infection and also the first to directly compare hepcidin and activin A levels in human serum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The moderate response we observed in volunteers infected in CHMI trials may be more pronounced in naturally infected individuals in the field, in whom parasitemia levels can greatly exceed the low parasitemia that is allowed in CHMI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>We also showed that human PBMC, when cocultured with iRBC, upregulated activin A mRNA, providing one plausible physiological source for increased activin A serum levels during infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Finally, we treated P. berghei-infected mice with a combination of anti-activin A and anti-activin B antibodies to test whether activin neutralization could abrogate the hepcidin response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The antibody treatment was efficacious in blocking activin signaling, as shown by significant decreases in activin-regulated genes Serpine1 and Fst, but there was no observed change in hepcidin or Id1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>These data suggest activins are not required for hepcidin upregulation in this murine model of Plasmodium infection, although they do not rule out that activins could play a role in hepcidin regulation in malaria in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Our findings are consistent with a recent study demonstrating that Inhbbâ/â mice continued to display hepcidin upregulation in response to LPS challenge (31) but contrast with another study that demonstrated abrogation of hepcidin upregulation after LPS challenge by use of the activin-binding protein follistatin (32). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we provide evidence that hepcidin upregulation in uncomplicated blood-stage Plasmodium infection is correlated with BMP/SMAD pathway activity in the liver. However, despite showing perturbations to expression of activins A and B in mouse and human malaria and confirming that activins induce hepcidin expression, neutralization of activins during murine malaria infection did not affect hepcidin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This suggests other factors are responsible for hepcidin expression in this context. </plain></SENT>
