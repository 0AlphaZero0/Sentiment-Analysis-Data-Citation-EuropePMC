</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies of seasonal variation in bacterioplankton metatranscriptomes [1, 2] revealed that Thaumarchaeota were abundant in Georgia coastal waters during mid-summer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thaumarchaeota 16S rRNA genes (rrs) and Archaea ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA) were detected at &gt;107 copies L−1 in August during quarterly sampling from the ferry dock at Marsh Landing, Sapelo Island, Georgia [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These peaks coincided with a mid-summer peak in nitrite concentration [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nitrite is an intermediate in the geochemical process of nitrification, produced by the oxidation of ammonia and removed by oxidation to nitrate [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Members of the Archaea (Thaumarchaeota, ammonia-oxidizing archaea or AOA) and Bacteria (Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria) are known to oxidize ammonia, whereas nitrite is oxidized by several groups of Bacteria [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recently, members of the genus Nitrospira have been identified that can perform both steps of nitrification (complete ammonia oxidation (AO) or comammox; [9, 10]); however, marker genes from organisms capable of comammox have not been detected in the marine environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Because our previous studies focused on one location in a dynamic coastal environment, they could not distinguish between in situ growth of the Thaumarchaeota population there vs. local population dynamics coupled to broader scale circulation patterns that could include advection or mixing from a population outside the immediate study area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The Marsh Landing sampling site is at the mouth of the Duplin River, a tidal creek draining ~ 1200 ha of salt marsh inshore of Sapelo Island. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The station is located adjacent to, and exchanges water with, Doboy Sound and thence the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) on every tidal cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The SAB is characterized by a broad, shallow (&lt;50 m) continental shelf that extends ~ 1000 km along the southeast coast of the United States, from approximately West Palm Beach FL to Cape Hatteras NC, and 130 km across the shelf at its apex at Savannah, GA, USA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Water properties in the nearshore zone of the SAB are influenced by river flow and tidal exchange with extensive salt marshes and estuaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Nearshore (z &lt; 15 m) flow in the SAB trends from north to south, while shelf-break and slope waters (z &gt; 50 m) are influenced by the Gulf Stream, flowing south to north [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The water column over the continental shelf is well-mixed by tidal currents (semidiurnal, 2–3 m tidal amplitude at the apex of the SAB), but is stratified over deeper water at the shelf-break, with a thermocline between 50 and 100 m [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We extended our survey of Thaumarchaeota populations to continental shelf and shelf-break waters of the SAB to evaluate the areal extent of the bloom and to detect source populations, if any, that might influence population dynamics at our primary study site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We sampled at approximately monthly intervals from April to November, 2014, to determine whether the seasonal dynamics of Thaumarchaeota populations in the SAB reflected, or drove, the dynamics we recorded at Marsh Landing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although covariance of nitrite concentrations and Thaumarchaeota abundance at Marsh Landing strongly suggested that this population oxidizes ammonia, Hollibaugh et al. [4] did not measure AO rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Thus, we measured AO using 15N-labeled ammonium, with the goal of assessing the magnitude of rates and determining whether rates covaried with the distribution of Thaumarchaeota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition to recording Thaumarchaeota abundance, we also determined the abundance of amoA genes from ammonia-oxidizing betaproteobacteria (AOB) to evaluate their distribution relative to AOA and AO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Finally, we measured the abundance of 16S rRNA genes (rrs) from Nitrospina, an important member of the guild of marine nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB; [12–15]), to evaluate coupling between ammonia- and nitrite oxidation in these waters. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Thaumarchaeota were never abundant on the SAB continental shelf, and the deep-water population found at the shelf-break was phylogenetically distinct from the inshore population, indicating that the summer bloom observed previously at an inshore site does not originate offshore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>OBS (light penetration) explains most of the variation in the spatial distribution of Thaumarchaeota in the SAB, suggesting that factors related to light penetration control the potential for the development of Thaumarchaeota populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Within the inshore zone of the SAB where light penetration is consistently low, water temperature appears to exert secondary control on the potential for bloom development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The weak correlation between Thaumarchaeota and Nitrospina distributions and the strong correlation between AO and nitrite concentration is consistent with the mid-summer accumulation of nitrite in inshore waters that appears to result from differential responses of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing organisms to seasonal variation in water temperature [73–80]. </plain></SENT>
