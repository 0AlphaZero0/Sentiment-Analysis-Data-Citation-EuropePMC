</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>About 4% of Escherichia coli membrane proteins are localized at the cell poles, which is critical for their function [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The polar localization of chemoreceptors, like the serine chemoreceptor Tsr, is required sensing environmental signals [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Tsr is a highly abundant transmembrane methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) and is stably localized at the poles in variably sized clusters [2], which are necessary for collaborative signalling [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tsr is one of five MCPs that form heterotrimeric membrane complexes at the poles [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, the polar distribution of Tsr is asymmetric and changes during the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Such asymmetry may be crucial in chemotaxis, chromosome segregation, and motility [3, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>One way polar localization is thought to be achieved depends on the geometrical curvature of the cell and segregation of chromosomal DNA to the polar regions [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The problem of polar localization has been previously investigated using single molecule techniques which provide direct imaging of the trajectories of individual molecules in living cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Deich et al. [6] showed that the membrane-bound histidine kinase PleC localizes to the flagellar pole in motile swarmer cells of Caulobacter crescentus during asymmetric cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The mobile fraction of newly synthesized PleC molecules are homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasmic (inner) membrane and show no active, direct transport to re-localize during development from the motile swarmer cell to the pre-divisional cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similar results were observed for the C. crescentus chromosome anchor protein PopZ [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These results support a model in which protein redistribution arises from random diffusion and capture, as proposed by Rudner et al. [9] and Shapiro et al. [10] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Other mechanisms of polar localization also exist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Targeting of the outer membrane virulence protein IcsA to the pole, which is required for unidirectional actin-based movement of Shigella flexneria in the host cell [11], is generated by its delivery exclusively at one pole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A polar gradient of IcsA is generated by lateral diffusion from the pole through the outer membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were also seen in E. coli as well as more distantly related Yersinia pseadotuberculosis [12], suggesting that the mechanism of polar targeting of these outer membrane proteins is conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Jain et al. [13] extended these findings to the large autotransporter family of virulence proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Chromosome segregation during cell division in E. coli and related bacteria depends on separation of the nucleoids to polar regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Woldringh et al. [14] proposed that this is acheived by transient constraining of DNA segments by coupled transcription-translation-secretion (“transertion”) of membrane proteins and a bias in the creation of transertion regions when chromosomes are replicated bidirectionally and newly replicated neighboring genes for membrane proteins are expressed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Considering the localization of chemoreceptors in E. coli, recent publications have shown the importance of the Tol-Pal complex [15], nucliod-exclusion [16] and membrane curvature [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Shiomi et al. [18] showed that the aspartate chemosensor Tar first appeared within the cylindrical portion of the cell and was distributed in a helical pattern that colocalized with the Sec translocation machinery but not with the helical cytoskeletal protein MreB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>They found Tar localized to the poles 80 minutes after induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thiem et al. [19] showed through fluorescently labeling CheR, which binds to the C-terminal of Tsr and Tar, that clusters of chemoreceptors occur at regular intervals along the cell body marking future cell division sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Also using fluorescently labeled CheR, Santos et al. [15] showed that deletion of the Tol-Pal trans-envelope complex severely disrupted the polar localization of chemoreceptor clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Neeli-Venkata et al. [16] proposed a model where nucleoid exclusion coupled with diffusion-and-capture by the Tol-Pal complex fit their results on Tsr localization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Further, membrane curvature at the poles has been shown to assist in localization of large clusters of chemoreceptors [17, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It has been shown elsewhere that Tsr accumulates at the poles linearly over time [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The greater accumulation of Tsr at the old pole relative to the new pole was used to discriminate the two poles in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Here we examined how Tsr is localized to the poles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We coupled ensemble and single molecule quantitative imaging methods to study the asymmetry of the poles in E. coli. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We recently found that the majority of newly synthesized Tsr accumulate at the old poles of E. coli and diffuse at different rates at the polar and cylindrical surface regions [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We also showed that there is no active transport for Tsr mobility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Single pole photobleach/recovery experiments show that newly emerging molecules are first aggregated at the old pole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Direct fluorescence imaging implies that the new pole matures through capture of molecules escaping the old pole and diffusing to the new pole region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with the model that newly synthesized Tsr is first inserted at or near the old pole, where Tsr is captured by existing chemotaxis complexes, but can escape and freely diffuse throughout the cell membrane and captured by small or unstable seeds of Tsr (or other chemotaxis complexes) clusters at the new pole. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Experiments were carried out using cells attached to glass slides which permitted examining individual cells over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>By observing numerous cells over 5 min growth periods, we quantified the positions of individual Tsr-Venus molecules within single cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, we bleached all Tsr-Venus fluorescence in living cells at time zero and again at 1-min intervals after imaging newly observed Tsr-Venus molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Cells were sheltered from illumination between observations to allow for newly synthesized and maturing Tsr-Venus molecules appear without photobleaching. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We found through direct single molecule counting, a total of 2356 new fluorescent spots among 1956 cells were observed over a 5 minute time scale, with 630 cells displaying more than one event, implying an upper bound for the protein production rate of 0.24 proteins per cell per min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Further, spots were not homogeneously distributed; rather, 83% were localized near poles, defined as a sphere 0.5 μm in radius, located within 0.5 μm from a cell end. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>As expected, the synthesis rate of Tsr-Venus is low (0.24 proteins/min measured over 1956 cells) and newly synthesized Tsr-Venus was first observed mostly near the poles, which is where MCP chemotaxis clusters are located (see Table A in S1 File). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To investigate the photostability of the poles, we performed whole cell photobleaching. Fig 1A shows individual image frames extracted from a typical movie (out of ~100 cells imaged) (S1 Movie) showing photobleaching of both poles under continuous illumination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The left panel is an integrated image of S1 Movie (1316 frames, at 30 fps), which shows one pole is significantly brighter than the other when viewed as a single, long exposure image with much enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Here we will refer to the bright pole from the integrated image as the “old pole” and the dimmer pole as the “young pole” [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The image sequences show young poles bleach more quickly than the old poles throughout. Fig 1B shows the intensity profile of a linear cross section along the long axis of the cell (red dotted line in the left panel of Fig 1A) as a function of bleaching time. Fig 1C shows the total intensity of young and old poles (circled areas in left panel of Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>While photobleaching of young poles follows an expected exponential decay, photobleaching of old poles deviates from such a decay rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The fluorescence intensity at old poles was reduced only 30% within 5 sec while intensity of young poles dropped 80% (Fig 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The differential behaviour of photobleaching of old and young poles (Fig A in S1 File, S2 Movie) may result from different dwell times or the acquisition of newly synthesized Tsr-Venus proteins at old poles, which is consistent with results above. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Our results show a distinct asymmetry of the cell poles both in terms of stability and recovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>By using Tsr-Venus, we specifically showed: a) the bright (old) pole photobleaches more slowly than the dim (new) pole when photobleaching the whole cell (Fig 1); b) the old pole recovers fluorescence intensisty faster after whole cell photobleaching; c) both poles exchange Tsr-Venus with diffusing molecules in the membrane, however the old pole is more stable than the young pole (Figs 2 and 3); and d) localization analysis shows areas of the new pole where the new polar cluster forms (Fig 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Results from single pole photobleaching and recovery show the relative stability of the two poles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>When both poles show similar intensities, sheltering the new pole from photobleaching shows substantial reduction of fluorescence of the new pole, implying that molecules localized near the new pole easily escape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Conversely, sheltering the old pole reveals much less reduction of fluorescence of the old pole, implying that the old pole is much more stable and/or rapidly accumulates newly synthesized Tsr-Venus after bleaching. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>We also observed that the old pole recovered fluorescence much faster than the new pole region after bleaching either pole singly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that Tsr-Venus molecules in the inner membrane freely diffuse on 5 ms time scales [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>We also found that the majority are trapped at the poles within nested compartments of 170 nm and 290 nm length scales. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>A non-Gaussianity test of individual Tsr-Venus trajectories showed that Tsr-Venus was constrained by these compartments at time scales longer than 5 ms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Notably, we found no evidence that Tsr-Venus is stably immobilized to any immobile structure at the poles, rather Tsr-Venus molecules are restricted from escape (see S1 File) which is consistent with recently found mechanisms for corralling chemoreceptors into the polar region (such as the Tol-Pal complex [15] and membrane curvature effects [17]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>A small fraction (7%) of molecules was found diffuse freely in the membrane with a diffusion coefficient of 0.4 μm2/s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Presumably, these molecules are the ones that escape and are free to explore the entire cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>They may originate from the relatively stable old pole or unstable newly forming new pole. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>By applying single molecule localization analysis techniques to images of the freely diffusing Tsr-Venus molecules, we obtained trajectories showing a propensity of Tsr-Venus to localize near the new pole, further underlining the relative stability of the two poles (S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Together these findings are consistent with a transertion-diffusion-capturing mechanism for pole maturity combining the previously proposed transertion mechanism [14] with diffusion-capturing mechanisms[6, 9, 15–17] for the polar localization of Tsr at the poles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we propose that newly synthesized Tsr preferentially accumulates near the old pole by interacting with relatively stable chemotaxis complexes containing other proteins of the chemotaxis machinery at that pole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The new pole is populated by Tsr molecules (or small clusters) that escape the old pole and diffuse through the membrane to the newly forming pole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Over time, accumulation of Tsr into clusters containing other chemotaxis proteins at the new pole forms stable chemotaxis complexes that matures into stable old pole structures during cell division. </plain></SENT>
