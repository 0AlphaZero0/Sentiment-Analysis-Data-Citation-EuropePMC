</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterised by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, autoimmunity and vasculopathy.1 Although the biological mechanisms underlying SSc are not fully understood, interplay between vasculopathy, autoimmunity and fibrosis may perpetuate a state of aberrant wound repair.2 Disease modification remains elusive, and treatment focuses on complications such as interstitial lung disease, pulmonary artery hypertension and peripheral vasculopathy.3 Clinical heterogeneity is a hallmark of SSc, and patients with severe progressive diffuse skin involvement have poor outcomes; more effective treatment for this subset of patients is an important unmet medical need.4 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Fibroblasts play a central role in the biology of the disease5 by interacting with endothelial cells6 and leucocytes7 in a complex biological network involving cytokines and adhesion molecules,8 resulting in excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and in tissue stiffening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) plays a central role in fibrosis9 by promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and by inducing profibrotic molecules and proliferation.10 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) also plays an important role in SSc11 by regulating the function of immune and non-immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Dermal fibroblasts from patients with SSc express increased levels of IL-612; elevated levels of IL-6 are associated with early disease,13 and increased serum IL-6 level predicts higher mortality risk, worse skin involvement and increased pulmonary decline.14 15 IL-6 is known to induce TGFβ production by cardiac fibroblasts16 and to enhance TGFβ-signalling in dermal fibroblasts17 and cardiac fibroblasts.18 Conversely, TGFβ regulates the expression of IL-6 by lung fibroblasts19 and airway smooth muscle cells.20 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the specific effect of IL-6 on the biology of fibroblasts in vivo, we took advantage of a unique clinical experiment—the faSScinate study—in which SSc patients were treated for 24 weeks with tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor-α blocking antibody. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The faSScinate study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled phase 2 study of TCZ in adult SSc patients with &lt;5 years’ disease duration, a modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) between 15 and 40 units and active progressive disease according to specified clinical or laboratory features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>No concomitant immunosuppressive medication was permitted at study entry or during the first 24 weeks of the trial.21 In this study, 43 patients with SSc received weekly TCZ 162 mg subcutaneously and 44 patients with SSc received weekly PBO subcutaneously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, primary clinical data from the faSScinate trial showed a trend of benefit in favour of TCZ for the primary endpoint or mRSS and a strong trend at 48 weeks together with congruent benefit in exploratory endpoints including lung function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Based on these results, a phase 3 trial of TCZ is under way (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02453256). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Here we define the molecular and functional phenotype of explant dermal fibroblasts from a representative subset of patients with SSc enrolled into faSScinate and demonstrate a profound reversal of the hallmark profibrotic properties of these cells after treatment with TCZ for 24 weeks compared with controls from the PBO arm of the trial. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The contraction node regroups 11 pathways related to cellular contractility machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>The migration node includes four pathways positively related to cell movement. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The five pathways grouped under the cardiovascular node are generally associated with endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell biology but are also known to be positively related to fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Although the main function of the two pathways grouped under the coagulation node is blood clotting, these pathways play an important role in linking vascular events to fibrotic events in SSc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The activation node regroups eight pathways representing major signalling molecules and transcription factors positively associated with cellular activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The two pathways grouped in the hormones node are thought to contribute to the pathobiology of SSc, but the exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain ill defined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Three of the four pathways included in the morphogenesis node belong to the bone morphogenetic protein family, and the fourth pathway in this node is related to neuregulin biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Overall, for the baseline SSc explant dermal fibroblasts (SSc vs NF comparison), the functions and activation status of the top 50 selected pathways depict a highly activated fibrotic, motile and contractile phenotype dominated by TGFβ superfamily member-regulated biology, where positive regulators (n=47) are activated and negative regulators (n=3) are predicted to be inhibited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for the dermal fibroblasts collected from patients treated with TCZ for 24 weeks (TCZ week 24 vs baseline comparison), the same 50 pathways are predicted to have the opposite activation status. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>This study provides exceptional insight into the molecular pathology of dermal fibroblasts in severe SSc and unique insight into the likely key pathways and mediators involved in SSc pathogenesis, building on the original observations of LeRoy.28 By linking the ex vivo data to promising clinical responses in a PBO-controlled trial of TCZ, our results also elucidate new and important mechanisms by which TCZ may exert an antifibrotic effect and build on data from whole-skin gene expression analysis from the faSScinate phase 2 study.21 Although it was demonstrated that treatment with TCZ for 24 weeks resulted in a specific downregulation of genes associated with M2 macrophages and with the IL-6 pathway, little specific effect of TCZ treatment could be detected on genes associated with fibrosis at the whole-skin biopsy level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Considering the multicellular complexity and relative heterogeneity of whole-skin biopsy samples used in this study, we hypothesised that the effect of TCZ on fibroblasts might be masked by the gene expression of other cellular compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The clinical homogeneity of the faSScinate patients and the access to samples collected from the same patients before and after 24 weeks of treatment with TCZ or PBO allowed us to use relatively small numbers of samples to generate robust and reliable results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>As a result, we are able to confirm and expand on the description of the profibrotic properties of SSc dermal fibroblasts at the functional and genomic levels, establish that the profibrotic phenotype of SSc dermal fibroblasts is stable over ≥24 weeks in patients treated with PBO in the absence of immunosuppressant (cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate) and demonstrate that treatment of SSc patients with TCZ for 24 weeks profoundly alters the biological characteristics of dermal fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The baseline functional and genomic properties of the dermal explant fibroblasts analysed in this study closely match those described in previous publications.23 24 29 Specifically, the baseline SSc dermal fibroblasts produced elevated levels of profibrotic proteins and of migration and contractility activities and differentially expressed a distinct set of fibrosis-related genes with a high prevalence of TGFβ-regulated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>Considering that the faSScinate patients were experiencing active progressive disease at study entry,21 our observation is consistent with the work of Sargent et al,24 who reported that the differential expression of genes regulated by TGFβ is associated with more severe disease when detected at the whole-biopsy level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Over the years, the study of explant dermal fibroblasts in vitro has provided valuable insight into the pathobiology of SSc.6 7 22 28 30 31 The fact that the phenotypic abnormalities of SSc dermal fibroblasts persist in vitro over multiple passages has been critical to this line of investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to note that dermal fibroblasts are heterogeneous and that they manifest different properties as a function of their microenvironment.32 The potential selection pressure imposed by isolation, plating and passage procedures makes it likely that only a subset of fibroblasts is accessible to in vitro studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>These may represent fibroblasts that are more motile, better able to acclimate to the culture conditions or have higher growth potential, thus perhaps representing stem cell population(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>For any of these reasons, we might have selected a fibroblast subpopulation in the explant culture conditions more sensitive to the effects of IL-6 inhibition. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>We used IPA (Qiagen) to associate gene expression with biological pathways, focusing on the molecular and cellular biology of relevance to fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The top 50 pathways associated with SSc differentially expressed genes could be grouped into 10 core biological nodes that covered two levels of biology: biology intrinsic to fibroblasts (fibrosis, contraction, migration, growth and activation) and biology extrinsic to fibroblasts (cardiovascular, coagulation, hormones, inflammation and morphogenesis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The pathways forming the intrinsic group reflect canonical features of fibrotic fibroblasts5 with a dominant contribution by TGFβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>This dominance of TGFβ-related biology is apparent in the fibrosis node and in the contraction node, where activation of Rho GTPases can be triggered by TGFβ in a SMAD-independent process,33 and in the activation node, where Ras, RAF1 and ERK are part of one branch of SMAD-independent TGFβ signalling.34 Conversely, the pathways forming the extrinsic group represent biological processes that link inflammation and vasculopathy to fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>For example, not only are the cardiovascular pathways EDN1 and AGT potent mediators of vasoconstriction,35 36 they are profibrotic mediators relevant to the pathobiology of SSc.37 38 This is notable considering the prominent vasculopathy of SSc and the putative benefit for patients with SSc of drugs that target these pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in addition to playing a key role in response to angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and the VEGFA-inducing transcription factor endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1 amplify fibrosis,39 creating a link between response to hypoxia and fibrosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Although excessive inhibition of angiogenesis could be detrimental, our data support normalisation of the activation status of cardiovascular-related pathways rather than complete blockade of these pathways, which might be detrimental for wound healing or tissue repair. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Patient treatment with TCZ for 24 weeks profoundly affected the properties of explant dermal fibroblasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>It is not possible to determine whether treatment with TCZ modified the phenotype of resident cells or the cellular composition of the dermis; both these mechanisms are non-exclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Independent of the exact mechanism, the effect of IL-6Rα blockade on biological pathways dominated by TGFβ-related biology is striking and highlights the interaction between IL-6 and TGFβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Although TGFβ is the quintessential profibrotic factor,9 IL-6 has also been shown to induce the production of fibrotic markers (CTGF, αSMA and collagen 1) by human fibroblasts in vitro.15 Hence, IL-6 and TGFβ may form a self-sustaining loop leading to fibrosis that could be interrupted by blockade of either or both cytokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>This is supported by recent work demonstrating that STAT3, the main downstream signalling element for IL-6, is an important TGFβ-dependent molecular checkpoint of fibrosis in SSc.40 Altogether, these results and our observations at the whole-biopsy level21 suggest a potential interaction network between IL-6 and TGFβ involving fibroblasts and macrophages that leads to fibrosis in SSc (figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Thus, blocking IL-6 signalling with TCZ may represent a novel approach to control both the TGFβ pathway and the inflammatory pathways, supporting further exploration of IL-6 and related mediators as potential therapeutic targets in SSc and other inflammation-driven fibrotic diseases. </plain></SENT>
