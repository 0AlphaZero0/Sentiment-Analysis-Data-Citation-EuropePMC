</text></title><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chagas disease is a zoonotic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite endemic to Latin America. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most infections occur in children by vector or congenital transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women in Latin America ranges between 5–40% depending on the geographical area and the rate of congenital transmission is estimated to be 1–12% [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, due to population mobility, Chagas disease has been increasingly detected in other non-endemic countries and continents (where the vector does not exist) such as the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe and Asia [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Congenital transmission, in spite of its low transmission rates, is partially responsible for the progressive globalization of the disease [2, 4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Importantly, congenital infection is responsible for an estimated 22% of new infections in 2010, making this form of transmission epidemiologically relevant [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The parasite presents a complex life-cycle that occurs in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, where three major developmental stages are observed: epimastigotes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Trypomastigotes constitute the extracellular infective form in mammals where they are able to infect a wide range of nucleated mammalian cells [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, T. cruzi has co-evolved with mammals to establish a complexity of specific molecular parasite-host cell interactions to invade host cells and tissues, to evade the host immune system and to undergo intracellular replication [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Key steps in parasite infection include its host cell penetration and replication of the protozoa in the cytoplasm of infected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The application of oligonucleotide and cDNA microarray technologies in the study of host-parasite interactions have permitted rapid and unbiased examination of changes in expression of a large number of genes at the level of transcription [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, these studies have been mainly focused on the interaction between the parasite and different cell types, but not on the infection and invasion on a tissue level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>During congenital transmission, T. cruzi must cross the placental barrier in order to infect the developing fetus [3, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This anatomical barrier is formed by the trophoblast, a two-layer epithelium which is in direct contact with maternal blood, the fetal connective tissue (villous stroma), the endothelium of fetal vessels and the basal laminae that support the epithelia [3, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the congenital transmission rate for T. cruzi is low [4, 13] and it has been proposed that the placenta might play an important role avoiding parasite infection [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The study of gene expression profiles during infection constitutes a very powerful tool to analyze global responses of several kinds of cells and tissues, allowing the identification of new genes and/or pathways implicated in the establishment of the infection and pathogenesis as well as possible local tissue responses [3, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Therefore, here we aimed to study the global changes of transcriptome in the placental tissue after T. cruzi challenge. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Similar results have been obtained in animal models, where important changes in murine myocardium metabolic pathways [29] and in murine placental response [24] are described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The increase of gene expression of proteases involved in ECM-remodeling (Table 2) is in concordance with our previous results showing that the parasite increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in human placenta [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The profound changes in genes involved in signaling agrees with numerous previous studies that showed that T. cruzi activates or inhibits several signal transduction pathways [14, 28, 30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The effect of T. cruzi on the immune system responses are particularly relevant since they are our main defense against the pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>The parasite dramatically changes host genes involved in the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The expression of an important number of genes of innate immunity is increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Thus, genes related to complement regulation and function such as CD46 and C1q are upregulated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown, that during ex vivo infection of HPE, T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) acts as a virulence factor since it binds maternal classical complement component C1q and increases parasite infectivity [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TLRs are also increased, particularly TLR-7 and TLR-8 which are increased over 20-fold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The validation experiments show that both mentioned TLRs as well as TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 are significantly increased (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>However, TLR-2, the TLR whose inhibition increases parasite infection in HPE as well as parasite-induced tissue damage [17] showed no significant increase in the microarray analysis (Additional file 1: Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>A similar contradictory result was obtained with IL-6; a high parasite concentration decreases the expression of this cytokine more than 60-fold (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>However, a low parasite concentration does not change IL-6 expression (Additional file 1: Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>However, our RT-qPCR data show a significant increase of IL-6 (Fig. 5) that is in concordance with the increase of IL-6 protein in the culture media of HPE after parasite challenge in the same condition [17], suggesting regulation at post-transcriptional levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Another important group of genes that change their expression are those related to pregnancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Most of the 19 upregulated genes in the four different experimental conditions compared to control samples are related to pregnancy processes (Table 3) and to the maintenance and development of the fetus such as pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoproteins, GH2 (growth hormone 2), CSH1 and CSH2 (chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Given that the placenta is the sole interface between mother and fetus and that this organ not only protects the fetus from infection but also regulates important metabolic and other physiological processes [32], it appears easily explainable that different pregnancy related processes are affected. </plain></SENT>
