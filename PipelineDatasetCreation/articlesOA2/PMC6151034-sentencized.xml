</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are typically associated with old age and represent a major cause of morbidity, functional dependence and socio-economic burden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These fractures also represent a sign of frailty, associated with a one-year mortality of approximately 30% [1–3] The affected patient population is very heterogeneous [4–6], with pre-fracture characteristics like age, the number of independent activities of daily living (ADLs) or the presence of dementia [6] being prognostic factors for long-term outcome [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The treatment of FNFs is a matter of debate and varies with age, fracture pattern and general health [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For elderly patients with FNFs, conservative treatment and osteosynthesis have mostly been abandoned [8–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>At our institution, many elderly patients are treated with cemented [13] hemiarthroplasty (HA) due to better short-term results, avoidance of suffering, efficient restoration of functional capacities and preservation of independence [9–12, 14, 15] (see Fig. 1 for the institutional treatment algorithm).Fig. 1Institutional treatment algorithm for femoral neck fractures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Algorithm for the treatment of FNF with a high degree of personalizability according to the specific patient characteristics, with a focus is on early pain free and fully weight-bearing mobilization </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Approaches for joint replacement though can differ considerably in their invasiveness [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The lateral transgluteal Hardinge (LAT) approach [17] has been one of the standard approaches for joint replacement of the hip for decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the twenty-first century, the anterior minimally invasive Hueter (AMIS) approach regained popularity [18–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This approach allows a muscle-sparing access to the hip joint using an inter-muscular and inter-nervous plane, while the transgluteal approach necessitates the transection of muscular tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The rationale for using the AMIS approach is a potential reduction of soft tissue damage, blood loss and postoperative pain, as well as an acceleration of postoperative mobilisation, with a consecutive reduction of length of stay (LOS) and duration of rehabilitation [21–25] compared to other approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Despite several publications, there is no consensus on the optimal approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA) [26, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reported data after THA have typically been derived from a younger and healthier population of patients with osteoarthritis [21–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Evidence from geriatric patients suffering FNFs is scarce [28–32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the primary objective of the trial was the comparison of a minimally invasive to a more conventional approach for the implantation of cemented HA in elderly patients suffering from FNFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The “Timed up and go” test (TUG) [33] at 3 weeks was chosen as the primary endpoint due to its prognostic value for long-term mobility and independence [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>A reduction of 20% in the TUG duration was assumed to be clinically relevant [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The secondary objectives of the trial were an evaluation of the changes in functional independence and TUG performance during the first postoperative year; the description of differences in the surgical performance, complications and mortality between the two approaches; and a subgroup analysis on the influence of functional independence and cognitive impairment. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The literature describes unfavourable outcomes in patients affected by frailty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>The definition of frailty remains controversial [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Frailty often is described as a multidimensional dynamic state of increased vulnerability and loss of resistance to external stressors, resulting in an increased risk of adverse outcomes [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The protocol envisaged a subgroup analysis based on the MSQ scores as a surrogate marker for frailty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This was complemented by visualising treatment effects in dependence on pfFIM status, given the inverse relationship between the baseline FIM and frailty [49]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>It might be assumed that the rather early occurrence and – in our dataset – persistence of outcome differences was related to the impact of hardly reversible perioperative deconditioning due to persistent pain or immobilisation, which has been associated with the traditional approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>This tendency could also be an explanation for the more pronounced benefit of AMIS in patients with a higher risk of frailty, i.e. more frailty associated characteristics and potentially less reserve, to compensate for postoperative muscular hypotrophy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par68"><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>This association points towards a methodological dilemma and might explain the current lack of high-level evidence for the superiority of minimally invasive surgery in the treatment of FNFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>There are few recently published RCTs analysing the benefit of minimally invasive surgery in patients with FNFs [31, 54–57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The analysed patient populations tend to be relatively small, and most trials exclude cognitively impaired patients, who make up a large proportion of the affected elderly population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The heterogeneity of the population in principle complicates the generation of valid generalisable data. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par69"><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In addition, the aspects of old age and cognitive impairment present a conceptual difficulty in RCTs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Cognitively impaired patients or patients diagnosed with dementia are typically excluded from interventional trials given the complexity of legitimate inclusion as well as the potential difficulty of meaningful data acquisition [58–60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In our institution, approximately one-third of patients presenting with an FNF suffer from dementia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The rate of more subtle cognitive impairment is significantly higher. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In these patients, an early return to their previous residential status and function is especially important [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Our data show a strong correlation between surrogate markers for frailty like FIM and MSQ as measure of cognitive impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>There is also a marked correlation with the calculated frailty index comprising FIM, medication and comorbidities that has been reported as predictor of mortality, 30-day residence and length of inpatient stay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>All of these measures predicted a benefit of AMIS over LAT as an approach for HA, which was specifically pronounced in patients with MSQ scores ≤7, i.e., in the presence of cognitive impairment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par70"><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In a literature review on minimally invasive THA, Jung et al. [62] reported consistently lower levels of pain and use of analgesics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The same effect has been documented after HA for FNFs in retrospective and prospective analyses [30, 31, 63], and this effect was also present in our data set, with patients in the AMIS-arm on average suffering lower levels of pain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>However, the effect did not reach significance, unlike in previous studies [31, 63], and must be interpreted with caution since the agreement between formal ratings and verbal expressions of pain or discomfort seems to decrease with advancing age [64], and the reliability with cognitive impairment might be additionally limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par71"><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Another aspect reported as an advantage after minimally invasive surgery is lower blood loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>We documented intraoperative blood loss as well as haemoglobin levels at different postoperative time points. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>We found, however, that these parameters were not reliable (or consistent) in our data set due to lack of standardised documentation of the intraoperative blood loss and individualised fluid management, as reported by other authors [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>As a surrogate marker, the need for transfusion was evaluated, which is handled uniformly at our institution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>We observed a higher need for transfusion within the first 72 h for patients treated with LAT compared to patients after AMIS as reported after HA via the AMIS approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>This is an important aspect in a comorbid patient population, since patients are not only at high risk of fluid overload and cardiac complications as a consequence of blood transfusion but also at a high risk of complications from anaemia such as delirium, fatigue and prolonged immobilisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned RCTs on the subject report conflicting results in this aspect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par72"><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>We should finally note that we observed a non-significant increase in mortality under AMIS, corresponding to 8 more deaths in 100 patients, without being able to give a clear explanation for the result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Further investigations in larger populations are necessary to clarify the question of a true difference in mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec10"><title><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Strengths and limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par73"><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>The strength of the current trial is its RCT design with a relatively high number of patients, including patients with cognitive deficits, which reduces the potential for selection bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The early assessment of TUG as a functional parameter for the primary outcome makes the current results predictive for performance in ADLs and for preservation of independence [34, 35], which are highly patient-relevant endpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>However, we did not include instruments sensitive enough to catch such long-term differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>An additional strength is the large number of participating surgeons and their allocation by independent administrative procedures, resulting in a highly balanced allocation and avoiding a bias in treatment effect estimation due to experience-based selection of surgeons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>A uniform level of surgical quality could be ascertained by the presence of a senior expert. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par74"><text><SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>We included in the analysis of the primary outcome 144 patients, nearly reaching the intended sample size of 150 as planned by the power analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We also observed a difference in median duration of TUG performance of 6 s (LAT: 41 s, AMIS: 35 s), corresponding to the assumed effect in the sample size calculation and hitting the MCID reported for the TUG [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The failure to reach significance may be due to our decision to include in the analysis patients who failed to perform the TUG successfully with a duration of 300 s, which is in contrast to other studies ignoring these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>In this way, we reduced the potential for bias, but we also increased the variability and hence reduced the power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Indeed, exclusion of these patients leads to a smaller treatment effect estimate of − 16.8%, with a smaller p-value of 0.089. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par75"><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>The current trial is limited by the high rate of screening failures, which is typical in prospective RCTs in elderly patients [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a certain loss to follow-up and failure to perform the TUG is problematic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>However, sensitivity analyses suggest that the main findings are robust against different ways of handling missing values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The patient numbers in the two treatment arms show a distinct – but insignificant – difference, reflecting the lack of block randomisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>We also have to note that the FIM is constructed as an observational tool for nursing home staff with close contact to patients, but it was used in our trial by study nurses relying on patient or proxy narratives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>We did not perform a specific assessment of the pre-fracture frailty in this trial, and hence we were forced to use surrogate measures to investigate a dependence of the treatment effect on frailty. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par76"><text><SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>FNFs in elderly patients are frequent, and given demographic developments, their socio-economic impact will increase in coming decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Every step contributing to a better outcome in these patients is beneficial for the individual patient and for society. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the present trial – despite failing to reach a significant difference in the primary outcome – adds to a growing body of evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These results support the implementation of a specifically designed treatment regimen for fragility fractures, taking into account the complexity of the heterogeneous patient population known as “the elderly”. </plain></SENT>
