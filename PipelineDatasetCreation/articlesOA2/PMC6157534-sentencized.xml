<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although implementation of the evidence-based Surviving Sepsis Guidelines has resulted in improvement in sepsis-related deaths, in-hospital mortality continues to range from 12% to 40%, with an estimated 5.3 million global deaths annually,1 and an estimated healthcare cost of US$14 to $24 billion per year in the USA.2 3 Septic shock survivors often suffer from diminished cognitive function, psychological problems, increased malignancy risk, increased hospitalization rates and long-term damage to organ systems.4 The guidelines provide strong recommendations for initial resuscitation with crystalloids—30 mL/kg within the first 3 hours.5 However, the guidelines state that there is ‘little available evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) to support its practice; this is an area in which research is urgently needed.’5 Furthermore, balanced crystalloids (BC) appear to be safer than normal saline, and albumin yields similar outcomes as crystalloids, thus the optimal fluid type is unknown.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Shock-induced endotheliopathy (SHINE) has been proposed as a mechanism associated with worsened outcomes in patients with critical illness including sepsis.7 Activation of the sympathoadrenal system and release of catecholamines (ie, sepsis or trauma) leads to glycocalyx injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The glycocalyx consists of a network of membrane-bound proteoglycans and glycoproteins that covers the endothelium (figure 1).8–10 This is associated with capillary leakage and microvascular thrombosis, ultimately resulting in organ dysfunction and increased mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Research suggests that endotheliopathy is both a marker and driver of worsened outcome.7 Interventions to prevent, mitigate or treat SHINE may improve outcomes in patients with shock. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>SHINE biomarkers, such as syndecan-1,11 interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFLT-1),10 have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Given that there have been no prior studies on which to base a power calculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Use of Bayesian analyses to complement traditional frequentist analyses will allow estimates of the probability of benefit of plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>A second limitation is that the primary outcome is based on SHINE biomarkers, which are a surrogate endpoint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>The promising effects of plasma on SHINE biomarkers seen in vitro and in animal models may not be replicable in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Moreover, changes in biomarkers may not correlate with clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Larger pragmatic trials are planned if the results of the pilot trial suggest potential benefit with plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>A third limitation of the study is the heterogeneity of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>ED patients are likely to have community-acquired sepsis whereas STICU patients have hospital-acquired sepsis, which prior studies have shown to have different clinical outcomes.23 We chose to incorporate both STICU and ED patients to capture a greater number of eligible patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Despite community-acquired and hospital-acquired sepsis being different clinical entities, the current treatment standard for both populations remains the same. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>To account for this heterogeneity, we will stratify by enrollment location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>By not limiting our patient population, the study’s outcome will be more generalizable to the surgical and trauma septic shock populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study will be the first pilot RCT that compares plasma versus BC in the initial fluid resuscitation of surgical or trauma patients with septic shock. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Results from this study will be hypothesis generating, and may be used to inform future, multicenter RCTs. </plain></SENT>
