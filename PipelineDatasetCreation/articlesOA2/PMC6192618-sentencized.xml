</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Lesser Sunda Islands in eastern Indonesia are an area of high linguistic diversity where several hundreds of often vastly different language varieties are spoken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The area covers a longitudinal distance of some 600 kilometres, including a multitude of islands, major ones of which are Flores, Lembata, Adonara, Solor, Pantar, Alor and Timor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This insular region constitutes the westernmost place where languages of the Austronesian family come into contact with Papuan languages of the Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) family in eastern Indonesia, as shown in Fig 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In such circumstances, language relationships have been very important tools for making inferences about human (pre-)history and tracing population movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, few linguists work in the Lesser Sundas, and their primary linguistic data is often unpublished or scattered across various (including “grey”, that is, unpublished but partly circulated) sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The lack of a collective body of data collected from primary sources has severely limited our understanding of the history of the languages in the Lesser Sundas and the history of their people. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Very little is yet known about the populations and their movements in this area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The Austronesians are commonly assumed to have arrived in the Lesser Sunda area ~3,000 years Before Present (BP) [1,2], but the origin and age of the Papuan family spoken in the Lesser Sunda Islands (the Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) family) is less clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis holds that the speakers are descendants of immigrants from New Guinea who arrived in the Lesser Sundas 4,500–4,000 BP [1,3,4], and that their languages are part of the Trans New Guinea family (cf. [4,5]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, lexical evidence to support such an affiliation is lacking [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Another hypothesis holds that the Papuans in the Lesser Sundas descend from arrivals 20,000 BP [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>While this possibility cannot be excluded, the currently known level of lexical and grammatical similarity in the TAP family does not seem to support a family age of more than a few millennia [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition, ancient Austronesian loans, e.g. ‘betel nut’ [10], are found across the Alor-Pantar (AP) subgroup following regular sound changes, and suggest a higher order family split-up after contact with the Austronesian languages in the area, which would give the AP branch a maximum age of ~3,000 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Work on the historical reconstruction of the TAP family has only just begun, and very little is yet known about the internal structure of low-level groups of the Austronesian languages in this area–let alone their higher order affiliations and external relations [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>With languages of two families coexisting for millennia in a relatively small geographical space, the Lesser Sunda region is also a hotspot of language contact and a laboratory for studying the role of contact in the evolution of languages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The aim of the LexiRumah database is to provide easy online access to large amounts of lexical data for the wider scientific community–including linguists, historians, and ethnographers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This database makes it possible for researchers to explore the linguistic data collected from primary sources, to formulate hypotheses on how the languages of the two families might be internally related and to compare competing hypotheses about subgroupings in the region [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It also allows researchers to study how and when languages might have borrowed particular words, both within and across the language family boundaries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>LexiRumah can thus be instrumental in developing theories of language evolution and change in a hitherto understudied region where small-scale, pre-industrial societies are still the majority. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>And as the database includes geographical data, it also enables the study of relationships between language and space, in order to generate and evaluate hypotheses relating to geographic dispersals of speaker groups within and between the Lesser Sunda Islands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Finally, large-scale lexical databases like LexiRumah allow testing of automatic and quantitative reconstruction methods, which have been shown to be powerful tools for making inferences about human prehistory [14], and dating population expansions [15,16]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="sec004"><title><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>2.1 Academic aims </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>LexiRumah is designed as a tool to study the history of the Lesser Sunda Islands in eastern Indonesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Classical methods in historical comparative linguistics largely focus on vertical transmission and internally motivated changes, aiming to reconstruct the common ancestor and mutual relationships within groups of related languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Language contact studies, by contrast, focus on patterns and constraints in externally motivated changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Truly unravelling the linguistic history of a region requires an approach which combines historical reconstruction with the study of language contact [26], investigating both vertical and horizontal transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Within the lexicon, items have different retention rates [27–29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The general assumption is that basic vocabulary is less easily replaced than non-basic lexicon; for example, numerals are typically quite stable, while words expressing certain particular activities (e.g. ‘to squeeze’) show more variation over time [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Words also have different borrowability characteristics, e.g., nouns are more easily borrowed than verbs [31,32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Loan words may be datable by their spread through a group of languages and level of integration into individual languages and may reflect pre-existing social networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>LexiRumah therefore comprises both basic vocabulary and borrowable vocabulary of various categories, including a range of region-specific vocabulary which could signal contact in particular socio-cultural domains like kinship, religion, politics, or technology at specific moments in time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>2.2 Other aims </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>LexiRumah also provides an accessible repository of lexical data to the general public in Indonesia and elsewhere in the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>It serves as a record of the cultural and linguistic identities and heritages of the minority groups who speak those languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>It makes the linguistic diversity in the Lesser Sundas even more visible for governmental and educational institutions in Indonesia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Educational institutions may decide to use the word lists to make informed decisions on the development of orthographies for local varieties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Internet access is cheap in Indonesia, and increasingly available in more remote locations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>2.3 Language collection policies </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In compiling the materials for the database, we started with a focus on the languages of the Lesser Sunda Islands, where TAP languages form a Papuan family surrounded by Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian, MP) languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we have included data on languages within and across the TAP family borders on Alor, Pantar and in eastern Timor, as well as data on MP languages to the west of Pantar, from the islands of Lembata, Adonara, Solor, Flores, and western Timor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>More languages from these areas, from the islands north and south of Timor, and from Sumba, are currently being prepared for inclusion into the next version of LexiRumah. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Genealogical affiliations between the MP languages in this region are as yet uncertain and understudied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Where known, the reconstructed forms from proto-languages are included in the database (see Section 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies [7] have suggested that there may be a lexical connection between TAP and languages of the Bomberai peninsula in west Papua. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In order to further investigate this eastern connection, we plan to include Bomberai languages as well as lexicons from the languages of Maluku spoken on the islands of Wetar, Ambon, Seram, Aru, Kei, Yamdena, Selaru, and also Halmahera in the future, see Fig 2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We have cases in LexiRumah of multiple dialects from the same language, for instance for Lamaholot, Alorese and Abui. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The observation of micro-variation is useful for both the academic and the non-academic aims of the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>In fact, in several cases, for example for Lamaholot (ISO-693-3: slp, Glottocode: lama1277), it is not clear whether these different varieties should be classified as the same or different languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In order to not take a stance on this, we will use the term ‘lect’ throughout this paper to refer to a language, dialect or other variety included in the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Using the formal terminology defined by Good and Cysouw [33], our notion of ‘lect’ corresponds to ‘languoid composed of all those doculects with both broadly homologous glossonyms and matching location data’. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The data we include are from both published and unpublished sources, as well as from fieldwork, including fieldwork done specificially with the goal of gathering data for this database, see Section 5.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>However, as LexiRumah is not a primary but a secondary source, the originals of unpublished manuscripts and fieldwork data must be publically accessible, either online (e.g. in electronic archives) or in printed form (e.g. grammars, dictionaries). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>A large number of primary sources are already available online, but linking them to the database is an ongoing effort. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>LexiRumah consists of not only borrow-resistant, stable core vocabulary (e.g. ‘sky’, ‘house’, ‘child’), but also culture specific words (‘bride price’, ‘betel nut’) as well as highly borrowable, lexically unstable concepts (see Section 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Since the 1960’s, Indonesian has increasingly been used in education and the public domain of the region, and in most areas (a local variety of) Indonesian has become the lingua franca between speakers of different local languages. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>In this section, we describe the general procedure of going from primary sources (fieldwork, in particular fieldwork with the specific goal of expanding this database, or publications by researchers inside or outside the project) to a validated entry in the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>We highlight challenges encountered in the process and give suggestions for best practices for future database collections of a similar nature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>Entries in LexiRumah may be either based on published or as of yet unpublished linguistic sources, or on survey work in the field, executed by the authors’ project members or close collaborators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Both types of data require different work flows to be included in our database and present different hurdles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Those steps are described below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec016"><title><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>5.1 Compiling word lists through fieldwork </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>The word lists in LexiRumah have been collected through fieldwork in two different ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>One data collection method involved a longer fieldwork visit, studying one language in particular, and using frequent consultations with different native speakers to obtain an in-depth knowledge of the language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>This method was used by researchers who spent several months in the field studying one language in detail. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>As one task of many, they also collected word lists in a few of the dialects of the language they were studying. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>The other collection method was through survey work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>In survey work, a fieldworker, possibly with their assistant(s), visits individual language communities for a relatively short stay, typically one week, maybe two, to collect “shallow” linguistic data which does not require in-depth knowledge of the language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>The aim of survey work is to sample data from various points in a region to study the linguistic diversity of that region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>It also provides initial data about unstudied lects that are possibly relevant for further study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>We use the term “shallow” here in contrast with the method of deeper investigation mentioned above, which would allow the researcher to also draw conclusions about the morphology and syntax of the target language, which is hardly possible from word list data collected through survey work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Survey work to elicit word lists is fraught with problems, especially in its main use case when there is limited survey time available per language, and the researcher collecting the data does not speak the target language, so that another language must be used as an intermediate language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>The risk of collecting bad or noisy data further increases when only one speaker is consulted, and it can become very high when this speaker has lived away from the place where the variety is originally spoken and has not used it for extensive periods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec017"><title><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>(a) Best practices for linguistic survey work eliciting word lists </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we apply the following best practices, where possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Eliciting word lists through survey work should (i) take place in the location where the variety is spoken; (ii) involve a small group (e.g. 3–6) of native speakers who feel confident about their language and speak the same lect with each other on a daily basis; (iii) involve native speakers who have sufficient time for compiling a word list which they consider to be representative of the consensus forms used in their local lect; (iv) involve a linguist who has in-depth knowledge of at least two languages that are spoken in the region covered by the survey, but which are genealogically and/or geographically remote from each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, (v) the elicitation word list should not provide only a single word in a gloss language, but give a clear definition of the meaning to be elicited, and (vi) specify criteria which word(s) to include if multiple words can be used to express that meaning, either because they are synonyms, or because each of them is more specific than the meaning requested. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title><text><SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>(b) Materials and protocol for lexical survey work </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>For lexical survey work, we use the following materials and protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Apart from the use of Indonesian as gloss language, this procedure is not specific to the Lesser Sunda Islands and should serve to obtain high quality transcribed word lists where lexical survey work using a lingua franca is possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Elicitation is in Indonesian, the national language of education, media and government, and spoken by virtually everyone as a second language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>An original word list compiled in English is translated into Indonesian by a native speaker of Indonesian. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>A “notes” column on that list provides extra information for the linguist about Indonesian prompts that often raise questions and/or need some extra clarification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>Before the first compilation stage, the linguist goes through the word list and the notes to familiarize him/herself with what is going to be asked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Then several speakers of the local variety are invited who are willing and able to translate the Indonesian words in their own language, and have sufficient time for the task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>The linguist and the speakers work through the list. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>When the speakers have reached a consensus about which word is the best translational equivalent of the Indonesian prompt, the linguist repeats this word until his/her pronunciation of it is accepted by the speakers, and writes it down in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>In the Lesser Sunda region, where we did dozens of lexical surveys in remote field sites, we worked with fluent native speakers who live in a stable social context with few distractions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>In such situations the elicitation of a list of 600 words (using Indonesian prompts) takes at least half a day, but can also last one or two days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The speed of collection might differ depending on the region where a survey takes place, the fluency of the speakers, and/or their cultural context. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>After the first compilation stage is finished, the linguist fills in a new (blank) list with the local words, now using Indonesian orthography (not IPA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>This is done so that a local speaker will be able to read the word that has been written down. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>A second appointment is made to audio/video record the word list. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>On this second appointment, the copy of the word list with the words in Indonesian script is given to one native speaker who is willing to be recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>An informed consent form is filled in. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>The linguist/assistant keeps the list with the IPA transcriptions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>On the recording, the linguist / assistant reads out the Indonesian word once, and the speaker repeats this word twice in his local language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>The speaker has the written word list in front of him/her as a reminder, but if s/he feels uncomfortable about reading the words of his language, the linguist/assistant sits next to him/her to assist when necessary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The linguist/assistant checks if the response uttered on the recording is the same as the word that was written on the list. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>If there is a difference, the speaker is invited to comment on the difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Usually the difference is due to a transcription error by the linguist, or an erratic choice of words by the recorded speaker (e.g. because of the pressure felt by being recorded). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Speakers who are comfortable reading their language will often note small errors in the way the linguist captured the words in written form (e.g. an [n] should be [ŋ], a final glottal stop should be an unreleased [k], etc.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>These transcription errors are corrected during the recording. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>In this way, the recording session provides a recording of the word list as well as a transcribed word list that has been double-checked by a speaker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>In our region, none of the lects under consideration have a standardized written variety, so it is unlikely that speakers correct natural to more literary forms, a problem that might occur for languages with established prescriptive traditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the recording is finished, backup copies are made and put in different places. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>At a later stage, the recording is transcribed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>For the final transcription, the linguist listens back to the recording and transcribes what is heard, whilst consulting the list that was already written in IPA in the compilation stage and had been corrected during the recording. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>This third check is to ensure that the words that are transcribed to be entered into the database indeed reflect what has been discussed and recorded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title><text><SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>(c) Issues encountered in lexical survey work </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>The following are some issues that arise in lexical survey work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Being aware of these issues means they can be addressed in the elicitation process or at least annotated in the database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>If these issues are not addressed, the data will make it harder to find cognate forms necessary for historical reconstruction, such that the lects under consideration appear less related than they actually are. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>First, speakers may translate the Indonesian word differently in their own language, because the Indonesian word is already polysemous. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>For example, Indonesian susu refers to ‘milk’ or ‘breast’; and the word sempit ‘narrow’ in Indonesian can mean ‘narrow’ (road), ‘crowded’ (house), or ‘tight’ (clothes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>In elicitation it must thus be specified what the target is. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>There may also be words in Indonesian with a meaning that is too generic to be translatable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>For example, the Indonesian general preposition di ‘at, in’ often does not have an equally general counterpart in the target language, so speakers will provide a semantically more specific adposition; or, in case the language does not have adpositions, give an expression that contains a locational verb (‘be at’). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>Third, the target language may have more than one translational equivalent for the Indonesian prompt, e.g. pukul ‘to hit’ may render different lexemes for e.g. ‘hit (a drum)’ and ‘hit (a dog)’. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>Finally, not all Indonesian words have a translational equivalent in the target language. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>For example, causal conjunctions such as Indonesian karena ‘because’ are not directly translatable into Alor-Pantar languages because causal relations between clauses are not expressed with conjunctions in these languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="424" pm="."><plain>Or languages lack a word for a particular concept, e.g. murah ‘cheap’ may be translated with various expressions such as ‘low price’, ‘short price’, ‘light price’ or ‘price go down’. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>Issues of translational non-equivalence and polysemy will always cause word lists to have unclear or incomparable data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>We tried to minimize the amount of such “noise” by applying best practices and a uniform protocol described above. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>While the lects under investigation may have a higher morphological complexity than the Indonesian used for elicitation, this does not constitute a problem of lexical survey work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>Just like English verbs might include the particle to in their citation form, eg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>Abui inalienable nouns in our word lists are cited with possessor prefixes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>The choice of citation form for various word classes appears consistent within each word list and such morphemes are marked where known. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>Transcription of the recordings of the word lists are all in broad International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). ‘Broad’ IPA transcription uses all basic IPA vowel and consonant symbols, and indicates (primary) stress, nasality and segment length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>It does not mark aspiration, centralization, dentality, roundedness, and breathiness with diacritics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>Transcriptions are phonemic for the languages for which we know the phoneme inventory; otherwise they are in broad IPA but phonetic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>The optimal situation is such that the linguist who transcribed the recording was also present at the compilation and recording of the word list, and has made written notes of the earlier sessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>In a few cases, for reasons of time constraints, survey work and/or transcriptions were done by relatively less experienced students. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>Their transcriptions have been checked against the original recordings and, where necessary, corrected by a linguist with significant experience in fieldwork and the phonological typology of the region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>Of 59 fieldwork sources, 5 were checked or transcribed by a different person than the collector and marked as such in their metadata. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>In contrast to survey work, where word forms are extracted orally and then written down, manuscripts and published sources require a first step to extract word forms from an already written source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="441" pm="."><plain>Some publications, such as [44] and the word lists in the Comparative Austronesian Dictionary [53] are not available in digital form, so the word lists need to be manually converted into a computer-readable format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="442" pm="."><plain>Other publications, such as the Austronesian Comparative Dictionary [46], are digital in principle, but are not presented in a format that makes extracting word lists (or even navigating the data) a simple, automatizable process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="443" pm="."><plain>Collecting word lists from such sources is also a diligent, potentially error-prone procedure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="444" pm="."><plain>Judging from our experience with these tasks, we suggest that the extraction of word lists from existing sources works best when the person doing the work is known to be very meticulous, and also has some background knowledge of the languages spoken in the area. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="445" pm="."><plain>Where a source cites multiple variants, synonyms, or ambiguous translations (e.g. a separate word for ‘small frog’ vs. ‘large frog’), each word form is in a separate row of the Form table. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>The comment column may give additional information about the relationship between the forms. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title><text><SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>5.4 IPA cleanup </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>Both transcriptions from published sources as well as survey data collected by fieldworkers may not always closely follow IPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="449" pm="."><plain>An often occurring point of deviation, in particular among European, American and Indonesian fieldworkers, is the use of &lt;j&gt; for the voiced palato-alveolar affricate [d͡ʒ] or palatal voiced stop [ɟ], and the use of &lt;y&gt; for the palatal glide [j]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="450" pm="."><plain>When this is done consistently (which can be seen from the absence of &lt;ɟ&gt;, &lt;d͡ʒ&gt; and variants thereof in the transcriptions, and from the use of &lt;y&gt; exactly where a consonant [j] would be expected), a simple two-step string replacement can resolve the issue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="451" pm="."><plain>If audio recordings of the collection sessions are available, they can also shed light on the issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="452" pm="."><plain>There are therefore separate columns in the CLDF wordlist for forms as given in the source, and for segmented data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="453" pm="."><plain>The sound segments are given in CLPA normalization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/clpn/clpa">https://github.com/clpn/clpa</ext-link>)–CLPA describes a normalization of IPA strings, which can be understood by other programs also subscribing to that standard. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="455" pm="."><plain>The NorthEuraLex database [54], which is of similar size, but aggregates data based on published dictionaries, includes a step having many entries routine-checked by a native speaker, and additional checks for forms flagged as surprising by non-native speakers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>A step like this is not feasible for our database in general, especially when it concerns data that was compiled from published sources or was done by fieldworkers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>In order to make editing CLDF datasets easier, the CLDF developers have also published a set of command line tools packed with the pycldf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/glottobank/pycldf">https://github.com/glottobank/pycldf</ext-link>) Python library. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="513" pm="."><plain>Alorese (AL) has some 25,000 speakers living in pockets along the coasts of the islands of Pantar and Alor as well as on the islets in their vicinity [62–64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="514" pm="."><plain>It is currently in contact with the TAP languages surrounding it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="515" pm="."><plain>AL is a variety of the Lamaholot (LH) language/dialect chain, which is spoken by some 180,000 people [64] living on the eastern tip of Flores and neighbouring islands (Fig 1), including Solor, Lembata and Adonara. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="516" pm="."><plain>Within the LH clade, AL is generally grouped together with the lects of Western LH, cf. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/alor1247">http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/alor1247</ext-link> in Glottolog [39]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="519" pm="."><plain>Investigating the lexicon of AL for historical traces is interesting because it is spoken in areas non-contiguous with its closest relatives, and it is the only Lamaholotic language currently in contact with Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) languages. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="534" pm="."><plain>In Fig 7, concepts with similarity classes that are shared with TAP lects, but not with Austronesian lects are green, classes that are unique for AL are purple. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="535" pm="."><plain>The remaining classes are coloured according to whether their distribution looks like they have a hierarchical history of inheritance: orange is used for classes that do, because they are (a) present in LH and AL, but in no other lects; or (b) present in at least some wider FL lects and in at least some LH lects and in AL, but nowhere else; or (c) present in other Austronesian lects, as well as in FL languages, LH and AL–independent of whether they are found in TAP lects or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="536" pm="."><plain>An example of (c) is the “hierarchically inherited” similarity class (orange) of ‘lizard’: all our attested forms for ‘lizard’ in AL (AL-Pandai [taˈkːe], AL-Munaseli [təˈkːɛʔ] and AL-Alor-Besar [taˈkːe]) are similar, and similar forms are also attested in, for example, LH-Lerek [təˈkɛk], Sika [təkeː], and proto-MP *təktək, as well as in most TAP languages (eg. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>Abui-Fuimelang [tekok]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>Presumably, the proto-MP form got borrowed into proto-TAP and was inherited by daughter languages in each family. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>Note that the orange class is only an approximation of “hierarchically inherited”: a recently introduced concept like ‘church’ also shows the distribution of an inherited word, because forms like AL-Alor-Besar [gaˈrɛd͡ʒa], borrowed from Indonesian gereja, are widespread across all groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>Yellow is used for all other similarity classes, indicating a complex history of inheritance and/or borrowing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>This includes all forms that “skipped” a clade in the inhertance hierarchy (and thus do not have the “hierarchical inheritance” pattern shown by the colour orange). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>For example, this includes classes found in AL and other Austronesian lects which are not attested in any of the LH lects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>(This would not be immediately expected under the hypothesis that AL is a daughter, not a sister, of LH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="544" pm="."><plain>It also applies to forms found in TAP, but which among our Austronesian languages are attested only in the wider FL languages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="545" pm="."><plain>The latter, cross-family, distribution cannot be explained by the two contact situations known to us, where AL borrows from TAP languages and proto-TAP borrowed forms from proto-MP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="546" pm="."><plain>A more in-depth analysis of these forms is necessary to distinguish between (i) TAP forms borrowed into FL languages, (ii) forms that originated in FL languages but have been borrowed into TAP lects possibly through the mediation of AL, and (iii) recent loans that spread through the Flores-Lembata-Alor region, but not attested in our other Austronesian languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="547" pm="."><plain>We present an example containing such an analysis after discussion of Fig 7. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="548" pm="."><plain>The height of the bars in Fig 7 indicates the number of similarity classes in AL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="549" pm="."><plain>For example, in Fig 7B, for the concepts ‘footprint’ and ‘to return’, we lack data in AL, so no bars are shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="550" pm="."><plain>All other concepts in that subfigure, which have a bar height of 1 or more, are attested in AL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="551" pm="."><plain>An example of a bar height of 1 is the concept ‘lizard’ mentioned above, where all our attested forms in AL (AL-Pandai [taˈkːe], AL-Munaseli [təˈkːɛʔ] and AL-Alor-Besar [taˈkːe]) are similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="552" pm="."><plain>An example of a bar height of 3 is the concept ‘claw’ in Fig 7C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="553" pm="."><plain>The similarity of AL-Pandai [kˈrako] and even more AL-Alor-Besar [gaˈraku] with Bunak-Bobonaro [galakha] places this similarity class in the green category of forms possibly borrowed from TAP languages, while the other two classes (AL-Munaseli [kɛla ˈleiŋ] and AL-Baranusa [limɑŋ taˈnuŋgul]) are not similar to any other forms in the database and therefore unique to AL, and purple. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="554" pm="."><plain>Overall, Fig 7A shows that all four of these categories (purple, green, orange, yellow) are present throughout the entire lexicon, and that innovations unique to AL (purple) make up a far larger part of the lexicon than apparent borrowings (green), although examples like ‘church’ mentioned above show that this overall picture reflects general trends, but is misleading in the details. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>The IPython notebook also shows how to systematically compare lexicons on a more detailed level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>This is relevant, because the plots do not give us detailed insight into inheritance patterns, as when they collapse hierarchically inherited forms with wide-spread borrowings (orange, cf. ‘church’) or when they collapse different reasons for “skipping” a clade in the inhertance hierarchy (yellow); ‘blood’ discussed below is an example of the latter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>We systematically compare the lexicon of AL and LH, focussing on the most stable vocabulary where differences are most relevant to the history of AL. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>The first most stable 25 concepts (cf. Fig 7A) where AL differs from LH are ‘roof rafter’, ‘some’, ‘dew’, ‘fist’, dibble stick’, ‘betel vine’, ‘stem’, ‘corn/maize’, ‘hand’, ‘ten’, ‘betel nut/areca’, ‘other’, ‘money’, ‘to scratch’, ‘thirteen’, ‘to return’, ‘jackfruit’, ‘mosque’, ‘footprint’, ‘chair’, ‘seventeen’, ‘two’, ‘sea’, ‘fifteen’, ‘blood’. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>For some of these very stable concepts (e.g. ‘roof rafter’, ‘some’, ‘dew’), we have word forms only in LH but not in AL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>This does not allow us to say anything on the history of these forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>For the other concepts, which have different word forms in AL and LH, we find various explanations for why they are different. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>For ‘hand’, most LH lects, including AL, have forms similar to [ˈlimaŋ], a form which is widely shared also outside the group and goes back to proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qalima. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>However, LH-Adonara has a form [ˈnaiʔjũ] that is not similar to any other counterpart for ‘hand’ in LexiRumah, suggestive of a lexical innovation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>A similar situation occurs for ‘betel vine’ and ‘sea’. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="565" pm="."><plain>For the concepts ‘ten’, ‘thirteen’, ‘seventeen’ and ‘fifteen’, the AL and LH forms are dissimilar, but the AL forms show similarity with the forms of the neighbouring Timor-Alor-Pantar languages, having apparently borrowed a reflex of Proto-TAP ‘ten’ *qar-. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="566" pm="."><plain>The forms for ‘jackfruit’ also show a split where the AL lects adopted a loan from TAP languages. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="567" pm="."><plain>In the forms for ‘betel nut’, an accidental split in classes has happened due to apparent metathesis: in some LH lects (LH-Lewoingu, LH-Adonara), words for ‘betel nut’ are [wua], reflecting ancestral proto-Malayo-Polynesian *buaq ‘fruit’ (in reconstructed proto-MP forms, &lt;q&gt; stands for a glottal stop /ʔ/). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="568" pm="."><plain>AL-Baranusa [ʔufa] and Kedang [uwe] on the other hand, are apparently metathesized and put in a different class from the unmetathesized forms in LH. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="569" pm="."><plain>The words for ‘money’, a relatively recent concept, show a range of different forms of apparently different origins: in LH the form [doi(t/r)] is used, from 17th Century Dutch duit ‘coin worth 1/8 of a stuiver (penny)’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="570" pm="."><plain>In AL-Alor Besar and AL-Pandai the word for money it [sɛŋ], from Dutch cent ‘coin worth 1/100 of a guilder’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>AL-Munaseli has two forms for ‘money’, both of them apparently innovated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the forms for ‘chair’ have different donor languages: kursi from Indonesian, cadeira from Portuguese. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="573" pm="."><plain>For ‘to scratch’, the similarity classes suggest that AL and a few LH lects (LH-Pukaunu, LH-Waiwadan, LH-Ile Ape, LH-Watan–which is not a recognizable geographic or phylogenetic cluster) reflect ancestral proto-MP *kaRaw (e.g. [garu] in LH-Watan), while all other LH lects are in a group of [ragu] forms, suggesting metathesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="574" pm="."><plain>The words for ‘mosque’ are two arbitrary split classes, both similar to [mɛs'ɟid]; and the fact that they are split into two classes is an artefact of the clustering algorithm we used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="575" pm="."><plain>The same happened for the concept ‘two’, with forms [ʤua] and [rua] in different classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="576" pm="."><plain>Lastly, for the concept ‘blood’, all LH lects and the neighboring Austronesian languages of Sika and Kedang have forms like [mei] (which the algorithm grouped with [wei] forms in TAP languages, possibly for their only superficial similarity), whereas AL [ra] appears to reflect proto-MP *daRaq, shared with other Austronesian languages of the region, but not with any TAP languages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="577" pm="."><plain>This is a lexical retention in AL which needs to be explained in the context of the AL emigration from LH-speaking areas in the 14th Century. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="578" pm="."><plain>It suggests that the ancestor language of both AL and LH contained a reflex of proto-MP *daRaq which was retained in AL but replaced with [mei] forms in all LH lects. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="579" pm="."><plain>In sum, using even a very basic quantitative analysis of some data available in LexiRumah with its noisy automatic similarity codings has nonetheless enabled us to uncover several instances of lexical innovation, possible loans, metathesis, and a surprising case of lexical retention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="580" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the history of LH has some complexities that are not trivially congruent with the grouping of AL originating as a Western LH dialect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="581" pm="."><plain>AL has undergone unique changes after the split, but has also retained ancestral material that is apparently not retained in any other LH dialects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="582" pm="."><plain>We therefore expect that a more sophisticated study using LexiRumah would help to uncover relevant facts relating to the history of the region. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="584" pm="."><plain>Creating a database such as LexiRumah has become significantly easier in the last decade, and hardly comparable to the first computer-readable lexical databases such as the Indo-European database on punched cards generated by Dyen in the 1960s. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="585" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, creating a lexical database that is easy to re-use, inspect, and browse, for the lexicon of language diversity in under-studied areas of the world, currently still requires linguistic as well as computational expertise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="586" pm="."><plain>In the coming years, we expect the threshold of necessary programming skills to go down, and the computing literacy in the linguistic community to go up, such that it will become ever easier to construct and combine lexical databases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="587" pm="."><plain>Given this development, it is useful to consider the state of the art and look at the lessons learned from building, maintaining, and using existing databases, such as LexiRumah. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="590" pm="."><plain>Our most important takeaway messages are listed below. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="592" pm="."><plain>Data and metadata may be hidden if it appears no longer useful, but should never be completely unavailable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="593" pm="."><plain>This includes an obligation to archive recordings from fieldwork, intermediate worksheets, and to keep a history of changes that lead to the version of data that is ultimately published. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="594" pm="."><plain>This allows anyone using the data to re-visit earlier decisions transparently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="595" pm="."><plain>If data is of severely questionable quality and would have been removed in times when computer memory space was more scarce, we suggest to not remove it but instead marking it as ‘unreliable’. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="597" pm="."><plain>Once data is in a computer-readable format, it may be tempting to some to hand the data to more computationally-minded collaborators and have them apply their methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="598" pm="."><plain>It is to be expected, however, that the raw data collected will contain several issues that will still need linguistic consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="599" pm="."><plain>This can relate to matters of orthography, informant sociolinguistics, decisions on synonyms in glosses and target languages, how to deal with recurring morphemes (e.g. the systematic prefix ta- to mark possessors of inalienable nouns in one of the languages, Abui), or a multitude of other matters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="600" pm="."><plain>Some of these issues may only show up while trying to analyse the data. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="603" pm="."><plain>Because the field of linguistic databases is still very young and the methods used for linguistic data collection are not always explicit, it is often unclear how to evaluate the quality of the data found in these databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="604" pm="."><plain>Explicit descriptions of methods and protocols, as well as a sufficient amount of metadata will increase the usefulness of such databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="605" pm="."><plain>New tools have been created (and sometimes discarded) quite frequently in the last years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="606" pm="."><plain>Recently, new databases and tools are more and more converging towards a consistent structure of delimiter-structured tabular text data, which can be easily manipulated using both generic data manipulation software (including many spreadsheet applications) as well as specific tools for working with linguistic data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="607" pm="."><plain>The CLDF standard is used for a wide range of other important databases ranging from lexical (e.g. NorthEuraLex [54], WOLD [37], and ASJP [21]) to structural (e.g. WALS [66]) and further afield (e.g. PHOIBLE [67]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="608" pm="."><plain>Some of these databases were originally using other data formats, which shows that this standard is not crystallizing for lack of alternatives, but because it has proven useful for a variety of editing and analysis needs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="619" pm="."><plain>While all metadata is currently kept together with the data, making it available for further analyses will require better structuring of the data, e.g. for connecting speakers’ sociolinguistic profiles to the sources they appear in. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="620" pm="."><plain>To capture the fact that not all words in the lists are equally reliable, we will provide reliability scores for each of the lexical items. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="621" pm="."><plain>For example, words for concepts like ‘breast’ or ‘narrow’ which are polysemous in Indonesian (susu ‘milk, breast’; sempit ‘narrowcrowded tight’) would get a lower reliability scale than translations of words that are not polysemous in Indonesian, e.g. laut ‘sea’ or langit ‘sky’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="622" pm="."><plain>Further factors influencing the reliability of lexical items are language external. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="623" pm="."><plain>For instance, because of time and funding constraints some of the survey work was done by less-experienced students, and in some cases, the only native speakers we could consult had been living away from their original home town for a certain period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="624" pm="."><plain>Such factors also lower the reliability score of the word form collected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="625" pm="."><plain>However, for the purpose of unravelling the history of the Lesser Sunda region, the goal of our project, our dataset needs to also grow in breadth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="626" pm="."><plain>Our data content concerning the island of Timor and its surrounding islands is still incomplete, and data from lects of neighbouring islands East of Timor and West of Central Flores are yet missing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="627" pm="."><plain>We welcome additional data sets on the languages of the region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="628" pm="."><plain>In order to assemble a cleaner picture of the history of the region, we have also begun assembling structured data of the same languages that is not lexical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="629" pm="."><plain>Typological features collected from grammars published about the languages of the region will form the content of the GramRumah database, while cultural features, collected from local informants in a structured questionnaire, are used for CultureRumah. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="630" pm="."><plain>In the construction of these two databases, we will in turn learn from the challenges of other typological databases currently in construction (e.g. GramBank [70], D-PLACE [71]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="631" pm="."><plain>Together with an expanded LexiRumah, and knowledge gained from the analysis of other linguistic databases describing other regions of the world, we are confident that qualitative and quantitative analyses of this data will provide us with a clearer picture of the contact-rich history of Papuan and Austronesian peoples settling the Lesser Sunda region. </plain></SENT>
