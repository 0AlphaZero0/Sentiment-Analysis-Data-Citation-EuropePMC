</text></title><p id="p0005"><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fructosyltransferases (FTase) are enzymes involved in the transfer to a molecule of sucrose a fructosyl group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may also transfer the fructosyl group to a fructooligosaccharide elongating the chain by a unit of fructose [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FTase is known to be involved in several reactions such as polymerization reactions, in which the transfer of fructosyl units decreases the degree of polymerization maximally from fructans having a high molecular mass [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which FTase elucidate their action has been established to vary depending on the enzyme source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Mostly in some plants, the action of FTase occurs via the synergistic actions of several enzymes meanwhile in microorganisms, just a single enzyme elucidates this action. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Also, it is noteworthy that the properties of FTase vary also in microorganisms depending on media parameters mostly the carbon source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that quite a number of microorganisms produce FTase, just a few have the potential for biotechnological or industrial production such as in the synthesis of fructooligosaccharides [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0010"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are oligosaccharides derived from the addition of a fructose moiety to a sucrose molecule which can be carried out by the actions fructosyltransferase and/or β-fructofuranosidase [24], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Both enzymes are classified as FOS-producing enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These FOS are obtained from several sources that include microorganisms and plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>FOS are known to play several important roles beneficial to human health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The production of these FOS is generally too low in plants and hence their significant health benefit is not so significant. Aureobasidium spp., and some other fungi belonging to the Aspergillus, Penicillum and Fusarium genus have been reported to be producers of these fructooligosaccharides producing enzymes [7], [23], [25], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>FOS are non-conventional sugars and they include kestoses (GF2), nystoses (GF3) and fructofuranosylnystoses (GF4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>They are composed of ß (2 → 1)-linked fructose (F) units attached to a terminal glucose (G) moiety by a (2 → 1) linkage [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These oligosaccharides have numerous health capabilities chief among which is their use as prebiotics because their intake aids the growth of bacterium beneficial to human health, decreases the level of cholesterol, prevents or reduces intestinal infections, allows for improved mineral absorption and also prevents incidences of colon cancer [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0015"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Due to FOS high demand, searching for new microbial strains with potential for FTase production thus increasing the rate of the enzymatic synthesis of FOS is of enormous importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The most important factor that limits the industrial usage is the operational cost of enzyme production and its concomitant purification which can be reduced using a combinatorial approach that includes obtaining novel strains from established producers, optimizing the fermentation strategies, growth conditions and composition of the medium and using statistical approach to media screening and optimization [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0020"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Strain improvement is defined as the science and technology of genetically modifying microbial strains to improve their potentials for numerous biotechnological applications and it majorly involves in iteration the genetic alterations, fermentation techniques and assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Mutagenesis involves the use of a physical method (UV radiation) or chemical methods (mutagens) or both to obtain a unique strain with the desired improved biotechnological characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>From an economic point of view most industrial fermentation process evolve around lower fermentation process, manufacturing and capital cost. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Strain improvement offers an advantage of decreased cost of production simultaneously with no increased capital outlay [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique described by Williams et al. [30] offers a quick method to distinguish between closely related species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>RAPD provides an approach to analyze polymorphisms between a newly obtained improved strain of the same specie [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0025"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The use of a statistical approach to optimization (response surface methodology) and screening of important media parameters (Plackett-Burman Design) provides a more reliable and strong technique to investigating numerous process variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>This is because there are comparatively fewer experimental trials compared to the conventional varying a factor at a time technique which does not provide the information needed when the effect of the interactions among the variables is to be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Also, one factor at a time approach is time consuming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>According to Nascimento et al. [17], the conventional studying of one factor at a time is very time consuming and very tasking while also not providing the desired true optimum facilitated by the interactions among the variables. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0030"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this work obtained a novel and relatively high fructosyltransferase secreting mutant strain from the wild-type of Aureobasidium pullulans NAC8 [2] using random sequential chemical mutagenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The wild-type was relatively a low FTase secreting strain isolated from soil containing decayed plant litters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>After chemical mutagenesis, the wild-type was distinguished from the improved mutant strain using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR and subsequent DNA fingerprinting analysis using GelQuest Sequentix, Germany version 3.2.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Further enhancement of the production of fructosyltransferase (submerged fermentation) by the improved mutant strain was investigated using a statistical approach that involved the screening of media parameters using Plackett-Burman design and optimization using Box-Behnken based response surface methodology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This would be the first report on the use of this combinatorial approach to source for high secreting fructosyltransferase strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>This study provides information on obtaining an improved mutant strain with potentials for increased production/synthesis of fructooligosaccharides while simultaneously decreasing the cost of production downstream. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="p0115"><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>There was a relatively rapid growth in the mutant compared to the wild-type; this might be attributed to the mutation of some genes necessary for control of cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>The absence of some bands in the electropherogram in the mutant strains is indicative of a successful mutagenic procedure where the genetic manipulation process resulted in the deletion of some genes and or mutations of these gene fragment. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The variation in the concentration of sucrose as a requirement for FTase production might be largely dependent on the source of microorganism and storage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>It is largely acknowledged that sucrose concentration higher than 20% (w/v) causes glucose-induced repression of fructosyltransferase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This results in decreased FTase activity and perhaps growth rate of the fungi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Thus, most reports find 10% (w/v) a safe choice for transfructosylating activity as well as synthesis of fructooligosaccharides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The results obtained in our study indicated that the optimum production of FTase occurred at 100 g/L i.e. 10% (w/v) as the sucrose concentration was varied at a low and high level of 100 g/L and 400 g/L respectively (using Plackett-Burman design). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="p0140"><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>The apparent decrease in fructosyltransferase activity at a high concentration of sucrose is thus explained by the glucose-induced repression of the enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, sucrose isn’t the only reported inducer for FTase production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In our study, we never utilized any other carbon source as most literature agree that sucrose is the best carbon source for FTase production. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the requirements for production of FTase differ as the intracellular enzyme required some inorganic salts for higher activity while the extracellular form of FTase required a mixture of both organic and inorganic salts for optimal activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest is the effect of yeast extract concentration on intracellular FTase production by the improved mutant strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Numerous report exists that indicated that increasing yeast concentration inhibits FOS production by Aureobasidium pullulans [18] but this seems not to apply to the improved mutant strain’s potential in the production of intracellular FTase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Yeast extract serves as a source of vitamin and growth factors for cell growth and production of fructosyltransferase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The non-requirement of yeast extract for intracellular production of fructosyltransferase might be explained in terms of the genetic alterations might have tinkered with its use of nitrogen source although both required sucrose as carbon source. </plain></SENT>
