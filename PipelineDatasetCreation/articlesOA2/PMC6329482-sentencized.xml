</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Based on this investigation, it is believed that the virus was introduced to surfaces in the exam room by a symptomatic patient, and that subsequent lapses in infection prevention practices led to transmission to other patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that adenoviruses can persist on environmental surfaces for several weeks (9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Enhanced infection prevention practices, including staff member education on eye drop administration and longer slit lamp and tonometer disinfection times were implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>No further cases were reported after July 3, 2017. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Previous similar EKC outbreaks have been linked to eye care clinics employing improper disinfection practices and lapses in hygienic protocols (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To prevent EKC transmission in eye care settings, recommended practices include the use of disposable tonometer tips, disinfectants efficacious against adenoviruses for tonometers and slit lamps, and single-use eye drops when available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Use of recommended infection prevention practices is necessary to avoid EKC and other health care–associated infections. </plain></SENT>
