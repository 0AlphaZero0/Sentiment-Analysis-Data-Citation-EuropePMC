</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intraflagellar transport (IFT)* (Kozminski et al., 1993) is essential for the assembly and maintenance of sensory cilia in Caenorhabditis, motile cilia in sea urchins and Chlamydomonas, and primary cilia in mice, and is likely to be important in all cilia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>During IFT, kinesin-II transports a large protein complex from the cell body to the tip of the flagellum (Morris and Scholey, 1997; Piperno and Mead, 1997; Cole et al., 1998; Orozco et al., 1999; Signor et al., 1999b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These particles are then returned to the cell body by the DHC1b/DHC2 isoform of cytoplasmic dynein (Pazour et al., 1998, 1999; Porter et al., 1999; Signor et al., 1999a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>IFT particles in Chlamydomonas are composed of at least 17 proteins and are thought to carry components needed to build and maintain the ciliary axoneme and membrane (Piperno and Mead, 1997; Cole et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The functions of individual IFT particle proteins are not known, but their sequences are conserved among green algae, nematodes, and vertebrates (Cole et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes encoding IFT particle proteins prevent ciliary assembly in Chlamydomonas, Caenorhabditis, and mice (Cole et al., 1998; Murcia et al., 2000; Pazour et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Vertebrate photoreceptors are polarized sensory neurons consisting of a photosensitive outer segment (OS) that develops from a nonmotile primary cilium by movement of membrane and phototransduction proteins, such as opsin, into the cilium (Besharse and Horst, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The cilium remains in mature photoreceptors as the sole connecting link between the inner segment (IS) and OS and is presumably the major transport corridor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mature photoreceptors continue to require transport from the IS to the OS to replace components of the OS that are turned over each day (Young, 1967). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that normal turnover in each mammalian OS requires delivery of as many as 2,000 photopigment molecules per minute throughout the life of the cell (Besharse and Horst, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the larger photoreceptors of amphibians, this rate must be increased by more than an order of magnitude (Besharse and Horst, 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In addition to photopigment molecules, phototransduction proteins (Philp et al., 1987; Whelan and McGinnis, 1988) and phospholipid components of the discs (Anderson et al., 1980) also turn over rapidly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although disruption of intersegmental transport results in photoreceptor degeneration and blindness (Li et al., 1996; Hagstrom et al., 1999; Clarke et al., 2000), the transport mechanisms have not been identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>IFT has been proposed as a connecting cilium transport mechanism (Rosenbaum et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In support of this idea, Marszalek et al. (2000) showed that a conditional knockout of KIF3A, which is a subunit of the anterograde IFT motor, leads to retinal degeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, KIF3A-containing motors are believed to be involved in other cellular processes, including neuronal transport, melanosome movement, and secretory pathway transport (Marszalek and Goldstein, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To more directly test the role of IFT in connecting cilium transport, we here investigate the distribution of IFT particle proteins in vertebrate retinas, and examine the effect of a mutation in an IFT particle subunit gene on the mouse retina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We show that mouse homologues of four Chlamydomonas IFT particle proteins are localized to the connecting cilium, and mice with a mutation in the Tg737/IFT88 subunit of the IFT particle form abnormal OSs followed by progressive photoreceptor degeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>These data strongly suggest that IFT is an important transport mechanism in vertebrate photoreceptors and raise the possibility that defects in IFT may cause some forms of human blindness. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Mammalian homologues of IFT88, IFT57, IFT52, and IFT20 were chosen for further study in this work. Chlamydomonas IFT88 is 42% identical (BLAST E = 1e − 142) to a mouse protein, called Tg737, that is required for assembly of primary cilia in the mouse kidney (Pazour et al., 2000) and node (Murcia et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>

Chlamydomonas IFT52 is 49% identical (BLAST E = 1e − 87) to a rodent protein called NGD5 and a C. elegans protein called OSM-6 (Cole et al., 1998; Deane et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The function of NGD5 is unknown, but its expression is down-regulated by exposing cultured cells to opioids (Wick et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Bovine retina is often used as a biochemical system for photoreceptor research, and techniques are available for making a detergent-extracted photoreceptor cytoskeleton (DEPC) fraction that is enriched in connecting cilia (Horst et al., 1987). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The retina is composed of multiple cell types, and it is likely that the failure to detect IFT proteins in whole retina is because these proteins are not abundant in the nonphotoreceptor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>If the IFT proteins are concentrated at the connecting cilia, as the mouse result suggested, the DEPC would be greatly enriched for these proteins, as the purification of the DEPC would remove the nonphotoreceptor cells as well as most of the proteins of the photoreceptor cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Both mutations cause accumulation of opsin in the IS and result in substantial age-related loss of photoreceptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>The principal difference in the two phenotypes is that kinesin-II mutant mice accumulate intracellular vesicles in the IS before degeneration of affected cells, whereas Tg737 mutant mice accumulate extracellular vesicles and show anomalous OS development before degeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Although the initial IS defect in the KIF3A mutant mice may reflect a nonciliary role for kinesin-II in photoreceptors, it seems likely that the principal differences between the two relates to the fact that the kinesin-II defect appears suddenly in individual cells after the OSs have developed (Marszalek et al., 2000), whereas the hypomorphic Tg737 mice have an insufficient quantity of IFT88 during development and do not form proper OSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>In both the Tg737 and the kinesin-II mutant mice, opsin accumulates within the IS, and it has been suggested that kinesin-II specifically transports opsin (Marszalek et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Although opsin is a potential cargo for IFT, its accumulation in IS membranes is a general feature of diverse photoreceptor degenerations (Nir and Papermaster, 1986; Nir et al., 1987; Hagstrom et al., 1999) and could result indirectly from multiple defects that alter the transport/assembly of discs in the OS. </plain></SENT>
