</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most common hereditary optic atrophy with an incidence rate as high as 1:10,000â1:50,000 [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by central vision loss, color vision abnormalities [1,3â5], and degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The onset of DOA symptoms typically occur in the first decade of life and visual loss is progressive, bilateral and irreversible once cell death has occurred [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>There is marked intra- and inter-familial phenotypic variability [5,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Optic atrophy may associate with hearing loss, apoptosis, and ophthalmoplegia [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Some families have been described with sex-influenced DOA phenotypes [9â11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The majority of DOA is caused by mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene [7,12â14]. OPA1 is a nuclear gene which encodes a mitochondrial protein [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>OPA1 consists of an N-terminal mitochondrial target signal, a transmembrane domain, a presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protease recognition site, and a dynamin-like domain with GTP binding activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>OPA1 is expressed ubiquitously [13,15] and functions in mitochondrial fusion [16â22], ATP production [23], and cytochrome-c mediated apoptosis [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Mitochondrial diseases are associated with mitochondrial fragmentation due to the fast proteolytic processing of the OPA1 protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of OPA1 can prevent such fragmentation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that OPA1 plays an important role in mitochondrial function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Although studies have contributed to our current understanding of OPA1 in terms of function and its relationship to optic atrophy, the pathogenesis of optic atrophy remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The major goal of this study is to establish an animal model for effective in vivo OPA1 studies for pathogenesis and therapeutic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Previous attempts to create a mouse model of OPA1 revealed that homozygous Opa1 mutant mice are embryonically lethal, while heterozygous animals showed no phenotype until a later age [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A Drosophila model of optic atrophy would offer several advantages: there is excellent homology between Drosophila genes and many human disease loci; it has a short lifespan; its eye development is well-studied; its genome has been sequenced; a wide variety of mutants and gene manipulation systems are available; and, for optic atrophy studies, its eye structure is well-defined and the phenotype is easily visualized [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>During Drosophila eye development, lattice cell apoptosis is highly regulated, with one-third of the lattice cells being eliminated by apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Here, we established a Drosophila model where the Drosophila ortholog of OPA1, CG8479 (dOpa1) [28] is inactivated by two different insertions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we were able to produce somatic homozygous dOpa1-deficient cells in Drosophila eyes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Functions of OPA1 in the eye and pathogenesis of optic atrophy were also addressed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To identify the Drosophila ortholog of human OPA1, we performed BLAST searches with the human OPA1 cDNA and amino acid sequences.

<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To further characterize dOpa1, we used multiple sequence comparison by log expectation (MUSCLE) algorithm to perform amino acid sequence alignments of human OPA1 (hOPA1), mouse Opa1 (mOpa1), CG8479 (dOPA1), and Yeast Mgm1 (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>In all four organisms, the GTPase domain was the most conserved region and the basic domain was the least conserved region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The amino acid sequence of mOPA1 shared 96% similarity with hOPA1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>When regions of these proteins were compared, the similarity percentages were 86.5% for the basic domain, 99.6% for the GTPase domain, and 98% for the dynamin central region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>dOpa1 shared 51.2% similarity to hOpa1 amino acid sequence, a higher score than the well-studied yeast protein Mgm1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>At the domain level, the similarity scores were 24.5% for the basic domain, 72% for the GTPase domain, and 53.5% for the dynamin central region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The high amino acid conservation of the GTPase domain and the dynamin regions between hOPA1 and dOpa1 suggests that dOpa1 is the Drosophila ortholog of hOPA1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The insertions in the coding sequence of 2nd exon, in the 3rd intron, and in the noncoding region of the 14th exon of the dOpa1 gene were designated as dOpa1 +/ex2, dOpa1 +/in3, and dOpa1 ex14/ex14, respectively (Figure 1A; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flybase.org">http://www.flybase.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>To determine if these insertions disrupted dOpa1 expression, we examined dOpa1 protein levels in these lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis with a mouse polyclonal antibody against OPA1 showed that wild-type and dOpa1 ex14/ex14 flies had similar levels of dOpa1 (Figure 1B), indicating that the insertion in exon 14 had no effect on dOpa1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the protein levels in dOpa1 +/ex2 and dOpa1 +/in3 were decreased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>This indicated that the P-element insertion in exon 2 (dOpa1 +/ex2) and transposon insertion in intron 3 (dOpa1 +/in3) disrupted dOpa1 expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Since insertion in non-coding exon 14 had no effect on the dOpa1 protein level, dOpa1 +/ex14 served as a control. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>However, the role of cytochrome-c in apoptosis in Drosophila has only been recently established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Mendes and colleagues showed that cyt c-d plays an important role in Drosophila eye apoptosis; and mutation of cyt c-d causes an increase in the number of interommatidial cells and perimeter cells [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Thus we hypothesize that lattice cell death is the result of a cell autonomous death signal from mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Our results show that cone and pigment cell death was correlated with increased ROS levels and mitochondrial fragmentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This implies that the increased ROS production induces cell death, which is further supported by the reversal of these effects and the rescuing of the glossy eye phenotype by antioxidants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Increased ROS production can trigger apoptosis to eliminate deleterious cells [45], but the exact link between oxidative stress and specific apoptosis pathways remains elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Transient fluctuations in ROS levels may serve as an important regulator of mitochondrial respiration, but high and sustained ROS levels cause severe damage [46,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>The rough/glossy phenotype is a result of the lack of cone and pigment cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The consequence is insufficient secretion of lens material, which directly contributes to the glossy phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>This phenotype may occur because cone and pigment precursor cells undergo too few mitotic divisions, failing to enter the second mitotic wave due to insufficient ATP production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the phenotype could result from the misregulation of cone and or pigment cell differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest an additional possibility of cell damage and death from ROS after 42h APF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Importantly, antioxidants can partially rescue the glossy eye phenotype in the dOpa1 intron 3 large clone ommatidia, but do not rescue the rough eye phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>This may further implicate the role of ROS in the pathogenesis of the eye phenotypes in the dOpa1 mutants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Our results show that loss of dOpa1 causes a rough, glossy eye phenotype by two distinct pathogenic pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The lattice cell death observed in the developing eye is probably linked to increased cytochrome-c release. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The glossy eye phenotype in the mutant flies is consistent with decreased lens material secretion from the cone/pigment cells, which are damaged by sustained high ROS levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Since we were able to partially reverse the eye phenotype through antioxidant treatment and expression of human SOD, antioxidant may provide a fruitful approach for treating this condition. </plain></SENT>
