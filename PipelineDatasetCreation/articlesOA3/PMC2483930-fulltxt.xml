The main mechanism considered to mediate parasitemia control in a mammalian host is the continuous interaction between antibodies and the parasite surface, covered by variant-specific surface glycoproteins. Early experimental studies have shown that B-cell responses can be strongly protective but are limited by their VSG-specificity. We have used B-cell (&#x000b5;MT) and IgM-deficient (IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice to investigate the role of B-cells and IgM antibodies in parasitemia control and the <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of trypanosomiasis-associated anemia. These infection studies revealed that that the initial setting of peak levels of parasitemia in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>&#x02013;infected &#x000b5;MT and IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice occurred independent of the presence of B-cells. However, B-cells helped to periodically reduce circulating parasites levels and were required for long term survival, while IgM antibodies played only a limited role in this process. Infection-associated anemia, hypothesized to be mediated by B-cell responses, was induced during infection in &#x000b5;MT mice as well as in IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and as such occurred independently from the infection-induced host antibody response. Antigenic variation, the main immune evasion mechanism of African trypanosomes, occurred independently from host antibody responses against the parasite's ever-changing antigenic glycoprotein coat. Collectively, these results demonstrated that in murine experimental <italic>T. brucei</italic> trypanosomiasis, B-cells were crucial for periodic peak parasitemia clearance, whereas parasite-induced IgM antibodies played only a limited role in the outcome of the infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>African trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by different species of extracellular flagellated protozoan trypanosome parasites. Trypanosomes have developed a mechanism of regular antigenic variation of their variant-specific surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat which allows chronic infection. Replacement of this coat occurs at rapid regular time intervals, allowing the parasite to escape from an effective host antibody responses. So far, primary T-cell independent antibody responses have been described to constitute the main host defense mechanism, relying largely on IgM antibody induction. Using genetically engineered B lymphocyte- or IgM-deficient mouse strains, we show that lack of B-cells or IgM did not prevent infection-associated anemia. More importantly, we show that in the absence of IgM, parasitemia was controlled almost as well as in wild-type mice, with only slightly increased mortality. In addition, we show <italic>in vivo</italic> that antigenic variation is not affected by the lack of IgM.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>African trypanosomes are extracellular protozoa that cause chronic infections in humans and livestock and are predominantly transmitted by the bite of the haematophagic tsetse fly <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Vickerman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> are the causative agents of West/Central- and East-African Sleeping Sickness respectively, also called Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), and are responsible for an estimated 500,000 infection cases <italic>per annum</italic>

Experimental approaches using mice depleted of B-cells by polyclonal antibody treatment <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Campbell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, or infections followed by drug-treatment <xref rid="ppat.1000122-deGee1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, have shown that B-cell responses can be strongly protective but are limited by their VSG-specificity. This has recently been confirmed in a Cape Buffalo model for natural trypanosomiasis resistance <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Guirnalda1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Recently however, using a chimera bovine model, it was shown that trypanosomiasis sensitivity or resistance was not solely linked to the haematopoietic background of the host, suggesting that other additional host derived factors might also play an important role in the determination of bovine resistance phenotypes <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Naessens1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Apart from immune mediated control of infection, the initial setting of parasitemia levels and waves of successive parasitemia peaks are regulated by trypanosomes themselves. This coincides with the differentiation of actively dividing &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; parasites into non-dividing &#x02018;short stumpy&#x02019; parasites <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Vickerman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1000122-Savill1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In experimental murine trypanosomiasis infection models, pleomorphic parasite populations consist of both &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; and &#x02018;short stumpy&#x02019; differentiation forms whereas monomorphic populations consist of &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; forms only. The latter is highly virulent and kills mice rapidly due to the exponential growth of the &#x02018;long slenders&#x02019;. The interaction between the different trypanosome forms and the host immune system can therefore be studied by performing experimental infections using pleomorphic and monomorphic trypanosomes that upon infection initially express the same VSG coat (clonal).</p><p>One of the most detrimental consequences of trypanosomiasis is anemia, which has been described in experimental mouse models <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Amole1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1000122-Magez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and livestock <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000122-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In cattle, monitoring of the dramatic decrease in packed red cell volume (PCV) is the main tool for diagnosis of animal trypanosomiasis, only followed later by parasite detection in the circulation <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Ouma1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In human infections, in particular during the hematolymphatic stage of disease, blood and serum anomalies including anemia are also commonly present <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Dumas1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, there is currently a lack of data to explain the occurrence of trypanosomiasis-associated anemia. Some studies have suggested infection-induced anti-VSG antibodies are involved in an erythrolytic process <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Rifkin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, whereas other studies have suggested that trypanosomes release toxic components which directly lyse red blood cells (RBC) <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Tizard1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, we have recently shown that the severity of anemia did not correlate with the actual parasite load <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Magez1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Considering (i) the limited knowledge of the role of individual antibody isotypes in trypanosomiasis control, and (ii) the unclear role of B-cells in the <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of trypanosomiasis-associated anemia, we used B-cell (&#x000b5;MT) and IgM-deficient (IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice to address these points. Our results showed that although B-cell- and IgM-deficient mice infected with the clonal <italic>T. brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1E parasites exhibited a reduced life span and impaired parasitaemia clearance, infection-induced IgMs played only a limited role in host survival during non-clonal infections. In addition, the presence or absence of B-cells or infection-induced IgM antibodies did not change the rate of trypanosome surface antigenic variation nor did it affect the occurrence of infection-associated anemia. Therefore, our results show that in mice the overall importance of the infection-induced IgM response is limited.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight to 12 week old female BALB/c mice, BALB/c &#x000b5;MT <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Kitamura1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> mice and IgM-deficient BALB/c (IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Lutz1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, as well as C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 &#x000b5;MT mice were obtained from an SPF breeding facility at the University of Cape Town.

Van Meirvenne and E. Magnus (Lab. Serology, Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITG), Antwerp, Belgium) and the MITat 1.2 and 1.4 parasite stocks by Dr. M.A.J. Ferguson (Dept. of Biochemistry, The University of Dundee, Scotland). The <italic>T . b. brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1 clonal, monomorphic parasite strain was originally generated as a daughter clone of the AnTat 1.1E clonal, pleomorphic parasite strain. This was done by 25 cycles of syringe passing on day 4 of infection. Due to the short interval between passages, the AnTat 1.1 parasite is highly virulent and expresses only one type of VSG throughout infection, which is homologous to the initial VSG expressed by the AnTat 1.1E clone. Similarly, the <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic> MITat (Molteno Institute Trypanozoon antigen type) 1.2 and 1.4 clonal, monomorphic parasites are highly virulent and express only one VSG that is non-homologous to the initial VSG expressed by the AnTat 1.1E clone. The TSW196 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> non-clonal, pleomorphic parasite stock was isolated in 1978 in C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire, from infected pig and was transferred to an OF1 mice in order to make stabilates for storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. It is catalogued at the ITG as ITMAS300500A. The AnTaR 1 (Antwerp Trypanozoon antigen repertoire) non-clonal, pleomorphic parasite strain was isolated in 1966 in Uganda from the bloodstream of infected bushbuck. Pleomorphic parasite populations are defined as consisting of both &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; and &#x02018;short stumpy&#x02019; differentiation forms, whereas monomorphic parasite populations consist of only &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; forms. The terms clonal and non-clonal indicates that the parasite population used to infect mice initially express identical or multiple, different VSGs respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Infection re-challenge, parasitemia &#x00026; red blood cell counts</title><p>Infections were initiated by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> parasites, unless stated otherwise. Parasites and red blood cells in a 2.5 &#x000b5;l blood sample 1/200 diluted in PBS, were counted every 2 to 4 days, using a light microscope. For super-infection experiments, mice were initially infected with 5000 <italic>T. brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1E parasites by i.p. injection. On day 6 or day 10 post primary infection, mice were super-infected with 5000 homologous highly virulent monomorphic AnTat 1.1 parasites or equally virulent monomorphic MITat 1.4 parasites. These monomorphic parasites were capable of expressing only one type of VSG during infection which were either homologous (AnTat 1.1) or non-homologous (MITat 1.4) to the VSG initially expressed during primary infection. For tsetse fly challenge experiments, freshly emerged tsetse flies were infected by feeding on AnTaR 1 infected mice at the peak of parasitemia. In order to obtain a pleomorphic trypanosome population at high titer, these mice were immune suppressed with cyclophosphamide (20mg/kg). 28 days after the infecting blood meal, flies were screened for a mature salivary gland infection by induced probing on pre-warmed glass slides followed by a microscopic analysis for the presence of metacyclic trypanosomes in the saliva. Infection of tsetse flies with <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites was performed in compliance with the regulations for biosafety and under approval from the Environmental administration of the Flemish government. To initiate a natural infection, one individual tsetse fly with a mature salivary gland infection was allowed to feed per mouse. To avoid interrupted tsetse feeding, mice were anesthetized prior to the tsetse exposure. Parasite burden of all mice was monitored every day for 1 week following super-infection and survival of all mice was recorded. The experiment was performed in WT BALB/c mice as well is in BALB/c &#x000b5;MT, and IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. 10 mice per group were used.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Anti-VSG antibody titer determination by ELISA</title><p>Infection-induced anti-VSG titers were determined by ELISA as described before <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Radwanska1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

This parasite clone has been used in the past as a well established model for experimental trypanosomiasis in mice, and produces a relatively chronic infection that lasts usually over a month, before killing the host. The pleomorphic annotation refers to the fact that blood parasite populations comprise both proliferating &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; parasites and &#x02018;short stumpy&#x02019; non-proliferating parasites, which are awaiting transmission to the tsetse fly vector. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows that in C57BL/6 mice, the absence of B-cells had neither an influence on the initial growth rate of the trypanosomes, nor on the height of the parasitemia at 6 days post infection, corresponding to the first peak in WT mice.

These monomorphic parasites expressed VSGs that were either homologous (AnTat 1.1) or non-homologous (MITat 1.4) to the initial VSG expressed during primary infection. This resulted in significant earlier mortality of re-challenged mice, as compared to primary infected mice, irrespective of the homology of the VSG being expressed by the parasite during re-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).

However, when re-challenged at day 10 with monomorphic AnTat 1.1 parasites, expressing homologous VSGs, rapid host killing was not observed demonstrating VSG-specific resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

However, the observed host killing occurred with slower kinetics than observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>.

This was not unexpected since both monomorphic parasites killed WT mice within 4&#x02013;5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). VSG-specific resistance in IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice re-challenged at the same time point with the same parasite was significantly impaired as compared to WT mice (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

This earlier mortality of IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice as compared to WT mice, showed that IgM's play only a minor role in protection against homologous re-challenge infection. In contrast T-cell deficient mice, which would be expected to produce T-cell independent anti-VSG IgM antibodies, were fully protected against homologous challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4G and 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Antigenic variation occurs in the absence of antibody responses</title><p>Antigenic variation is a characteristic feature of trypanosomes allowing escape from protective host immune responses.

Quantification of VSG AnTat 1.1E specific RNA by Real Time RT-PCR from AnTat 1.1E infected B-cell deficient (&#x000b5;MT) or wild-type mice showed similar VSG AnTat 1.1E specific RNA concentrations during the first parasitemia peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Using irrelevant VSG MITat 1.2 specific primers, no amplification signal was obtained under identical real time RT-PCR conditions, demonstrating the VSG specificity of the assay (data not shown). VSG AnTat 1.1E specific RNA was undetectable in parasites isolated from the second peak of parasitemia of WT mice, due to efficient elimination of the VSG AnTat 1.1E parasites. Interestingly in &#x000b5;MT mice, VSG AnTat 1.1E specific RNA from second peak parasites was strikingly reduced despite exponential parasite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), which suggests that the main evasion mechanism is an intrinsic genetic program.

However, efficient elimination of actively proliferating monomorphic parasites occurred only when the parasites used for re-challenge expressed a VSG that was homologous to those expressed during primary infection. These observations support the notion that antibodies can only exert their full anti-trypanosome activity in an immunological environment that develops later than day 6. At this early time point, activated macrophages play a crucial role in parasite destruction via the secretion of inflammatory molecules such as nitric oxide (NO) and TNF, and through phagocytosis of damaged and opsonized parasites<bold>.</bold> Although IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice survived a few days longer when re-infected on day 10 with the homologous VSG-expressing AnTat 1.1 parasite, as compared to re-infection using non-homologous VSG-expressing MITat 1.4 parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), this prolonged survival in IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (MS&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12 days) was much less pronounced than the prolonged survival obtained in WT mice, where re-challenge on day 10 did not result in accelerated mortality at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). This demonstrated that VSG-specific IgD and/or IgG responses were not able to efficiently compensate for IgM immunity, irrespectively of the homology of the VSG being expressed by the parasite during re-challenge. Because MITat 1.4 re-challenged IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>) survived longer than MITat 1.4 primary infected IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000122-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), we concluded that a primary host immune responses from day 10, had a negative effect on parasite growth rate, which seems to be VSG-independent. A similar observation has been reported in natural infections where relative resistance or susceptibility to trypanosomiasis in cattle could not always be correlated to the host's capacity of mounting an efficient anti-VSG response. Instead trypano-tolerance was found to be associated with elevated Type I cytokine production (IFN&#x003b3; &#x00026; TNF), increased macrophage activation and NO production <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000122-Tabel1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Similarly, during initial exponential parasite growth phase, SCID mice displayed a lymphocyte-independent parasite growth regulating mechanism which gradually triggered the differentiation of proliferating &#x02018;long slender&#x02019; parasites into non-dividing &#x02018;short stumpy&#x02019; forms causing the infection to reach a plateau <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1000122-Inoue1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. This mechanism of B-cell independent parasite control may therefore involve an intrinsic regulation of parasite growth/differentiation by a parasite released short-stumpy inducing factor <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Reuner1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>In contrast to the results from infection using clonal, pleomorphic parasites, infections with a non-clonal, pleomorphic field isolate (TSW196) showed that IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were able to remit parasitic waves as efficiently as wild-type control mice. Infection-induced IgM's may therefore be compensated for, perhaps by IgG's or other Ig isotypes, during host protective responses. Similarly, no prominent role for IgM was observed in non-clonal tsetse fly initiated infections. However, in this case it should be noted that the AnTaR 1 <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasite used for tsetse fly transmission caused a highly virulent infection in all experimental groups. Moreover, we can not exclude the possibility that WT mice do not make sufficient IgM in response to tsetse fly initiated infections and that IgM's are important for wave remission. These results may also suggest that either tsetse fly saliva components, or other factors involving intrinsic characteristics of tsetse fly transmitted parasites, actively prevent the induction of efficient B-cell responses in mice as a defence mechanism against the host immune system.</p><p>Although, previous <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments indicated that trypanosomes in culture may undergo VSG switching in the absence of antibody-mediated pressure <xref rid="ppat.1000122-Horn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, this has never been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have shown that antigenic variation occurring <italic>in vivo</italic> is independent of antibody induction or selective pressure. Although clonally infected &#x000b5;MT mice had overall impaired parasite clearance and shortened survival, the virtual absence of VSG AnTat1.1E specific RNA in &#x000b5;MT mice 10 days after first peak of infection, demonstrated that parasites switched their VSG independently of antibody selective pressure. Moreover, the remaining 3.5&#x00025; VSG AnTat1.1E specific RNA in &#x000b5;MT mice and 3&#x00025; VSG AnTat1.1E specific RNA in IgM-deficient mice, indicated that antibodies are mostly needed for complete elimination of the remaining non-switched parasites. Interesting to note is the apparently unaltered VSG switching rate between parasites growing in WT and &#x000b5;MT mice. This observation suggests that antibody independent host or parasite factors drive the actual switching process. While the production of a VSG-specific stumpy-inducing factor by the parasite itself appears unlikely, it is feasible that inflammatory mediators such as NO, oxygen radicals or inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFNg, produced by activated macrophages or T-cells could impact on the activation of antigenic variation. Future repetitions of the experiments presented here in BALB/c <sup>nu/nu</sup> and/or RAG<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could potentially shed more light on the mechanisms at work here.</p><p>In summary, the genetic approach of our study using applicable gene deficient mice has allowed us to discriminate the <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of B-cells as well as IgM-responses in parasite growth control, host survival and pathology associated with trypanosomiasis. Our report shows that B-cells are not involved in the induction of trypanosomiasis-associated anemia. Moreover, although infections with the clonal, pleomorphic <italic>T. brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1E parasites in &#x000b5;MT and IgM<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice indicated a limited role for infection-induced anti-VSG antibodies in parasitemia control and host survival. Moreover, non-clonal, low-virulent infections originating from field populations, as well as tsetse fly exposure experiments, indicated that IgM responses have no decisive role on either disease progression or host survival. Finally, this study demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> parasite VSG switching operates as an intrinsically programmed genetic process that is independent of B-cell or antibody pressure, with the function of antibodies mainly limited to the elimination of the remaining non-switched parasites.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. M.
