Intravenous enzyme replacement is the accepted standard of treatment. In the current report, we evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a novel human recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme expressed in transformed plant cells (prGCD), administered to primates and human subjects. Short term (28 days) and long term (9 months) repeated injections with a standard dose of 60 Units/kg and a high dose of 300 Units/kg were administered to monkeys (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4/sex/dose). Neither clinical drug-related adverse effects nor neutralizing antibodies were detected in the animals. In a phase I clinical trial, six healthy volunteers were treated by intravenous infusions with escalating single doses of prGCD. Doses of up to 60 Units/kg were administered at weekly intervals. prGCD infusions were very well tolerated. Anti-prGCD antibodies were not detected. The pharmacokinetic profile of the prGCD revealed a prolonged half-life compared to imiglucerase, the commercial enzyme that is manufactured in a costly mammalian cell system. These studies demonstrate the safety and lack of immunogenicity of prGCD. Following these encouraging results, a pivotal phase III clinical trial for prGCD was FDA approved and is currently ongoing.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00258778">NCT00258778</ext-link>

Following the successful completion of non-clinical safety toxicology studies, which included a single dose study in rodents <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and a 28-day acute safety toxicology study in primates (Cynomolgus monkeys) with daily dosing of prGCD, regulatory approval for conducting a Phase I clinical trial was allowed by the FDA. The clinical study in healthy human volunteers was designed to evaluate the safety of three escalating doses of prGCD and to determine the pharmacokinetics profile of the drug. In addition, a nine-month chronic safety toxicology study in primates (Cynomolgus monkeys) with dosing once every two weeks, mimicking the proposed clinical regime of prGCD, was also performed. This study was a prerequisite for the initiation of an advanced Phase III clinical trial, which will address the continuing safety of chronic administration of prGCD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004792.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004792.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Non clinical safety studies in Cynomolgus Monkeys</title><p>Two extensive safety toxicology studies were performed: an acute 4-week daily intravenous infusion study and a chronic 39-week intravenous infusion study in Cynomolgus Monkeys. In each study, twenty four (24) animals (4/sex/dose) were intravenously infused either daily (in the acute study) or once every 2 weeks (in the chronic study) over 1 hr with multiples of 1 or 5 times the clinical dose (60 units/kg) adjusted to animal body surface area. The doses of 5.6 and 27.8 mg/kg/day represent 1&#x000d7; and 5&#x000d7; the clinical dose on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, respectively. The clinical dose of 60 units/kg, equivalent to approximately 1.8 mg/kg in humans, corresponds to 66 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (using the conversion factor of 37 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for humans), and corresponds to 5.6 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys (using the conversion factor of 12 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for Cynomolgus monkeys). Studies were performed according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) at MPI Research (Mattawan, Michigan, USA). This facility maintains an Animal Welfare Assurance statement with National Institutes of Health, Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Hebrew University. Animals were subjected to clinical observations and assessed for body weight, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry and urinalysis evaluations. Animals were sacrificed at the end of treatment period and organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic pathology were also determined. Antibodies were measured on Day 1 and Day 28 in the acute study and on Day 1, followed by 1, 3, 6 and 9 months in the chronic study.

Controls and unknown samples were incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate coated with prGCD molecules and incubated with shaking at room temperature, allowing any anti-prGCD antibodies present to bind to the prGCD molecules. After incubation, the plate was washed to remove any nonreactive serum components. Biotinylated prGCD conjugate was added which enabled binding to anti-prGCD antibodies already bound to the prGCD solid phase. Detection was performed using a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. The plate was washed to remove any unbound protein and reagents followed by the addition of the substrate, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution. After a 10-minute incubation, 2 M sulfuric acid was added and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The intensity of the color produced was proportional to the concentration of anti-prGCD antibodies in the sample. Antibody-positive samples were determined by comparing the optical density (OD) with a predetermined cutoff OD. An OD equal to or greater than the cutoff identifies a sample as antibody-positive. Samples that were presumed positive underwent immunodepletion testing by addition of prGCD. The addition of prGCD to samples containing anti-prGCD was expected to block the anti-prGCD antibodies from binding to the prGCD coat on the plate, thereby decreasing the OD readings. Any sample demonstrating a decrease of greater than 50&#x00025;, after the addition of prGCD, was considered positive for anti-prGCD antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Determination of neutralizing antibodies</title><p>Analysis of neutralizing antibodies was performed (Midwest BioResearch, LLC, Skokie, Illinois) using a validated immunoassay we have developed. Controls and unknown samples were incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate coated with prGCD molecules and incubated with shaking at room temperature, allowing any anti-prGCD antibodies present to bind to the prGCD. After one hour of incubation at room temperature, the plate was washed to remove any non-reactive serum components. The substrate, p-nitrophenyl &#x003b2;-D-glucopyranoside, was mixed with the activity assay buffer and added to the wells. After a one-hour incubation at room temperature, 5 M sodium hydroxide was added to stop the reaction and enhance the intensity of the color developed. Control samples included neutralizing and non-neutralizing controls. A solution of prGCD, substrate and enzyme inhibitor conduritol B epoxide (CBE) which was added to the uncoated wells was used to perform enzyme inhibition. The control of pooled naive human serum was added to the coated wells to track the activity of the enzyme coated to the surface of the microtiter wells in the presence of normal human serum. A sample is considered positive for neutralizing activity if the OD obtained is less than or equal to the assay cutoff.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Determination of prGCD concentration in serum</title><p>Determination of prGCD plasma concentrations was performed (Midwest BioResearch, LLC, Skokie, Illinois) using a validated immunoassay we have developed.

After two hours of incubation, the plate was washed to remove any non-reactive plasma components. Rabbit anti-prGCD antibodies were added and the plates were incubated 1.5 hours at room temperature to allow the rabbit anti-prGCD to bind to the prGCD. The plate was washed to remove any unbound protein and reagents followed by the addition of an alkaline phosphatase affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugate.

Safety results indicated that prGCD was well tolerated with only non-drug- related, minor side effects that were self limited and resolved with no treatment. No serious adverse events were attributable to prGCD administered intravenously once a week at a dose of up to 60 units/kg. Laboratory tests for kidney and liver function tests were all within normal range.

Immunological laboratory tests were all within normal limits. The Complete Blood Counts (CBC) differentials revealed that one volunteer had at screening and at follow-up a slight elevation in eosinophils, up to 7&#x00025; (normal values up to 5&#x00025;; and his total WBC count was approximately 8,000/cm3); and the second volunteer had a single measurement of 6&#x00025; of eosinophils (at a total WBC of 6,000/cm3).

The safety results confirmed that there was no clinical or laboratory evidence of any significant innate or humoral immune reactions of this investigational drug with any clinically significant adverse events. prGCD administered IV once a week up to 60 mg/kg was shown to be safe and non immunogenic. This data was strongly supported by pre-clinical toxicological studies in animals including primates, performed with prGCD. Based on these results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed prGCD to proceed to a Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial, which is currently ongoing. An interesting finding in this study comes from the pharmacokinetic results, wherein the half life of prGCD was prolonged relative to that of Cerezyme&#x000ae; (Genzyme Corporation, MA, USA), the commercially available enzyme, reported as 3.6&#x02013;10.4 min <xref rid="pone.0004792-Weinreb1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>(Genzyme website). While these data are based on a relatively small number of human subjects, these findings have been corroborated in the primate studies as well, and therefore probably reflect a truly prolonged half life of the prGCD enzyme. At this stage, it is impossible to predict whether this longer circulation time in the blood would have any clinical advantage based on a longer time of exposure to the mannose receptors on the macrophages. Given the great similarity between the prGCD and Cerezyme&#x000ae; proteins, already reported at the level of their 3-D structure <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and based on the increased uptake of prGCD by the tissue macrophages <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, it will be interesting to compare the clinical outcome of prGCD treatment with the reported outcome Cerezyme&#x000ae; treatment.</p><p>Development of antibodies to the current commercially available recombinant human glucocerebrosidase, expressed in CHO cells, has been reported in approximately 15&#x00025; of the treated patients tested and antibody formation was reported following 3&#x02013;12 months of treatment <xref rid="pone.0004792-Starzyk1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Ponce1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Considering the relatively small group size and the short duration of treatment (total of 4 weeks) in the human study, the lack of of antibodies to prGCD formation is not surprising. This may also attributed to the high homology with the endogenous protein <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The differences between the reactions of the primates and human subjects has also to do with the differences in the amount of prGCD given and the frequency and duration of dosing (up to 27.8 mg/ml for 9 months in primates and only up to 1.8 mg/ml in humans over a 4 week period). The formation of antibodies to prGCD in Gaucher patients will be further evaluated in the Phase 3 clinical study.</p><p>There is a public concern regarding the high cost of the recombinant GCD enzyme approved for Gaucher's disease <xref rid="pone.0004792-Beutler2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Futerman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Pollack1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The plant cell system used for the expression of prGCD has the potential to be highly advantageous due to the safe and cost effective production of therapeutic recombinant glycoproteins that are not suitable for production in bacterial hosts, and are currently being expressed in costly mammalian expression systems. prGCD is produced in carrot cells, naturally possesses terminal Mannose residues and therefore, prGCD production does not require costly enzymatic deglycosylation as would be required for the production of recombinant GCD in mammalian cells <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, it provides high batch-to-batch reproducibility of its glycan structures, which represents another important advantage of plant cells. An additional advantage over mammalian cells is the fact they do not involve mammalian-derived components in the manufacturing process, making the purified biopharmaceutical products less expensive and potentially safer <xref rid="pone.0004792-Beutler2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Sijmons1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Hellwig1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>It remains to be determined in larger scale clinical studies, as required in any new protein drug development process, whether plant-derived biopharmaceutical glycoproteins are associated with any excessive immunogenicity effects or excessive neutralizing antibody formation, beyond the standard rate seen for recombinant therapeutic proteins, which may limit their use. However, the current regulatory viewpoint, based on data accumulated in a number of clinical trials involving different plant-expressed proteins, is quite promising in this regard <xref rid="pone.0004792-Kaiser1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0004792-Hellwig1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The clinical and preclinical data presented herein and reported previously <xref rid="pone.0004792-Shaaltiel1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, demonstrated that there were no obvious treatment-related adverse reactions or clinical findings, indicating the potential safety of plant cell-expressed GCD.</p><p>Currently, several biotechnology companies have used plant biotechnology to produce protein pharmaceuticals, such as glucocerebrosidase to treat Gaucher disease in our case, lipase to treat cystic fibrosis, alpha-interferon, lactoferrin, and others, which are under evaluation in human studies <xref rid="pone.0004792-Kaiser1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The value and impact of plant biotechnology on global health should not be dismissed. Protein drugs, although quite costly, are widely used in the developed world, but economic barriers make most of these new biotechnology products inaccessible to the general public, but the very wealthiest inhabitants of the developing world. It is likely that another opportunity for plant-made biopharmaceuticals will take place in the field of new versions of biopharmaceutical products or &#x0201c;biosimilar&#x0201d; versions of existing protein drugs. This is especially true as patents on current drugs expire <xref rid="pone.0004792-Arntzen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> or in those cases where the patents do not protect the expression method of such proteins in plants. The ongoing clinical trials evaluating these different plant biotechnology produced protein-based pharmaceuticals will enable to determine the merit of using these novel and highly promising technologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004792.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004792.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004792.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(1.72 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004792.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Dr. Raul Chertkoff for his review of the clinical data and critical review of the manuscript.
