<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vitiligo is an acquired skin disease that affects 0.1–3% of the world's population, characterized by loss of melanocytes from the epidermis, and leads to the development of achromic lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The basic pathogenesis of vitiligo remains unknown, although several studies suggest genetic predisposition, relationship to other autoimmune disorders, biochemical and neurohormonal imbalance, and environmental toxin/stressors [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cosmetic disfigurement caused by vitiligo has profound psychological effects in approximately two-thirds of the patients, with depression, low self-esteem, social rejection, and even job discrimination [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In patients affected by focal vitiligo, the causative factors usually disappear, leaving well-defined achromic lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In stable generalized vitiligo, the size and number of lesions are stationary for several years and the Koebner phenomenon is absent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Current conventional medical treatment of vitiligo consists of UV therapy (narrowband UV-B or psoralen plus UV-A), local steroids, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus, and calcipotriol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In patients with stable vitiligo, lack of reliably effective medical therapies has led to the development of surgical treatment options using transplantation of autologous melanocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This technique includes split-thickness grafts, punch grafts, and suction blister grafts, which do not require cell expansion [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Complications of these surgical methods can lead to the appearance of a cobblestone surface, peripheral hypopigmentation, spotty pigmentation, or lack of pigmentation of the treated areas, as well as to scarring and pigmentary alterations of the donor sites [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Currently transplantation of cultured autologous melanocytes with or without keratinocytes for treating vitiligo is at the developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Such transplantation techniques include noncultured epidermal suspension, cultured mixed melanocyte-keratinocyte suspension with or without carrier, and cultured pure melanocyte suspension [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The amniotic membrane (AM), the inner part of the placenta, consists of a thick basement membrane of collagen type IV and laminin and an avascular stroma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Davis [10] was the first to use fetal membranes in skin transplantation in 1910. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, AM underwent widespread use as biological dressing in the management of burns [11], chronic venous leg ulcers [12], toxic epidermal necrolysis [13], epidermolysis bullosa [14], surgical dressings [15], and following facial dermabrasion [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Since 1995, when Kim and Tseng reported the use of preserved human AM to rehabilitate severely damaged rabbit cornea [17], AM transplantation has been successfully applied for ocular surface reconstruction in patients with severe corneal diseases [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Experimental and clinical studies using AM as a graft or patch have demonstrated that AM promotes re-epithelialization, decreases inflammation and fibrosis, and inhibits angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>AM acts like a basement membrane and facilitates the migration of epithelial cells [19], has an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting protease activity and infiltration of leukocytes and by suppressing IL-1α and IL-1β [20], and induces downregulation of TGF-β thus reducing fibrosis [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, AM has antimicrobial properties that decrease the risk of postoperative infection [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Moreover, AM has been thought to display very low immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The technique of human AM processing and cryopreservation with the Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium and 50% glycerol recommended by the FDA renders all the amniotic cells nonviable [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we report the clinical results obtained with the application of melanocytes cultivated on AM onto distinct achromic lesions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Despite the availability of various types of medical and surgical treatments for vitiligo, the therapeutic response of either focal or chronic stable generalized vitiligo to conventional treatment is poor, with a significant number of patients failing to respond with a satisfactory degree of repigmentation [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Cellular grafting techniques have advantages over tissue grafts such as punch grafts or suction blister epidermal grafts, including greater uniformity of pigmentation, lower risk of skin-texture abnormalities such as cobblestoning, and the ability to cover larger areas of vitiligo with smaller graft sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Noncultured epidermal suspension transplantation in stable vitiligo was first described by Gauthier and Surleve-Bazeille [25], and a recent paper reports the use of this technique in children and adolescents [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, the donor skin size to recipient skin size ratio is between 1 : 3 and 1 : 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Expansion of melanocytes in vitro provides more cells for transplantation; therefore, the cells from a small piece of skin can be used to treat a large vitiliginous area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>One of the limitations of transplantation of cultured melanocytes is the delivery of the cells in a vehicle that facilitates the cells to engraft and remain in the location of the skin lesion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Administration of cell suspensions may lead to the disappearance of melanocytes while the use of different scaffolds may provide a better substrate for engraftment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Recently we treated a group of five patients with either focal or generalized stable vitiligo using a graft of autologous melanocytes cultured on a denuded AM, with very good repigmentation rates (90–100%) [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Here we treated two patients with vitiligo lesions greater than 200 cm2 with similar satisfactory results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>From the second week the proliferation of melanocytes is exponential so that large achromic areas have no direct therapeutic limitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>The use of AM as a mean of providing a scaffold for transplantation of melanocytes offers several advantages: the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of the AM along with the lack of antigenicity facilitate the epithelization of the skin and decrease scarring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>The basement membrane and its underlying extracellular matrix of AM containing collagen type IV, type VII, and laminins-1 and -5 [28] provide a natural substrate for cells and allow adhesion and proliferation of melanocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>For these reasons AM seems to be a very good substrate for cultivating human melanocytes similarly to what is observed with human limbal epithelial cells [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Besides their biological properties, AMs are easy to obtain and unexpensive, can be customized, and are cosmetically desirable, avoiding the scars seen with the use of split-thickness skin grafts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that epidermal trauma (dermabrasion or laser) could be a melanocyte-stimulating trigger to a reservoir of melanocytes, that is, hair follicles and the surrounding skin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the induced repigmentation might be postinflammatory, caused by the release of inflammatory mediators after epidermal trauma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>We believe these are unlikely explanations for the observed effects in our patients in accordance to studies in which Van Geel et al. [30] have shown that repigmentation induced by epidermal ablation, UV therapy, and inflammatory mediators in placebo-treated lesions is extremely limited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>We also show that the use of CO2 laser allows precise removal of the epidermis, preservation of the papillary dermis, and absence of bleeding and inflammation being a user-friendly procedure, fast and uniform unlike more classical dermabrasion or diathermosurgery [31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>The results in this limited number of patients warrant further studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the AM as a scaffold for melanocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Only an intraindividual clinical trial evaluating the usefulness of AM as a scaffold versus the application of melanocytes in suspension can confirm the greater efficiency of using a carrier for transporting and transplanting the cells. </plain></SENT>
