As most phosphoproteome studies are based on optimized <italic>in-vitro</italic> cell culture studies new methods are in need to improve <italic>de novo</italic> identification and characterization of phosphoproteins in extracts from tissues. Here, we describe a rapid and reliable method for the detection of phosphoproteins in tissue extract based on an experimental strategy that employs 1D and 2D SDS PAGE, Western immunoblotting of phosphoproteins, in-gel protease digestion and enrichment of phosphorpeptides using metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). Subsequently, phosphoproteins are identified by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS with the CHCA-TL or DHB ML sample matrix preparation method and further characterized by various bioinformatic software tools to search for candidate kinases and phosphorylation-dependent binding motifs. The method was applied to mouse lung tissue extracts and resulted in an identification of 160 unique phosphoproteins. Notably, TiO<sub>2</sub> enrichment of pulmonary protein extracts resulted in an identification of additional 17 phosphoproteins and 20 phosphorylation sites. By use of MOAC, new phosphorylation sites were identified as evidenced for the advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor. So far this protein was unknown to be phosphorylated in lung tissue of mice. Overall the developed methodology allowed efficient and rapid screening of phosphorylated proteins and can be employed as a general experimental strategy for an identification of phosphoproteins in tissue extracts.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors gratefully acknowledge support from The Virtual Liver Network (grant 031 6154) of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

Such post-translational modifications of proteins are accomplished by the activities of protein kinases and reversed by phosphatases in a highly dynamic manner. Approximately 500 protein kinases are encoded by the human genome to possibly phosphorylate more than 100 000 sites <xref rid="pone.0050025-Manning1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The predominant class of protein phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells is O-phosphates, and modifications occur on serine (S), threonine (T) and tyrosine (Y) residues at a stoichiometric ratio of 86.4%, 11.8% and 1.8%, respectively <xref rid="pone.0050025-Olsen1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Phosphorylation of proteins changes their activities and is associated with translocation and modulation of protein&#x02013;protein interaction to influence cellular processes including signal transduction, cell differentiation, proliferation, metabolic maintenance, cell division, as well as programmed cell death <xref rid="pone.0050025-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Importantly, an imbalance between phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation results in a wide range of pathological conditions. Thus, inhibiting kinases is the subject of molecular targeted therapies, particularly in the treatment of cancers where hyperactivity of kinases is frequently observed <xref rid="pone.0050025-BlumeJensen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050025-Lim1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>While it is highly desirable to study entire phosphoproteomes, an identification of low abundance phosphoproteins and an assessment of the stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation is challenging, especially when current protocols are applied to small amounts of tissues such as that of lung of mice. As a result of this only a small number of investigators reported studies on the pulmonary proteome and these are based primarily on cell lines <xref rid="pone.0050025-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050025-Linthicum1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> or nasal/bronchoalveolar lavage <xref rid="pone.0050025-Ghafouri1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050025-Stripp1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, in biomedical research diverse mouse models are employed to study disease mechanisms, yet the mapping of components, regulatory events and substrates in signaling pathways remains challenging and is impaired by the lack of an easy method to study more comprehensively entire proteomes. Nonetheless, in recent years, research on phosphoproteins benefitted from the availability of antibodies that selectively recognize phosphorylated amino acid residues <xref rid="pone.0050025-Gronborg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050025-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, thus enabling a more broad search of phosphoproteins <xref rid="pone.0050025-Oda1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> even though some may prove to be ineffective in the recognition of phosphoproteins <xref rid="pone.0050025-Gronborg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Thus, a variety of experimental strategies for the enrichment and detection of phosphorylated proteins has been developed but none of these approaches can be regarded as universally applicable with the mapping and characterization of phosphoproteins requiring a combination of different methods and experimental strategies <xref rid="pone.0050025-Delom1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Specifically, metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) with titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) has been employed for the selective enrichment of phosphopeptides prior to MS <xref rid="pone.0050025-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050025-Pinkse1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This technique is based on the selective interaction of phosphopeptides with porous TiO<sub>2</sub> microspheres (titanspheres) via bidentate binding at the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface and in combination with MALDI-MS to allow the detection of phosphopeptides. Likewise, separation of complex protein mixtures by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and the combination of 2-DE with MALDI-MS for proteome and phosphoproteome mapping studies have been reported as a successful strategy <xref rid="pone.0050025-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050025-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> while other investigators used HPLC- coupled with ESI-MS/MS.</p><fig id="pone-0050025-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0050025.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Description of the combined 2-DE-WB approach.</title><p>200 &#x000b5;g of tissue lysate protein extracts were separated on 2-DE, stained with Colloidal Coomassie G-250 and acquired as an image (2-DE-cCBB).

Using the marker added landmarks the two images were superimposed and combined by the image analysis software to create a virtual image showing the phosphoproteins and the total proteins together (WB-virtual). Several protein spots from this image, which are in common with the cCBB-2-DE image, were selected as additional landmarks and used to superimpose the WB-CCB image to the 2-DE-cCBB image.

These technologies have been put together as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g001">Figure 1</xref>. A detailed description of the procedure is given below.</p><p>Mice were sacrified and lungs were removed and washed free of blood. Then the lung tissue was disrupted with a sonicator and the proteins extracted in the presence of detergents (SDS), reducing agents (DTT), protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Preparative gels were loaded with 250 &#x000b5;g of tissue lysate proteins and separated by 2-DE, then stained with Colloidal Coomassie G-250 (cCCB) and the image acquired to generate a reference image of the total protein extract (2-DE-cCBB). Furthermore, analytical gels were prepared by loading 40 &#x000b5;g of proteins that were subsequently separated by 2-DE, transferred onto PVDF membrane followed by immuno-detection using anti-phosphorylated proteins specific monoclonal antibodies (WB-pAb). With a marker pen (rapidograph&#x000ae;, rotring, Germany) several dots were added on the PVDF membrane and used as landmarks for membrane images that were superimposed (see below) and the image was acquired. Thereafter, the membrane was post-stained using cCCB, to visualize total proteins blotted, and a new image was acquired (WB-cCCB). Using the dots as landmarks the WB-pAb and the WB-cCCB images were merged by the image analysis software as superimposed and matched by creating an image showing the phosphoproteins and the total proteins together (WB-Virtual). Eventually, the 2-DE-CBB image was superimposed and matched to the WB-Virtual image using the CCB post-stained protein spot on the membrane as landmarks, to unravel phosphorylated proteins on the 2-DE-cCBB gel. Protein spot landmarks were selected in such a way to be evenly distribution through the gel. This allowed the software algorithm to compensate local gel distortions. Protein spots on the 2-DE-cCBB gel showed the same electrophoretic mobility as the immunodetected proteins in the membrane were excised from the gel, subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Each immunoblot was run in parallel with one or more 2-DE-cCBB gels, in order to be matched with. At the same time, the protein spots used as landmark for the matching process were also excised and identified on every different 2-DE-cCBB gel to confirm the accuracy of the matching procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>D<italic>e-novo</italic> phosphoproteomic analysis from limited sample material is challenging.

When phosphorylated proteins are detected by antibodies, it is important to realise that each antibody (Ab) has its own unique properties regarding sensitivity and specificity. In addition, factors such as background from contaminating proteins and nonspecific reactivity of the antibodies toward unrelated proteins could influence the performance as well. In the present study, the employed monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were validated previously for their usefulness in the enrichment of phosphorylated proteins and were confirmed by MS identification, therefore demonstrating specificity and selectivity <xref rid="pone.0050025-Gronborg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050025.s002">Table S2</xref> informs on the properties and the combination of antibodies used for the search of pulmonary phosphoproteins. Notably, the various MAb were produced with slightly different antigens, which might influence the specificity and binding behavior of the Ab. Alongside the immunoblotting of phosphoproteins their identification by MS and the subsequent submission of identified sequences to software predictor and database searches of already known literature information confirmed the reliability of the identified data as phoshorylated proteins. Consequently, detection of phosphoproteins with specific Ab and their identification by high performance MALDI-TOF-MS/MS was a simple and fast method. Moreover, to increase the sequence coverage and for comprehensive analysis, the trypsin digested protein spots were analyzed by two different sample preparations, i.e. the CHCA thin layer (TL) and DHB matrix layer (ML). Then, MS/MS data were used to confirm identified proteins. Once identified, bioinformatics was used to predict the potential protein phosphorylation sites, and database searches provided information about the exact position of known phosphorylated sites. In addition to the immunoblotting of phosphoproteins, extracted proteins of lung tissue were also separated by one dimensional SDS-PAGE, and after in-gel digestion of individual bands phosphopeptides were enriched with self-made TiO<sub>2</sub> micro column. The phosphorylation sites were then identified and characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Detection and Identification of Phosphorylated Proteins with Anti-phosphoserine Antibodies</title><p>For the detection of serine phosphorylated proteins, a set of 5 different anti-phosphoserines (pSset) and the MPM-2 MAbs were used (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050025.s002">Table S2</xref>). After development on PVDF membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g002">Figure 2</xref>) with the pSset of monoclonal antibodies, the corresponding spots were excised from the 2-DE cCBB stained gel, in-gel digested with trypsin to overall yield 149 unique proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050025.s001">Table S1</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g003">Figure 3</xref> an example of the specificity of the pSset of MAbs is given. Three distinct spots detected in the WB with the pSset MAbs had two corresponding spots in the 2-DE-cCBB stained gel. Importantly, with the CHCA TL sample matrix preparation the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (O88569) was identified and confirmed by MS/MS. However, when the digests of the same spots were analyzed by the DHB ML sample preparation Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (P16858) was additionally identified and confirmed by MS/MS. Therefore, a careful comparison of the spot in the developed immunoblot of the 2-DE-cCBB gel and the visual inspection of regions in which the spots appeared needed to be confirmed. Likewise co-migrated and adjacent spots were examined. Specifically, the use of two different MALDI sample preparation methods and the acquisition of MS/MS spectra in an automated mode enabled reliable identification of phosphoproteins. The pSset of MAbs facilitated the MS identification of a large number of kinases including the SRC kinase (P05480), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (O88351), integrin-linked protein kinase (O55222) and serine-protein kinase ATM (Q62388) mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (Q63844).

One of these proteins is the heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HS90A). This chaperone is essential for proper protein folding, stabilization and trafficking of an expanding list of proteins, but appears to be critical for a variety of signal transduction pathways as well through an interaction with a wide range of transcription factors and protein kinases.

Out of the 160 phosphoproteins identified their distribution was assigned to 21.2% into cytoplasm, 17.9% in the nucleus, 11.9% in the mitochondria, 16.6% in the cytoskeleton, 15.2% in the plasma membrane and 7.3% as extracellular. Such a distribution of proteins provided further evidence of the versatile character of the developed assay in the search for novel phosphoproteins. The molecular functions of the annotated proteins are consistent with the activity of phosphoproteins in biological processes including protein binding (22.2%), nucleotide binding (15.7%), catalytic activity (9.8%), enzyme regulation (8.5%), enzyme binding (5.9%) and signal transduction (6.5%). Since lung served as a source of tissue material, it is not surprising that the functions of most identified phosphoproteins are related to respiratory biology.</p><p>The PhosphoSitePlus&#x000ae;, Phospho.ELM 9.0 and the UniProt database were used to search for the exact position of known phosphorylation sites based on the available literature. Furthermore, putative phosphorylation sites were searched with different software packages. With Netphos 2.0, an output score of 0.5 was employed as cutoff to ensure that the obtained result is a <italic>bona fide</italic> phosphorylation site. Notably, for all of the 160 identified proteins several phosphorylation sites were predicted. Each phosphoprotein is further analyzed with Scansite 2.0 with high and medium stringency to predict the kinase and phosphorylation-dependent binding motifs. Potential binding sites for the Erk D-domain, PDK1 Binding, DNA PK, ATM kinase and casein kinase are most commonly predicted; casein kinase 1 and 2, PKC epsilon and zeta sites are also found frequently. Thus, out of 160 proteins analyzed 106 (66.2%) are already validated phosphoproteins based on the available literature, 26 proteins (16.2%) were predicted in mouse but validated as phosphoproteins either in humans or in rats, and 30 (18.8%) are only predicted to be phosphorylated but enharbour a kinase docking domain (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0050025.s001">Table S1</xref>). In all, a total of 130 phosphoproteins (81.25%) are validated; this documents the usefulness of the developed assay.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Enrichment of Phosphoproteins by MOAC and <italic>de novo</italic> Identification of Phosphoryation Sites by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS</title><p>Several reports describe the use of titanium in metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC-TiO<sub>2</sub>) for the successful enrichment of phosphorylated peptides. We found most of these protocols not useful for our sample preparation due to the elevated concentration of DHB in the elution solution and the increased backpressure obtained <xref rid="pone.0050025-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we developed a disposable micro-column (&#x000b5;-MOAC-TiO<sub>2</sub>) in which inert glass microfiber was used as a frit and the composition of the elution solution was modified. To further characterize the position of the phosphorylation site, trypsin digests of immunoreactive spots were enriched by &#x000b5;-MOAC-TiO<sub>2</sub> and subsequently applied to the pre-structured sample support for MS analysis. The obtained MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were analyzed for the presence of phosphorylated peptide signals. None of the digested proteins gave acceptable signals of phosphorylated peptides (data not shown). Considering the low stoichiometry of phosphoporylation the total amount of peptides in the 2-DE spots digests was simply insufficient for an identification of phosphopeptides. Tissue extracted proteins were therefore separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and enriched as follows: 50 &#x000b5;g of lung extracted proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE; the lane was cut into 15 regions. The digested proteins from each region were enriched using &#x000b5;-MOAC-TiO<sub>2</sub> and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Each peptide signal presented in the MS spectrum was subjected to MS/MS fragmentation. With this approach additional 17 proteins and 19 phosphorylated peptides were identified and characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. Specifically, 14 peptides contained a single pSer residue, 3 peptides contained two and 1 peptide contained three pSer residues. Moreover, one protein with a single pSer residue also contained pThre residues as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0050025-t001">Table 1</xref>. The yielded spectra contained the characteristic neutral loss of ions at -98 and -80 from the molecular ion as result of &#x003b2;-elimination of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The high quality of spectra enabled detection of copious signal from the peptide back bone (y- and b- series) leading to an unambiguous characterization of the phosphorylation site(s), and in some cases the complete peptide sequence was observed. In addition, peptide ions of masses of&#x0003e;2000 Da were detected to yield highly informative and structurally relevant fragment ions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for the peptide R.TPEELDD<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>DFETEDFDVR.S of alpha-1 catenin (P26231). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g005">Figure 5B</xref> the MALDI-TOF-MS/MS spectra of peptide <italic>m/z</italic> 1526.5210 that corresponds to the peptide R.KAPE<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>QEDEEER.A of the advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor protein (RAGE_MOUSE) is depicted. The fragmentation pattern allowed not only an unambiguous identification of the peptide through the main fragmentation signal but the identification of the Ser 377 as the definitive phosphorylation site. Noteworthy, this protein is described as phosphorylated on threonine 271 but not as phosphorylated on serine (377) in mouse lung. While TiO<sub>2</sub> has been widely used for the enrichment of phosphorylated peptides, none of the presented works demonstrated the feasibility of such enrichment for MALDI-MS for the specific characterization of phosphorylation sites in tissue extracts. Importantly, the copious neutral loss in MS/MS spectra shadows the signal of the backbone peptide. With the CHCA TL sample preparation method a reduced number of phosphorylated peptides, copious matrix clusters, and increased fragmentation rendered data analysis impossible (data not shown). However, the DHB ML sample preparation method delivered an improved homogeneity and increased backbone peptide fragments signal in MS/MS experiments when the matrix was doped with diammonium hydrogen phosphate. Therefore, the ML sample preparation in combination with &#x000b5;-MOAC-TiO<sub>2</sub> enrichment allowed the successful fragmentation and characterization of novel phosphorylation sites.</p><p>Taken collectively, the experimental strategy consisted of two approaches in the search of phosphoproteins. The first approach is based on immunoblots with anti-phosphorylated protein MAbs, while the second approach is based on enrichment of phosphopetides from tissue extracts with TiO<sub>2</sub>. The immunoblot procedure does not always define all the possible residues subjected to posttranslational modifications. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0050025-g006">Figure 6</xref>, the phosphoserine specific MAbs pSset recognized aldehyde dehydrogenase (P47738) and selenium-binding protein 1 (P17563), but with the MAbs 4G10, MPM-2 and pYset only one of these proteins were detected. These two proteins are phosphorylated at different sites as reported elsewhere. Thus, by use of several anti-phosphoprotein Abs with different specificity in the recognition of epitopes a more comprehensive characterization of phosphoproteins can be achieved. Furthermore, the identified proteins enharbour kinases binding motifs as suggested by various bioinformatic sequence analysis. Moreover, 66% of all the detected proteins have been reported to be phosphorylated at sites identified in the present study and appeared to be conserved in human, rat and mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An antibody based rapid screening method for detection and <italic>de novo</italic> identification of phosphoproteins was developed and applied to lung tissue for an identification of pulmonary phosphoproteins. The facile use of MALDI-TOF-MS/MS for the characterization of phosphopeptides is therefore demonstrated. The assay can readily be applied to any tissue in the search for phosphoproteins and to obtain information about on/off states with regard to protein phosphorylation. In the same way it would be possible to study the effects of drug treatment with kinase inhibitors on the phosphoproteome. The proposed assay provided the capability to qualify protein phosphorylation status on a systematic scale and therefore can be employed in biomedical research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050025.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Summary of sequence specific phosphoresidues of identified proteins and bioinformatic prediction of kinases involved.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0050025.s001.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050025.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Monoclonal antibodies and their properties.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0050025.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0050025.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>GO annotations of identified proteins.</p><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0050025.s003.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Ines Voepel and Ute Sanger for the technical help and Dr. Maria Stella Ritorto for constructive discussions.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0050025-Manning1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
