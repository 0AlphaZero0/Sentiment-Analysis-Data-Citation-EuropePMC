The optimization of these applications requires a detailed understanding of the molecular determinants that control of coiled-coil formation. Although many of these determinants have been identified and characterized in great detail, a puzzling observation is that their presence does not necessarily correlate with the oligomerization state of a given coiled-coil structure. Thus, other determinants must play a key role. To address this issue, we recently investigated the unrelated coiled-coil domains from GCN4, ATF1 and cortexillin-1 as model systems. We found that well-known trimer-specific oligomerization-state determinants, such as the distribution of isoleucine residues at heptad-repeat core positions or the trimerization motif Arg-h-x-x-h-Glu (where h&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;hydrophobic amino acid; x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;any amino acid), switch the peptide&#x02019;s topology from a dimer to a trimer only when inserted into the trigger sequence, a site indispensable for coiled-coil formation. Because high-resolution structural information could not be obtained for the full-length, three-stranded cortexillin-1 coiled coil, we here report the detailed biophysical and structural characterization of a shorter variant spanning the trigger sequence using circular dichroism, anatytical ultracentrifugation and x-ray crystallography. We show that the peptide forms a stable &#x003b1;-helical trimer in solution. We further determined the crystal structure of an optimised variant at a resolution of 1.65 &#x000c5;, revealing that the peptide folds into a parallel, three-stranded coiled coil. The two complemented R-IxxIE trimerization motifs and the additional hydrophobic core isoleucine residue adopt the conformations seen in other extensively characterized parallel, three-stranded coiled coils. These findings not only confirm the structural basis for the switch in oligomerization state from a dimer to a trimer observed for the full-length cortexillin-1 coiled-coil domain, but also provide further evidence for a general link between oligomerization-state specificity and trigger-sequence function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by fellowship PA00P3_139673 and grant 310030B_138659 from the Swiss National Science Foundation and P30-EB-09998 form the National Institute of Bioengineering and Biomedical (to SB, MOS and MRC respectively).

Such studies have resulted in the extensive use of coiled coils for the rational design of multi-stranded structures in applications as diverse as basic research, biotechnology, nanotechnology, materials science and medicine <xref rid="pone.0063370-Lupas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. For example, designed two- and three-stranded coiled coils were successfully used as lead molecules to target the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor-suppressor protein implicated in colorectal cancers and to inhibit HIV infection, respectively <xref rid="pone.0063370-Bianchi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063370-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the factors that control coiled-coil folding and oligomerization are not yet well understood. Amongst such factors, &#x0201c;trigger&#x0201d; sequences are known to play an important role in coiled-coil formation <xref rid="pone.0063370-Frank1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063370-Burkhard1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. They comprise short, distinct amino-acid sequences, many of which fold into moderately stable monomeric &#x003b1;-helices prior to the formation of coiled-coil structures. Apparently, the function of a trigger sequence is to present key residues in a coiled coil-like conformation, which serves as a scaffold for the recognition and in-register alignment of partner helices. Interacting helices then &#x0201c;zip up&#x0201d; along the molecule to form a stable coiled-coil structure.</p><p>Several determinants that control the oligomerization state of coiled coils have been identified and studied in great detail. Major roles are played by the specific placement of hydrophobic core residues, in particular isoleucine and leucine, and their distribution generally correlates well with the oligomerization state of coiled coils <xref rid="pone.0063370-Harbury1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063370-Woolfson2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. An accumulation of isoleucine and leucine residues at the heptad repeat <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> core positions, respectively, favors the formation of dimers whereas the reverse arrangement results in tetrameric structures. In contrast, a more even distribution of isoleucine at both the <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> positions facilitates trimer formation.</p><p>Interhelical interactions between side chains of residues at the <bold>e</bold> and <bold>g</bold> positions as well as the packing of these amino acids against the hydrophobic <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> core residues also contribute significantly to oligomerization-state specificity of coiled coils <xref rid="pone.0063370-Lupas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063370-Woolfson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. This is exemplified by the trimerization motif Arg(<bold>g</bold>)-h(<bold>a</bold>)-x-x-h(<bold>d</bold>)-Glu(<bold>e</bold>) (denoted R-hxxhE where h(<bold>a</bold>)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Ile, Leu, Val, Met; h(<bold>d</bold>)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Leu, Ile, Val; x&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;any amino acid residue) that specifies a three-stranded, parallel topology of coiled-coil domains <xref rid="pone.0063370-Ciani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063370-Kammerer4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The trimerization driving force of the motif can be explained by optimal side chain&#x02013;side chain interactions whereby the strictly conserved arginine and glutamate residues form a distinct, bifurcated, interhelical salt-bridge network and participate in the formation of the hydrophobic core by establishing tight packing interactions to the neighbouring residues at the <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> positions through their aliphatic moieties.</p><p>An open issue is that the presence of a specific oligomerization-state determinant frequently does not correlate with the corresponding coiled-coil topology. Although the trimerization motif R-hxxhE is predominantly found in protein families harboring parallel, three-stranded coiled-coil domains, it is also present in some dimers and antiparallel trimers <xref rid="pone.0063370-Kammerer3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We have recently addressed this issue and identified a general link between coiled-coil oligomerization-state specificity and trigger-sequence function <xref rid="pone.0063370-Ciani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. By using the archetype coiled-coil domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 as a model system, we showed that trimer-specific oligomerization-state determinants such as the trimerization motif or isoleucine residues at the heptad-repeat <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> positions switch the peptide&#x02019;s topology from a dimer to a trimer only when inserted into the trigger sequence. We successfully confirmed our results in two other, unrelated coiled-coil dimers, ATF1 and cortexillin-1. Because of its substantial size of 18 continuous heptad repeats, we used a combination of trimer-specific determinants to switch the cortexillin-1 coiled coil from a dimer to a trimer. Accordingly, we rationally substituted residues to complement two ideal trimerizer motifs of the type R-IxxIE and introduced one additional hydrophobic core isoleucine residue in the trigger sequence of the cortexillin-1 coiled coil (referred to as Cort-Ir-M1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063370-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These substitutions were designed to span the entire trigger sequence <xref rid="pone.0063370-Ciani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0063370-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0063370.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Design of Cort-Ir-M1 variants.</title><p>(A) Amino-acid sequence of the wild-type Cort-Ir coiled-coil dimer and its trimeric mutant Cort-Ir-M1.

However, extensive crystallization trials using Cort-Ir-M1 resulted in crystals that diffracted to low resolution only and were not suitable for the collection of a full dataset. We therefore produced two shorter fragments of the Cort-Ir-M1 mutant, denoted Cort-Ir-M1-short1 and Cort-Ir-M1-short2, which span the entire trigger sequence and contain all the amino-acid substitutions that were introduced to switch the full-length coiled-coil domain from a dimer to a trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063370-g001">Figure 1</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0063370-Ciani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>).

Sedimentation equilibrium yielded average molecular masses of 13.2 kDa, which is consistent with the formation of a homotrimer (calculated monomer molecular mass is 4.5 kDa). Next we determined the dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>, of Cort-Ir-M1-short1 by fluorescence sedimentation velocity experiments. To this end, we produced an N-terminal GFP-fusion version of the coiled-coil domain (denoted GFP-Cort-Ir-M1-short1). The sedimentation profile of GFP-Cort-Ir-M1-short1 at 500 nM monomer equivalents revealed only a single peak centred at &#x0223c;5.2 S, which we assigned to a GFP-Cort-Ir-M1-short1 trimer (sequence derived molecular mass of 99 kDa for the trimer; molecular mass of 98 kDa derived from S value) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0063370-g003">Figure 3</xref>). At 5 nM concentration, the lowest concentration that was measurable in a reproducible manner, only one peak centred at 2.7 S was observed, corresponding to 33 kDa. At 50 nM concentration, we observed two peaks centred at &#x0223c;2.8 and &#x0223c;5.2 S.

Our study therefore represents a confirmation and extension of existing sequence-to-structure rules <xref rid="pone.0063370-Lupas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0063370-Woolfson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Such detailed information on coiled-coil sequence-to-structure rules should be beneficial for retrospective interpretation of existing results and could form a basis for design of new molecular entities.</p><p>A well-documented example is the application of a coiled coil-based strategy for the investigation of the activation mechanisms of prokaryotic and eukaryotic transmembrane receptors. These studies have shown that dimerization is not always sufficient to induce autophosphorylation and that additional conformational changes such as, for example, rotation of the kinase domains relative to each other are required for activation. A coiled-coil based approach has been used to test the dimerization-rotation model for several homodimeric proteins (for a representative example, see <xref rid="pone.0063370-Seubert1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). Typically, the extracellular domain of a given receptor is replaced by the short dimeric coiled coil of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcription factor Put3 and fused to its transmembrane domain and intracellular domain. By removing residues of the transmembrane domain at the junction to the coiled coil, designed variants with seven different rotational conformations of the cytosolic domains relative to each other were generated by imposing the Put3 heptad-repeat pattern <xref rid="pone.0063370-Seubert1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. However, in some cases the Put3 coiled coil might not be stable or specific enough to impose the conformations on the transmembrane domain and/or the cytoplasmic domain as it possesses a rather moderate stability of only 40&#x000b0;C at a monomer concentration of 100 &#x000b5;M (R.A. Kammerer, unpublished result). This finding suggests that results obtained with Put3 have to be interpreted with caution. However, on the basis of our extended sequence-to-structure rules it should be possible to optimize Put3 for studies of transmembrane receptors.</p><p>Angiopoietins are the ligands of Tie2 and have potential therapeutic applications in angiogenesis and prevention of vascular leakage. However, the large-scale production of recombinant angiopoietins, in particular angiopoietin-1, is hindered by the aggregation and insolubility of the proteins <xref rid="pone.0063370-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. We and others have produced soluble angiopoietin-1 variants by replacing the native oligomerization domains by coiled-coil domains from other proteins <xref rid="pone.0063370-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Our designed trimeric variant using the coiled-coil domain of matrilin-1 as a fusion partner formed a mixture of trimers and tetramers and phosphorylated Tie2 to the same extent as the native protein. However, the minimal oligomerization state of angiopoietin-1 required for Tie2 activation is currently unknown. The Cort-Ir-M1-short sequence appears to be an excellent candidate fusion partner to address this question.</p><p>Integrins comprise a large family of heterodimeric adhesion receptors consisting of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits. They link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, a process in which the structure of cytoplasmic domains of integrin &#x003b2; subunits plays a key role <xref rid="pone.0063370-Shattil1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The majority of integrin ligands result in receptor clustering and it has been suggested that isolated cytoplasmic &#x003b2; subunit domains resemble ligand-occupied integrins. To mimic this process, Pfaff and colleagues fused cytoplasmic &#x003b2; subunit domains to a four heptad-repeat long particular coiled coil, K-LEALEGR-LDALEGK-LEALEGK-LDALEG, with the aim to generate parallel homodimers <xref rid="pone.0063370-Pfaff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Despite the authors found differences in the binding of clustered &#x003b2; subunit domains with regard to cytoskeletal proteins, their choice of the coiled coil appears not ideal for the design of specific, parallel dimers. The coiled coil contains leucine residues at both the <bold>a</bold> and <bold>d</bold> positions, a distribution that was shown to poorly specify the oligomerization state and result in the formation of mixed oligomers, as well as parallel and antiparallel coiled-coil structures <xref rid="pone.0063370-Harbury1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. It should also be noted that the coiled coil contains a trimerization motif of the type R-LDALE, which is a strong determinant of specific trimer formation in such short coiled coils <xref rid="pone.0063370-Ciani1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0063370-Kammerer4" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>These examples highlight that the design of chimeric fusion proteins using coiled coils remains a challenge. They also emphasize the need for identifying further sequence-to-structure rules like the ones described in the present study. Such experimental findings should significantly improve the specificity of rationally designed coiled coils and consequently many applications using these popular oligomerization domains.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank V.
