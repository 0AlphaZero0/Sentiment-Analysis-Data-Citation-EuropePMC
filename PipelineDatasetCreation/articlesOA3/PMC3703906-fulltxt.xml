Introduction</title><p>Advanced prostate cancers eventually progress to the terminal stage of castration refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) which is not responsive to most of treatment modalities. Docetaxel-based chemotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment for this metastatic CRPC, and recently, other anticancer drugs such as cabazitaxel or abiraterone acetate are allowed for use, but their therapeutic benefits are still not that sufficient [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </p><p>Researchers consider some defects in apoptotic signaling pathway or abnormal overexpression of antiapoptotic factors as the main causes of treatment resistance in patients with late-stage prostate cancer [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Among those antiapoptotic factors, bcl-2 [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], clusterin [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], heat shock prostein 27 (Hsp27) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], cellular-FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and GRP78 [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been widely reported. Overexpression of these factors could be induced by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), chemotherapy, or other extreme stresses.</p><p>Recently, new therapeutic ways of blocking these factors are being developed as new drugs, and among them, clusterin ASO is now on Phase 3 clinical trial [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While knockdown of each factor alone can exert apoptosis inducing effect, blocking several factors which have some different pathways together may enhance apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. This concept can be applied to the development of new therapy against prostate cancer.</p><p>Hsp27, one of small Hsps, inhibits key effectors of the apoptotic pathway at the pre- and postmitochondria levels [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In prostate cancer, Hsp27 is associated with pathologic stage, Gleason score, lymph node metastasis, shorter biochemical recurrence, and poor clinical outcome [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p><p>The c-FLIP is an inhibitor of apoptosis downstream of the death receptors Fas, DE4, and DR5 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The expression of c-FLIP is closely related to the resistance to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and FAS-mediated apoptosis in prostate and bladder cancers [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, c-FLIP is regarded as a new therapeutic target for relevant cancers [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. </p><p>Dual silencing is reported to be effective in augmenting biologic effect on laboratory level and technically feasible [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Doxazosin, an quinazoline derivative <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1 adrenoreceptor antagonist, has been known to exert antitumor effect via induction of apoptosis in PC-3 cancer cells [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Doxazosin induces apoptosis via not an <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1-adrenoceptor-dependent action but a death receptor-mediated pathway [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In this present study, we investigated the enhanced effect of double knockout of Hsp27 and c-FLIP genes using siRNA technology in PC-3 prostate cancer cells and also tried to find out whether there is any interactive role between the 2 factors by observing the expression of one factor under silencing of the other factor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Assessment for Hsp27 and c-FLIP RNA Interference with siRNAs in PC-3 Cells</title><p>For downregulation of Hsp27 expression in PC-3 cells, three different Hsp27-specific siRNAs (Hsp27-1, Hsp27-2, and Hsp27-3) were used for transfection studies. As a control, cells were transfected with siRNA against scrambled sequence. To determine the efficiency of the downregulation of Hsp27 expression in PC-3 cells, mRNA levels of Hsp27 were counted by RT-PCR. Forty-eight hours after transfection, Hsp27-2 siRNA downregulated Hsp27 mRNA level to approximately 17% of control level. The downregulation of Hsp27 expression caused by Hsp27-2 siRNA-mediated silencing was maintained until 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>Similar to Hsp27, three kinds of siRNAs (c-FLIP-1, c-FLIP-2, and c-FLIP-3) were used for c-FLIP silencing in PC-3 cells. c-FLIP-1 siRNA downregulated c-FLIP mRNA level to approximately 14% of control level after 48 hours of transfection.

Nuclear condensation and fragmentation, characteristic findings of apoptosis, were found in TUNEL-positive cells. </p><p>In the cells without siRNA transfection, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was minimal under 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of doxazosin treatment, but it increased gradually in a dose-dependent manner, and finally a significant number of apoptotic bodies were observed under 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of doxazosin treatment.</p><p>Compared to the nonsilenced cells, in the cells transfected with either siRNA targeting Hsp27 or c-FLIP genes, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells were increased in all concentrations of doxazosin.

Similar findings were observed in protein level.

Discussion</title><p>The experimental dose of doxazosin, 10&#x02013;25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, is relatively higher than the serum concentration of patients treated with doxazosin for their lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, doxazosin at clinical dose cannot induce significant apoptosis in the patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, the findings of new mechanisms showing the induction of apoptosis at very low concentrations of doxazosin may provide an evidence to put doxazosin as a new drug candidate for treatment of prostate cancer [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>Commonly used siRNA introduction techniques are either direct introduction by transfection or introduction via plasmids that express short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) precursors of siRNA [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this study, siRNA was introduced by the direct transfection way. We selected a proper oligo which could knock out Hsp27 or c-FLIP gene after 48 hours of siRNA transfection.</p><p>Rocchi et al. reported the effect of synthetic siRNA targeting Hsp27 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells. According to their reports, 1&#x02009;nM of siRNA was effective to downregulate Hsp27 in mRNA and protein levels, resulting in 2.4&#x02013;4-fold increase of apoptotic rates and 40%&#x02013;76% inhibition of cell growth. Characteristic cleavage of caspase-3 was also observed [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Day et al. reported c-FLIP knockdown in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. They observed knockdown of c-FLIP gene with siRNA transfection triggering spontaneous apoptosis and inducing FADD-mediated and DR-5-mediated apoptosis. They addressed c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> not c-FLIPs for having a key role in preventing spontaneous death signaling and suggested c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> as a therapeutic target for breast cancer [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, in a report on colorectal cancer cells, Longley et al. observed that siRNA targeting c-FLIP<sub>L</sub> synergistically enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In our present study, TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells increased twice with each siRNA transfection and increased over 60% after a dual silencing of 2 genes. After single gene silencing of Hsp27, apoptotic index was remarkably increased in 10 and 25&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of doxazosin treatment condition. Similarly, single silencing of c-FLIP gene enhanced doxazosin-induced apoptosis, but the degree of apoptosis was little higher in c-FLIP group compared to Hsp27 group. It can be speculated that while both factors are working as antiapoptotic factors significantly, c-FLIP plays bigger role in resisting doxazosin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells.</p><p> siRNA technology can be used in combined knockdown of two genes involved in carcinogenesis or cancer progression via dual silencing. Kaulfu<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and colleagues reported that dual silencing of insulin-like growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor resulted in an increased apoptosis rate and inhibition of cell proliferation in colorectal cancer cells. Dual silencing is technically feasible and effective in augmenting biologic effect in laboratory level. However, it has not yet been widely established. The studies using this method are limited to colorectal and breast cancers and are also limited to the region of growth factor. As far as we know, there has been no study blocking two different antiapoptotic proteins in prostate cancer cells. </p><p>Both Hsp27 and c-FLIP have been known as strong antiapoptotic mediators. While c-FLIP manifests its role mainly in extrinsic apoptotic pathway, Hsp27 does mainly in mitochondrial pathway. For this reason, we planned to knock out these 2 factors which have different antiapoptotic mechanisms together. We observed much more amount of apoptotic bodies when these 2 factors are blocked together by siRNA technology than individual silencing of Hsp27 or c-FLIP alone. Furthermore, this effect could be seen in low concentration of 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M of doxazosin. These show that PC-3 cells which could have resisted against apoptosis with the help of 2 survival factors became susceptible to doxazosin treatment when Hsp27 and c-FLIP are effectively knocked down together. If applied to clinical situations, this result suggests that multiple block of several antiapoptotic factors which are overexpressed and helped cancer cells to resist to treatment induced apoptosis can augment therapeutic effect even in very low concentration of the drug.</p><p> We also observed that both factors interacted with each other. c-Flip knockout downregulated the expression of Hsp27, and similarly, silencing against Hsp27 decreased the expression of c-FLIP in RT-PCR study. These findings suggest that antiapoptotic functions of c-FLIP and Hsp27 are closely related even when the main pathways are different. We previously reported that siRNA targeting androgen receptor reversed the expression of Hsp27, GRP78, clusterin, and c-FLIP in long-term cultured androgen-independent LNCaP cell lines [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Through these observations, we can speculate that prostate cancer cells have their own peculiar features of antiapoptotic mechanisms that include close interaction between androgen receptor and several survival factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Dual silencing is technically feasible, and dual silencing of c-Flip and Hsp27 enhances apoptosis even under 1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, rather than low concentration, of doxazosin in PC-3 cells. This suggests a new strategy of multiple knockout of antiapoptotic and survival factors in the treatment of late-stage prostate cancer refractory to conventional therapy. We also preliminarily observed that there was interaction between c-FLIP and Hsp27 expression. Further studies revealing detailed interactions between important survival factors and androgen receptor can make another basis in reinforcing therapeutic armaments combating fatal advanced prostate cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>All authors confirm that they have no conflict of interests.</p></ack><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This work was
