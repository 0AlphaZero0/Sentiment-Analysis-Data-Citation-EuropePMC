</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A number of incurable diseases in the visual system involve one or more components of the phototransduction signaling network (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Visual phototransduction is the G protein-mediated process that generates a neuronal signal following light capture by visual pigments in photoreceptor cells (rods and cones). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A unique feature of rod cells, the vertebrate photoreceptors dedicated to dim light vision, is the capability to transduce signals from even single photons due to an extremely efficient amplification not paralleled by other signal transduction pathways [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The first event in scotopic vision is the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin (R), the cornerstone of family A of the seven-transmembrane G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which leads to the formation of the signaling active state (R*) [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The latter, in turn, catalyzes the exchange of bound GDP for GTP on the αβγ heterotrimeric G protein transducin (Gt). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The GTP-bound α subunit (GαGTP) dissociates from the βγ dimer thus stimulating the activation of phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE), a tetramer made of two nearly identical α and β catalytic subunits and two identical γ subunits [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The binding of GαGTP to the γ subunit of PDE (PDEγ) releases its inhibitory constraint on the catalytic subunits, thus leading to the hydrolysis of guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), followed by a rapid closure of the cGMP-gated ionic channels in the outer membrane and a drop in the circulating current. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The lowering in intracellular calcium concentration, associated with cell hyperpolarization ultimately signals the presence of light to the secondary neurons of retina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Signaling shutoff includes at least three calcium feedback mechanisms as well as the simultaneous deactivation of GαGTP and PDE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this respect, the termination of PDE activation by GαGTP is achieved when the GTP-bound to Gα is hydrolyzed to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The latter process is significantly accelerated by a multiprotein complex containing the ninth member of the Regulators of G protein Signaling (RGS) family, hereafter indicated as RGS [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>As a result of the GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) action of RGS, the GαGDP complex re-associates with the βγ dimer restoring the GαGDP-βγ heterotrimer (i.e. Gt). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Such an example is the Nougaret form of dominant stationary night blindness (Nougaret Congenital Night Blindness, NCNB) caused by a missense mutation, G38D, found in the rod Gα of affected individuals [7]–[9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Stationary night blindness is not associated with retinal degeneration and is characterized by the inability to see in the dark, whereas daytime vision is largely unaffected [7]–[9]. In vitro characterization showed that the aspartate substitution for G38 does not alter the interaction between Gα and Gβγ or activation of transducin by R* [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mutant Gα is characterized by modestly reduced kcat value for the intrinsic (∼2.5-fold) and RGS-catalyzed (∼5 fold) GTP hydrolyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In contrast, biochemical data showed that G38D is totally impaired in its ability to bind and activate PDE [9], whereas suction electrode recordings revealed that homozygous GαGTP G38D−/− rods exhibit residual light responses, indicating that the mutation reduced but did not completely abolish effector function [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Functional consequences of substituting the homologous amino acid in other G proteins were found to inhibit GTPase activity and to prevent stimulation by GAP in Ras-p21 [10], Gαi [11], Gαz [12], and Gαs [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Thus, a single-point mutation in Gα seems to elicit a multitude of effects not entirely clarified by in vitro and in vivo experiments and likely involving more than one component in the phototransduction signaling network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In this framework, to gain insights into the molecular bases of the NCNB disease, we integrated the information from in vitro/in vivo experiments with systems-based and atomistic modeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>The systems-based approach relied on a comprehensive quantitative model of phototransduction in rod cells that explicitly includes most of the molecular components of the cascade [14] (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>In this study, that model was extended to the NCNB pathological phenotype, thus highlighting those reactions and intermolecular interactions perturbed by the Gα mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The molecular systems involved in those reactions were subjected to atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and included: wild type and mutated GαGTP taken both in their isolated forms (i.e. GαGTP WT and GαGTP G38D) and in the ternary complex with RGS and PDEγ (GαGTP-RGS-PDEγWT and GαGTP-RGS-PDEγG38D) (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that, in the actual mathematical model, up to two GαGTP can bind, and in turn activate, either one of the catalytic subunits of PDE, hence leading to a 2∶1 stoichiometry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, as previously discussed [14] (see also Table S4 therein), the 2∶1 GαGTP∶PDE complex is detectable only in the presence of light flashes with intensities in the order of 105 photons/µm2 and, even then, their presence is negligible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>As a confirmation of those results, deep reductions of kP3 and kP4 (regulating, respectively, the binding of the second molecule of GαGTP to GαGTP-PDE and the activation of both catalytic subunits of the PDE tetramer), in the background of any of the test models used in this study, did not elicit any change in the photoresponse (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>We cannot, however, exclude that this was due to an inaccurate modeling of this part of the network, whose biochemical detail remains mainly unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>For example, a finer treatment of the allosteric and regulatory mechanisms may be necessary to recover the role of the second PDE subunit [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>This might also explain why, with the changes in kP1, kP2, and kRGS1 necessary to reproduce GαGTP G38D−/− photoresponses, loss in sensitivity and delay of the time to peak are more marked in simulated responses compared to in vitro ones (78- vs 47- and 2.4- vs 1.7-fold, respectively, see Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>In line with the statements above, we relied on the fact that, in the present model, changes in kRGS1 and kRGS2 only affect the formation and activity of the 1∶1∶1 GαGTP-RGS-PDE complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, as shown in Table 1, kRGS2 is a rather coarse parameter, as it describes the RGS-catalyzed GTPase activity in both GαGTP-RGS-PDE and GαGTP-RGS-PDE-GαGTP complexes as well as disruption of these complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we couldn't use the mathematical model to properly evaluate mutational effects on the GAP activity of RGS in the GαGTP-RGS-PDE complex. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Incidentally, the G boxes are five ultra-conserved regions of the Ras-like domain involved in nucleotide binding (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Such mutated position is not involved in backbone-mediated H-bonding interactions with the nucleotide neither in the wild type nor in the mutant, (Supplementary Figure 1A (Figure S1A)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The interaction pattern of the nucleotide remains almost unchanged in the two forms following MD simulations, as also indicated by the patterns of interaction energies between GTP and surrounding residues (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data are consistent with the results of in vitro evidence that the mutation elicits a marginal effect on the intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In contrast to lack of local structural effects, the G38D mutant turned out to affect the intrinsic dynamics of the protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>In this respect, MD simulations on the GαGTP-RGS-PDEγG38D ternary complex are justified by the fact that the mutated Gα holds a residual binding to PDEγ [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>Comparing the dynamics and structural communication features of all the components of the ternary complex in the presence of either wild type or mutated Gα served to infer the effects of the G38D mutation on different structural aspects such as: a) communication and interaction features of the nucleotide, b) intrinsic dynamics of each component of the complex, and c) inter-protein communication. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>In line with simulations on monomeric GαGTP, simulations on the ternary complex show that the interaction pattern of the nucleotide is substantially similar in wild type and mutated Gα (Figure S1 and S2), thus not providing any clue on mutational effects on the GAP activity of RGS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>As for the intrinsic dynamics of the three proteins in the complex, differently from PDEγ, GαGTP and RGS are characterized by low mobility in terms of RMSDs, (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="438" pm="."><plain>The higher mobility of PDEγ is likely due to the poor intramolecular and intermolecular tertiary contacts made by such protein, which is a 42-amino acid fragment of a small subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="439" pm="."><plain>In deep detail, as for GαGTP, the wild type and mutated forms do not differ significantly in terms of RMSDs or RMSFs; major differences concern only the swIII region, which fluctuates less in the mutant than in the wild type (Figures S3 and S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="440" pm="."><plain>In line with such behavior, the overlap between the ES of the two Gα forms in the context of the heterotrimer is quite high (0.90), the essential motions of β2/β3 loop and swIII contributing to such differences (Figure S6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="446" pm="."><plain>Thus, RGS action is likely due to inter-protein structural communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="447" pm="."><plain>On these bases, possible structural relations with the postulated mutation-induced reduction of the GAP activity of RGS were searched by the PSN analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="448" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the two simulated ternary complexes could be inferred from the analysis of the shortest communication pathways, which were almost halved in the mutated complex compared to the wild type (Table 3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="456" pm="."><plain>Another difference concerning the structural communication of wild type and mutated Gt is that, whereas for the wild type some (4%) of the shortest pathways describe a communication between Gα and PDEγ, in the mutant form such communication could not be found, likely due to the increased flexibility of the effector subunit. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="466" pm="."><plain>In this study, we combined visual phototransduction modeling with atomistic simulations to thoroughly investigate the defect associated with the NCNB-causing G38D mutation of Gα. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="467" pm="."><plain>The mathematical model of visual phototransduction was able to reproduce the key features of the behaviors of heterozygous and homozygous rods typical of the NCNB disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="468" pm="."><plain>This could be possible upon reducing the constants governing: a) the binding of GαGTP to PDE, b) the activation of the catalytic activity of PDE, and c) the binding of the RGS complex to a PDE tetramer with one active subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="469" pm="."><plain>In fact, a strong reduction in PDE recognition and activation by GαGTP coupled to a two-fold reduction in the RGS binding constant was essential to reproduce the visual responses in Nougaret patients, while decreasing the intrinsic or RGS-catalyzed GTPase activities did not seem to have a significant effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="470" pm="."><plain>Thus, mathematical modeling emphasized the formation and activation of the GαGTP-PDE complex as the processes more significantly affected by the aspartate substitution for G38 in Gα, in line with electrophysiological recordings [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="471" pm="."><plain>MD simulations on monomeric GαGTP suggest that such reduction in the PDEγ binding ability of mutated Gα is likely due to altered dynamics of the protein associated with changes in the architecture of the swII/α3 cavity, essential recognition point for PDEγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="472" pm="."><plain>A detrimental effect of the mutation on such cavity had been also postulated based upon crystallographic analyses [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="473" pm="."><plain>We ended up independently with this conclusion by individuating also the main actors of this structural effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="474" pm="."><plain>In this framework, the Y254 position seems to be particularly sensible to the concerted motions of the protein triggered by the mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="475" pm="."><plain>Indeed, deformation of the swII/α3 cavity results in the burying of Y254 in the α3/β5 loop, preventing both the Y254 itself and F211(s2:11) from being available to PDEγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="476" pm="."><plain>We also speculated that mutation-induced reductions of the catalytic activity of PDE may derive from the formation of an improperly assembled GαGTP-PDEγ complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>Along this line, also in the ternary complex with RGS and PDEγ the mutation exerts a long distance effect on the effector binding site resulting in increase in the intrinsic flexibility of PDEγ and lack of communication pathways at the Gα-PDEγ interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="478" pm="."><plain>Another clear effect of the Gα mutation is the incapacity to form a stable Q200(G3:5)-mediated communication between the nucleotide and N364 of RGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="479" pm="."><plain>Such communication is instead present in the wild type and is necessary for the GAP action of RGS [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="480" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the main structural effects of the G38D mutation turned out to be deformation of the primary effector binding site in monomeric Gα and enhanced flexibility of PDEγ in the ternary complex, which would destabilize the Gα-effector interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="481" pm="."><plain>Collectively these effects are connectable with the impaired effector recognition and activation shown by in vitro experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="482" pm="."><plain>Finally, the pathogenic mutation of Gα seems to affect the communication between RGS and nucleotide essential for the GAP activity, thus suggesting that the observed slight reduction of the RGS-catalyzed GTPase activity is a matter of perturbed inter-protein communication. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="555" pm="."><plain>An interaction strength cutoff Imin is then chosen and any residue pair ij for which Iij≥Imin is considered to be interacting and hence is connected in the PSG. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="556" pm="."><plain>As previously demonstrated [31], the optimal Imin is the one at which the size of the largest cluster of nodes at Imin 0% halves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="557" pm="."><plain>Incidentally a node cluster is a set of connected nodes in a graph. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="558" pm="."><plain>We approximated the Imin value to the second decimal place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="559" pm="."><plain>The final Imin cutoffs were: 3.24% for GαGTP WT, 3.23% for GαGTP G38D, 3.52% for GαGTP-RGS-PDEγWT, and 3.58% for GαGTP-RGS-PDEγG38D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="560" pm="."><plain>To build the PSG, only the edges present in at least 30% of the trajectory frames were used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="561" pm="."><plain>Those nodes involved in at least four links are named as hubs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="562" pm="."><plain>Possible shortest communication paths or optimal paths (OPs) in the different GαGTP binary complexes as well as between wild type and mutated GαGTP and the other two proteins in the GαGTP-RGS-PDEγ ternary complex were searched. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="563" pm="."><plain>All residue pairs except those at sequence distance ±5 were considered as path extremities (i.e. the first and last amino acids in the path). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="564" pm="."><plain>In detail, the number of intra-Gα amino acid pairs was 49770 for the wild type and mutated forms of isolated GαGTP and 50090 for the wild type and mutated forms of GαGTP in the ternary complex with RGS and PDEγ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="565" pm="."><plain>Finally, 56350 amino acid pairs were considered to search all possible communication paths between wild type and mutated GαGTP and the two proteins in the ternary complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="566" pm="."><plain>Vishveshwara and co-workers implemented also the search for suboptimal paths (SOPs), alternate routes of communication, which can be computed by systematically removing all interactions of an OP node(s), thus forcing the traversal of a less than optimal path [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="567" pm="."><plain>Since our path searches, different from those by Vishveshwara and co-workers [36]–[38], are not limited to a few selected node pairs but systematically consider almost all node pairs in a system, the additional search for SOPs would have been too costly in terms of computer time with the high risk to produce more noise than relevant information. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="569" pm="."><plain>The search for the shortest path(s) between pairs of nodes as implemented in the PSN-path module of Wordom relies on the Dijkstra's algorithm [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="570" pm="."><plain>They were searched by combining PSN data with cross-correlation of atomic motions calculated by using the LMI method. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="571" pm="."><plain>Following calculation of the PSG and of correlated motions (by means of the LMI method [30]), for each frame, the procedure to search for the shortest path(s) between each residue pair consists of a) searching for the shortest path(s) between each selected amino acid pair based upon the stable PSN connectivities, and b) selecting the shortest path(s) that contains at least one residue correlated (i.e., with a LMI cross-correlation ≥0.3) with either one of the two extremities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="572" pm="."><plain>All the shortest paths that pass the filter of correlated motions are subjected to a further filter based upon path frequency, i.e. number of frames containing the selected path divided by the total number of frames in the trajectory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="573" pm="."><plain>The relative number of amino acids holding correlated motions with either one of the two extremities is quantified by the correlation score, i.e. the ratio between the number of correlated amino acids and the path length; the latter excludes the two extremities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="574" pm="."><plain>Outcome of this stage is the total pool of paths for the system under study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="575" pm="."><plain>Meta paths made of the most recurrent nodes and links in the path pool (i.e. global meta paths) are worth computing to infer a coarse/global picture of the structural communication in the considered system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="576" pm="."><plain>In this study, meta paths were computed on the ensemble of paths with frequency ≥30%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="577" pm="."><plain>For each link a recurrence score r is calculated using the following equation:where l is a given link present in the considered set of shortest paths, pij is the total number of shortest paths from node i to node j and pij(l) is the total number of shortest paths from node i to node j that include link l. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="578" pm="."><plain>Finally, only those links with a recurrence score ≥30% of the highest score are used in the meta path representation. </plain></SENT>
