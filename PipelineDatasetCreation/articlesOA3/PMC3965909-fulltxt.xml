We previously found that nuclear accumulation of histone deacetylase-4, HDAC4, contributes to this degeneration; we now report that increased histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) mediated by polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) also plays an important role in the A-T phenotype. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a core catalytic component of PRC2, is a new ATM kinase target, and ATM-mediated S734 phosphorylation of EZH2 reduces protein stability. Thus, PRC2 formation is elevated along with H3K27me3in ATM deficiency. ChIP-sequencing shows a significant increase in H3K27me3 &#x02018;marks&#x02019; and a dramatic shift in their location. The change of H3K27me3 chromatin-binding pattern is directly related to cell cycle re-entry and cell death of ATM-deficient neurons. Lentiviral knockdown of EZH2 rescues Purkinje cell degeneration and behavioral abnormalities in <italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, demonstrating that EZH2 hyperactivity is another key factor in A-T neurodegeneration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem disease characterized by neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The earliest and most profound neuropathology involves the Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum. A-T is caused by mutation of the A-T mutated (ATM) gene, which is ubiquitously expressed throughout development and encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. The best-known function of ATM is to ensure the integrity of the genome. After DNA damage, ATM activates cell cycle checkpoints, arresting the cycle until DNA repair is complete<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Its role in maintaining the health and survival of neurons is complex. Consistent with its function in DNA damage repair<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, ATM protects post-mitotic neurons from degeneration by suppressing the cell cycle<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. But ATM is also required for neuronal vesicle trafficking<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and maintaining HDAC4 (histone deacetylase 4) in the cytoplasm<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Both of these processes are crucial for neuronal viability and yet neither is directly induced by DNA damage<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These later observations hint at a complex web of nerve cell phenotypes that are dependent on ATM function and suggest that the mechanisms behind the neurodegeneration in A-T are multifaceted and still incompletely defined.</p><p id="P3">Our finding of ectopic nuclear HDAC4 in ATM deficiency and the subsequent genome-wide alterations in the acetylation marks on histones H3 and H4 led us to explore other aspects of the histone code. Polycomb group (PcG) family proteins are transcriptional repressors that epigenetically modify chromatin and participate in the establishment and maintenance of many cell fates<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. PcG proteins participate in both stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis as well as in brain development<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. In mammals, there are two distinct polycomb protein complexes: polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The PRC2 complex consists of EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), SUZ12 (suppressor of zeste 12) and EED (embryonic ectoderm development)<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. EZH2 catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to histone H3 at Lys 27 (H3K27) in target gene promoters, leading to epigenetic silencing. EZH2 plays a role in X-chromosome inactivation, germ line development, cell fate decisions and stem cell pluripotency<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. EZH2 is overexpressed in aggressive solid tumors and its overexpression has been implicated in cancer progression and metastases<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>; its knockdown leads to decreased proliferation of cancer cells and a delay in the G2/M transition. During development and stem cell maturation, CDK1/EZH2 or CDK2/EZH2 interactions integrate developmental cues and cell cycle activity to control self-renewal or differentiation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. EZH2 also regulates the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of cortical neurons<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Histone modification is a major form of epigenetic gene regulation that plays a critical role in many neuronal processes<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Spurred by our finding of dramatic HDAC4-mediated histone acetylation changes in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient neurons, we asked whether EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is also affected by a defect of ATM function. We now report that in the cerebella of A-T patients and in A-T mouse models, the levels of H3K27 trimethylation are elevated due to the loss ATM-dependent EZH2 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation normally de-stabilizes EZH2 thus reducing its association with the PRC2 complex and subsequent H3K27 methylation. ChIP-sequencing using H3K27me3 antibody reveals genome-wide differences in this histone mark between wild type and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>. These differences help to drive the CNS symptoms of A-T; knockdown of EZH2 prevents cell cycle reentry and neuronal death in <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient neurons and improves behavior of <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. We propose a model of A-T in which EZH2-mediated hypermethylation of H3K27me3 is a crucial step leading to the degeneration of the <italic>Atm</italic>-deficient neurons.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S1"><title>Results</title><sec id="S2"><title>Elevated H3K27me3 in A-T brains</title><p id="P5">EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation is a key activity of the polycomb epigenetic system.

We became interested in EZH2 as a possible player in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) because of its roles of in cell cycle regulation. ATM-deficient Purkinje and granule cells both reenter the cell cycle before dying in human A-T and in its <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse model<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. We speculated that if EZH2 were involved, the disease process in the A-T nervous system might derive in part from the over-activation of PRC2. As H3K27 is the main target of EZH2, first, we examined H3K27me3 in human cerebellar cortex. Purkinje and granule cell nuclei contained low levels of H3K27me3 in healthy control cerebellar sections (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, top and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Yet, as predicted by our hypothesis, both neuronal types in sections from A-T patients showed enhanced nuclear H3K27me3 staining; H3K9me3 was unaffected (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, bottom and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Western blots of tissue extracts validated the immunostaining &#x02013; elevated levels of H3K27me3 in A-T compared to control (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). We next repeated these observations in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. Immunostaining for H3K27me3 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, upper and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), but not H3K9me3 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, lower and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), was substantially increased in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Purkinje cell nuclei. We also found increased H3K27me3 in mouse <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> neocortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>; <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected, an increased interaction of H3K27me3 with EZH2 was also found in ATM-deficiency (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b&#x02013;c</xref>). Thus, there is a close association between elevated H3K27me3 and <italic>Atm</italic>-deficiency in both humans and mice.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>EZH2 is an ATM target</title><p id="P6">The remarkable change in the levels of H3K27me3 in A-T brain suggested that EZH2 might be a novel ATM target. Analysis of the EZH2 protein sequence predicts that two serines, S652 and S734, are highly probable sites of ATM phosphorylation. We could find no comparably favorable sites in the EZH1 histone methyltransferase, or in other members (e.g., Suz12) of the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) to which EZH2 belongs. To determine whether these two EZH2 sites are used as ATM targets in vivo, we prepared cerebellar extracts from control and A-T patients as well as from wild type and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and performed immunoprecipitation with EZH2 or EZH1 antibodies. Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were then probed with an antibody against a phosphorylated serine or threonine in the context of a following glutamine residue (<bold><sup>P</sup></bold>[S/T]Q), the canonical ATM/ATR target site<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. A strong <bold><sup>P</sup></bold>[S/T]Q signal was found on the EZH2 band in control samples but not in A-T or <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> extracts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We found no <bold><sup>P</sup></bold>[S/T]Q signal in either genotype using EZH1 immunoprecipitates (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We verified that S734 is the predominant ATM site on EZH2 by performing ATM <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using GST-EZH2 fusion proteins as substrates (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). The phosphorylation signal was nearly lost when the EZH2-S734A mutant was used as substrate; the 2SA (S652A/S734A) double mutation blocked the phosphorylation signal entirely. This indicates S734 is the major ATM phosphorylation site, but S652 may serve as an alternate kinase target. To confirm whether ATM-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation responds to DNA damage in vivo, GFP-EZH2 wild type or the non-phosphorylatable 2SA mutant was overexpressed in human A-T fibroblasts with Flag-ATM wild type or the kinase dead (KD) mutant. A strong <bold><sup>P</sup></bold>[S/T]Q signal was found with etoposide treatment when GFP-EZH2-WT was expressed with Flag-ATM-WT (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Expression of either the EZH2-2SA mutant (lane 6) or the ATM-KD mutant (lane 3) significantly reduced the response.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>ATM phosphorylation of EZH2 blocks its assembly into the PRC2 complex</title><p id="P7">In mature neurons, the levels of EZH2 are normally very low<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, a finding that we verified in wild type mouse and human disease-free cerebella (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d&#x02013;e</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). In A-T cerebellum and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cerebellum by contrast, we found that levels of EZH2 were significantly higher (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d&#x02013;e</xref>). Elevated levels of EZH2 were also found in other <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> brain regions such as neocortex and hippocampus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>) suggesting that this effect may be a general one. The enhanced levels of EZH2 protein in ATM-deficient neurons were likely not a result of increased transcription; by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), EZH2 mRNA levels were nearly equal in the two genotypes (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c&#x02013;d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">As a core protein of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), the function and enzymatic activity of EZH2 relies on its physical interaction with the other PRC2 proteins. When we overexpressed EZH2in N2a cells, we found that, compared to wild type EZH2, the association with EED and Suz12 was stronger with the non-phosphorylatable 2SA mutant and weaker with the 2SD phosphomimetic mutant (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). To assess whether the stability of EZH2 affects its ability to participate in PRC2 complex formation, we used the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis, then followed the degradation of the existing pools of protein. After overexpression in N2a cells, wild type EZH2 had a protein half-life of 17.3 hrs (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g&#x02013;h</xref>). The half-life of the phosphomimetic mutant (2SD) was comparable (not shown). By contrast, the non-phosphorylatable 2SA mutant proved remarkably stable (t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> ~ 2 days; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g&#x02013;h</xref>). In all cases, stability was directly correlated with increased EZH2 binding to H3K27me3 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Endogenous EZH2 protein in human A-T fibroblasts behaved similarly &#x02013; more stable after cycloheximide treatment than EZH2 in control fibroblasts (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a&#x02013;b</xref>). Next we tested whether inhibiting protease activity with ALLN blocked the degradation of non-phosphorylatable EZH2. When given 24 hours after transfection of GFP-EZH2, protease inhibition blocked the degradation of the 2SA EZH2 mutant (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c&#x02013;d</xref>). These data suggest that PRC2 complex formation is enhanced in ATM deficiency and that this protects EZH2 from degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>H3K27me3 chromatin-binding correlates with down-regulated transcription</title><p id="P9">The substantially increased levels of H3K27me3 in ATM-deficient neurons led us to ask whether the evidence of altered chromatin remodeling was related to the elevated levels of EZH2. We thus performed H3K27me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) from <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cerebellar cortex, and found a substantial (4-fold) increase in the number of H3K27me3 binding sites in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> compared to wild type chromatin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, this increase was accompanied by a substantial shift in the pattern of binding; just 5% of the sites identified in wild type chromatin overlapped with the sites found in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>. Most of the <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> binding sites (93%) were not represented in the wild type; and of the total wild type sites identified only 23% were found in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> as well. Despite these local shifts in discrete binding sites at the genomic level, the increased in H3K27me3 density was uniformly distributed over genome (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Analyzed by gene function, a large proportion of H3K27me3 targets are in categories that include neuronal function and cell cycle regulation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), but the peaks in the different genotypes did not show a striking difference in gene ontology (GO &#x02013; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Among genes identified in this analysis were <italic>Slit1, Synj2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> &#x02013; genes with important function in synaptic development and maintenance. The H3K27me3 marking of each of these genes was confirmed by qPCR (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b&#x02013;c</xref>).

The GO analysis of the down regulated genes also highlighted developmental processes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). To assess the direct effect of enrichment of H3K27me3 in the promoter regions of these genes, we examined mRNA expression in wild type and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cerebella. Consistent with microarray data, we found a significant reduction of gene expression in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> samples (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).

By contrast, ATM-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation responds robustly to DNA damage (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). To pursue this difference we treated normal human fibroblasts or differentiated rodent N2a cells with ionizing radiation (IR). In control fibroblasts we saw a reduction of EZH2 and H3K27me3 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a&#x02013;c</xref>), while in A-T fibroblast lines IR had virtually no effect.

Mutant cortical neurons have a markedly reduced number of spines along a given length of dendrite (as previously reported for cerebellar Purkinje cells<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>).

First, by H&#x00026;E staining we noted a reduction in the number of Purkinje cells with the large cytoplasmic vacuoles described previously<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD11" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8b</xref>). In addition, when we stained mouse cerebellum using the rapid Golgi stain (<xref rid="SD12" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) we noted changes in both the dendrites and spine density of the Purkinje cells in the infected areas. Although there was no significant difference in Purkinje cell density between wild type and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cerebella with or without <italic>shezh2</italic> viral infection, we found that the cross sectional Purkinje cell dendritic profile area was reduced in untreated <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared to wild type (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g and h</xref>; <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6</xref>). This shrinkage was reversed in the areas surrounding the injection and the difference between injected and uninjected brains was significant.

In the current work we have uncovered a role for EZH2-mediated histone methylation in the A-T neurodegenerative process. In A-T and <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse brain, histone H3K27 trimethylation showed a significant increase. Further, in the absence of ATM the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, is stabilized, is more readily incorporated into the PRC2 complex and displays enhanced binding to H3K27. The elevation in H3K27me3 was quantified by a genome-wide analysis that represents the first unbiased, high-resolution mapping of H3K27me3 occupancy in the ATM-deficient brain. The increase in chromatin sites where H3K27me3 associates in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> brain is correlated with a shift in the expression of a variety of cell cycle and neurotrophic genes. The result is an EZH2-induced increase in neuronal process degeneration, cell cycle reentry, suppression of neuronal genes, and induction of the apoptotic process. The physiological relevance of these changes in the epigenome is underlined by our finding that knockdown of EZH2 can partially rescue the behavioral disabilities found in <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, a finding with immediate therapeutic interest. In the aggregate, therefore, our data define a pathological role for elevated EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in the etiology of A-T.</p><p id="P19">EZH2 was discovered based on its functions during embryogenesis, yet the current work highlights its importance to signaling in the adult brain. Other kinases have also been shown to modulate adult EZH2 activity including AKT, CDK1, CDK2 and p38 kinase<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Adding ATM to this list further integrates the pattern of histone methylation into the signaling activity of a cell by providing evidence that the levels and location of H3K27me3 can respond to DNA damage and oxidative stress. This can be seen directly in the alteration of EZH2 levels observed after ionizing radiation or etoposide treatment. We note that while Cdk1-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation increases H3K27 methylation<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, AKT-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation on serine 21 prevents it<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. This suggests that EZH2 regulation in response to a change in cellular state is complex and bi-directional.</p><p id="P20">ATM deficiency leads to enhanced histone methylation, which is generally associated with a more compact form of chromatin. The observation that DNA damage, which activates ATM, leads to a substantial reduction in histone methylation suggests that activated ATM, by accelerating the degradation of EZH2, would be expected to reduce chromatin condensation. This would lead to a more open chromatin structure that could aid in the access of the various DNA repair proteins to the injured double helix and suggests a new and previously unrecognized way in which ATM helps in the DNA repair process. We note that this concept is fully consistent with work showing slower rates of DNA repair in heterochromatin compared with euchromatin<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Previous studies indicate that EZH2 plays a role in determining cancer cell response during the DNA damage response<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>; two additional studies demonstrate that EZH2 contributes to cancer progression<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Thus our data suggest that ATM-mediated degradation of EZH2 during the DNA damage response is likely to serve a protective function in brain.</p><p id="P21">Note that as ATM activity increases not only would histone methylation decrease, but because HDAC4 would be less likely to move to the nucleus, the levels of histone deacetylation should decrease<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. These two changes would act in consort with one another; both changes in the histone code would favor a more open chromatin configuration and thus more efficient DNA repair. Additional insight into the consequences of the ATM-dependent changes in the histone code can be achieved by comparing the H3K27me3 sites defined in this study with the nuclear HDAC4 chromatin binding we reported previously<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD14" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). The locations of the two &#x02018;marks&#x02019; overlap at only ~2% of the sites in the wild-type. In ATM-deficiency, however, the overlap increases to more than 5%. The dual epigenetic marks would be predicted to induce gene silencing in the <italic>Atm</italic> mutant. The H3K27me3-HDAC4 intersection peaks also appear to be particularly enriched in areas likely to contain cis-acting regulatory sequences. This can be seen most easily by comparing the distribution of these areas with those defined by randomly selected peak sets. Therefore, the H3K27me3-HDAC4 intersections are more likely to select marks within a reasonable cis-acting distance of a gene and are therefore more likely to regulate adjacent gene expression. It should be noted that while it may be important in determining the A-T phenotype, this overlapping subset of marks comprises only a small fraction of the total, suggesting that the two systems &#x02013; methylation and acetylation &#x02013; have largely independent functions.</p><p id="P22">In conclusion, our study presents evidence to suggest an expanded epigenetic regulatory model for the neurodegenerative process in A-T. ATM-deficiency leads to abnormal alteration in EZH2-dependent polycomb epigenetic system. We propose that changes in the status of cell cycle and neuronal survival gene expression in A-T brain is not only dependent on the consequences of HDAC4 nuclear accumulation; it also relies on PRC2 complex-mediated H3K27me3 changes. Identification of a role for ATM in the polycomb silencing system expands our understanding of the dynamic changes underlying histone modifications in the A-T neurodegenerative processes and suggests novel therapeutic targets for treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S10" specific-use="web-only"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S11"><title>Antibodies and chemical regents</title><p id="P23">Antibodies against EZH1, EZH2, EED and SUZ12, Aldolase C, calbindin, H3K27me3, alpha Tublin, BrdU and cleaved caspase3 were obtained from Abcam.

Whole-cell extract DNA (reserved from the sonication step) was treated to reverse crosslinks. Immunoprecipitated DNA and whole-cell extract DNA were then purified by treatment with 50 mM NaCl and proteinase K for 2 hours at 65 &#x000b0;C with rotation. Purified DNA samples were normalized and subjected to PCR analysis. Antibodies used for pull downs were: anti-H3K27me3 and anti-histone3, mouse and rabbit IgG were from Cell Signaling. After immunoprecipitation, recovered chromatin fragments were subjected to semi-quantitative PCR or real-time PCR for 32&#x02013;40 cycles, using primer pairs specific for 150&#x02013;500 bp segments as described in the text.</p></sec><sec id="S25"><title>ChIP sequencing analysis</title><p id="P37">ChIP sequencing libraries were constructed from anti-H3k27me3-immunoprecipitated chromatin using the SOLiD<sup>&#x02122;</sup> DNA fragment library kit (Invitrogen) following the standard ChIP-Seq protocol.

Briefly, premade iLenti<sup>&#x02122;</sup> constructs including a set of <italic>ezh1</italic> siRNA-GFP and a set of <italic>ezh2</italic> siRNA-GFP were from Applied Biological Material Inc. (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S10</xref>). Human EZH2 and EZH1 lentiviral constructs were from GeneCopoeia. Site-direct mutation of lentiviral EZH2 to 2SA (S652A/S734A) and 2SD (S652D/S734D) were performed by QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The high lentiviral particle titers were prepared with Lenti-Pac<sup>&#x02122;</sup> Expression Packaging Kits (GeneCopoeia) in HEK 293T cells and purified by Ultra-Pure Lentivirus purification Kits (Applied Biological Material Inc. Vancouver). Stereotaxic intra-cerebellar infusions were delivered to wild type and <italic>Atm</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (8 weeks of age) under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were positioned in a Kopf stereotaxic apparatus and burr holes drilled into the skull. A 5 &#x003bc;l Hamilton syringe fitted with a 33-gauge needle was lowered into the cerebellum for vector delivery. The coordinates of the burr hole and ventral location for infusion were: &#x02212;7.2 mm from bregma, 1.0 mm lateral from the midline, and 3 mm ventral. For each cerebellum, slow infusion over 15 minutes of 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;l of lentiviral particles (1&#x02013;5&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> TU/ml), was performed; the needle was withdrawn 5 min after completing infusion. For knocking down endogenous EZH2 and overexpressing human EZH2, we delivered <italic>shezh2</italic>: human EZH1,2 lentiviruses as 1:1 ratio in 2-month old mice. After surgery, animals were injected subcutaneously with 0.3 ml pre-warmed saline to avoid dehydration, and were allowed 7 days recovery prior to tissue collection. For behavioral experiments, lentiviruses were injected into mouse cerebellum at postnatal day 18 (P18), and 3 weeks later, trained for tests of motor behavior.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Rota-rod test</title><p id="P41">The rota-rod consisted of a felt-covered steel cylinder fitted to a rotating pump with variable speed settings. Age-matched animals were initially trained for two days to walk on the rota-rod, with each day consisting of two 5-minute training trials (inter-trial interval: 2 hr), with the rota-rod speed adjusted to accelerate from 6 rpm to 40 rpm over a 5 min period each day. After 1 week, mice were returned for testing using the rota-rod adjusted to 10 and 16 rpm over a 5 min test period. Latency to fall off was measured in seconds using a stopwatch by an observer blind to experimental treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Open-Field Test</title><p id="P42">The open-field test was conducted as previously described<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Briefly, a four-sided chamber was used as the open field (63 &#x000d7; 57 &#x000d7; 28 cm). The floor of the arena was divided into a grid of 30 squares. After placing a mouse at the center of the arena, locomotor activity was measured over a 5-minute period using an overhead camera connected to a videotape recorder. Mouse movement behavior was digitally tracked using video-tracking software (Spontaneous Motor Activity Recording and Tracking (SMART), San Diego instruments, San Diego, CA) by running the videotape recording through a Dell computer containing a frame grabber. In addition to obtaining a measure of distance travelled (measured in cm), an observer blind to experimental treatment scored animals for rearing behavior. A rear was defined as an animal raising both front paws off the floor and extending the head and torso upward. Both rearing numbers and distance travelled were divided into one-minute bins across the 5-minute test. This was conducted to determine whether changes in behavior between the various groups were time dependent relative to initial exposure to the apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Stereological analysis of Purkinje cells</title><p id="P43">Golgi neurohistological staining was performed following a modification of classical Golgi procedure described previously<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the freshly dissected brain was processed with FD Rapid GolgiStain kit<sup>&#x02122;</sup> by FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc. (Ellicott City, MD), and counterstained with cresyl violet. To examine morphological alteration of Purkinje neurons, six randomly selected cerebellar sagittal cryosections (60 &#x003bc;m) through the entire cerebellum were observed. The numbers of Purkinje cells per cerebellum were estimated with the optical fractionator technique on a Leica microscope using Stereologer software (IPLab Scanalytics Software). Purkinje cells were counted and analyzed according to the parameters of the optical dissector described as below. The optical fractionator probe randomly selected locations within each contour to place a 3-dimensional (250&#x000d7;250&#x000d7;10 &#x003bc;m) counting box within the defined tissue. Statistical comparisons between different groups were made using a one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA).

With the exception of the behavioral data, we evaluated statistical differences by Student&#x02019;s t test. Behavioral data were analyzed by two-way ANOVAs, with repeated measures included for the open field data. Post hoc testing used Neuman-Keuls or Bonferroni t-tests where appropriate. Effects were considered significant at p &#x0003c; 0.05. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, but sample sizes were similar to those described in previous related studies<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.
