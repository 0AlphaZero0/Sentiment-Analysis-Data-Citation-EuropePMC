They negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play key roles in many biological processes, including skeletal development and cartilage maturation. In addition, miRNAs involvement in osteoarticular diseases has been proved and some of them were identified as suitable biomarkers for pathological conditions. Equine osteochondrosis (OC) is one of the most prevalent juvenile osteoarticular disorders in horses and represents a major concern for animal welfare and economic reasons. Its etiology and pathology remain controversial and biological pathways as well as molecular mechanisms involved in the physiopathology are still unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in equine osteochondrosis (OC) physiopathology.</p><p>Short-read NGS technology (SOLID&#x02122;, Life Technologies) was used to establish a comprehensive repertoire of miRNA expressed in either equine cartilage or subchondral bone. Undamaged cartilage and subchondral bone samples from healthy (healthy samples) and OC-affected (predisposed samples) 10-month Anglo-Arabian foals were analysed. Samples were also subjected or not to an experimental mechanical loading to evaluate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of mechano-transduction pathways.

Studies performed during the past decade have led to the discovery of many miRNAs in almost all organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over 8000 predicted miRNAs from plants, animals and viruses are currently described in miRBase, the reference database. It has been shown that miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting specific mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression trough the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They play key roles in many biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation as well as apoptosis and have been shown to be involved in a number physiopathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of cartilage-specific Dicer-knock-out (KO) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] revealed a crucial role of miRNAs in cartilage development and integrity. However, a comprehensive identification of miRNAs expressed in cartilage and bone and their precise role is still unclear. Recent studies highlighted the role of some miRNAs in endochondral ossification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], chondrocytes differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], regulation of bone remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, miRNA expression profiling performed on bovine articular cartilage suggested their involvement in mechano-transduction pathway and in the maintenance of articular cartilage homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In line with their role in cartilage maturation and bone development, miRNAs are now recognized as key players in osteoarthritis (OA) physiopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and may prove to be involved in other osteoarticular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, it has been demonstrated that mir-27b regulates a protein involved in MEC turn-over, the Matrix Metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), in both normal and OA human chondrocytes. This result suggest that an abnormal expression of mir-27b may contribute to OA development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, some miRNAs have been identified as biomarkers for pathological conditions including OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Most recently, there has been growing interest in using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to catalog small RNAs in a variety of tissue. The aim of our study was to use short-read NGS technology (SOLID&#x02122;, Life Technologies) to establish a comprehensive repertoire of miRNA expressed in either equine cartilage or subchondral bone and to investigate their potential role in equine osteochondrosis (OC). This juvenile osteoarticular disease leads to joint swelling, stiffness and varying degrees of lameness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. OC is one of the most prevalent developmental orthopedic diseases in equine population and constitutes a major concern in terms of animal welfare as well it economic impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Its etiology and pathology are still unclear, due to the confusion regarding the definition of the disease and the lack of understanding of primary lesions formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Clearly, there is a need for a better understanding of OC molecular physiopathology in order to refine nosological entities.</p><p>Here, we analysed undamaged cartilage and subchondral bone from healthy (healthy samples) and OC-affected (predisposed samples) foals, with and without an experimental mechanical loading. This was performed with the aim of exploring the role of miRNAs in the constitutive defects associated with OC development, as well as in regulating mechano-transduction pathways. This work made it possible to define, for the first time to our knowledge, the comprehensive epiphyseal cartilage and subchondral bone miRNome, including about 300 new putative miRNAs. Furthermore, we highlighted miRNAs associated with both OC status and mechanical loading, suggesting that miRNAs may be involved in OC physiopathology as well as in the cellular response to biomechanical stress. Some differentially expressed miRNA identified by our work may later prove to be valuable diagnostic biomarkers that could help refining the nosological entities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animal care committee</title><p>The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved under the number 0964 by the Animal Care Committee of VetAgro Sup, which abides by the requirements of the directive 86/609 of the European Community Council.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Samples collection and experimental design</title><p>The study was based on 37 Anglo-Arabian foals obtained from a unique stallion known to have OC-affected foals in his progeny (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Short-read NGS technology (SOLID&#x02122;, Life Technologies) was performed to define the cartilage and sub-chondral bone miRnomes. Three comparisons were used: between healthy and OC predisposed samples (H vs OC) to test the hypothesis of a constitutive defect, between healthy loaded and unloaded samples (H_L vs H_UL) to evaluate the role of miRNA in the response to biomechanical stress and between healthy and OC-predisposed samples loaded (H_L vs OC_L) to test the hypothesis of a impaired response to mechanical loaded in OC-affected foals.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12864_2013_6497_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e427"/></fig></p><p>Foals were bred at the experimental station of the French National Stud (Station IFCE of Chamberet) to reduce genetic and environmental variability. Mare-foal couples were managed on swivel pastures until the end of the grass season. The osteo-articular status of each foal was determined between six to seven months of age to reliably identify OC lesions. Horses were subjected to a clinical examination consisting in a qualitative visual assessment for lameness, trauma, skin anomalies and joint effusion. An X-ray examination of fetlock, tarsocrural and stifle joints of each foal was then performed and images were evaluated for the presence of OC signs. If irregularities or anomalies were noted, additional X-rays were taken to confirm the lesion. Foals were considered healthy if the clinical exam was normal without ambiguity and if X-rays did not reveal any sign of osteo-articular irregularities. Three healthy and three OC-affected (at least one lesion on the hock) foals were selected and euthanized at 10 months by lethal intravenous injection of T61 (Embutramide), a sedative drug used for euthanasia in veterinary medicine. All joints were macroscopically examined at necropsy to ensure the healthy status and confirm radiologic diagnosis. Cartilage and bone cylindrical explants were obtained from the stifle (healthy joint) using a 12-mm punch. Samples were collected on the same location in the middle of the trochlea to avoid technical bias due to sample location in the joint. Explants including epiphyseal cartilage and about 5 mm of the soft underlying bone (considered as subchondral bone) were washed in PBS and placed in DMEM culture medium for subsequent mechanical-loading experiments or flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA-seq analysis.</p><p>OC-lesions were also collected, fixed for 24 hours in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified in EDTA 10% pH 8.8 solution for one month before being embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 &#x003bc;m).

We identified 609 and 622 miRNAs expressed in cartilage and bone, respectively, including about 300 novel miRNAs. Recently, Sun <italic>et al</italic>., described the use of a Solexa-based deep sequencing approach to identify miRNAs profiles of articular cartilage from rat femoral head cartilage. This study made it possible to highlight 310 known miRNAs as well as 86 novel miRNAs candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Since 215 miRNA are found in common with the present study, our results extend the repertoire of miRNA expressed in cartilage by adding 111 additional miRNAs. We provide a comprehensive repertoire of miRNAs expressed in both cartilage and bone samples collected <italic>in vivo</italic>. In particular, our results highlighted numerous new putative highly expressed miRNAs based on a high confidence RNA-fold score. Most of these also display orthologous precursor sequences in at least one other mammalian genome. Furthermore, they were found to be modulated between healthy and OC-affected horses, providing support for the hypothesis that these sequences do not account for experimental artifacts, but rather may represent genuine miRNAs or smallRNAs. Such a large number of new putative miRNAs may be due to the lack of studies and data specifically targeting cartilage and bone miRnome.</p><p>Equine osteochondrosis is the most common developmental osteoarticular disorder in equine populations leading to pain and lameness. Primary lesions are thought to results from a focal disruption of endochondral ossification, leading to cartilage retention into subchondral bone. Several studies have suggested that primary lesions result from an initial dyschondroplasia associated with an impaired differentiation of chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] whereas other studies have supported the hypothesis of an initial disruption of canal blood supply leading to the formation of necrotic cartilage areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Here, our miRNome analysis agrees with the hypothesis of a constitutive defect leading to impaired cartilage maturation. Indeed, our study was focused on undamaged samples collected on stifle from healthy foals and foals affected by OC lesions on hock. Differential analysis highlighted 49 and 41 modulated miRNAs in cartilage and bone, respectively. Interestingly, several gene mapping programs have been initiated worldwide in different breeds and several quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions have been identified (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]). On these regions, two were found to contain a new miRNA differentially expressed in cartilage (new-eca-mir-696 and new-eca-mir-754) and one overlap with the location of eca-mir-1249, which has been shown to be modulated in bone (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p><p>In cartilage, predicted target genes were found associated with known functions and mechanisms involved in maintenance of cartilage integrity. For example, the balance between catabolic and anabolic processes plays a critical role in cartilage homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It has been shown that several miRNAs including mir-140, mir-199a, mir-193 and mir-29a/29b may be involved in cartilage anabolic and catabolic regulation by regulating the expression of key genes involved in those process such as MMP13, Adamts-5 or Col2A1 (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]). Following these results, our data suggest that differentially expressed miRNAs regulate genes involved in macromolecule metabolism and protein folding and transport. This may also reflect a modification of cartilage turn-over in OC foals. Furthermore, chondrocyte energy metabolism plays a major role in chondrocyte development, maturation and mineralization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Likewise, actin cytoskeleton, which plays a major role in chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], was highlighted in our data. Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of miRNAs expression in OC predisposed foals may alter pathways crucial for cartilage maturation, leading to an abnormal extracellular cartilage matrix synthesis. Interestingly, extracellular matrix changes were observed in OC-affected horses, often associated with a disruption of cartilage canals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Thus, our findings are consistent with a role of miRNAs in cartilage genetic susceptibility to equine OC.</p><p>Likewise, in bone, miRNAS target genes were found associated with functions essential for bone development and remodeling, as well as bone cell differentiation and activation. For instance, energy production and metabolisms are undoubtedly essential for proper bone tissue development. Indeed, ATP is essential for osteoclasts to generate the acidic environment required for solubilization of the alkaline salts and digestion of the organic bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and is involved in osteoblast differentiation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that Rab GTPases, a family of proteins involved in membrane traffic, play an key role for osteoclasts function, in particular for the polarized transport of acidic vesicles of the endocytic/lysosomal pathway required for formation of the ruffled border (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]). Likewise, lipids, especially cholesterol, are essential for osteoblasts and osteoclasts development (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]). Consistent with the known role of miRNAs in the control of bone remodeling (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) and their involvement in key regulation pathways of bone formation and remodeling such as BMP-signaling pathway (mir-133, mir-135) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and Wnt-signaling pathway (mir-29a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], miRNA predicted targets were found to be involved in the regulation of several signaling pathways (FGF, TGFb, IGF1). An essential role of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone remodeling has also recently emerged. For example, ZFP521 acts as a co-factor of Runx2 and the Runx2/ZFP521 balance regulates bone homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. ZNF384 regulates expression of type I collagen, counteracts BMP2-enhanced osteoblast differentiation as well as PTH induced MMP-13 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Our data supports a role of miRNA in a constitutive bone defect associated with a predisposition to OC, including impaired bone remodeling and bone cells homeostasis.</p><p>To investigate the role of miRNAs in mechanotransduction pathways in bone and cartilage, samples were subjected to a 24-hours experimental loading treatment. The comparative analysis between unloaded and loaded samples made it possible to identify modulated miRNAs in cartilage and in bone. Regulation of mechanotransduction pathways in articular cartilage by miRNAs was previously suggested in a study performed with bovine articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This study allowed for the identification of additional miRNAs (mir-17-3p, mir-874-3p) as well as 17 new ones involved in response to mechanical stress. This work is the first to demonstrate a role of miRNAs in the regulation of mechanotransduction pathways in bone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, based on the miRNome, equine OC appears to be associated with combined cartilage and bone defects, in good agreement with our previous preliminary proteomics findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The precise mechanisms linking cartilage and bone defects remain to be elucidated. Moreover, cartilage and subchondral bone serve as a functional unit to maintain joint homeostasis and a disruption or modification of either of these two tissues may lead to the remodeling of the other (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]). Nevertheless, factors involved in this interaction remain unknown. miRNAs are secreted in both tissues and may able to take part in the communication from cartilage to bone and from bone to cartilage through the synovial fluid. In fact, miRNAs are present in synovial fluid and their expression is modified in pathological situations such as OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We observed miRNAs differentially expressed between healthy and OC cartilage and bone, some of which should constitute relevant OC biomarkers in synovial fluid and, to a lesser extent, in plasma.</p><p>Finally, there is no evidence indicating that identified defects could alone be sufficient to induce OC lesions. Since biomechanical constraints are thought to trigger the development of focal lesions, we also explored the hypothesis of an impaired response to biomechanical constraint and some mild differences could be observed between healthy and predisposed samples. However, it remains unclear whether these differences may reflect a constitutively impaired response to biomechanical constrains or may reflect changes in ECM structure and biomechanical properties, consequently modifying mechanical signal transduction and leading to a slightly different outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12864_2013_6497_MOESM1_ESM.tiff"><caption><p>Additional file 1: Figure S1: Histological analysis of OC lesions.

Irregularities and reduced thickness were observed at the cartilage surface. The absence of staining both in and close to the lesion indicates reduction in proteoglycan content suggesting that cartilage is composition is modified.
