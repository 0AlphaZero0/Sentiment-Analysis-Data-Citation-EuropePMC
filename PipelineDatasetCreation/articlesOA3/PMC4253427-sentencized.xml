</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Folates are essential vitamins which serve as cofactors in a variety of key processes such as de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis and DNA methylation [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Antifolates are folate antagonists rationally designed to inhibit key enzymes in the folate metabolic pathway and thus disrupt DNA replication [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Polyglutamatable antifolates undergo a unique metabolic process known as polyglutamylation, in which several glutamate residues are attached to the γ-carboxyl of the glutamate moiety of the antifolate; this metabolic conversion is catalyzed by the ATP-dependent enzyme folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Polyglutamylation renders antifolates polyanions which, on the one hand, are no longer recognized by efflux transporters [3, 4], and on the other hand, display ~100-fold higher potency to their intracellular target enzyme [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hence, FPGS plays a key role in intracellular retention and antitumor activity of polyglutamatable antifolates [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of antifolate polyglutamates has been well recognized as an important determinant in the treatment outcome of cancer patients including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [6-8] and solid tumors including lung cancer and osteosarcoma [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although antifolates including methotrexate (MTX) are a key component in ALL chemotherapy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found to have intrinsic resistance to these important antimetabolites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Comparison of leukemia blasts obtained from AML patients at daignosis to those derived from ALL patients demonstrates that AML blasts accumulate significantly less long-chain MTX polyglutamates than ALL blasts [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that loss of FPGS activity is a predominant mechanism underlying resistance to polyglutamatable antifolates, where 11 out of 14 antifolate-resistant human ALL sublines displayed drug resistance based on impaired FPGS activity [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thus far, three naturally occurring mutations have been shown to underlie loss of FPGS function in leukemia cells: C388F decreased the affinity of FPGS for glutamate by 23-fold [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Additionally, C209R and G569C, each identified in separate alleles of FPGS in a single antifolate-resistant subline, resulted in ≤13% residual FPGS activity compared to the wild type enzyme [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway has key roles in cell differentiation, apoptosis, development and carcinogenesis [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling are the Sma- and Mad-related (Smad) transcription factors (TFs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While Smad4 is constitutively expressed, it translocates to the nucleus only when in complex with phosphorylated Smads, which are activated by TGF-β (Smad2 and Smad3) or in response to bone morphogenetic proteins (Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In the nucleus, Smads bind directly to their DNA-binding site as heterodimers or interact with various coactivators/repressors [15-18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>TGF-β is considered the most potent negative regulator of hematopoiesis and induces cell cycle arrest in committed progenitors by down-regulating cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and c-myc [19] and is considered to have a negative impact on cell proliferation primarily in the myeloid cell lineage [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Here we show that Smad proteins are involved in the selective silencing of the WT allele of FPGS by binding to an intragenic regulatory element in exon12 of FPGS and consequent recruitment of epigenetic modifiers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that FPGS gene expression is inversely correlated with the binding of a Smad4/Ets-1 complex to exon12 in both ALL cells and AML blast specimens. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>To explore the mechanisms underlying loss of FPGS function in human T-ALL cells displaying resistance to polyglutamylation-dependent antifolates, we studied the previously described human leukemia antifolate-resistant sublines MTAR1.5, MTA C-3 and ZD1694 C-9 [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Moreover, to further assess the impact of the mutations on protein structure and enzyme function, a 3D model of the hFPGS was built based on the Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) FPGS template, as detailed in Materials and Methods (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The mutation identified in MTA C-3 cells (i.e. G1088A leading to a R363Q substitution) resulted in the replacement of an arginine residue, which is absolutely conserved among all of species analyzed here, by glutamine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>In FPGS from L. casei, this arginine residue was shown to form a hydrogen bond with ATP, thus stabilizing it in its binding pocket [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the R363Q substitution in the 3D model illustrates that while the distance between the native arginine residue and the ATP is compatible with hydrogen bond formation (i.e. 2.6Å, Figure 1B), the mutant glutamine residue faces in the opposite direction, causing a clash with the ATP molecule (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>However, the substitution of the arginine, located in an α-helix at the surface of the protein, with a proline is likely to introduce a bend and thereby have a deleterious effect on protein structure (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The second mutation, A379T, affects a highly conserved small non-polar residue (100% alanine/glycine conservation) which is located at the ATP-binding pocket (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>ZD1694 C-9 cells harbor three mutations; the V217M substitution naturally exists in many species, therefore the substitution of valine with a methionine is not expected to have a deleterious effect on protein structure/function. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>To explore this hypothesis, we screened the FPGS gene for CpG islands and found two such elements: one encompassing the promoter region (Figure 3A) and another spanning the entire surroundings of exon12 (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>To explore whether or not allele-specific methylation in the FPGS promoter or exon12 can account for the selective silencing of the WT allele in MTA C-3 cells, the methylation status of these regions was assessed by bisulfite sequencing analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>We found that the promoter of FPGS is completely unmethylated (Figure 3C), whereas heavy methylation was found from intron 11 throughout exon12 in both the WT and mutant alleles in MTA C-3 and CCRF-CEM cells (Figure 3D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>The G1088A mutation, found within the CpG island, disrupts a CpG dinucleotide, hence enabling us to verify that both alleles were represented during the cloning and sequencing in the bisulfite sequencing analysis of exon12 (Figure 3D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>This exon can effectively drive gene transcription (Figure 4), hence we hypothesized that the cis/trans-regulatory elements responsible for differential allele expression reside within exon12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>We thus analyzed by bioinformatics the mutation region for the loss or de novo formation of binding sites for TFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that WT exon12 harbors binding sites for both avian erythroblastosis virus E26 (v-ets) oncogene homolog-1 (Ets-1) (EBS, Figure 5A) and specificity protein 1 (Sp1) (GC-box, Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>In contrast, whereas these binding sites are disrupted by the mutation, a known consensus sequence for the binding of TFs of the Smad family is newly formed (SBE, Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we determined the actual binding of Ets-1, Sp1, Smad2 and Smad4 (Smad 3 is not expressed in these cells and thus was not used) to the WT and mutant alleles by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, followed by allele specific real-time PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Expectedly, this ChIP analysis revealed that Ets-1 and Sp1 bind to the WT allele 15- and 20-fold over the mutant allele, respectively (representing 1.4 and 1.9% of the input, respectively; Fig. 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Smad4, which is known to interact with Ets-1 [15], was also found to differentially bind the WT allele (4-fold over the mutant allele, representing 2.1% of the input in the WT allele), whereas Smad2 was found to bind both alleles equally (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Smad proteins were previously shown to be important factors in promoting and maintaining epigenetic gene silencing [18, 25, 26] and have also been suggested to be involved in the recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP-1), a known marker of gene repression, by promoting histone H3K9 methylation [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we further determined, by ChIP analysis, the binding of the following epigenetic markers of gene silencing to exon12 of FPGS: 1) Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg-1) as a marker of the nucleosome positioning complex SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) in addition to histone H3 and histone H3K9me2 modification as markers of high nucleosome density and repressive histone modifications; 2) HP-1α as a marker of heterochromatin and gene repression; and 3) RNA polymerase II (PolII), as a marker of RNA polymerase stalling/pausing due to high nucleosome abundance [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Brg-1, HP-1α, and PolII exhibited &gt;25-fold higher abundance on the WT allele compared to the mutant allele, and H3 had a &gt;7-fold higher abundance on the WT allele (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at the WT allele we found H3K9me2 to constitute 54% of the detected histone H3, whereas at the mutant allele only 14% of the detected histone H3 was found to harbor this epigenetic modification. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Protein binding to the mutant allele of FPGS in MTA C-3 cells resembled the binding to CRYAA (i.e. residual ~0.1%), with the exception of Smad2 and Smad4, which bind the mutant allele 9-16 fold over CRYAA (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>Exon12 is ~7kb downstream to the FPGS promoter, suggesting that it may affect allele expression by DNA looping with the MP of FPGS. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>While exon12 of FPGS was highly occupied by TFs, the MP of FPGS had 7-20 fold lower binding of these proteins to give a maximum input percentage of 0.27 (Figure 5C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Since the MP did not exhibit substantial protein binding as would be expected from a promoter, we searched for additional regulatory elements. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In the current study we explored the molecular mechanism underlying antifolate resistance in leukemia cells harboring a heterozygous G1088A mutation in FPGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>We found that the WT FPGS allele was selectively silenced presumably due to the binding of Smad4 to the genomic region of WT exon12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>We further show that FPGS expression is inversely correlated with the binding of Smad4 to exon12 in leukemic blast cells from adult AML patient specimens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Our search for the mechanism underlying the selective silencing of the WT allele of FPGS in MTA-C3 cells led us to discover a heavily methylated CpG island in the region encompassing intron 11 through exon12 of the FPGS gene in human leukemia cell lines and in human peripheral white blood cell samples (i.e. healthy donor and an AML patient). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that exon12 harbors a putative GC-box sequence, which we found to be occupied by the TF Sp1 (17-fold over the negative control) upon ChIP analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Although the functional role of intragenic binding of TFs has not been extensively reported, Sp1 and Smads were previously shown to regulate transcription via intragenic binding sites [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that exon12 of FPGS has a transcriptional regulatory role. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>A careful examination of the UCSC database revealed several points to support our hypothesis that exon12 acts as a regulator of FPGS transcription: 1) Exon12 emerges upon DNaseI hypersensitivity assays along with the MP of FPGS; indeed, DNase I hypersensitivity is an established feature of regulatory elements [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>2) Histone modifications which are characteristic of promoter/enhancer elements including H3K4me3 and H3K4ac are observed in exon12 in various tumor cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>3) A high occupancy of TFs in exon12 was reported in ChIP-seq experiments compared to other regions of the FPGS gene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>In this respect, since our findings indicate that exon12 may play an important role in regulating FPGS gene expression, we performed ChIP analysis to confirm the actual binding of TFs to exon12 or to the MP of FPGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The consensus site for Smads is present only in the mutant FPGS allele, which could explain the binding of Smad2 and Smad4 to the mutant allele in MTA C-3 cells demonstrated by ChIP analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>However, we found that Smad2 and Smad4 bind the WT FPGS as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Smads were shown to have low binding affinity to DNA, thus requiring additional cofactors for DNA binding [15], and are known to interact with Sp1 [17] and Ets-1 [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the latter TFs were selectively bound to the WT allele, thus providing a plausible explanation for the preferential binding of Smad4 to the WT allele over the mutant allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Additionally, genome-wide analysis of Smads binding established that Smad4 is found in regions distant from the transcription start site and in GC-rich motifs [34], both of which are characteristics of the exon12 region of FPGS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>In the current study we found that Smad4 can bind the WT FPGS allele in vivo and recruit epigenetic modifying proteins, leading to the near complete silencing of the WT FPGS allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate the binding of Smad4 and Ets-1 to the genomic region of exon12 of FPGS in AML patient blasts exhibiting low FPGS expression, while no such binding was detected in an AML patient specimen with high FPGS levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Thus, the current study establishes Smads as novel negative regulators of FPGS gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This implies that a combination regimen consisting of both antifolates along with TGF-β inhibitors in the treatment of leukemia may have a substantial synergistic therapeutic impact on patient outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Consistently, the TGF-β signaling pathway has been successfully targeted in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and triple-negative breast cancer cells with a small molecular inhibitor (LY2157299) or with a humanized neutralizing antibody against TGF-β receptor type II [35, 36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Such targeted combination chemotherapy may improve the treatment efficacy of both ALL and AML via two approaches: 1) ALL patients could be tested for Smad4-binding to exon12 of FPGS at diagnosis and/or upon relapse, thereby allowing clinicians to personalize the treatment protocol for individual ALL patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>2) It may enable the inclusion of antifolates in the treatment of AML, a hematological malignancy which is known to be inherently resistant to antifolate treatment due to low levels of FPGS activity [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>FPGS is crucial for the maintenance of the intracellular folate pool, which is critical for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication [1], thus it is not surprising that we found FPGS to be overexpressed in most of the specimens from adult AML patients (7 out of 9 patients studied). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This is in concordance with previous reports in which FPGS was found to be overexpressed in many hematopoietic malignancies, and to a lower extent in normal bone marrow [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>From a physiological perspective, we propose that part of the TGF-β response, which induces cell cycle arrest in hematopoietic cells, leads to silencing of FPGS expression via binding of Ets-1, Smad2 and Smad4 to exon12 of FPGS, thereby resulting in reduced intracellular nucleotide pools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>DNA-looping between distant regulatory elements within the ORF and the promoter is known to contribute to transcriptional regulation [38], hence, exon12 of FPGS may interact with the promoter, with the cooperation of the highly bound Smad4/Ets-1 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>This Smad4/Ets-1 complex can also promote allele-specific silencing by recruiting epigenetic modifiers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>However, whereas these TFs highly bind exon12, they were found at a much lesser extent in the MP (~2% of input in exon12 compared to ~0.3% of input in the MP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>The promoter of FPGS was previously explored in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by Leclerc et al, with constructs harboring promoter segments up to 8kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, revealing an 800bp domain located ~2.5kb upstream of the transcription start site with an important regulatory role [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>We thus evaluated Ets-1, Smad2 and Smad4 occupancy in this upstream region, and indeed found a significant abundance of these TFs in the UPE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis identified binding sites for these factors in the UPE, allowing for this genomic region to interact with exon12 by cross-talk between the same TFs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>This is further substantiated by the fact that in CCRF-CEM parental cells Ets-1 and Smads do not bind to exon12 and accordingly, the MP and UPE are also devoid of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>The putative interaction of exon12 with the promoter presumably directs the epigenetic modifiers to allow specific allele silencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>The SWI/SNF complex can either promote transcription by nucleosome removal or suppress transcription by nucleosome positioning, depending on the interacting protein partners (reviewed by Narlikar et al, 2002 [39]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>This complex was shown to interact with methyl CpG binding proteins to repress gene expression [40] and since exon12 is highly methylated, it may recruit the trans-acting factors necessary for transcriptional repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>High nucleosome density impairs the unwinding of the two DNA strands during transcription and was shown to induce PolII stalling as well as pausing [27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>We consistently found here 50-fold higher levels of PolII occupancy on the WT allele, when compared to the mutant allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>Another support to the epigenetic silencing of the WT allele is that the sequences of both WT and mutant alleles had the same promoter activities in driving luciferase reporter transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Since luciferase reporter analysis is performed using a vector transiently introduced into the cells, nucleosomes cannot be recruited and cannot influence gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if indeed epigenetic modifications are the mechanism underlying silencing of the WT allele, no differences in luciferase reporter activity are expected between the WT and mutant alleles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In this study we also demonstrate that inactivating FPGS mutations constitute a dominant mechanism of antifolate resistance in leukemia cells, illustrated by the fact that all antifolate-resistant cells that were examined harbored inactivating mutations in the ORF of FPGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown (Liani et al., 2003) that loss of FPGS activity is a dominant mechanism of resistance to polyglutamatable-antifolates in leukemia cells and our conclusion was that inactivating mutations are not a common mechanism of loss of FPGS function in antifolate resistance [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>However, the screening for inactivating mutations at that time was performed by the single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) method, which is based on conformational changes induced by single-base mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Clearly, since various mutations may not necessarily introduce a conformational change in the DNA fragment under study, this SSCP method is not sufficiently sensitive as the direct sequencing method in detecting mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Hence, we were now able to detect multiple single nucleotide substitutions in the FPGS gene in various antifolate resistant leukemia sublines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In this respect, we identified a total of six missense mutations in the coding region of FPGS, which further expand the list of hFPGS mutations including three other missense mutations previously reported to result in the loss of FPGS activity in antifolate resistant cells [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>Two of the mutations that we identified here, in two independent antifolate-resistant sublines, affected the ATP-binding pocket of FPGS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>The R363Q substitution found in MTA C-3 cells is predicted to impair ATP-binding by interfering with an important hydrogen bond formed between the conserved arginine residue at position 363 and ATP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>The A379T substitution found in MTAR1.5 cells resides at close vicinity to the ATP-binding pocket and may disrupt substrate entry or release from this pocket. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>The A562S substitution, found in MTAR1.5 cells, could not be analyzed using bioinformatics tools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>However, substitution of the G569 residue located near the A562 residue, with a cysteine, resulted in the loss of 87% of FPGS activity in antifolate resistant human leukemia cells [12], strongly indicating that this region is highly important for FPGS activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms affecting FPGS protein activity have recently been reported in the general population, suggesting different antifolate sensitivities in patients undergoing antifolate-containing chemotherapy [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Since we used single-step selection to isolate two of the antifolate resistant clonal sublines, the mutations that we identified were most likely preexisting variants rather than newly induced by the exposure to antifolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the variations in FPGS activity between patients, the tumor itself, in a single patient, is composed of multiple genomically unstable cells which may display distinct sensitivities to antifolates due to high frequency of alterations in the coding sequence of the FPGS gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Some of these cells can survive the chemotherapeutic treatment and can result in a relapse of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>Recent studies support this notion hence establishing the striking intratumor genomic heterogeneity when analyzing multiple regions of the same tumor in individual cancer patients [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that in addition to loss of FPGS enzyme activity, single nucleotide substitutions in FPGS can result in alterations in allele expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>This is due to a unique transcriptional regulatory role of the downstream exon12 discovered herein, which is a binding site for a Smad4/Ets-1 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>The current study constitutes the first report of the impact of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway on FPGS gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>These novel findings have important ramifications for the rational overcoming of FPGS-based antifolate resistance in leukemia. </plain></SENT>
