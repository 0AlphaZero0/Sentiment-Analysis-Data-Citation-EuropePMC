It is characterized by asymmetric muscle weakness and variable penetrance. FSHD is linked to a reduction in copy number of the D4Z4 3.3 kb macrosatellite repeat, located in 4q35. This causes the epigenetic de-repression of FSHD candidate genes leading to disease. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism responsible for silencing of FSHD candidate genes in healthy subjects is not fully understood. While a role for DNA methylation has been suggested, so far there is limited information regarding the methylation status of the 325 CpGs contained in each D4Z4 unit. Using a human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell line containing a single human chromosome 4, we performed an in depth analysis of DNA methylation for the majority of the CpGs inside D4Z4 at single nucleotide level. We found that D4Z4 is not uniformly methylated and that the level of DNA methylation does not correlate with the density of CpG dinucleotides. Moreover, in several D4Z4 regions characterized by near complete methylation, we found specific unmethylated CpGs. These elements are enriched in transcription factor binding sites that could be involved in muscle-specific D4Z4 activity. Our approach also detected differential methylation among different D4Z4 units, suggesting that the D4Z4 array is a mosaic of euchromatic and heterochromatic domains. Finally, we found that DNA methylation and histone de-acetylation are required to maintain FSHD candidate genes repressed. Taken together, our data underscore new players involved in the epigenetic regulation of the FSHD locus that could be targeted for therapeutic purposes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Association Fran&#x000e7;aise contre les Myopathies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.afm-telethon.com/">http://www.afm-telethon.com/</ext-link>); the ERA-Net for Research on Rare Diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.erare.eu/">http://www.erare.eu/</ext-link>); the European Research Council (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://erc.europa.eu/">http://erc.europa.eu/</ext-link>); the Italian Epigenomics Flagship Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epigen.it/">http://www.epigen.it/</ext-link>); the Italian Ministry of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.salute.gov.it/">http://www.salute.gov.it/</ext-link>) and the FSHD Global Research Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fshdglobal.org/">http://fshdglobal.org/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="24"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Usually, patients affected by FSHD start to present symptoms in their teens, and by the second decade of life more than 90% have shown signs of the disease <xref rid="pone.0115278-LuntPW1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Nevertheless, presentation of FSHD exhibits a wide range of clinical severity and variable age of onset, even between family members with similar DNA mutation. Notably, monozygotic twin discordance has been reported, thus suggesting a strong epigenetic component in the disease <xref rid="pone.0115278-Tupler1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Tawil1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Two forms of the disease have been described: FSHD1 (MIM 158900) and FSHD2 (MIM 158901). Different from most Mendelian disorders, FSHD1 (accounting for 95% of FSHD cases) is not due to a mutation in a protein-coding gene. Instead, it is linked to reduction in copy number of a 3,3 kb macrosatellite repeat called D4Z4, located in the long arm of human chromosome 4 (4q35). In healthy individuals 11 to 100 D4Z4 repeats are found, while FSHD1 patients carry 1 to 10 units <xref rid="pone.0115278-Neguembor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is increasingly evident that, in healthy subjects, the high D4Z4 copy number mediates the epigenetic repression of 4q35 genes <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. On the other hand, the reduction of D4Z4 copy number in FSHD1 patients is associated to altered expression of several 4q35 genes <xref rid="pone.0115278-Broucqsault1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115278-Rijkers1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Consequently, it has been proposed that the disease is caused by the aberrant expression of one or more 4q35 FSHD candidate genes <xref rid="pone.0115278-Neguembor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. FSHD2 is a D4Z4 contraction-independent form of the disease. In 85% of FSHD2 patients the disease is brought about by mutations in the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 <xref rid="pone.0115278-Lemmers1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Several aspects of the FSHD molecular mechanism remain unclear. For example, while its involvement has been suggested <xref rid="pone.0115278-Lemmers1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115278-vanOverveld1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, evidence for a direct role of DNA methylation in the repression of FSHD candidate genes has never been provided.</p><p>D4Z4 is extremely GC rich (73% as opposed to 42% of the average human genome-wide GC content) <xref rid="pone.0115278-Hewitt1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and displays an unusually high CpG dinucleotide frequency (10% compared to the average human genome frequency of 1%) <xref rid="pone.0115278-Jabbari1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Since each D4Z4 unit contains 325 CpGs and in healthy subjects up to 100 D4Z4 repeats are present, the FSHD locus represents one of the more extended CpG islands of the human genome <xref rid="pone.0115278-Neguembor1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. For this reason, D4Z4 is an attractive candidate for regulation by DNA methylation, a major mechanism of epigenetic repression occurring predominantly in the context of CpG dinucleotides and carried out by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) protein family <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cedar1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Unfortunately, the study of DNA methylation at 4q35 is complicated by the fact that D4Z4&#x02013;like sequences are present in several other chromosomes beside chromosome 4 <xref rid="pone.0115278-Lyle1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In particular, as a result of an ancient duplication, the subtelomere of chromosome 10q contains a repeat array with 98% identity to D4Z4 <xref rid="pone.0115278-vanGeel1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. To investigate specifically DNA methylation at 4q35, all studies so far have used Methyl Sensitive Restriction Analysis (MSRA) <xref rid="pone.0115278-Fraga1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Using this approach, only 3 CpG dinucleotides within the 325 CpGs present in each D4Z4 unit were analyzed. By this approach, it has been shown that D4Z4 is highly methylated in healthy subjects and significantly hypomethylated in FSHD patients <xref rid="pone.0115278-Hartweck1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115278-deGreef2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-vanOverveld2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-deGreef3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Recently, using Sodium Bisulfite sequencing <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, 74 CpGs of D4Z4 have been investigated in FSHD2 patients, confirming the D4Z4 hypo-methylation in the disease <xref rid="pone.0115278-Hartweck1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. While these studies strongly suggest a role for DNA methylation in FSHD, they were severely limited in their coverage of the FSHD locus. Moreover, a functional role for DNA methylation in the control of FSHD candidate genes is still missing.</p><p>Here, we characterized a cellular model to selectively study the epigenetic status of the human FSHD locus in 4q35. Using this model, we investigated DNA methylation for the majority of the CpGs inside D4Z4 at single nucleotide level. We found extensive variability in DNA methylation along the D4Z4 repeat, spanning the entire range from 0 to 100 percent methylation and irrespectively of CpG density. Moreover, we discovered opposite methylation patterns for different D4Z4 units of the array. Finally, we found strong cooperation between DNA methylation and histone de-acetylation in the repression of FSHD candidate genes. These results provide novel targets for the development of possible therapeutic approaches aimed at normalizing candidate gene expression to treat FSHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genomic DNA purification and Bisulfite conversion</title><p>Cell pellets were carefully resuspended in 300 ul of TE per 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> of cells.

This severely limits the possibility to obtain detailed information of the specific epigenetic status of the 4q35 region. Since D4Z4 is a primate-specific repeat <xref rid="pone.0115278-Clark1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, we exploited a commercially available human/rodent monochromosomal hybrid cell line containing, in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) background, a single human chromosome 4 with 27 D4Z4 units (located on a 4qB subtelomere) derived from a healthy subject (Chr4/CHO) <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Lemmers2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Considering that no much information regarding the epigenetics background of CHO cells is currently available, we decided, as a first step, to determine if the key epigenetic features of the FSHD locus in healthy subjects are maintained in Chr4/CHO cells. To this purpose, we performed a Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) survey of proteins and histone marks previously described at the FSHD locus in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Bodega1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Immunopurified material was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using several primer pairs spanning D4Z4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). One additional primer pair located in a region immediately proximal to the repeat array (p13E-11) was used as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). H3K9me3, HP1gamma and SMC3 (Cohesin Complex) were found enriched at D4Z4 in healthy subjects and significantly decreased in FSHD patients <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Nevertheless, this analysis has been conducted by qPCR with just one primer pair (Q-PCR in <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and D4 in our analysis). While we confirmed that H3K9me3, HP1gamma and Cohesin are all enriched over D4Z4 with respect to the region immediately proximal to the repeat array, we also found that they display different enrichment patterns along the repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g001">Fig. 1b&#x02013;1d</xref>). H3K9me3 is enriched at similar levels in all D4Z4 regions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>).

These results are in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the H3K9me3 density is not sufficient to recruit HP1gamma and Cohesin to D4Z4. Indeed, it has been shown that an additional factor, which may be expressed in a cell type-specific manner, is required for HP1gamma and Cohesin binding to D4Z4 and that they depend on each other for their recruitment to D4Z4 <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0115278-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115278.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Chr4/CHO cells recapitulate the epigenetic status present at the FSHD locus in healthy subjects.</title><p>ChIP survey for repressive and actives marks as well as enzymes present inside D4Z4.

Nevertheless, we obtained several unexpected findings. In the different regions analyzed, we found highly variable methylation levels (spanning the entire range from 0 to 100%) that do not correlate with the density in CpGs. This suggests that, contrary to our expectation, D4Z4 is not a single uniformly repressive domain. Moreover, we found isolated, non-methylated CpGs embedded inside regions of highly methylated CpGs. It is tempting to speculate that these sites could represent entry points for DNA binding proteins relevant for the biology of D4Z4. Our analysis also supports the notion that in region B5 the D4Z4 array could be a mosaic with some D4Z4 unit displaying a euchromatic environment and other D4Z4 units presenting a heterochromatic environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>DNMTs and HDACs are selectively recruited to the FSHD locus</title><p>DNA methylation is carried out by members of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cedar1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.

Since loss of D4Z4 repeats leads to de-repression of FSHD candidate genes located on the 4q35 region <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cabianca2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, we hypothesized a direct role for DNMTs and HDACs in the transcriptional regulation of the FSHD region. To assess it, we first investigated the effect of downregulating the expression of DNMTs or HDACs by RNAi. Unfortunately, single depletion of the DNMTs or HDACs associated to D4Z4 was not sufficient to cause a significant alteration of FSHD candidate gene expression (data not shown); further supporting their redundant activity at 4q35. To test this hypothesis, we used small molecule inhibitors to obtain a specific but general ablation of either DNMTs or HDACs activity. Specifically, we used 5&#x02032;-Aza-2&#x02032;deoxycytidine (AZA) also know as Decitabine, a chemical analogue of cytosine which is incorporated into DNA during DNA replication <xref rid="pone.0115278-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.

Thus, we used a rodent/human monochromosomal hybrid containing one human chromosome 4 derived from a healthy donor (Chr4/CHO) as the only human counterpart.

Accordingly, RNAi mediated knockdown of SUV39H1 translated into a reduction in H3K9me3 in HeLa cells <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Heterochromatin binding protein HP1 is usually associated to transcriptional silencing and is recruited by methylated H3K9 <xref rid="pone.0115278-Lachner1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. HP1 gamma binds to D4Z4 in healthy subjects and its enrichment at D4Z4 is reduced following H3K9me3 loss in FSHD patients <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In Chr4/CHO cells, we found a selective enrichment on D4Z4 for H3K9me3, HP1gamma and Cohesin (protein found associated to D4Z4 <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Therefore, together with previous results <xref rid="pone.0115278-Cabianca1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, our data indicates that Chr4/CHO cells faithfully recapitulate a number of epigenetic features previously described at the endogenous FSHD locus in healthy subjects.

Unfortunately, this approach presents several limitations as: the need of high amounts of gDNA, the requirement of specific probes for Southern analysis and the availability of informative restriction sites inside the region of interest. The above limitations and the presence of multiple D4Z4-like repeats in the human genome restricted the analysis of DNA methylation at D4Z4 by MSRA to only 3 out of the 325 CpGs inside the repeat <xref rid="pone.0115278-deGreef1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0115278-vanOverveld1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-vanOverveld2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Recently, an additional study used bisulfite sequencing but investigated only 74 CpGs in FSHD2 patients <xref rid="pone.0115278-Hartweck1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Instead, by combining Chr4/CHO cells and bisulfite sequencing, we were able to analyze 219 out of the 325 CpG dinucleotides located inside each D4Z4 unit. While confirming D4Z4 hypermethylation, we found that DNA methylation is not uniformly distributed inside the repeats and that it does not correlate with the density of CpGs. For example, we found that region B1 displays a very low methylation level on average compared to the other regions analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g002">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115278.s001">S1</xref>). This suggests the existence of mechanisms that could shield from methylation regions of functional relevance. ChIP experiments indicate that all three main DNMTs (Dnmt1, Dnmt3A and Dnmt3b) are specifically enriched at D4Z4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), consistent with a redundant role for these enzymes at D4Z4. Since we did not found any significant correlation between the profile of DNMTs enrichment and the level of DNA methylation, it seems unlikely that the differential methylation of different D4Z4 regions is due to a differential recruitment of specific DNMTs. On the other end, nucleosome positioning could influence DNA methylation patterns throughout the genome <xref rid="pone.0115278-Bartke1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and DNMTs appear to have nucleosome-bound DNA as a preferential target <xref rid="pone.0115278-Bartke1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Hence, a relevant issue to be investigated in the future is whether the differential methylation inside D4Z4 correlates with the location of nucleosomes inside the repeat.</p><p>Another interesting finding from our bisulfite sequencing analysis is the identification of four individual CpGs (regions B1, B3, B4 and B7) that are never methylated even if they are surrounded by CpGs that are methylated in 100% of the clones analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115278-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). It has been previously reported that transcription factor binding causes reduced methylation at the actual binding motif <xref rid="pone.0115278-Stadler1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Accordingly, we found a single CpG dinucleotide with 0% methylation inside region B4 that corresponds to the binding site of the transcription factor YY1. YY1 is required for repression of FSHD candidate genes in healthy subjects <xref rid="pone.0115278-Gabellini2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and its DNA binding is inhibited by DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0115278-Kim2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Sekimata1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Based on this, it is tempting to speculate that the single unmethylated CpGs inside regions B1, B3 and B7 underscore binding sites for yet to be discovered DNA binding proteins regulating the activity of D4Z4. This justifies future studies correlating transcription factors recruitment to D4Z4 with its epigenetic status.</p><p>CpG methylation at promoter regions has been traditionally considered a potent silencing mechanism that blocks binding of transcription factors. On the contrary, it has recently been shown that several transcription factors recognize selectively methylated sequences or sequences different from their known consensus sequence when the DNA is methylated, at least in vitro <xref rid="pone.0115278-Hu1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Therefore, a number of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins may bind and regulate the activity of different D4Z4 units according to their DNA methylation levels.</p><p>Beside single non-methylated CpGs, we also found evidence of differentially methylated D4Z4 repeat units. The various D4Z4 units of the array are nearly identical. There are few SNPs that allow distinguishing the first, most proximal unit from internal units, however they are erased upon bisulfite conversion. Thus, the information obtained by bisulfite sequencing is an &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; of the DNA methylation status for the different D4Z4 units of the array. Interestingly, for region B5, bisulfite sequencing identified either non-methylated or fully methylated clones. Considering that in bisulfite sequencing several independent PCR clones are sequenced, the black or white results for region B5 could belong to different D4Z4 units. This suggests the co-existence of hypo- and hyper-methylated D4Z4 units, at least for the region covered by primers B5. Moreover, ChIP-re-ChIP experiments with anti-H3K4me2 and anti-H3K9me3 antibodies also identified heterogeneity in the different D4Z4 units <xref rid="pone.0115278-Zeng1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

On the other hand, DNA methylation may also influence the maintenance of histone modifications through cell division, since it has been proposed that methylcytosine-binding proteins such as methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) recruit HDACs to methylated regions <xref rid="pone.0115278-Nan1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0115278-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0115278-g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0115278.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Model for DNMTs and HDACs contribution in 4q35 gene repression.</title><p>Healthy individuals carrying from 11 to 100 D4Z4 units display a high enrichment for DNMTs and HDACs, redundantly contributing to the repressive environment of the FSHD locus.

Through the use of bisulfite sequencing, we were able to provide single nucleotide information of the methylation status for most of D4Z4 CpGs dinucleotides. While confirming previous results, we also found that DNA methylation is non-homogeneous inside D4Z4. In particular, we identified CpGs that are never methylated located inside a context of fully methylated CpGs and found evidence that the D4Z4 repeat array could be a mixture of euchromatic and heterochromatic repeats. These features could be involved in differential recruitment of regulatory factors to the FSHD region and in the regulation of <italic>DUX4</italic> alternative splicing. Altogether, our studies elucidate additional layers in the regulation of the epigenetic landscape of the FSHD locus and the expression of 4q35 genes identifying novel potential therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0115278.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>
