</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Obligate intracellular pathogens Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis are major clinical and public health concerns, and cause pneumonia [1,2] and the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide [3,4], respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although C. pneumoniae is also associated with chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma [5] and atherosclerosis [2], its etiological role remains to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Chlamydiae undergo a unique biphasic developmental cycle, with a morphological change between the elemental body (EB), which is an infectious form, and reticulate body (RB), which is a replicative form, into the surrounding plasma membrane, the so-called inclusion membrane [6-8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>To complete their developmental cycle, chlamydiae utilize the type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate several effector proteins across the inclusion membrane [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence from experiments with Shigella or Salmonella have shown that T3SS effectors play a critical role in bacterial invasion and maturation, and maintenance of host cell viability, which is directly related to bacterial pathogenesis [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Although several chlamydial T3SS effectors such as translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (TARP) [12], inclusion membrane protein A (IncA) [13], and chlamydial outer protein N (CopN) [14] have been documented, mechanisms of host cell manipulation evoked by these effectors remain to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Gram-negative bacterial T3SS is a complex of multiple proteins including tip, needle, rod and plug proteins, and ATPase [15], and the effector proteins translocating across the plasma membrane are strictly regulated by the plug proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For instance, MxiC, a plug protein of Shigella flexneri, regulates effector secretion [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The activation of Yersinia T3SS effector secretion is controlled by YopN/TyeA as a plug complex of Yersinia T3SS in response to extracellular calcium and/or contact with eukaryotic cells [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Also, translocation of some plug proteins such as YopN or MxiC into eukaryotic host cells has been documented [16,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, these bacterial plug molecules, possibly with effector function, have a central role into controlling T3SS effector secretion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Recent work has shown that chlamydial CopN, which is homologous to YopN and MxiC but with low similarity, is a T3SS plug protein, and is secreted by a Yersinia type III apparatus [14,21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Also, CopN domain structure analysis using gel filtration assay with His-tagged recombinant proteins has revealed that CopN binds to tubulin, which prevents microtubule assembly [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid analysis has shown the essential role of the CopN effector protein in C. pneumoniae intracellular growth [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings support that chlamydial CopN has a critical role as a T3SS plug with effector function in the chlamydial host manipulation system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Whether the CopN targets tubulin alone remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>To optimize the intracellular niche for their propagation, chlamydiae utilize several T3SS effector proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Several chlamydial T3SS effectors including TARP [12], IncA [13] and CopN [14] have been reported with detailed protein structures, and these provide hints for elucidating how chlamydiae manipulate host cells, resulting in successful adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>CopN effector is well conserved among chlamydiae, functioning both as the T3SS plug and a secreted effector protein [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The effector protein is responsible for a central role in chlamydial adaptation to host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have elegantly demonstrated that CopN manipulates host cells, causing mitotic arrest [33], and that CopN interacts with tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>However, whether the CopN targets tubulin alone remains undetermined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>In this work, we therefore attempted to find previously unidentified chlamydial CopN effector targets in host cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The CopN protein family, which functions as T3SS plug proteins with effector functions, is strictly conserved with weak sequence homology to chlamydiae and other Gram-negative bacteria [9], and the sequence similarity of CopNs used for this study was 48% (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>To identify the host proteins that interact with chlamydial CopN, we performed a pull-down assay with GST-fused recombinant CopN proteins (C. pneumoniae: GST–CpCopN, C. trachomatis: GST–CtCopN) and HEp-2 cell lysates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Coomassie brilliant blue staining revealed that unrelated contaminants in the recombinant fractions were minimal in purified GST-fused protein fractions (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>As a result, a specific band with ~40-kDa molecular size was detected in the eluted pull-down fraction with GST–CpCopN, but not in that with GST–Ctr CopN or GST alone (Figure 1C, arrowhead). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>It was a possible candidate for CopN target molecule, thus, the band cut out from the gel was analyzed by nano-LC/MS/MS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>As a result, MS revealed two distinct eukaryotic proteins to be aldolase A, which is involved in glycolytic metabolism, and lancC-like protein, which is a lanthionine synthetase component (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>The peptide hit numbers and coverage against aldolase A were significantly high compared with those for lancC-like protein (Figure 2A); therefore, we concluded that GST–CpCopN target protein might be a glycolytic enzyme, aldolase A. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Recent work has shown that multifunctional glycolytic enzymes including aldolase A have so-called “moonlight functions” [35,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>For example, it is well known that aldolase A binds to F-actin [37], and this binding step is important for secondary moonlight functions, such as vesicle trafficking [37], or cell motility [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, aldolase A sequesters WASP and affects WASP/Arp2/3 complex associating with actin remodeling [39,40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>WASP/Scar proteins stimulated by Rho family small GTPases in turn activate the Arp2/3 complex to create new actin filaments [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>More importantly, a recent study has indicated that caspase-1 digestome senses fragmented glycolytic enzymes, including aldolase A, digested in infected cells, resulting in cell death; a novel host defense system [42]. </plain></SENT>
