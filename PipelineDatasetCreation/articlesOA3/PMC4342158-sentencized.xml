</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Molecular hydrogen has great potential as a clean energy vector given its pollution-free combustion and the ease with which it can be converted into electricity via fuel cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, current industrial hydrogen production processes, such as steam reforming of natural gas, release large quantities of CO2 and thereby contribute substantially to the greenhouse effect [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Consequently, scientific interest in recent years has focused on alternative methods of hydrogen production, in particular on the use of photosynthetic and fermentative microorganisms for CO2-neutral H2 production from renewable energy sources, such as solar energy and biomass [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a major challenge when using microorganisms for H2 production is the low yield generally obtained, with typical mesophilic fermentation of carbohydrates supplying only 10 to 20% of the H2 potentially available in the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Consequently, research in the field of metabolic engineering has investigated different approaches with a view to optimising the yield of well-characterised biohydrogen production pathways [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>However, such strategies require a thorough and detailed understanding of the relationships between genome content, gene expression patterns, pathway utilisation and metabolite synthesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In dark anaerobic fermentation microorganisms break down carbohydrate-rich substrates into organic acids and alcohols while releasing H2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Strict anaerobes such as clostridia have been the most widely studied among the various anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria capable of fermentative hydrogen production [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>H2 production in living organisms is always dependent on the presence of H2-producing enzymes such as hydrogenases and nitrogenases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>[FeFe] hydrogenases, which are especially abundant in clostridia, are well recognised as the main H2-producing enzymes in this genus [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>By contrast, nitrogenase-mediated hydrogen production has never been proposed for clostridia, even though this is known to be an intrinsic metabolic property of many cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in 1960 Carnahan showed that the free-living soil microorganism Clostridium pasteurianum is an efficient N2 fixator [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Later nif operons were described in C. acetobutylicum and C. beijerinckii [8], but the contribution of nitrogenase to overall H2 production in clostridia has not yet been reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Clostridium butyricum CWBI 1009, a strain recently isolated from an anaerobic sludge, was previously shown to ferment different carbon substrates at acidic pH to H2 and CO2 with formate, butyrate and acetate as the main end-products [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It possesses four different [FeFe] hydrogenases, three of which are monomeric belonging to clusters A2, B2 and B3, and one which is a trimeric enzyme representing cluster A8 [6,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that optimum growth for this bacterium occurs at pH 7.3, it only starts to produce H2 when the pH declines due to the natural acidification of the medium as fermentation proceeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The optimal pH value to produce H2 under fixed-pH culture conditions was found to be 5.2 and has been discussed in previous work [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Although many studies have described the fermentative activity of C. butyricum associated with H2 production [12,13], a comprehensive analysis of the fermentative pathways at the genomic and proteomic levels has not yet been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Relative gene expression profiles, together with the associated proteomic and metabolite data, can now be used to provide the visibility needed for well-targeted metabolic engineering. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a better understanding of the shifts in gene and protein expression, which occur in response to pH changes and during the growth phase, should facilitate the optimisation of bioreactor performance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study three parallel approaches were used to investigate the changes at the molecular level associated with pH-dependent hydrogen production in C. butyricum CWBI 1009, namely metabolite analysis, transcriptomics and proteomics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The effect of the naturally decreasing pH was studied with glucose in 20-L batch bioreactors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the effect of fixed-pH fermentations was evaluated to provide comparative data under optimal pH conditions for cellular growth (pH 7.3) and H2 production (pH 5.2), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The genome of C. butyricum CWBI 1009, which was unknown until now, was also sequenced to provide better mapping of the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) reads during natural acidification of the medium. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The genome of C. butyricum CWBI 1009 was also sequenced to provide better mapping of the RNA-seq reads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The RNA-seq data were obtained from rRNA-depleted mRNA samples isolated from two independent reactor cultures (biological replicates). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The selection of these values was based on the fact that pH 7.3 and 6.3 corresponded respectively to the minimum and maximum H2 production phases of the three fermentations without pH regulation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Secondly, both hydB2 and hydB3 are very strongly up-regulated at fixed pH 5.2 versus fixed pH 7.3; however, the basal expression level of hydB2 at fixed pH 5.2 was around five times higher than that for hydB3 (Figure 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Of particular interest also is the observation that during the unregulated-pH fermentation the basal expression levels of the four [FeFe] hydrogenase coding genes were lower than their expression levels at fixed pH 5.2 (10 h incubation, late exponential growth phase, Figure 4B and Figure 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>For the two fixed-pH fermentations the expression level of the nifH gene was similar (Figure 6C), and was significantly lower than during the unregulated-pH glucose fermentation (Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>A Western blot analysis carried out on samples corresponding to the different fermentation stages for both fixed-pH cultures gave no positive signal for the NifH subunit (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that in contrast to the unregulated-pH glucose fermentation, where a strong up-regulation of nitrogenase genes was observed, H2 production at fixed pH 5.2 may be essentially hydrogenase-mediated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>To better understand the phenomenon of possibly differential nitrogenase- and hydrogenase-mediated H2 production in clostridia under different pH conditions, further investigation is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the genetic elements for the transcriptional control of the nif operon have not yet been well defined in clostridia [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate about the significance of the differential carbon metabolisms (Figure 1G and I) observed for fermentation under unregulated- pH compared with fermentation under fixed pH 5.2 condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>This may be an indication of metabolic adaptations affecting the H2-producing enzymes, thereby leading to distinct H2 production profiles (Figure 1D and F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has recently been shown that the nitrogenase-mediated H2 evolution in a photoheterotrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides was enhanced by ethanol [35,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Oh et al. [36] reported a 60% increase in H2 production in the presence of ethanol in the ammonium-containing medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the authors showed that the increased nitrogenase activity was regulated at the level of nifHDK transcription and that ethanol was not used as a carbon source by the bacterium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Though the study discusses another type of bacterium, it can be compared with the unregulated-pH fermentation in our study, where both an increase in the production of ethanol and transcription of nif genes were detected and were concurrent with a higher H2 production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>In contrast, during fixed pH 5.2 glucose fermentation, where no ethanol production was observed, the expression level of nifH was significantly lower as well. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there are still unresolved questions concerning the metabolic fluxes and regulations in clostridia that need to be studied before a more grounded hypothesis can be made, especially as our study is the first to suggest, based on transcriptional analysis, a putative involvement of nitrogenase to the overall H2 production in this bacterial genus. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a biomolecular overview of the changes occurring when the metabolism of C. butyricum CWBI 1009 shifts to H2 production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>The results show that the cellular metabolism for all the tested metabolites varied under all conditions and was pH dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>The primary soluble metabolites were formate, acetate and butyrate, followed by ethanol and lactate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The highest H2 yield (1.78 ± 0.11 mol H2/mol glucose) was in accordance with previous studies with the same strain [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Further investigations into the genomic/proteomic changes associated with naturally decreasing pH and with H2 production indicated the differential regulation of numerous genes/proteins; some were known to be directly associated with H2 production (for example, hydrogenases and pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>However the up-regulation of others, such as those involved in N2 assimilation, were more surprising, since H2 production in clostridia has never before been described as nitrogenase-mediated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>As the transcription levels of the [FeFe] hydrogenases and the nitrogenase coding genes varied significantly between different fermentations, transcriptional analyses indicated the need for further biochemical characterisation of the H2-producing enzymes, especially for the [FeFe] hydrogenases HydA8, B2 and B3, which have not yet been studied [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the identification of multiple hypothetical genes/proteins (Additional file 2: Table S4) that were differentially regulated suggests that other unknown mechanisms may be governing H2 production in clostridia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>This could therefore be fertile ground for future studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>This work contributes to the field of dark fermentative hydrogen production by providing a multidisciplinary approach for the investigation of the processes involved in the molecular H2 metabolism of clostridia, which could in time lay the groundwork for further optimisation based on genetic engineering techniques [3]. </plain></SENT>
