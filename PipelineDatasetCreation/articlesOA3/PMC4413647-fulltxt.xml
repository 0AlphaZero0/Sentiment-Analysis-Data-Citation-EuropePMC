In this study, we report that our <italic>Novel Retinamides</italic> (NRs) target both AR signaling and eIF4E translation in androgen sensitive and castration resistant PCa cells via enhancing AR and MNK degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Dual blockade of AR and MNK initiated eIF4E activation by NRs in turn induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation. NRs also inhibited cell migration and invasion in metastatic cells. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of NRs on AR signaling, eIF4E translation initiation and subsequent oncogenic program were more potent than that observed with clinically relevant retinoids, established MNK inhibitors, and the FDA approved PCa drugs. Our findings provide the first preclinical evidence that simultaneous inhibition of AR and eIF4E activation is a novel and efficacious therapeutic approach for PCa, and that NRs hold significant promise for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>androgen receptor</kwd><kwd>eIF4E</kwd><kwd>MNK</kwd><kwd>novel retinamides</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Androgen receptor (AR), a ligand dependent transcription factor plays pivotal role in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa), the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous male malignancy [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While majority of prostate cancers are initially androgen dependent and respond to androgen ablation therapy, most patients eventually recur with more aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) where AR signaling is reactivated even in the absence of androgen stimulation [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Besides AR signaling, hyper-activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the mRNA 5&#x02032; cap-binding protein of cap dependent translation promotes exquisite transcript-specific translation of key mRNAs that are indispensable in PCa initiation, progression and metastases [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is dependent on serine 209 phosphorylation by MAPK-interacting kinases 1/2 (MNK1/2) [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Overexpression of MNK and hyper-activation of eIF4E are common in hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate tumors and correlates with poor clinical outcome [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Analysis of the molecular networks in androgen dependent and independent PCa has revealed direct targeting of the translational machinery, precisely eIF4E to be beneficial in the treatment of CRPC [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, a strong rationale exists for identifying new drugs that can simultaneously target both AR and eIF4E for treating advanced PCa.</p><p>Retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBA), a family of compounds that inhibit the P450 enzyme(s) responsible for the metabolism of all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (ATRA) exert potent anticancer and growth inhibitory effects in human breast/prostate cancer cells and xenograft models [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Series of RAMBA related compounds referred to as &#x0201c;Novel Retinamides&#x0201d; (NRs) which are novel structural analogues of ATRA and 4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR) have been designed and synthesized in our laboratory [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that these NRs inhibit the growth of triple negative, estrogen receptor alpha (ER-&#x003b1;) and Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells by blocking MNK initiated eIF4E activation [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, we explored the effect of NRs to simultaneously target AR signaling and MNK activated eIF4E translation initiation in androgen sensitive and CRPC cells. Our data reveal that NRs are capable of inhibiting the growth and progression of PCa by directly targeting both AR signaling and eIF4E translational machinery via enhancing AR and MNK degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which in turn led to inhibition of downstream events that promote cell growth, proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis evasion, invasion and metastasis. Our findings establish for the first time that agents such as NRs, which simultaneously inhibit activation of both AR and eIF4E to suppress growth and progression in genetically diverse PCa cells at pharmacologically feasible concentration, are novel therapeutics for treatment of both androgen-sensitive and castration resistant PCa.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Novel retinamides inhibit growth and colony formation in PCa cells</title><p>To determine the effect of NRs on PCa cell growth, androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and -insensitive (PC-3, C4-2B) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells were treated with NRs (VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -146, -147, -148, -152, -153), VN/14-1, ATRA, 4-HPR, Casodex, Abiraterone acetate (AA) (Zytiga) and MDV3100 (Enzalutamide) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and assessed for cell viability by MTT assay. We found that NRs, particularly VNLG-145, -147, -152 and -153 inhibited the growth of PCa cells with a GI<sub>50</sub> value 1.5 - 5.5 &#x003bc;mol/L (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1 and 2</xref>). The growth inhibitory potential of these NRs were more potent than that observed for VN/66-1, our previously established lead RAMBA; VN/14-1, the parent RAMBA from which the new NR series (VNLG-145, -146, -147, -148, -152, -153) were derived; clinically relevant retinoids (ATRA and 4-HPR) and almost comparable to that of the FDA approved PCa drugs (Casodex, AA, MDV3100). Our results also indicated that the growth inhibitory effect of NRs in PCa cells was significantly much higher (12-30 fold) compared to that in immortalized untransformed prostate cells signifying that NRs are differentially sensitive towards untransformed and malignant prostate cells. The other NRs (VNLG-146 and -148) did not display any notable growth inhibitory effect or differential sensitivity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Analysis of the effect of NRs on colony forming ability of PCa cells, indicated that lead NRs in addition to inhibiting cell viability were also able to inhibit PCa colony formation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A and B</xref>).</p><p>We next evaluated the growth inhibitory potential of NRs, specifically VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -147, -152, -153 that showed promising growth and colonization inhibitory potential in prostate cancer cells in comparison with casodex, AA and MDV3100 in LNCaP cells that were resistant to MDV3100 treatment (MR49F). Our results revealed that NRs significantly inhibited the growth of these resistant cells with a GI<sub>50</sub> value &#x02245; 3.5 &#x02013; 7.5 &#x003bc;mol/L, which was several times more potent than that observed for the FDA approved drugs Casodex or AA (GI<sub>50</sub>: 43.65 and 27.54 &#x003bc;mol/L respectively). We also note that Enzalutamide had no significant effect up to a concentration of 100 &#x003bc;mol/L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait"

Additionally, LNCaP cells were treated with VNLG-147/-152 in the presence or absence of pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD (5 &#x003bc;M, 24 h) to confirm whether apoptosis induction by NRs was caspase mediated. Our results showed that combined treatment of ZVAD completely suppressed NRs induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>) and PARP-1 cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) confirming that NRs induced apoptosis via the caspase-dependent pathway.</p><p>We also evaluated the inhibitory effects of NRs on cell invasion and migration- the late stage carcinogenic events in the metastatic PCa cell line, PC-3 by wound-healing and trans-well invasion assays [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We found that 24 h after cell monolayers were wounded control cells had completely filled in the scratched area. Whereas incubation of PC-3 cells with NRs, in particular VNLG-147, -152 and -153 at concentration of 5 &#x003bc;M for 24 h potentially suppressed PC-3 cell migration to the denuded zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), revealing that NRs potentially inhibit the motility of PC-3 cells. To further elucidate the inhibitory effect of NRs on the invasion of PC-3 cells across extracellular matrix (ECM), the cells that invaded through the matrigel coated polycarbonate filter in the Boyden chamber were analyzed. Our results showed that NRs treatment (5 &#x003bc;M) for 24 h profoundly suppressed invasion of PC-3 cells across the matrigel-coated filter. The percentage of cell invasion was 33, 13 and 35 for VNLG-147, -152 and -153, respectively compared to control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B and C</xref>). In addition, lead NRs were also able to modulate the expression of E- and N-cadherin, the key players in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).

The efficiency of transfection was confirmed by western blot analysis, wherein protein lysates obtained from the transfected cells after AR siRNA transfection showed a temporal decrease in total AR protein and cells transfected with MNK1 siRNA showed a temporal decrease in the expression of both MNK1 and peIF4E compared to scrambled (siSCR) treated controls after 18 h of transfection. Cells co-treated with AR and MNK1 siRNA showed a remarkable decrease in the expression of both AR and MNK1 compared to scrambled siRNA treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). MTT assay revealed that transient transfections with AR or MNK1 siRNA alone for 18 h caused a considerable decrease (&#x02248; 30%) in LNCaP cell viability compared to control (compare lane 1 to lanes 2 and 3). Co-transfection of LNCaP cells with both AR and MNK1 siRNA (compare lanes 1 and 4) further augmented loss of viability in LNCaP cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells (untransfected) with VNLG-152 (5 &#x003bc;M) for 72 h showed a robust reduction in cell viability (lane 5). LNCaP cells harboring MNK1 (lane 6) or AR (lane 7) knockdown also displayed a significant decrease in cell viability upon treatment with VNLG-152 compared to the MNK1 and AR siRNA alone treated counterparts (lane 2 and 3, respectively). However, LNCaP cells with double knockdown of AR and MNK1 genes (lane 8) did not show any significant decrease in cell viability upon VNLG-152 treatment compared to lane 4, which was co-treated with MNK1 and AR siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

However, in the case of MNK2, though VNLG-152 exerted a dose-dependent decline maximal effect was observed only at 20 &#x003bc;M concentration. Besides MNKs and AR, a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of cell cycle regulatory cyclin D1 and increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase was also observed in LNCaP cells at the GI<sub>50</sub> concentration.

However, simultaneous targeting of AR signaling and MNK facilitated eIF4E activation- the major signaling pathways involved in PCa development, progression, and transition from androgen dependence to androgen resistant form, to develop proof-of-concept small molecule inhibitors as potential PCa therapeutics has not yet been shown [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that our proprietary novel retinamides can simultaneously inhibit both AR signaling and MNK facilitated eIF4E translation initiation and impede growth and progression of in androgen dependent (LNCaP) and castration resistant (C4-2B, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cells. Most interestingly, NRs also block AR expression, activity and cell growth in cells that are resistant to enzalutamide treatment. Our data collectively suggest that NRs may be promising novel therapeutics for patients with advanced prostate cancer and those resistant to enzalutamide treatment.</p><p>Androgen-AR signaling has a critical role in prostate cancer development and progression in part through transcriptional regulation of AR responsive genes [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Earlier studies have validated that AR splice variants, especially the most dominant variant AR3 which lacks a portion of ligand binding domain contributes to the transition of prostate cancer from androgen dependent to castration resistance. While constitutively active AR3 might itself facilitate PCa cell growth and progression, it may even depend on full-length AR to execute AR transcriptional activity and cell growth effects [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, NRs treatment downregulated the expression of full-length AR (in LNCaP, C4-2B and 22Rv1); splice variant AR3 (in 22Rv1); and the AR responsive protein, PSA in genetically diverse PCa cells. Furthermore, NRs also dramatically reduced DHT induced AR transcriptional activation in LNCaP and MR49F, the enzalutamide resistant LNCaP cells. In mechanistic studies identifying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR down-regulation in LNCaP cells, treatment with protein synthesis inhibitor did not have any effect on VNLG-152 induced AR down-regulation, whereas the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 largely restored VNLG-152 induced AR decrease. Knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, CHIP or MDM2 individually or in combination abrogated VNLG-152 mediated fAR degradation, suggesting that NR (VNLG-152) mediated AR down-regulation in LNCaP cells involved degradation of the active AR protein via proteasomal degradation through the activation of E3 ubiquitin ligases CHIP and MDM2. Our finding that AR is degraded through CHIP is consistent with the degradation of nuclear receptors where ubiquitination has been demonstrated to signal receptor degradation [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Involvement of MDM2 in promoting AR ubiquitination and degradation has also been reported in a number of studies [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Lin <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that AR ubiquitination is impaired in MDM2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to MDM2-intact MEFs. Although our work confirms a role for MDM2 and CHIP in degrading AR, the primary E3 ligase responsible for degrading AR in response to VNLG-152 and the molecular mechanisms underlying their preference are not fully understood.</p><p>In addition to AR signaling, the role of MNK mediated cap dependent translation in PCa development and progression has been established in recent years [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initiation of cap dependent translation primarily involves the assembly of eIF4F initiation complex comprising of eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A on the 5&#x02032; cap of mRNA [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Of all the members of the translation initiation complex, eIF4E expression and activity is considered crucial as this is the only protein that binds directly to the mRNA cap structure [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Indeed, overexpression of eIF4E alone has been shown to contribute directly to cellular transformation [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The transforming properties of eIF4E have been linked to its ability to promote translation of genes involved in proliferation and survival including that of c-Myc, cyclin D1, growth factors (fibroblast growth factor 2, FGF2 and vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and Mcl-1 [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is sternly dependent on phosphorylation at serine 209 residue by MNK1/2 which increase the affinity of eIF4E for 5&#x02032; cap of mRNA.4 Both MNK and p-eIF4E are found to be up-regulated in various cancers [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Bianchini <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that eIF4E phosphorylation by MNKs supports protein synthesis, cell cycle progression and proliferation in prostate cancer. Furthermore combined deficiency of MNK1 and 2 has been demonstrated to delay tumour development [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, NRs treatment dramatically reduced the expression of MNK1, MNK2, and peIF4E<sup>ser209</sup> without affecting total eIF4E expression. Notably, the effect of NRs in depleting MNKs and peIF4E proteins was far potent than the established MNK inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380) and clinically relevant retinoids-ATRA and 4-HPR.</p><p>Dissection of the molecular mechanism underlying lead NR (VNLG-152) mediated MNK and peIF4E down-regulation indicated that VNLG-152 stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MNKs, the critical activators of eIF4E. Degradation of MNKs by VNLG-152 may abrogate MNK mediated phosphorylation of eIF4E at serine209, which subsequently impairs its ability to enter the eIF4F initiation complex, binding to 5&#x02032; mRNA cap, and activation of cap-dependent translation initiation [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The results of the present work are consistent with the earlier report by Ramalingam <italic>et al</italic>. who demonstrated that NRs induce MNK degradation and block eIF4E phosphorylation in triple negative and Her2-overexpressing breast cancers.</p><p>Constitutive AR signaling and/or eIF4E mediated translation initiation favors translation of key genes involved in oncogenesis [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Abrogation of both these pathways may block translation of sub-set of genes indispensable for maintaining growth and survival in PCa cells. In the present study, the functional consequence of AR and MNK knockdown on LNCaP cell proliferation provides proof-of-principle for the importance of AR and MNK mediated signaling in upholding growth and survival of PCa cells, and also authenticates that AR and MNK are the prime target of NR (VNLG-152) for mediating growth inhibitory effects in PCa cells. The biological significance of NRs mediated dual inhibition of AR and MNK mediated signaling pathways is further indicated by enhanced cell death and inhibition of cell growth, cell colonization, migration and invasion in PCa cells. Several studies in the past have elicited a direct role of AR and eIF4E translation initiation in regulating cell cycle progression [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Blocking of AR expression has been demonstrated to induce strong cell cycle arrest [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Results from the present study also show that NRs induce cell cycle arrest at G1/S (VNLG-152) or G2/M (VNLG-145, -147, -153) phase with accompanied decrease in the expression of cyclin B and cyclin D1 that are associated with G1/S and M phase cell cycle transition. Besides inducing cell cycle arrest, NRs treatment also induced caspase dependent apoptosis in PCa cells through increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax. Our findings indicate that synchronized dual inhibition of AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation by NRs in PCa cells results in blockade of cell cycle progression and induction of caspase dependent apoptosis which is in line with the earlier reports that demonstrate that targeting AR or MNK in PCa cells results in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (19,37,38). In the highly metastatic PC-3 cells which are also AR negative, NRs treatment also impaired cell migration and invasion, the late stage events essential for tumour metastasis [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The anti-invasive and anti-migratory effects of NRs were associated with reappearance of E-cadherin and down-regulation in the levels of N-cadherin. Earlier, Graff et al. [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated that cells with reduced levels of eIF4E had reduced invasiveness and experimental metastasis. Similarly, Li et al. [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] showed that knockdown of eIF4E significantly inhibited invasion of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. These reports suggest that elevated eIF4E expression is a positive regulator of invasion, and that NRs inhibit migration and invasion, the late stage carcinogenic events in the AR negative PC-3 cells by impeding MNK dependent eIF4E translation initiation that is chiefly responsible for translation of various key genes associated with invasion and metastasis [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our study identi&#x0fb01;es for the first time novel retinamides that can simultaneously inhibit both AR signaling and MNK mediated eIF4E activation in prostate cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Most intriguingly, our proprietary NRs were able to block AR activation and cell growth in PCa cells resistant to Enzalutamide treatment. NRs also displayed inhibitory and anti-cancer effects in PCa cells in order far more potent than FDA approved PCa drugs, established MNK inhibitors and clinically relevant retinoids, with nominal effects on immortalized untransformed prostate cells. Collectively, these results suggest that novel retinamides that function as dual inhibitors of AR and MNK signaling in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant PCa have great potential as novel therapeutics for treatment of advanced prostate cancer.</p><fig id="F9" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the inhibition of AR signaling and MNK activated eIF4E cap-dependent translation by NRs</title><p>NRs stimulate AR degradation in LNCaP cells by promoting its proteasomal degradation through the CHIP or MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligases.

This event in turn inhibits phosphorylation of eIF4E at ser209 residue, subsequent formation of translation initiation complex and translation of key mRNAs critical for PCa development and progression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="oncotarget-06-3195-g009"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC-3) and castration resistant (C4-2B and 22Rv1) human prostate carcinoma cells were procured from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA and maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
