</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Evolutionary developmental biology (EVO-DEVO) studies how the dynamics of development affect the phenotypic variation arising from genetic variation and its correlation with phenotypic evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this subject there is a central issue: which is the most conserved period or the crucial section during the entire developmental process of an organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>While it is unarguable that the later stages of embryogenesis are not conserved among species, two major models have been proposed: the “funnel-like” model, in which the earliest embryo shows the most conserved pattern, and the “hourglass” model, in which the middle point of development is imposed with the most evolutionary constraints [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The “hourglass” model, which assumes the midembryonic stage (phylotypic), which shows developmental constraints and functional importance, was originally proposed due to the expression of Hox genes in middle point of vertebrate development [2] and has been preferred in comparative transcriptomic studies nowadays [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition to the transcriptomic similarity of phylotypic stages between different species, transcriptome age index (TAI) based methods, which address the total evolutionary ages of expressed genes in each developmental stage, show convergent evolution matching an hourglass pattern of embryogenesis in animals and plants [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Mammalian preimplantation embryonic development (PED) starts from fertilization and ends at implantation of the embryo in the endometrial lining of the uterus [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>After fertilization, the major genetic substances in the transcriptome of the zygote are the maternally deposited transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>After 2-3 rounds of cell divisions, maternally inherited transcripts are degraded gradually and new transcripts of zygote are produced by the new diploid nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This process is termed zygote genome activation (ZGA) [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These changes are not easily captured by traditional gene expression microarray techniques, as the sensitivity of microarray technology is limited when detecting low expressed genes or expression in a single cell [5, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>With the development of single cell RNA sequencing technology [10], we were able to identify precisely gene expression changes during the embryo developmental process which are unapparent in the microarray analysis [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In order to illustrate the earliest developmental gene expression fluctuation of PED which contain the crucial ZGA process and may further affect the later developmental stages, it is meaningful to look into these PED stages and identify the genetic modules regulating in each period of PED [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>From an EVO-DEVO viewpoint, inspection of the selective constrains in PED is interesting because the trend in this period would further influence the tendency of evolutionary constrains in the middle stages of embryo development such as the phylotypic stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of the expression profile of the PED stage, previous comparative transcriptome research has yet to characterize it [3, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The lack of understanding of these PED stages has led past researchers to conclude that selective constraints during the earlier developmental stages increase continuously in the “funnel-like” model while they decrease in the “hourglass” model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the selective constrains of genes in each PED stage could aid in distinguishing between the formation mechanism of the “hourglass” model or the “funnel-like” model and also consummate the whole pattern of selective constrains that act on embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Based on the single cell RNA sequencing results of human preimplantation embryos from the oocyte stage to late blastocyst stage [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Applying weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) [13], we were able to identify representative genes in each stage and summarized selective pressure on these genes to clarify the selective trend in earlier developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We found certain patterns of the evolutionary constraints that imposed on different stages of human preimplantation embryos; therefore we illustrated selective constraints on PED stages, which also presented fluctuation properties, considering that these earlier stages should be included for studying the constraints on the whole embryo development. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In the course of evolution, most biodiversity is due to alterations in gene regulation relationships rather than the sequence mutations on genes [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Coexpression gene modules tend to evolve together so as to share evolutionary patterns [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used gene coexpression analysis rather than differential expression to identify genes that may have close regulation relationships [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In order to study selective constrains in preimplantation embryonic development, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of human preimplantation embryos (including oocyte, zygote, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morulae, and late blastocyst stages) that were obtained by single cell RNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Stage-specific coexpression modules were selected by the gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) (Figure 1) which is an unsupervised clustering method to group genes which have coexpression patterns into distinct modules [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This is a reliable gene coexpression analysis tool and is wildly adopted by many investigators [17–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>After merging correlated modules with a stringent threshold, we assigned 27 out of 41 modules into a specific preimplantation developmental stage according to the correlation of eigengene of every module with each stage indicator (r &gt; 0.6, P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Some modules might correlate with two adjacent developmental stages because of the similarity of these two adjacent developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>To remove the bias of stage comparison, we assigned this kind of modules to stage in which they had the highest correlation coefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>After that, each module was classified into a specific developmental stage and most of the genes in each module showed consistent overexpressed behavior in corresponding developmental stage (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Genes in multiple modules of the same stage were merged together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In total, we obtained 2 coexpression modules for the oocyte stage, 1 module for the zygote stage, 1 module for the 2-cell stage, 5 modules for the 4-cell stage, 4 modules for the 8-cell stage, 5 modules for the morulae stage, and 9 modules for the late blastocyst stage (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>We obtained 1409, 583, 481, 1494, 1731, 1720, and 3132 specific genes for each stage, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The large number of genes in the oocyte showed a complicated regulation mechanism that involved the expression of maternal genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The number of coexpression modules and genes gradually increased with the progress of zygote development, which implied the formation of embryo complexity and modularity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology biological process (GOBP) enrichment analysis showed that genes from each stage were enriched in the relevant functions of corresponding developmental process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We also verified the function of genes in each stage by comparing them with the known function categories that were identified by Xue et al. on a different dataset of human preimplantation embryos [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The zygote gene activation (ZGA) process, which is the principal transformation of the pre-implantation period, was endorsed by significant overrepresentation of genes involved in transcription and transcription regulation process from 4-cell stage to morulae stage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Various Selective Pressures on Gene Sequence </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS) is a widely used method to measure gene sequence conservation [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We used dN/dS ratio for genes in each module to quantify the selective pressure on the corresponding developmental stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The dN/dS ratios were calculated between mouse and human, as we intended to measure the pressure acting on sequence of genes in the mammalian species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Then their distributions were illustrated in Figure 3(a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Next we randomly sampled same number genes within each stage and calculated the median of the dN/dS distribution for the random dataset, which stood for the background.  Figure 3(b) shows the median of dN/dS for genes in coexpression modules and the median of dN/dS for randomly selected genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The dN/dS ratios of stage-specific genes gradually decreased until the 4-cell stage, which may be caused by the consumption of the maternal genes and the expression of new genes of the zygote itself as shown by previous studies of preimplantation embryos [11, 12, 23–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Oocytes and zygotes had a higher median of dN/dS ratios relative to the median dN/dS for all genes whereas the dN/dS ratios of genes belonging to the 4-cell stage were significantly lower than the median dN/dS for all genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>From the zygote stage to the turning point 4-cell stage, the decreasing trend of dN/dS ratios was parallel with the process that the maternal genes expended and zygote genes emerged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The genes of the 4-cell stage were more inclined to be expressed by zygotes and had low dN/dS ratios. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>At the same time, genes regulated in the zygote or oocyte stages were left by maternal source and these genes had high dN/dS ratios. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>So the decreasing trend from maternity to zygote might suggest more striking selective pressure acting on the genes produced by zygote than selective pressure effecting genes inherited from maternity [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>After the 4-cell stage we detected a pattern of increasing dN/dS ratios, which shows these stages expressed genes with selective pressure not as strong as 4-cell stage. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Stage-Specific Genes Were Born in Different Ancient Roots </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The ages of stage-specific genes have been used as indices of evolutionary constraint [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We traced the root of every gene expressed in human preimplantation embryo in the phylogeny and used the ancient level of the root to represent the conservation of the gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Based on the phylogenetic taxonomy of their roots, genes were separated into four groups: (1) Opisthokonta-Bilateria, (2) Sarcopterygii-Amniota, (3) Chordata-Euteleostomi, and (4) Mammalia-Eutheria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>For each gene set, the number of genes in each of the 4 groups was calculated to represent the age distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Next we marked every preimplantation developmental stage with a specific age distribution and used the age distribution of all genes as background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To detect the difference of gene age during different development stages, the age distribution of genes in each stage was compared with the background distribution of all genes (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>We detected a clear changing trend for the Opisthokonta-Bilateria genes, with their proportion decreasing from the zygote to the 8-cell stage and then increasing until the late blastocyst. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In particular, the genes belonging to the 8-cell stage were significantly depleted in Opisthokonta-Bilateria and overrepresented in Mammalia-Eutheria, which implied most genes expressed in this stage are recently born in the Mammalia-Eutheria lineage compared to other stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In other words, these new genes, which were expressed and regulated as modules in 8-cell stage, were products of developmental evolution in the Mammalia-Eutheria lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This suggested that genes expressed in the 8-cell stage had a crucial function for the ZGA process of organism in Mammalia-Eutheria lineage [11, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>As Figure 3 shows, after the 8-cell stage there was an opposite trend of increasing Opisthokonta-Bilateria genes from depletion to overrepresentation and decreasing Mammalia-Eutheria genes from overrepresentation to depletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Finally the late blastocyst stage showed the opposite pattern—the stage was significantly depleted genes belonging to Mammalia-Eutheria and Chordata-Euteleostomi groups and it was overrepresented of genes in Opisthokonta-Bilateria group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This sort of opposite pattern illustrated that the late blastocyst stage was conserved as it tended to express the oldest genes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Genes in Each Stages Present Diverse Duplicated States </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Gene duplication state is also an indicator of selective pressure [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the conservation of genes more widely, we chose the zebra fish, an evolutionary distant species, as reference to check the gene-duplicated situation of human genes in each development stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Genes were separated into four groups based on the gene duplication states: (1) one-to-many, (2) one-to-one, (3) many-to-many, and (4) new gene (no ortholog in the zebra fish genome). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>We removed the many-to-many gene pairs because it is difficult to evaluate their conservation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>As stated above, we compared the observed distribution of genes in each stage with the expected distribution that was recorded by distributing all genes into these 3 groups (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Genes falling in one-to-many orthologs revealed that they were single copy in human and their orthologs had duplications in zebra fish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Knowing that constrained developmental stages should display less change in gene family size [31], the genes, which duplicate in other species but keep singleton in human developmental stages, should be considered to be conserved specifically in Homo sapiens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, the one-to-one orthologs retain the functions of ancestral gene since the last shared common ancestor, and left no duplication in the human or zebra fish lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Therefore genes of one-to-one orthologs also should be subject to functional constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Just as in the above age analysis of genes, the new genes, which were new products during the evolutionary process of Homo sapiens, were considered to be under less constraint. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>At last, many-to-many orthologs showed duplication events in both species and their conservation patterns were complicated; thus we ignored many-to-many orthologs in the further analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>As Figure 5(b) shows, the one-to-one (single-copy) orthologs and new genes exhibited opposite trends in the preimplantation period which implied the transformation of evolutionary constraints on different stages during the developmental process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In particular, the 4-cell stage showed significant depletion of the one-to-one genes but overrepresentation of the one-to-many genes that signify genes of this stage is under strong functional constraints on their sequence in Homo sapiens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>It accorded with the dN/dS result showing that genes expressed in the 4-cell stage had significantly lower human-mouse dN/dS ratios and lends further evidence to the hypothesis of conservation of genes belonging to the 4-cell stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the 8-cell stage showed overrepresentation of the newborn genes and depletion of the one-to-one genes, which is consistent with the gene age analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The large number of new genes in the 8-cell stage offers further evidence for human-specific embryonic development occurring in this stage [11, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>As with the above gene age analysis, we also detected conserved convergence from the 8-cell stage to late blastocyst stage reflected by the transition from an overrepresented state to a depleted state of the new genes and by the transition from depleted state to overrepresented state of the one-to-one genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Finally, the late blastocyst stage reached a conserved state, which was significantly depleted of new genes and overrepresented for one-to-one genes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Conservation of cis-regulatory sequences is also a critical standard for measuring the selective pressure on genes [14, 32], and highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) are often considered to be associated with developmental regulatory genes or transcription factors (TFs) [23, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we determined the transcriptional importance of stage-specific genes by analyzing their potential to become TFs and the distribution of HCNEs in their promoter regions (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>We found that promoter regions of genes in the 2-cell stage were significantly enriched for HCNEs, and there are more TFs in 2-cell stage than expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>These enriched transcriptional factors and transcriptional regulatory elements may promote effective gene transcripts in the 2-cell embryo and launch the progress of zygote genome activation (ZGA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>TFs were significantly enriched in 4-cell, 8-cell, and morulae stages, which indicated that the gene expression and regulation network became more sophisticated during the zygote gene activation (ZGA) process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Our finding of a relatively desolate transcriptional scenario in the late blastocyst stage accords with the findings of Piasecka et al. [31], who proposed that the cleavage/blastula modules of zebra fish development are not enriched with transcriptional devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>Finally, the gathering of these transcriptional elements during the ZGA process could not be disregarded and this might further influence the evolutionary model or regulation mechanism of the whole developmental schedule. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>All of these indices implied several features during the process of human preimplantation embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>First, we observed that maternal genes were under less selective constraints while there were strong selective constraints effecting on earlier zygote-activated genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>This was verified via the reduction of the dN/dS ratio accompanied by the consumption of maternal mRNAs and ZAG expressing from zygote to 4-cell stage (Figure 3), and the over-representation of the conserved one-to-many orthologs in the 4-cell stage (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Secondly, we discovered a switch of the evolutionary constraints at 8-cell stage in which the embryo tended to express new genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>This trend is reflected by the fact that dN/dS begin elevating after the 8-cell stage (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, genes in 8-cell stage present depletion of oldest Opisthokonta-Bilateria genes and show overrepresented of newest Mammalia-Eutheria genes (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>The burst of new genes in the 8-cell stage was further demonstrated by the depletion of one-to-one zebra fish orthologs genes and overrepresentation of human specific genes in this stage (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>Lastly, the selective pressure on late blastocyst stage tended to increase again. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>The late blastocyst stage was overrepresented in the oldest Opisthokonta-Bilateria genes (Figure 4) and one-to-one orthologs of zebra fish (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>The phylotypic stage in middle development was specifically enriched for transcriptional elements so that the transcriptional factory was subtly working in this stage [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>Our work revealed that ZGA in early stages also showed the enrichment of transcriptional elements (Figure 6), which indicated the ZGA process is under precise regulation as phylotypic stage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>In summary, we found that, in the earlier developmental stages of the human embryo, the conservation indices presented the sequence of increasing—decreasing—increasing (Figure 7), rather than increasing or decreasing monotonically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>And this trend is potentially correlated with the maternal transcripts degrade and ZGA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>As part of the developmental process, earlier embryo development turns out to be a complicated process which also involves the fluctuation of selective pressure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Mammalian developments comprise three important processes: zygote genome activation (ZGA) at earlier stages [11], expression of Hox genes at middle stages [2], and morphological formation at late stages [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The evolutionary conservation of these three stages has been debated at length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Previous EVO-DEVO studies concerning development [1, 4, 5, 31] focused on conservation during the whole development process, while changes of selective pressure during earlier development were neglected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>These studies typically used one stage (such as the zygote stage) to represent the earlier embryonic stages [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Most stages of the earlier embryo (such as 2-cell to 8-cell stages) were discarded as they are relatively short compared to the long time interval of stages in middle and late embryo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>By monitoring these transient stages of earlier development, the exquisite regulation mechanism of the ZGA process could be revealed [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Rather than monitoring once after certain time intervals [4], the detecting time points should be chosen according to developmental events and time interval of different stages should be specially selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is meaningful to set more observing points during the earlier stages [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Here we analyze eight stages in preimplantation embryonic development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the conservation scenario of the earlier embryo has a degree of fluctuation different from the direct increase or decrease previously reported [1, 3, 5, 6, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The fluctuation in PED stages was probably associated with the events occurring during these stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>For instance, more selective pressure was on early zygotic genes than maternal genes [27]; therefore the measure of conservation increased during the maternal transcripts degrading process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Then the embryo was building the infrastructure so that it expressed highly conserved genes during the 2-cell stage to 4-cell stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>After this, the embryo expressed some species specific genes to determine its fate inclination [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Finally, the genes expressed near middle embryonic stages presented to be conserved, which was accordance with the hourglass model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Our work illustrates that the dynamics of evolutionary indices during these short-time early stages should also be taken into consideration in discussions of the “hourglass” model or the “funnel-like” model of embryo development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>We believe a precise exploration of the evolutionary indices of earlier developmental stages will lead to the creation of a more sophisticated model of selective pressure on the whole development process. </plain></SENT>
