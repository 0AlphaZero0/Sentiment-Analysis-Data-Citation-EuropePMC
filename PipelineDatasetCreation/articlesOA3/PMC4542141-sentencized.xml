</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This randomized trial compared breathing 80 ppm NO versus N2 as an in-hospital adjunctive therapy for 92 comatose pediatric patients with CM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference of plasma Ang-1, Ang-2, or cytokine levels between the groups after 48 hours of treatment (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>Nitric oxide proved to be effective in murine CM models, wherein PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with a systemic NO donor (dipropylenetriamine NONOate), or breathing 40 ppm NO, had improved survival [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic treatment with 80 ppm NO in the same model, with and without antimalarial therapy, resulted in a reduced mortality rate, a greater increase of plasma Ang-1 levels, reduced brain mRNA copy numbers of the ratio of Ang-2/Ang-1, and reduced plasma levels of IFN-γ, TNF, and MCP-1 [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>In this small clinical trial, we found an overall mortality rate of 12%, with fewer patients dying breathing NO; however, NO treatment did not significantly reduce the mortality rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was less than the 18% reported in a recent multicenter study of 5425 children with severe malaria (of whom 1825 had CM) treated with IV artesunate [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence rate of neurological sequelae in our study was 12%, which is similar to the 10%–25% rate reported in sub-Saharan Africa [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>We believe NO treatment to be safe because the mortality rate in our study was low, breathing NO did not increase the incidence of neurological sequelae, mean methemoglobin levels remained low (4.1% ± 0.4%), and the number of patients affected by SAEs and AEs were similar in both groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Plasma S100b, a biomarker of injury to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and other neural cell types, is increased in patients after traumatic brain injury and cardiac arrest [26–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Elevated S100b levels have been measured in adult and pediatric CM patients with seizures, but this was only investigated using cerebrospinal fluid [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma S100b levels in our CM patients, and, although we found no significant difference in the reduction of the levels between the treatment groups over 48 hours (Table 2), plasma S100b may be useful as a tool for assessing the level of central nervous system injury in future studies involving CM patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We delivered NO or N2 with the INOPulse, a gas injector that was triggered on inspiration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Even though it was not possible to measure the precise NO concentration in the trachea of children receiving NO gas with the INOPulse, we confirmed that NO was inhaled by detecting elevated levels of blood metHb% and plasma NO metabolites (Figure 2B and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were reported by Gladwin et al [25], among adult sickle cell patients breathing 40 or 80 ppm NO using the INOPulse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>We measured plasma NO metabolites in an effort to better understand their changes in CM patients breathing NO, and we observed increased plasma nitrate levels in the NO arm and a reduction of nitrate levels in the N2 arm after 48 hours of treatment (Figure 2C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>After inhalation, NO has an extremely short half-life with 97% rapidly converted to nitrate and the remainder to stable adducts (S-nitrosylated proteins [eg, S-nitrosothiols or N-nitrosamines], nitrosyl-hemeproteins, and nitrite), which can release NO in systemic vascular beds by various mechanisms [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown beneficial extrapulmonary effects of inhaled NO in humans, including reduced platelet aggregation [33], reduced myocardial injury after cardiopulmonary bypass [34], increased renal blood flow [35], enhanced liver allograft function in liver transplant recipients [36], and reduced inflammation in lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion from tourniquet use [37]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Despite the possible vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory benefits of inhaled NO described above, including the positive outcomes of NO trials in murine models of CM [11, 12], we did not find a significant difference in the change of plasma Ang-1 or Ang-2 levels after 48 hours of inhaled NO treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Plasma angiopoietin levels have been correlated to the severity of illness in severe malaria and CM patients [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>In the future, it may be valuable to focus the administration of inhaled NO upon CM patients with laboratory evidence of NO scavenging and pulmonary or systemic vasoconstriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>We would suggest studying the subset of CM patients with elevated levels of plasma cell-free hemoglobin and therefore increased NO scavenging and consumption [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>This subset has shown evidence of increased right heart/pulmonary pressures on echocardiogram [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that this subset of patients suffer from increased cerebrovascular resistance with reduced cerebral blood flow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Breathing NO oxidizes cell-free hemoglobin to metHb, thereby reducing its ability to scavenge intrinsic NO [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Inhaling NO may have greater clinical efficacy in this subgroup of patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NO did not significantly increase plasma Ang-1 levels at 48 hours compared with patients treated with N2. </plain></SENT>
