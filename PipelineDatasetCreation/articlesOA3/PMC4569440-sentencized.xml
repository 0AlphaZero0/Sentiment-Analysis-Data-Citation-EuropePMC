</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Obese/overweight youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have suboptimal glycemic control [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Though insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of this poor glycemic control, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Metformin is a biguanide, which acts principally by increasing insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and thereby reducing hepatic glucose output [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials with metformin in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D) reported a decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>However, there have been conflicting reports from studies in adolescents with T1D [2, 4–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The benefit was transient in one study [7] and no decrease was found in another [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The main drawback of these studies was the small sample size and lack of reporting on long term benefit and safety of adjunctive therapy in many of them [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we conducted a 12-month clinical trial consisting of a 3-month run-in-phase and a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional period to determine the role of adjunctive metformin therapy on glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that adjunctive metformin therapy would improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>The study’s objective was to compare the effect of adjunctive metformin vs. placebo on glycemic control, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and hypoglycemia in overweight/obese youth with T1D receiving multiple daily injections of insulin. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>In this nine-month randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial, we report a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>This glycemic finding was associated with non-significant decreases in FPG, and TDD of long-acting insulin compared to placebo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>This clinically significant difference [13] in HbA1c may not have reached statistical significance due to type 2 error arising from inadequate sample size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the longest randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight/obese youth of both genders with T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>This study is further distinguished by its employment of a standardized insulin delivery protocol, the treat-to-target insulin regimen, to ensure uniformity of insulin titration in both arms of the study; the utilization of MyCareTeam software to capture glucose data for glycemic monitoring and analysis; and the use of uniform insulin analogs delivered via multiple daily insulin injections only. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Published reports on adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese patients with T1D have reached differing conclusions [1, 2, 6, 14–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>A recent meta-analysis of 197 studies on the use of adjunctive metformin therapy in children and adults with T1D concluded that metformin therapy reduces insulin dose requirements in T1D but not HbA1c value[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>A recent 9-mo RCT that examined the effect of metformin for the treatment of hyperandrogenism in 24 female adolescents and young women with T1D, included glycemic endpoints in their analysis and found no differences in HbA1c and total daily doses of insulin between the placebo and metformin groups[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>This study differed from our trial in that the investigators enrolled only female subjects; used only 850 mg of metformin daily in the treatment arm; and recruited both normal-weight and overweight/obese subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>They neither evaluated changes in fasting glucose levels nor employed a standardized insulin treatment protocol to ensure uniformity of glycemic control in both the placebo and metformin groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>They also did not investigate the changes in the doses of fast-acting- and long acting insulins in both groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Another trial, a 6-month RCT of adjunctive metformin in 74 youth with T1D concluded that metformin therapy reduces insulin dose requirements in T1D but not HbA1c value[1].This study, though adequately powered, was limited by its relatively short duration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>In contrast, some studies in youth have reported significant reduction in HbA1c in those who received adjunctive metformin therapy [2, 6, 17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>These studies were, however, limited by their short duration of 3 months[2, 6], open label design and very small sample size of 9 subjects [17] and 10 subjects[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the two RCTs that reported reductions in HbA1c [2, 6] did not categorically recruit overweight/obese children and adolescents with T1D, and did not employ a titration regimen to ensure uniformity of insulin dosing and glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Taken together, despite the lack of consensus on the efficacy of adjunctive metformin on HbA1c in T1D, our study suggests that prolonged treatment with adjunctive metformin could result in a clinically significant[13] reduction in HbA1c in overweight/obese children and adolescents with T1D. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The elevated mean HbA1c values in our study are similar to the findings from a recent national report on glycemic control in children and adolescents with T1D which showed higher mean HbA1c level [8.4 ± 1.4% for whites, 9.6 ± 1.9% for blacks, and 8.7 ± 1.6% for Hispanics] than the recently recommended HbA1c target of &lt;7.5% by the American Diabetes Association[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our finding of suboptimal glycemic control despite increasing insulin dose in the placebo group is consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) [21], which reported that the average of HbA1c values in adolescents with T1D was 1% higher than in adults in both the conventional and intensive treatment groups, despite receiving more insulin; and attempts to increase insulin doses led to weight gain and worsening of glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The proposed mechanism for this deterioration in glycemic control was termed insulin resistance of puberty, which is believed to be driven by the significantly elevated levels of anti-insulin hormones namely growth hormone and sex steroids, during the period of active pubertal maturation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>Apart from IR of puberty, other factors may have contributed to the failure to achieve optimal glycemia in this cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Differences in subjects’ adherence to insulin therapy may have led to poor glycemic outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Equally, some patients could have adjusted their insulin doses to maintain glycemic targets that were substantially higher than those directed by the investigators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>It could also be due to a combination of these two factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>The significant reduction in insulin requirement in our metformin cohort is consistent with improved insulin sensitivity [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>The lack of a significant change in ISF in the metformin group suggests that the mechanism for this reduction in insulin requirement was principally by increasing hepatic insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and consequent reduction in hepatic glucose production [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>However, though the lack of a statistically-significant reduction in HbA1c suggests that insulin resistance may not be the sole mechanism for poor glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D, our small sample size may have introduced type 2 statistical errors that prevented the detection of significant differences in HbA1c between the groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Several socio-demographic and therapeutic factors such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parental education, parental involvement in diabetes management, family dynamics, and whether a patient receives care from an endocrinologist[23] have been associated with poor glycemic control in youth [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>These variables were considered in our analysis as all of our subjects received their care from pediatric endocrinologists, had parental involvement in their diabetes care, were of low to medium socio-economic status, and mostly of white or Hispanic ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>This RCT has a number of limitations that should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>The small sample size is a major limitation and this could have limited our ability to detect significant differences in the outcome parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Such type 2 errors might indicate that we had insufficient power to reject the null hypothesis despite the fact that this hypothesis is false. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>This is particularly important in interpreting the results that were nearly significant such as the change in the TDD of long-acting insulin in which the metformin group had a consistently lower requirement for long-acting insulin throughout the trial compared to the placebo group (p = 0.221). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a significant difference could have been detected with an adequate sample size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>Secondly, though the significantly reduced insulin requirement in the metformin group was consistent with increased insulin sensitivity in that cohort, no formal measurement of insulin resistance using techniques such as hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, changes in physical activities during the study, which could alter insulin sensitivity, were not measured; and plasma or urine metformin levels were not obtained to monitor adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Intake of calories and macronutrients was not monitored and analyzed as these could represent strong modifiers of glycemic control in patients with T1D. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>The trial was stopped before reaching enrollment target because most youth were reluctant to commit to this long-term study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the characteristics of the 10 subjects who were consented for the study but not randomized, showed no differences in anthropometric and glycemic characteristics between the randomized subjects and the 6 dropouts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>The remaining 4 subjects were excluded because they either had an HbA1c value of &lt;8% or BMI of &lt;85% on the day of their scheduled randomization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The study’s strengths lie in its randomized controlled design, the long duration of intervention, the enrollment criteria, and the use of a common insulin treatment protocol of multiple daily insulin injections only, thus ensuring a uniformity of timing and delivery of both short- and long-acting insulins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>This is the first trial to employ a standardized insulin titration protocol, the treat-to-target insulin regimen, in the investigation of the role of adjunctive metformin therapy in youth with T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>The employment of treat-to-target insulin regimen ensured that all participants used the same algorithm for insulin dose adjustment throughout the duration of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>This protocol addressed the problem of the uniformity of insulin administration, which has been a recurrent confounder in other trials on adjunctive metformin therapy in T1D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Further strengths of the study include the use of a common insulin analog for the short-acting and long-acting insulin formulations; the use of a single basal insulin dose given every evening to ensure accuracy of titration of long-acting insulin dose to FPG levels, and the incorporation of the MyCareTeam software to capture glucose readings for the entire duration of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The trial’s retention rate of 78.6% ensured that the completers were representative of the original cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>This is the first trial in youth to accurately determine that the differential increase in insulin requirement in the placebo group was a function of escalations in the dose of long-acting insulin, and not the short-acting insulin dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Thus, the long duration of this trial ensured that our conclusions were free from initial Hawthorne effects, and the institution of a standardized insulin delivery protocol allowed conclusions to be drawn on the effect of adjunctive metformin therapy on glycemic control and insulin requirements that were not possible in previous studies in this field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Therefore, though this trial’s relatively small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings, the study’s randomized, placebo-controlled design and the novel measures implemented to limit confounding variables, ensured the validity of these results. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>In this nine-month randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial, we report a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>This clinically significant difference [13] in HbA1c did not reach statistical significance most likely due to type 2 error arising from inadequate sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>This reduction in HbA1c suggests that adiposity-associated insulin resistance may be one of the primary mechanisms for poor glycemic control in these patients while other factors such as socio-demographic, hormonal, and therapeutic factors may play a secondary role on glycemic control in this population. </plain></SENT>
