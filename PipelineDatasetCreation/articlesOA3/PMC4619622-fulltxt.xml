[<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141258.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately one in 1000 children is affected by severe hearing loss at birth or during early childhood, which is defined as pre-lingual deafness [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141258.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with approximately half of these cases attributable to genetic causes [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Among the &#x0003e;100 known forms of non-syndromic deafness with identified genetic loci, by far the most common and best characterized is the one associated with <italic>GJB2</italic> (OMIM 121011), the gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We previously reported the generation of mouse models for Cx26-associated deafness and their molecular pathophysiologies. We recently showed that the delayed programmed cell death observed in Cx26 mutant mice resulted in an abnormal shapes for the organ of Corti [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and mutation of Cx26 resulted in a drastic disruption and reduction in the gap junction plaque as well as an ion transport disorder. We also found that the corresponding upregulation and isoform shift of caveolin (CAV) may underlie these disruptions [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been reported that histopathologic evaluation of the human temporal bone in Cx26-related hearing loss revealed near-total degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both a Cx26 dominant-negative model and a conditional knockout model developed secondary degeneration [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which could be rescued by gene transfer with wild-type <italic>Gjb2</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mechanism underlying secondary outer hair cell (OHC) degeneration remains unknown. Because the mammalian inner ear largely lacks the capacity to regenerate OHCs [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the mutant Cx26&#x02013;associated degeneration leads to irreversible hearing loss. Even if certain therapies, drugs, or a superior cochlear implant is developed for Cx26-associated deafness, these irreversible changes may counter any attempt to treat the hearing loss. Here we demonstrate the deformation of OHCs in mice with Cx26-associated hearing loss and investigate the factors that contribute to the secondary degeneration of OHCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Animals and ethics statement</title><p>The care, maintenance, and treatment of animals in these studies followed protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Juntendo University (Permit Number: 270201).</p><p>As we previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], otic vesicle&#x02014;specific Cx26 knockout mice were generated by breeding Cx26<sup>f/f</sup> mice with mice that expressed the Cre recombinase gene under the control of the P0 gene promoter (P0Cre mice on the C57BL/6J background).

It is thought that the overall cyto-architecture of the organ of Corti is essential for normal hearing. In our previous work, we showed that developmentally essential apoptosis in the organ of Corti was delayed in Cx26 mutant mice [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that mutation of Cx26 arrests TC development [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is thought to be associated with hearing loss. These studies show that disruption of the cyto-architecture of the organ of Corti may cause the deformation of OHCs. Moreover, the characteristic wavy surface structure of the plasma membrane of normal OHCs, which was thought to indicate cortical lattice (<xref rid="pone.0141258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), was not observed partially in OHCs of Cx26<sup>f/f</sup>P0Cre mice. We speculate that alteration of the structure of the cortical lattice may underlie the observed deformation of OHCs in our Cx26<sup>f/f</sup>P0Cre mice (<xref rid="pone.0141258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We previously reported that OHCs are compressed and squeezed by the surrounding supporting cells in Cx26 mutant mice [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These mechanical forces may reduce the wavy structure and result in a flat plasma membrane. The cortical lattice may regulate OHC stiffness and/or electromotilty [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We reported that distortion-product otoacoustic emission could not be detected throughout development of Cx26 dominant-negative model mice [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is thought that mechanical stress and abnormal cyto-architecture suppress the distortion-product otoacoustic emission response and cause substantial damage to OHCs [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This may ultimately lead to the degeneration of secondary OHCs in Cx26<sup>f/f</sup>P0Cre mice.</p><p>CAVs are integral plasma-membrane proteins and the principal structural components of the localized caveolae membrane and related to endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and various signal transduction processes [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recent experiments have shown that overexpression or abnormal localization of CAVs delays wound healing or accelerates cellar aging in several organs (e.g., skin [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141258.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], lung [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], heart [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and eye [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). Among the three members of the caveolin family (CAV1, CAV2 and CAV3), CAV1 and CAV2 are expressed in most cell types. CAV3 is only expressed muscle cells [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0141258.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A recent study revealed that CAV2 is the key protein that regulates cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The CAV family is thought to be one of the stress-induced protein families, and CAVs negatively regulate cell proliferation and cell cycle progression [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It was also reported that CAV1 and CAV2 levels are elevated in endothelial cells in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, shear stress causes translocation of CAV1 from caveolae to noncaveolae sites and induces ERK activation [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In our current study, notable accumulation of CAV2 was observed in OHCs and supporting cells in Cx26<sup>f/f</sup>P0Cre mice. In particular, this accumulation was observed in cells near the closed TC (<xref rid="pone.0141258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>) and the shrunken site of OHCs (<xref rid="pone.0141258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). These facts indicate OHCs and supporting cell were received some mechanical stress and the OHC secondary degeneration might be associated with CAV2. These facts may suggest that, as a consequence of CAV2 accumulation, the OHCs experienced secondary degeneration.</p><p>This is the first report demonstrating the characteristic deformation of OHCs and the identification of certain factors that contribute to OHC degeneration in the organ of Corti of Cx26<sup>f/f</sup>P0Cre OR Cx26 mutant mice. Our study also suggests that CAVs in the organ of Corti may play a crucial role in the progression or secondary pathogenesis of <italic>GJB2</italic>-associated deafness. It has been reported that CAVs polymorphisms are associated with the risk of Meniere&#x02019;s disease, which is a disease of the inner ear that manifests as episodic vertigo [<xref rid="pone.0141258.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. CAVs may be important for inner-ear homeostasis. Investigation of these molecular pathways, including those involving CAV2, may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of <italic>GJB2</italic>-associated deafness and provide new information on effective targets for new therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank M.
