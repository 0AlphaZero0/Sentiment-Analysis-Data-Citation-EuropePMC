</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Hereditary deafness is one of the most common congenital diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>[1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Approximately one in 1000 children is affected by severe hearing loss at birth or during early childhood, which is defined as pre-lingual deafness [3, 4], with approximately half of these cases attributable to genetic causes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Among the &gt;100 known forms of non-syndromic deafness with identified genetic loci, by far the most common and best characterized is the one associated with GJB2 (OMIM 121011), the gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We previously reported the generation of mouse models for Cx26-associated deafness and their molecular pathophysiologies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We recently showed that the delayed programmed cell death observed in Cx26 mutant mice resulted in an abnormal shapes for the organ of Corti [7], and mutation of Cx26 resulted in a drastic disruption and reduction in the gap junction plaque as well as an ion transport disorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We also found that the corresponding upregulation and isoform shift of caveolin (CAV) may underlie these disruptions [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that histopathologic evaluation of the human temporal bone in Cx26-related hearing loss revealed near-total degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Both a Cx26 dominant-negative model and a conditional knockout model developed secondary degeneration [10–13], which could be rescued by gene transfer with wild-type Gjb2 [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The mechanism underlying secondary outer hair cell (OHC) degeneration remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Because the mammalian inner ear largely lacks the capacity to regenerate OHCs [15], the mutant Cx26–associated degeneration leads to irreversible hearing loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Even if certain therapies, drugs, or a superior cochlear implant is developed for Cx26-associated deafness, these irreversible changes may counter any attempt to treat the hearing loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate the deformation of OHCs in mice with Cx26-associated hearing loss and investigate the factors that contribute to the secondary degeneration of OHCs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate the deformation of OHCs in Cx26-deficient mice using unconventional horizontal sections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the overall cyto-architecture of the organ of Corti is essential for normal hearing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>In our previous work, we showed that developmentally essential apoptosis in the organ of Corti was delayed in Cx26 mutant mice [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several studies have demonstrated that mutation of Cx26 arrests TC development [16–19], which is thought to be associated with hearing loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>These studies show that disruption of the cyto-architecture of the organ of Corti may cause the deformation of OHCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the characteristic wavy surface structure of the plasma membrane of normal OHCs, which was thought to indicate cortical lattice (Fig 2), was not observed partially in OHCs of Cx26f/fP0Cre mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>We speculate that alteration of the structure of the cortical lattice may underlie the observed deformation of OHCs in our Cx26f/fP0Cre mice (Fig 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that OHCs are compressed and squeezed by the surrounding supporting cells in Cx26 mutant mice [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>These mechanical forces may reduce the wavy structure and result in a flat plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The cortical lattice may regulate OHC stiffness and/or electromotilty [20–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>We reported that distortion-product otoacoustic emission could not be detected throughout development of Cx26 dominant-negative model mice [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>It is thought that mechanical stress and abnormal cyto-architecture suppress the distortion-product otoacoustic emission response and cause substantial damage to OHCs [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This may ultimately lead to the degeneration of secondary OHCs in Cx26f/fP0Cre mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>CAVs are integral plasma-membrane proteins and the principal structural components of the localized caveolae membrane and related to endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and various signal transduction processes [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Recent experiments have shown that overexpression or abnormal localization of CAVs delays wound healing or accelerates cellar aging in several organs (e.g., skin [26, 27], lung [28], heart [29], and eye [30]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Among the three members of the caveolin family (CAV1, CAV2 and CAV3), CAV1 and CAV2 are expressed in most cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>CAV3 is only expressed muscle cells [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A recent study revealed that CAV2 is the key protein that regulates cell proliferation [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The CAV family is thought to be one of the stress-induced protein families, and CAVs negatively regulate cell proliferation and cell cycle progression [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>It was also reported that CAV1 and CAV2 levels are elevated in endothelial cells in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, shear stress causes translocation of CAV1 from caveolae to noncaveolae sites and induces ERK activation [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>In our current study, notable accumulation of CAV2 was observed in OHCs and supporting cells in Cx26f/fP0Cre mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>In particular, this accumulation was observed in cells near the closed TC (Fig 5B) and the shrunken site of OHCs (Fig 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>These facts indicate OHCs and supporting cell were received some mechanical stress and the OHC secondary degeneration might be associated with CAV2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These facts may suggest that, as a consequence of CAV2 accumulation, the OHCs experienced secondary degeneration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>This is the first report demonstrating the characteristic deformation of OHCs and the identification of certain factors that contribute to OHC degeneration in the organ of Corti of Cx26f/fP0Cre OR Cx26 mutant mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Our study also suggests that CAVs in the organ of Corti may play a crucial role in the progression or secondary pathogenesis of GJB2-associated deafness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CAVs polymorphisms are associated with the risk of Meniere’s disease, which is a disease of the inner ear that manifests as episodic vertigo [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>CAVs may be important for inner-ear homeostasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Investigation of these molecular pathways, including those involving CAV2, may contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of GJB2-associated deafness and provide new information on effective targets for new therapies. </plain></SENT>
