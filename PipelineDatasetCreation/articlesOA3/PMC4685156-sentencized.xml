</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The Malays (Melayu) are found across wide areas in the world including Peninsular Malaysia, Borneo (Sabah &amp; Sarawak), Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand, Sri Lanka and some of the Cape Malay community in Cape Town, Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among these countries, Malaysia and Brunei formed the majority of the Malay population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In Peninsular Malaysia, the Malays consist of several sub-ethnics groups originating from different ancestral lineages based on their migration many years ago (Paul, 1961). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Malays in Peninsular Malaysia comprises the western Malays (Melayu Minang), southern Malays (Melayu Jawa and Melayu Bugis) and northern Malays (Melayu Kelantan and Melayu Kedah) according to their settlements in the Peninsular Malaysia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The SNP genotyping data previously reported by Hatin et al. (2011) has placed the Kelantan Malay or Melayu Kelantan as an outlier to the other Malay ethnic groups in the Peninsular Malaysia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) has an ancestry that is more divergent than other Malay populations due to their historical links and geographical location at the northern part of the Peninsular Malaysia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, other Malays from the western and southern regions of the Peninsular Malaysia have more historical and cultural links with respective populations from the Indonesian archipelago, whereas Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) shows limited links with these populations (Hatin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The uniqueness shown by the Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) has sparked interests in understanding the Malaysian population in Malaysia in particular the Malay sub-ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The sequencing of two members of the Royal Kelantan family genomes will provide insights on the Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) whole genome sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The two Royal family members are the descendents of the Sultan Muhammad IV, the ruler of the Kelantan state from 1911 to 1920. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The sequence will allow the construction of a Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) reference genome, the identification of variants specific to the Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) ethnic group and the positioning of Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) in the broad prehistory of both the Malay Peninsula and the Southeast Asia in general. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The whole genome sequence of the Royal Kelantan Malay individuals should reveal the genetic variants associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and thalassemia in Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although the Malays are the predominant ethnic groups in Malaysia, a study has reported the low prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Malays compared to the Chinese and the Indians (Goh, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Chinese and the Indians might be due to the high prevalence from the country they originated from, which are the Southern China and the Southern India (Goh, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The Helicobacter pylori prevalence also varied from a low range of 26.4% in Kota Bharu in the north east of the Peninsular Malaysia to a substantially high of 55.0% in Kota Kinabalu in the Sabah state of Borneo (Goh &amp; Parasakthi, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These findings were further supported by the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection which was reported to be low prevalence in the north-east as compared to the west coast of the Peninsular Malaysia (Goh &amp; Parasakthi, 2001; Uyub et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Due to the history of immigration thousand years ago, there are few implications related to the Malays Helicobacter pylori prevalence as the Malays isolates shared the same origin as the Indian isolates (Tay et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Previous genome wide association study conducted by our group (Maran, 2011) revealed the presence of protective SNPs contributed to the low prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Kelantan. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The basis of this comparison was to look for any admixture between the genomes as reported in the previous study, where the distinct genetic difference of the Malays was possibly due to the admixture between the Kelantan Malay (Melayu Kelantan) with other Indian populations (Hatin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The admixture could possibly occur by Indians who migrated from India in second century AD (Hatin et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>It was found that the overlapping variation between the two Royal Kelantan Malay individuals, K1 and K2 were about 2,542,089 (19.3%) and the unique variants of K1 and K2 were about 1,404,217 (10.7%) and 1,364,388 (10.4%), respectively. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>The findings could be attributed by a disease which is linked to the survival and reproductive success, making it a strong selective force in human evolution (Myles et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>Based on recent studies by Lee et al. (2012) and Maran et al. (2013), the low prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Malay residing in Kelantan was probably due to the local dietary practice and also genetic factors that were found to be protective against the bacteria.Table 2 List of all SNPs associated with H. pylori infection in the Royal Kelantan Malay genome  dbSNP ID  Source  Identified rs10496563Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs9319171Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs1533949Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs221493Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs10487849Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs2120441Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs1941158Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs10435337Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs200032Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs2896092Study (Maran, 2011)Yesrs397514620ClinVar databaseNors45575636ClinVar databaseNors121918442ClinVar databaseNors58238559ClinVar databaseNors387906528ClinVar databaseNors72552778ClinVar databaseNors10004195GWAS (Mayerle et al. 2013)Yesrs368443GWASNo </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we also identified a variation in the FCER1G gene (rs11587213). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>This variation may contribute to the development of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) by altering the toxicity level (Palikhe et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>In 2-23% of adults with asthma, and rarely in children with asthma, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) could cause asthma exacerbations (Obase et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Within 3 hours of ingestion of aspirin, individuals with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) could develop bronchoconstriction, often accompanied by rhinorrhea, conjunctival irritation, and scarlet flush (Obase et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In severe cases, a single therapeutic dose of aspirin can provoke violent bronchospasm, loss of consciousness, and respiratory arrest (Obase et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that the Royal Kelantan Malays carry the SNPs which are associated with protection to Helicobacter pylori infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In addition they also carry SNPs which are associated with beta-thalassemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>These findings are in line with the findings by other researchers who conducted studies on thalassemia and Helicobacter pylori infection in the non-royal Malay population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>This whole genome sequence of Royal Kelantan Malays provides a reference genome for the Kelantan Malays sub-ethnic group and will be useful to those conducting comparative and evolutionary population studies. </plain></SENT>
