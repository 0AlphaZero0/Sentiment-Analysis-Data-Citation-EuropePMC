</text></title><sec id="s1_1"><title><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Endogenous retroviruses </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Endogenous retroviruses are an inherent part of mammalian genomes and typically consist of viral gag, pol and env sequences flanked by long terminal repeats (LTR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This genomic heritage originates from ancestral and independent retroviral infections within the germ line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Complex reinfection, retro-transposition, propagation and error-prone steps occurred during evolution, leading to the formation of multi-copy sequences arranged in families [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In humans, about 100 human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families are identified [2], yet only about thirty have been reasonably well studied [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Each family contains tens to thousands of distinct loci scattered throughout the human genome, representing an overall pool of approximately 200,000 individual HERV loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Together with the mammalian apparent LTR-retrotransposons, LTR retroelements span roughly 8% of the chromatin [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>To date, all characterized HERV elements are replication defective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is generally accepted that HERV are silent due to mutations and epigenetic regulation [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, in some contexts, HERV have become bona fide genes that contribute to biological functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For instance, the Syncytin-1 envelope glycoprotein is essential for human placentation [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>However, the major contribution of (H)ERV sequences to the evolution of species and functional genomics relies presumably on their LTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>They can trigger chromosomal breaks through recombination events [7] and serve as natural or alternative promoters and enhancers capable of modulating transcription [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s1_2"><title><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>HERV-H and colorectal cancer </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second cause of cancer-related deaths in Europe and in the United States and its incidence increases in developing countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of CRC depends primarily on colonoscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Some molecular markers are in clinical use, e.g. the dosage of the carcinoembryonic antigen in serum [9], but no marker indicates the early conversion of adenomatous polyps to adenocarcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>There is therefore a demand for (early) diagnostic markers, ideally based on non-invasive sampling methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, CRC is closely connected to genetic background (e.g. familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or more broadly called Lynch syndrome), chronic inflammation, lifestyle and dietary habits [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>At least three molecular subtypes of CRC are currently well recognized: (I) the chromosomal instable (CIN) tumors (characterized by aneuploidy), (II) the microsatellite instable (MSI) tumors (loss of the DNA mismatch repair system causes mutations especially in repetitive DNA sequences) and (III) the tumors presenting with the CpG island methylation phenotype with frequent inactivation of tumor-suppressor regions by methylation [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A major consequence of the abundance of LTR regulatory elements within the human genome is that permissive HERV reactivations are often associated with pathological contexts including cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Transcripts from HERV-K HML-2 have been associated with numerous cancers including melanoma [12], leukemia and lymphoma [13] as well as tumors of the breast [14, 15], testis [15] and ovary [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The HERV-E family has been associated with prostate, kidney, ovarian and uterine cancers [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the expression of the HERV-H family has been previously associated essentially with CRC [15, 19], but, to date, the identification of individual reactivated HERV-H loci remains poor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>One unique HERV-H locus on Xp22.3 has been repeatedly described to be up-regulated in CRC [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s1_3"><title><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recent findings and purpose of the study </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We recently used a dedicated Affymetrix custom microarray to gain insights into the HERV transcriptome using a composite panel of 40 normal and 39 tumor RNA samples, including breast, colon, lung, ovary, prostate, testis, uterus, and placenta samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>This led to the identification of 284 differentially expressed HERV loci including 166 HERV-H elements in paired colon tissues (n = 4 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissue). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Using partitioning clustering, a restricted list of 21 HERV-H loci was identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Although their expression appeared specific to CRC, it relied only on a limited number of samples [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Following these results, we herein sought to deeply characterize HERV-H reactivations in CRC by integrating expression profiles with molecular and clinical data for a large cohort. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>HERV-H locus-specific qRT-PCR systems (n = 19) were designed and validated using a small sample series (n = 32 tumors and n = 21 corresponding normal tissues). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>After a short list of five HERV-H candidate sequences has been circumscribed, their expression was analyzed in two well-defined and independent clinical cohorts composed of tumor and normal adjacent colon tissues (n = 139 pairs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Additionally, samples from early and late stages of the disease (i.e. adenomas (n = 21) and metastases (n = 16)) were analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Finally, associations of HERV-H expression with clinical and molecular parameters were investigated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The previously described sequence on chromosome X (X00041_h_gag) had the highest expression frequency with detection in half of the tumors, followed by a third of tumors expressing a locus on chromosome 20 (2000045_h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Other significant expressions, ranging from 17% to 27%, were detected for the loci 500502_h, 1400035_h and 1300360_h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The positive and negative controls defined within the HERV-H family exhibited an opposite behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>There was only one false positive out of the 276 tissue samples (for the negative control) but 175 rightfully positive (for the positive control). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Conventional tumor markers MMP7 and OPN were found expressed in 63% and 79% of the tumors and in 4% and 1% of the normal tissues, respectively. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>A HERV-H sequence located at Xp22.3 has repeatedly been described to be expressed in CRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>In small cohorts of 18 to 34 tumor tissue samples, expression is reported in 47% to 95% of analyzed CRC samples [21, 23, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>In the current large analysis of clinical samples (n = 139 CRC and adjacent normal tissue pairs), we could confirm such expression in half of the tumor samples (70/139). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy of expression rate with respect to the Asian samples analyzed in Liang et al. [23] may, however, be due to their very small sampling size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, these studies identified overlapping mechanisms regulating the expression of the Xp22.3 locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Wentzensen et al. showed that the expression correlates with demethylation of the 5′ LTR [21] and the Liang group demonstrated promoter activity of this 5′ LTR [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The identified and thoroughly selected HERV-H sequences of the current study included – beside the conversant locus on the X chromosome – novel loci on chromosomes 5, 13, 14, and 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Expression was restricted to cancerous tissue of the colorectum and present in up to a third of the CRC samples, for the most expressed sequence of these additional loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Special emphasis was put on common sites of metastasis [41] to complete the view of CRC specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>HERV-H expression, again, was shown to be strongly CRC specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the HERV-H colon-tissue positive control appears to be a powerful indicator for the tissue of origin in CRC liver metastases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>However, HERV-H Xp22.3 expression was previously described in 40% of gastric, in one of six liver and two of twelve pancreatic carcinomas [21, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>This could be due to population size as well as composition or design of primers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Notably, we observed a low expression in pancreatic carcinomas of the loci on chromosome 20 and in one case also the one on chromosome 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Generally, molecular similarities between pancreatic and colorectal carcinomas, especially with regard to gene expression, have been reported [44]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a larger panel of adenomas (n = 21) and metastases (n = 16) was analyzed for expression of the five HERV-H loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>In this, we could confirm and extend the findings by Alves and co-workers, who found HERV-H Xp22.3 expressed in one adenoma and eight metastases [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>We found HERV-H Xp22.3 expressed in 29% of adenomas and additionally the locus on chromosome 20 in a third of adenomas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>In metastases, especially the locus on chromosome 13 was found present (1300360_h_gag expressed in 11/16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>However, the env gene of this particular locus was expressed only marginally in our metastatic samples (1/16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Such a divergence in expression between two genes of the same locus was neither observed in adenomas nor in tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Thus, the loss of 1300360_h_env expression may be a CRC liver metastasis specific event and either due to alternative splicing in the metastases or a genomic loss during the metastization process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Overall, we detected transcripts of the five CRC restricted HERV-H loci already present in a third of pre-cancerous adenomas and in up to half of the tumor and metastatic samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Thus HERV-H expression is generally maintained in all stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Bioinformatics analysis of the CRC specific HERV-H sequences in comparison to constitutively active, silent or gonads specific HERV-H loci revealed that the CRC specific HERV-H loci grouped in distinct clusters compared to loci from other categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they are younger in age and possess more activating histone marks on their 5′ LTR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>On one hand, the fact that these sequences are rather recent (about 7 million years) and possess transcription enabling histone marks suggests that, from an evolutionary point of view, they are not (yet) as tightly repressed as more ancient (H)ERV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the detected histone marks are similar to the ones observed for the tightly controlled active LTR of the domesticated Syncytin-1 [45] as well as active enhancers [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This suggests an independent acquisition or preservation of CRC related TFBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>So far no explanation for heterogeneity in expression in patients could be provided based on comparison of the CRC specific loci with silent and constitutive ones, including SNP in the 1000 Genomes Project (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>A strong correlation of HERV-H expression and MSI as well as lymph node infiltration was observed (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0006 respectively). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Clinically, tumors with high instability in microsatellite regions are associated with a better prognosis [47]; caused by the high degree of lymphocyte infiltration due to strong immunogenicity of these tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Such immunogenicity results from the appearance of numerous neoantigens due to the inactivation of the mismatch repair system (MMR) – by functional loss of hMLH1 protein due to methylation (in sporadic MSI) and germ line mutations in hMLH1 and other MMR genes (in HNPCC/Lynch syndrome) [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>To date the known mechanisms MSI positive tumors acquire to evade this cataclysmic immune pressure include downregulation of MHC expression [49] and elevated expression of counter-inhibitory checkpoints [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Very recently, A HERV-H derived peptide has been found to add to the arsenal of immune escape mechanisms [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Further HERV-triggered immunosuppressive mechanisms would be especially useful for tumors with a high level of immune cell infiltration – as is the case for MSI positive CRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Mechanistically, we hypothesize that HERV-H ORF interrupted by inactivating mutations might effectively be restored by MSI-induced frameshift mutations [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Thus, MSI positive tumor cells expressing such small ORF/peptides would gain a selective advantage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is compatible with the observed increased rather than exclusive HERV-H expression in MSI positive CRC compared to microsatellite stable tumors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the better prognosis connected with MSI, infiltration of tumor cells into lymph nodes represents a feature of more aggressive tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation with the M status (presence or absence of metastasis at time of resection) was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>This could hint towards potential involvement of HERV transcripts in early metastasizing processes, facilitating epithelial to mesenchymal transition and preparation of the metastatic niche by exosomes incorporating HERV-H transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Yet, in the subsequent steps of metastasis, such as the reversion of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, HERV-H transcripts may be less important. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>A combination of HERV-H transcripts could improve CRC detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Although preliminary, this approach shows that, by combining the four most expressed HERV-H sequences, the detection of adenocarcinoma could reach 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity on the clinical cohorts. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>To sum up, this work confirmed the CRC specific expression of HERV-H loci in a large multicentric clinical study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Previously uncharacterized HERV-H sequences were successfully identified by taking advantage of the Affymetrix HERV custom microarray developed in our lab [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Herein, for the first time, expression of HERV-H sequences was shown to be associated with the microsatellite status of the tumor and with the nodal status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This allowed discussing a potential involvement of HERV-H in general and especially in MSI-positive colon tumorigenesis and immune evasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>The strong CRC specificity underlines the promising use of HERV-H sequences as a novel class of RNA biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Together, these results consolidate the rational behind the use of the HERV repertoire for diagnosis and/or therapeutic purposes. </plain></SENT>
