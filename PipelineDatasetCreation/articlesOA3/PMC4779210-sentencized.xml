</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk, manifesting as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, contributes to about 3.87 million premature deaths in the 30–69 year-old age group in Pakistan [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In one of the largest case-control studies of 15,152 cases of first MI and 14,820 controls, it was shown that South Asian participants were relatively young at the time of their first MI (mean age = 53 years) compared with participants from China or Western Europe (mean age = 63 years) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Nearly 10 % of these heart attacks in South Asian participants occurred in individuals aged 40 or below. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the reported lifetime prevalence of stroke symptoms is 19 % in urban Pakistan, which amounts to 7 million potential cerebrovascular victims in this densely populated high-risk region [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although most patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke in South Asian countries receive these evidence-based treatments, their overall continuation in the outpatient phase of care remains low. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Patients from Pakistan are uniquely challenged in this respect because the overall literacy rates remain one of the lowest in Pakistan among South Asian countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In addition, a great majority of Pakistani patients often do not understand or follow health prescriptions (which are still written in English). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Additionally, due to an unregulated health industry, patients frequently take multiple opinions and prescriptions from different physicians [1, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>This lack of understanding leads to a reduced adherence to these often life-saving medications and increases their risk for drug-drug interactions and serious adverse reactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a tailored health information technology-driven intervention in Pakistani patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic strokes receiving care in outpatient setting in the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi, Pakistan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that this health IT-driven intervention would address the above-mentioned information gaps and will lead to an increase in medication adherence. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>This study protocol presents the design of a randomized controlled trial using Talking Prescriptions for improving medication adherence and health literacy in patients with stroke or CAD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Technology has been used to increase medication adherence to HIV medications, polio vaccination, and most asthma, hypertension and maternal and child care interventions in developed world populations [19–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>In general, SMS is the most common technology used for these interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>This is a patient-centered intervention which is friendly, repeatable and accessible and requires no advanced literacy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>There are several unique aspects to this protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>First, technology has never been used in a unique high-risk vascular disease population living in resource-strapped settings with marginal support and poor health literacy [28–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Second, the content used in this intervention are not just simple knowledge transfer texts, the wording and the content has been designed based on the Health Belief Theory and Social Cognitive Model [32, 33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Third, each behavioral communication message is informed by taxonomy and coded for easy replicability of intervention [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Fourth, our study protocol, design and methods are robust by the use of centralized randomization, allocation concealment, blinded assessment, intention-to-treat analysis, and a design to ensure maximum follow-up and minimize attrition [34–36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The major limitation of this study is the choice of measure of primary outcome, i.e., self-report of medication adherence on the Morisky Medication Adherence Questionnaire [37, 38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>Although this tool has been validated in Urdu in the implementation country, using assessment tools such as biochemical markers or electronic pill boxes may potentially provide more accurate results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>This however is not possible because of the complexity of a vascular patient’s prescription; this may include drugs for multiple risk factors and multiple drugs at the same time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>Simply opening an electronic pill box registers a dose as administered even if the patient takes only two medicines out of the four he is prescribed for that time, thus an electronic pill box could not capture the data of a complicated regimen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Running biochemical tests for each of these medications would be costly and impractical in a resource- constrained environment and would require repeat hospital visits [39–42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In any arm, if the design required patients to make repeat visits during intervention and to interact with the caregiver then the act of repeated interaction may then be more responsible for adherence than the IT-based intervention itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>However, we do intend to perform a limited pill count to add robustness and triangulation data to our measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Another limitation of our study is that we are unable to blind participants to the educational intervention, so those on the intervention arm are receiving SMS and are thus aware that they are on a program to increase literacy and medication compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>A possible design to account for participant effect due to the lack of blinding could be giving two versions within the intervention where general information may be imparted in one arm and more detailed specific intervention could be imparted to participants in the second intervention arm as compared to the control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>At this pilot stage we were unable to plan for two versions in this intervention arm since we were concerned about how this technology would be received and used in this early study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Another limitation to the study is the application of the literacy tool TOFHLA in a developing country like Pakistan where the literacy rate varies between 28 and 96 %, varying sharply with age groups and regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Since Karachi is the largest metropolitan city of the country with population of 9.3 million, literacy rate variations in this city are expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>In addition, the health system in Pakistan is very different to the US where this tool was designed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>Hence, TOFHLA was modified and adapted to embrace the limitations encountered in our local community while we adhered to the basic architecture of TOFHLA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>First, section 1 was modified to encompass our health system replacing insurance coverage with topics more pertinent to our local health structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Second, passages in section 2 were completely over-hauled and replaced by our local data and advice by regional content experts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>In addition, each statement was kept short and focused with just one blank to decrease the confusion that was anticipated with the presence of three to four blanks in the original version. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>The total numbers of questions in each section were kept the same to ensure accurate scoring as delineated in the original tool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>This modified TOFHLA was content-validated by five experts each, from the fields of neurology, cardiology and epidemiology/statistics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>After extensive fine-tuning, this tool was translated in Urdu and thereby successfully tested in the pilot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Our Cumulative Validity Index (CVI) scores for the regionally adapted TOFHLA were as follows: for relevance 0.87 and for clarity 0.72, which are excellent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>This study is regionally important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Pakistan, like other emerging low- and middle-income countries, faces non-communicable diseases like stroke and MI as its major health challenge, so a low-cost intervention would have a high impact [1, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>The study population is uniquely at high risk and exceptionally vulnerable to these two vascular diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>Currently, the country has an electronic database with a unique identifier number, thus the potential of reaching masses as an extension is possible in addition to the already vast mobile infrastructure [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>Since most out-of-pocket, large, unanticipated expenditure on vascular disease would push most Pakistanis into poverty, simple small steps in prevention would help and, even if the expected effect size is modest, we may ultimately have the potential to empower and positively influence many more lives [44–46]. </plain></SENT>
