<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous stimulation of different types of PRRs can have synergistic immunostimulatory effects resulting in enhanced production of molecules that mediate innate immunity such as inflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we evaluated the impact of combined stimulation of PRRs from different families on adaptive immunity by generating alum-based vaccine formulations with ovalbumin as a model antigen and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist MPLA and the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) agonist MDP adsorbed individually or together on the alum-ovalbumin particles. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition to the target antigen, adjuvants are key components of vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Adjuvants serve to (i) enhance immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic antigens, (ii) induce broader immune responses capable of covering multiple serotypes, (iii) reduce the need for booster immunizations, (iv) increase the duration of protection, and (v) allow reduction of the antigen dose needed for effective vaccination, which is financially beneficial and also reduces the risk of unfavorable side effects [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite the clear importance of adjuvant usage, research focused on their development and application has been extremely limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the past 70 years, only a single type of adjuvants, those based on Aluminium (Alum), has been used clinically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Alum adjuvants predominantly boost humoral immunity by providing Th2 cell help to follicular B cells [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This type of immune response is effective against extracellular pathogens (helminthes, Vibrio cholera, Bacillus anthracis, etc.), but not against intracellular pathogens that require mainly Th1-cell-mediated immunity (e.g., HIV, influenza virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc.) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The facts that adjuvant development primarily involves empirical approaches and must meet strict safety requirements could explain the paucity of development activity in this area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In any case, it is reasonable to hypothesize that new adjuvants could be discovered that might have stronger and broader (e.g., stimulating both Th1- and Th2-mediated immunity) activity than Alum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Such agents could be expected to have a highly significant impact on human health through improving the effectiveness of numerous vaccines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Discovery of the powerful immunoregulatory activities of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including both induction of innate immunity and modulation of adaptive immune responses suggested that agonists of PRRs could be effective adjuvants [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In fact, it has now been shown for a variety of PRR agonists that inclusion of the agonist as an adjuvant component in a vaccine (i) increases the magnitude of the specific immune response against the vaccine antigen, (ii) increases the longevity of the response, and (iii) steers polarization of the immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In particular, when administered as vaccine adjuvants, agonists of TLR-3, -4, -7/8, and -9 caused predominately Th1 response stimulation [5,6,7,8], agonists of TLR5 (e.g., flagellin) produced mixed Th1 and Th2 responses [9], and agonists of TLR2 (e.g., Pam2CSK4) showed a strong Th2-biased humoral immune response [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>It was also shown that stimulation of a non-TLR PRR, the C-type lectin Mincle receptor, by the synthetic agonist trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) induced a strong Th1/Th17 immune response [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Published reports on the activity of NOD1 and NOD2 agonists are conflicting, with Th1-, Th-2, and Th17-polarization of the immune response being observed in different studies with different antigens [12,13,14], Therefore, while some details remain unclear, it is well established that number of PRR agonists can be safe and effective immunostimulatory components of vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Based on this foundation, numerous PRR agonist-based adjuvants have been prepared [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Typically these are comprised of the PRR agonist immobilized on a particulate carrier in order to achieve better immunostimulatory characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Examples of such adjuvants include: AS01 (the TLR4 agonist Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA) formulated in liposomes), AS04 (MPLA adsorbed on aluminum salts), and CAF01 (the Mincle receptor agonist TDB formulated in liposomes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These adjuvants produce strong induction of adaptive immune reactions and/or more potent skewing of immune responses to different Th responses [16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested, however, that the effectiveness of these PRR-based adjuvants might be improved by using more than one PRR agonist as the immunostimulatory component within a given vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The rationale for this approach is based on the demonstration of synergistic activity between members of different families of PRRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>For example, combined stimulation of different TLR and NLR family members was shown to lead to enhanced transcription factor activation and cytokine/chemokine production, providing increased protection of mice against Salmonella infection in comparison to stimulation of either receptor alone [18,19,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Here, we report studies aimed at evaluating the immunoadjuvant potential of combining agonists of different types of PRRs in the context of model vaccine formulations consisting of clinically approved alum salts (carrier), ovalbumin (model antigen) and the well-known PRR agonists MPLA (TLR4 agonist) and MDP (NOD2 agonist) adsorbed to alum particles alone or in combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It is a first report showing that simultaneous combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 receptors via activation of several of transcriptional factors (e.g., NF-κB, AP-1, CREB) results in drastically expand the number and increase gene expression levels in THP-1 cells in comparison to individual PRR stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The PRR agonist combination also had synergistic effects on phagocytic uptake of vaccine particles by BMDCs and on dendritic cell (DC) maturation (up-regulation of CD80, CD86, and MHCII molecules) and activation (production of cytokines) in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the synergistic effects of combining MPLA and MDP in the vaccine formulation extended to the cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses observed in immunized mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>These results support the possibility of significantly improving vaccine efficacy through development of new adjuvants based on synergistic PRR activity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="sec018"><title><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment of THP1 cells with agonists of TLR4 and NOD2 leads to a stronger and broader transcriptional response than treatment with either single agonist </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that simultaneous activation of TLR and NOD family receptors has a synergistic effect on NF-κB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, MIP-1α, etc.) both in vitro and in vivo [18,19,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>However, it is possible that combined stimulation of TLR and NOD receptors has broader effects on gene expression that could contribute to adjuvant activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Here we tested this hypothesis by using microarray-based global gene expression analysis to compare the transcriptional profiles of naïve THP-1 cells versus THP-1 cells treated with the TLR4 agonist MPLA and the NOD2 agonist MDP either alone or in combination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>First, in order to determine the optimal doses of MPLA and MDP to use in the transcriptional profiling experiment (i.e., doses that produce synergy upon combination of the two agonists), we treated THP1-XBlue™-CD14 cells carrying an NF-κB/AP-1-dependent SEAP reporter gene with different doses of the two agonists alone and in combination for 18 hours and then measured activity of expressed SEAP as a readout of NF-κB/AP-1 activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Based on the obtained data, we chose 20μg/ml MDP and 1μg/ml MPLA for use in the subsequent experiments as a combined regimen that provides synergistic NF-κB/AP-1 stimulation in THP1 cells over either agonist alone (S1 Fig). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for the transcriptional profiling experiment, THP1 cells were treated with 1μg/ml MPLA and 20μg/ml MDP individually or in combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>RNA for microarray hybridization was harvested from the cells 3 hours after treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The data from this experiment (see Methods for details) showed that treatment with MPLA led to induction (by at least 3-fold compared to untreated THP1 cells) of 143 genes, whereas treatment with MDP only led to induction of 23 genes (Fig 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Treatment of THP1 cells with these two agonists in combination resulted in induction of 201 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Importantly, all of the genes that were induced by individual treatment with MDP or MPLA were also induced by combined treatment with both agonists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>The 58 additional genes that were identified as induced by combination treatment but not by single agonist treatment were all genes that were expressed in the single agonist-treated cells, but did not meet the level of induction (3-fold relative to untreated cells) used as a cut-off. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that the level of expression of the majority of genes induced (relative to untreated cells) by combined TLR4/NOD2 stimulation was significantly greater than that observed in cells treated with the agonist of one receptor or the other. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Vaccination is a highly effective biomedical approach to controlling infectious diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>The goal of vaccination is to stimulate generation of a strong and durable immune response against the administered antigen, providing long-term protection against infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>However, use of highly purified recombinant or synthetic antigens in subunit vaccines often makes them generally less immunogenic than vaccines containing live or killed whole organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Recent data indicates that this may be due to the fact that recombinant/synthetic vaccines often lack markers of pathogenicity (‘danger’ signals) that are part of the infectious organism and are essential for activation of full-bodied innate immune responses that contribute to development of adaptive immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>A significant breakthrough in our understanding of how the immune system recognizes and generates protection against pathogenic microbial organisms resulted from the discovery of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the associated signaling pathways [32,33,34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>It was determined that PRRs recognize evolutionarily conserved molecular components of pathogens, termed pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>PRR–PAMP interactions trigger intracellular signaling cascades that culminate in expression of a variety of proinflammatory molecules, which together orchestrate the early innate immune response to infection and also affect subsequent activation of adaptive immunity [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>These findings presented new opportunities for vaccine design, and the concept of ‘danger’ signals has been successfully applied to develop modern adjuvants that assist antigens in achieving high efficacy and safety parameters for vaccines by enhancing and directing the immune response [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Thus, currently, it is widely believed that an “ideal” adjuvant should mediate its activity through several mechanisms, including: (i) presenting ‘danger’ signals that are able to trigger PRRs that activate innate immune responses; (ii) acting as an effective antigen delivery system resulting in improved antigen uptake by APCs and lymphatic trafficking; (iii) promoting localized immune activation and inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines for immune cell recruitment [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>While the beneficial effect of PRR stimulation on vaccine efficacy has been established, the potential for even greater adjuvant activity with simultaneous stimulation of multiple PRR families is still understudied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>The rationale for this approach includes growing evidence showing that during any infectious event, various types of PRRs are activated in a stepwise manner [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>This suggests importance of complementary as well as synergistic effects of signaling via PRRs belonging to different families for efficient development of protective immunity against a given pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Additional support for this thesis is provided by data showing synergistic action between members of different families of PRRs (e.g., Toll-like and Nod-like receptors) leading to enhanced levels of transcription factor activity and cytokine/chemokine production, and ultimately, increased protection of mice against Salmonella infection in comparison to stimulation of just one type of PRR [18,19,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Based on this foundation, the goal of the work reported here was to determine whether cooperation/synergy between different PRR families affects adaptive immunity and could be applied towards improving the efficacy of vaccination. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>To address this goal, we created vaccine formulations containing alum particles (as the particulate component of the vaccine) with a model antigen (ovalbumin) and the TLR4 agonist MPLA and the NOD2 agonist MDP adsorbed to the alum particles separately or in combination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>We found that compared to use of individual PRR agonists, combining both PRR agonists within the vaccine formulation synergistically enhanced activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 and production of proinflammatory cytokines in THP-1 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>These observations are consistent with previous reports using soluble PRR agonists while additionally demonstrating that absorption of MPLA and MDP on a particulate carrier does not affect synergism between TLR4 and NOD2 signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>One of the first key steps in the induction of immune responses is internalization of the antigen by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>It was previously shown that stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 play a crucial role in upregulation of the process of antigen phagocytosis by DCs [37,38], but potential synergy upon combined stimulation was not evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that, indeed, combined stimulation of both NOD2 and TLR4 in the context of an alum-based vaccine formulation results in enhanced levels of antigen uptake by BMDCs compared to stimulation of only one PRR or the other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>While the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of PRR stimulation on vaccine particle uptake by DCs remains to be investigated, several TLR-dependent mechanisms of bacteria and vaccine particle uptake are well documented [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>Based on our results, we speculate that TLR and NOD receptor pathways possibly have an essential common intracellular signaling point through which synergy is generated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Another critical step for further induction of T lymphocyte-dependent immunity is maturation and activation of DCs [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Earlier studies demonstrated upregulation of DC maturation markers (CD80, CD86, etc.) and cytokine production in response to stimulation of TLR4 or NOD2 individually [41,42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>However, since virtually all pathogens contain molecules that may be detected by PRRs belonging to different families [36], the effects of combined stimulation of different types of PRRs on DC activation are more biologically relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrated that in vitro treatment of immature BMDCs with vaccine formulations containing agonists of either TLR4 (Alum-OVA-MPLA) or NOD2 (Alum-OVA-MDP) resulted in increased expression of the DC maturation/activation markers MHCII, CD80, and CD86, but that the vaccine formulation with both PRR agonists (Alum-OVA-MDP-MPLA) had a significantly stronger effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of CD80/86 in DCs is known to be critical for antigen-specific activation of Th cells [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>In addition, optimal activation of DCs favors local activation of Th cells expressing TCRs with the highest affinity to antigenic peptides [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>The Alum-OVA-MDP-MPLA vaccine formulation had a similar statistically significant synergistic effect (compared to Alum-OVA-MDP or Alum-OVA-MPLA) on BMDC production of cytokines and chemokines, some of which are known to be important for CD4 T cell-DC interaction (e.g., MIP-1α, MIP-1β) [45] or in serving as chemoattractants for NK cells, neutrophils and macrophages (e.g., MIP-1α, MIP-1β, KC, RANTES) [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>We also observed that combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 also notably enhanced production of number of cytokines belonging to Th1-polarizing (IL-2, TNF, IFN-γ) as well as Th2-polarazing groups (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) [47]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the results of these analyses suggest that combined stimulation of TLR4 and NOD2 is likely to promote mixed Th1/2-mediated immunity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this, when the Alum-OVA-MDP, Alum-OVA-MPLA and Alum-OVA-MDP-MPLA vaccine formulations were used to immunize mice, enhanced cellular and humoral immune responses were observed with stimulation of combined, as opposed to individual, PRRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>The synergistic effect of combined PRR stimulation in vivo on cellular immunity was indicated by a significant increase in the proportion of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells that were proliferating and/or activated (IFN-γ producing) after in vitro restimulation with ovalbumin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>The enhanced humoral response was indicated by higher titers of ovalbumin-specific IgG antibodies in mouse serum samples, including all four IgG sybtypes relevant to a mixed Th1/Th2 response [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Therefore, vaccines including combined PRR agonists induce significantly stronger humoral and cellular immune responses to a model antigen in vivo without significant Th1/Th2 polarization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>In summary, this is the first report showing that combined stimulation of two distinct PRR families (Toll- and NOD-like receptors) using MPLA and MDP molecules formulated into an alum-based vaccine effects on several critical steps of stimulation of immune response: significantly enhances antigen uptake by BMDCs, promotes BMDC maturation and activation and leads to enhanced humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses in comparison to alum adjuvant alone or alum particles with absorbed individual PRR agonists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>Our results show that collaboration between members of different families of PRRs is not limited to regulation of innate immunity, but also affects the magnitude of subsequent adaptive immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study provides strong proof of concept for development of a new class of adjuvants based on combined PRR stimulation that could significantly improve the efficacy of vaccines. </plain></SENT>
