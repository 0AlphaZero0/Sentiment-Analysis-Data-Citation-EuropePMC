The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed hairpin ends, referred to as hairpin telomeres. The hairpin telomeres represent a simple solution to the end-replication problem. Deoxyribonucleic acid replication initiates internally and proceeds bidirectionally toward the hairpin telomeres. The telomere resolvase, ResT, forms the hairpin telomeres from replicated telomere intermediates in a reaction with similarities to those promoted by type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. ResT has also been shown to possess DNA single-strand annealing activity. We report here that ResT promotes single-strand annealing of both free DNA strands and ssDNA complexed with single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB). The annealing of complementary strands bound by SSB requires a ResT&#x02013;SSB interaction that is mediated by the conserved amphipathic C-terminal tail of SSB.

<italic>Borrelia</italic> species possess highly segmented genomes, harboring multiple circular and linear replicons. The prototype <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> B31 genome possesses a linear chromosome and 23 plasmids that are a mix of circular and linear replicons (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref>). The linear replicons are terminated by covalently closed DNA hairpins, structures called hairpin (hp) telomeres (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of the replication cycle of the linear replicons is that DNA replication initiates internally and proceeds bidirectionally toward the hp telomeres (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Replication around the hp telomeres would produce an inverted repeat dimer joined by replicated telomere (<italic>rTel</italic>) junctions. The resulting intermediate has been replicated, but cannot be segregated to daughter cells, until a specialized DNA breakage and rejoining reaction, referred to as telomere resolution, occurs at the <italic>rTel</italic> junctions. Telomere resolution liberates a pair of linear replicons terminated by hp telomeres. <italic>rTel</italic> junctions are processed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> into two hp telomeres (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The essential specialized telomere resolvase that performs this reaction for <italic>Borrelia</italic> is known as ResT (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A similar replication strategy has been demonstrated for the lysogen of the N15 bacteriophage; the N15 prophage exists as a linear plasmid terminated by hp telomeres (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>ResT, and other characterized telomere resolvases, catalyzes telomere resolution by a 2-step transesterification reaction with similarity to that promoted by type 1B topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;20</xref>). A detailed view of the reaction mechanism can be found in (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the simplest view, the essential role of ResT in the cell cycle would be to resolve dimeric replication intermediates to allow cell division. A prediction of this model is that ResT insufficiency would result in a failure to resolve replicated intermediates, leading either to a filamentous phenotype or to a guillotining of the unresolved intermediates by continued cell division. Recent <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest a more complex role.</p><p>A <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> strain with conditional expression of ResT was examined for the effect of ResT depletion (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Growth arrest occurred 48 h after ResT shutoff. Among several unexpected phenotypes, were arrest of DNA replication at 48 h and the failure of the cells to filament. Starting 24 h after ResT shutoff, unit sized linear DNAs disappeared and became progressively more complex, slowly migrating forms that had a roughly equal mix of hp telomeres and replicated, but unresolved<italic>, rTel</italic> junctions. This suggested the linear plasmids examined were present in partially replicated, and possibly strand-exchanged, forms. The observed arrest of DNA replication suggested that ResT may interact directly, or indirectly, with the DNA replication machinery (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>An additional report suggested a more complex role, for ResT, in hp telomere metabolism. ResT was found to possess single-strand annealing activity and the ability to promote limited strand exchange between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors and homologous partial duplex DNAs (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We speculated that these activities could indicate that ResT may be needed to promote daughter strand gap repair in cases where the replisome was unable to fully denature the template DNA near the hp telomere to complete DNA synthesis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Daughter strand gap repair is normally promoted by RecA action, mediated by the RecFOR proteins, in the RecF DNA repair pathway (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref>). <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> possesses RecA, but otherwise lacks identifiable components of the RecF pathway, excepting RecJ, which also participates in mismatch repair (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we extend our findings that ResT can promote annealing of complementary ssDNA to show that ResT can promote this reaction with the physiological substrate of ssDNA complexed with its cognate ssDNA binding protein (SSB). Furthermore, we demonstrate that ResT interacts with SSB via the conserved amphipathic C-terminal tail (Ct) of SSB. Eubacterial ssDNA binding proteins serve as general assembly platforms for the recruitment of DNA replication, recombination and repair enzymes to sites of SSB-complexed ssDNA (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The observed interaction of ResT with SSB and its ability to promote single-strand annealing of SSB complexed ssDNA are properties held in common with the recombinational mediator, RecO, of the RecF pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>DNAs</title><p>All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT).

We were interested to discover whether ResT shared any of the properties of the single-strand annealing protein, RecO, of the RecF pathway, and could, thereby, replace some of the missing functions. To test this we determined if ResT shares RecO's unusual ability to anneal complementary strands bound by cognate ssDNA binding protein (SSB).</p><sec id="SEC3-1"><title>ResT promotes single-strand annealing with SSB-complexed ssDNA</title><p>We obtained recombinant <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> SSB by construction of a synthetic mini-gene, codon-optimized for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

We examined the ability of ResT to promote annealing of complementary single strands complexed with SSB. We used an annealing assay with a pair of complementary 35-nt oligonucleotides (see the Materials and Methods section and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Briefly, the assay involves mixing a radiolabeled reporter DNA strand with an equimolar amount of cold complementary strand and following the conversion of the ssDNA into duplex DNA on native PAGE gels. The annealing reactions are terminated by addition of SDS load dye containing pronase and and excess unlabeled reporter oligonucleotide that sequesters any remaining unlabeled complementary strand, freezing the annealing reaction at the point of termination (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The timecourses documented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref> indicate that spontaneous annealing of our model ssDNAs was slow and that pre-incubation with a saturating concentration of SSB yielded a similar slow annealing rate.

In reactions with naked DNA substrates there was a gradual increase in the initial rate with increasing ResT concentration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). In contrast, reactions with SSB-complexed substrate DNAs exhibited a saltatory jump in the initial rate at the 112 nM concentration of added ResT with a plateau in the annealing rate with higher concentrations of ResT. As 130 nM SSB was used for the pre-incubation of the oligonucleotides, a roughly equimolar ResT concentration seems to be needed to promote annealing of the SSB-complexed complementary strands. Annealing reactions with the intermediate ResT concentration of 112 nM were significantly faster with SSB-complexed ssDNA than with naked DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The ability of ResT to promote annealing of complementary SSB-complexed oligonucleotides was not particular to the sequence or length of the oligonucleotide substrates tested in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. A pair of 87-nt oligonucleotide substrates, with the same GC-content as those used for Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, were also good substrates for ResT-promoted annealing of both the naked and SSB-complexed forms (Supplementary Figure S1).</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-2"><title>The conserved C-terminal tail of SSB is needed for ResT annealing of SSB-complexed ssDNA</title><p>We tested if ResT was able to support annealing in reactions where a saturating concentration of EcSSB was used to produce the SSB-complexed substrate (Supplementary Figure S2). ResT was found to be compatible with EcSSB. <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>'s SSB is clearly identifiable as an EcSSB homolog, but is 29 amino acids shorter and shares less than 30% identity/60% overall similarity with EcSSB, except in the last seven amino acids where the two proteins share (71.4% identity/100% similarity; Supplementary Figure S2B). EcSSB has been documented to interact with DNA replication, replication restart, recombination and repair functions, including DNA pol III (&#x003c7; subunit), PriA, TopoIII, RecQ, RecO, RecG and ExoI, via this highly conserved amphipathic C-terminal tail (SSB-Ct; (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)). Key to the documented protein&#x02013;protein interactions are the conserved acidic patch (DDD) and the final hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). We deleted the final five residues of SSB that encompass the conserved part of the acidic patch and the final hydrophobic residues, to produce a mutant referred to as SSB&#x00394;C5 (Supplementary Figure S2). SSB&#x00394;C5 was compared with wild-type SSB in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and by protein crosslinking to determine if the &#x00394;C5 deletion had gross effects on ssDNA binding affinity or SSB oligomerization status. There was little observed difference between the &#x00394;C5 mutant and wild-type SSB (Supplementary Figure S3).</p><p>We used the &#x00394;C5 mutant to produce SSB&#x00394;C5-complexed ssDNA for annealing reactions. SSB&#x00394;C5, in the absence of ResT, supports slow annealing of the 664/665 oligonucleotide pair. ResT promotes a much slower annealing reaction with SSB&#x00394;C5-complexed DNA than with ssDNA bound with wild-type SSB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>).

This concentration of ResT is sufficient to drive a robust annealing reaction with the ssDNA bound by wild-type SSB. Increasing the ResT concentration from 75 to 224 nM in the SSB&#x00394;C5 reactions resulted in a modest but significant increase in the initial rate of annealing (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0102).

Titration of ResT into binding reactions with the 664 oligonucleotide, used as the radiolabeled strand in the preceding annealing assays, led to a progressive conversion of free 664 into a well-shifted complex (lanes 2&#x02013;6; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Pre-incubation of 664 with SSB yielded a discrete SSB/ssDNA complex that enters the gels and was progressively converted into a well-shifted complex by titration of ResT into co-binding reactions (lanes 7&#x02013;12; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). To test if the well-shifted complexes, in the ResT/664 versus SSB/664 + ResT reactions, represent different complexes, we tested their sensitivity to NaCl concentration. The ResT + 664 binding reactions produced a wellshift that was resistant to disruption with as much as 350 mM NaCl (lanes 2&#x02013;6; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Addition of ResT to the wild-type SSB/ssDNA complex, followed by incubation in buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, co-shifted 83% of this complex into the wells (lane 9; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Addition of ResT to the SSB&#x00394;C5/ssDNA complex, under the same conditions, co-shifted only 17% of the SSB&#x00394;C5/ssDNA complex (lane 14; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). ResT addition to wild-type SSB/ssDNA complexes produced a co-shift that was sensitive to moderate concentrations of NaCl. Adjusting the NaCl concentration to 200 mM returned 30% of the co-shifted material back to the SSB/ssDNA complex (lane 12; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The small yield of co-shifted ResT/SSB&#x00394;C5/ssDNA complexes obtained in 100 mM NaCl conditions was eliminated by use of 200 mM NaCl conditions (lanes 15&#x02013;17; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). We infer from the differential salt sensitivity of the electrophoretic mobility shifts produced by ResT addition directly to ssDNA versus ResT added to SSB/ssDNA complexes that ResT has not simply replaced SSB on the ssDNA but has produced a distinct complex that contains SSB, ResT and ssDNA. Since the &#x00394;C5 deletion eliminated most of the co-shift, we also infer that the SSB-Ct is involved in the ResT&#x02013;SSB interaction needed to produce the salt sensitive co-shifts of the SSB/ssDNA complex.</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The SSB-Ct domain recruits ResT to SSB/ssDNA complexes.

Protein&#x02013;protein crosslinking was induced by addition of glutaraldehyde to incubations containing ResT, SSB, SSB&#x00394;C5, ResT/SSB and ResT/SSB&#x00394;C5. Initial trials that used glutaraldehyde concentrations sufficient to yield a significant amount of SSB tetramer resulted in crosslinking products with ResT that were too large to enter our SDS-PAGE gradient gels (data not shown). When a sub-saturating glutaraldehyde concentration was used ResT-SSB crosslinks were readily observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Under these crosslinking conditions, ResT on its own did not multimerize (lane 2; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">B</xref>).

When ResT was co-incubated with SSB a ladder of higher molecular weight crosslinking products was seen under buffer conditions containing 100 mM NaCl (lane 8; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).

The results of crosslinking assays conducted in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl were qualitatively similar to the 100 mM NaCl results for the individual proteins.

ResT is also known to possess ssDNA annealing activity (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Besides promoting the annealing of free DNA strands, we demonstrate that ResT can also promote the annealing of complementary ssDNAs that are complexed with cognate ssDNA binding protein (SSB). As is the case for most previously documented interactions of SSB with proteins involved in genome replication and maintenance, the ResT&#x02013;SSB interaction appears to be mediated by the conserved amphipathic C-terminal tail of <italic>Borrelia</italic>'s SSB (SSB-Ct).</p><sec id="SEC4-1"><title>ResT displays RecO-like properties</title><p>Proteins that promote the annealing of complementary ssDNAs can act directly as recombinases in RecA-independent recombination. Single-strand annealing proteins can also be recombinational &#x02018;mediators&#x02019; involved in presynaptic control of strand exchange proteins like RecA or Rad51 (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>). Examples of single-strand annealing proteins that act directly as recombinases include the phage-derived Red&#x003b2;/RecT and ERF families of recombinases (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Paradigm examples of mediators include the eukaryotic Rad52, <italic>E. coli</italic> RecO and T4 UvsY proteins. Recombinational mediators share the properties of (i) promoting the annealing of complementary DNA strands complexed with their cognate ssDNA binding proteins, RPA, SSB and T4 gp32, respectively, for the above examples (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref>); and (ii) they aid and stabilize the loading of their cognate recombinase onto ssDNA substrates complexed with ssDNA binding protein (Rad51, RecA and T4 UvsX; (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)).</p><p>Our demonstration that ResT possesses the first property of canonical recombinational mediators raises the possibility that ResT may play a RecO-like role in <italic>Borrelia</italic>. Like ResT, RecO is recruited to ssDNA by an interaction with the C-terminal tail of SSB and this interaction is required for RecO to promote single-strand annealing reactions with substrates bound by SSB (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is unusual in not possessing identifiable homologs of the RecFOR and RecQ proteins (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The RecF pathway mediates RecA-dependent events that contribute to recovery from replication stress and/or DNA damage. Impediments to replication fork progression have different consequences depending upon whether the impediment occurs on the leading or lagging template strands. The replisome can often skip over a lagging strand lesion, leaving in its wake a daughter strand gap (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Impediments on the leading strand can cause arrest of the replication fork (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Studies of the genetic requirements, in <italic>E. coli</italic>, of repair of damage caused by UV-irradiation have revealed a role for the RecF pathway both in promoting recombinational repair of daughter strand gaps and in contributing to replication fork processing events that stabilize arrested forks. This allows for rapid recovery of replication after fork arrest (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45&#x02013;47</xref>). In both cases, RecFOR mediates the loading of RecA onto gapped DNA bound by SSB and the DNA pairing activity of RecA is used.</p><p>
<italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> is highly unusual in not displaying increased sensitivity to UV-irradiation in strains mutated for a host of recombination and repair functions, including RecA. The only system that has been identified as needed for recovery from UV-irradiation is the nucleotide excision repair system (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Additionally, many recombination and repair functions, including RecA, are not required for the gene conversion reactions that drive antigenic variation at the <italic>vlsE</italic> locus, though a strong requirement for the RuvAB Holliday junction branch migrase implies some variety of strand exchange reaction is involved (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The most extensively characterized antigenic variation system in bacteria, <italic>pilE</italic> switching in <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>, is dependent upon RecA action in the RecF pathway (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Either these processes are fundamentally different in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or there is a functional alternative to the RecF pathway present. We have previously shown that ResT can promote limited strand exchange reactions between ssDNA donors and partial duplex targets (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The finding, in this report, that ResT cannot promote these reactions when the ssDNA present in both the donor and partial duplex target DNA is bound by SSB suggests that ResT function may be limited, <italic>in vivo</italic>, to single-strand annealing reactions and possibly mediator function. The product of the <italic>&#x003bb; orf</italic> gene suppresses <italic>recF, recO</italic> and <italic>recR</italic> mutations, demonstrating that RecFOR functions can be provided by a single protein (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>).</p><p>Further studies will be needed to establish the degree of specificity of ResT for the chromosomal SSB used here and to establish whether the RecO-like properties also extend to ResT mediating the loading of RecA, or other recombinase, onto ssDNA coated with SSB.
