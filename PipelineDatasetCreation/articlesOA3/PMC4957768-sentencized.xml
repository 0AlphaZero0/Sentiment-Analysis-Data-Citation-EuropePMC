</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Declining male reproductive health in humans [1,2] is of particular current concern, and has increased the need for animal experiments to investigate both treatments and causes of male reproductive disorders and diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The possibility that these disorders may, in part, be caused by exposure to environmental pollutants that disrupt the male reproductive endocrine system [3,4] has led to changes in legislation, resulting in an increased need for animal testing to determine reproductive toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Hershberger assay [5], originally developed to identify the drivers (hormones) of male sexual development, is a gold standard test used in reproductive toxicity testing as well as the development of pharmaceuticals designed to treat male reproductive disorders and hormone-dependent cancers [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This assay employs castrated peri-pubertal male rats to assess effects of chemical or pharmaceutical exposure on weight, morphology and histopathology of reproductive organs and tissues and is, therefore, both ethically undesirable and costly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>To replace the rodents used in reproductive pharmacology and toxicological testing with small invertebrate organisms is desirable, to reduce both the use of rodents and the high costs of such tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This approach has been successful in, for example, research into Parkinson's disease, axon regeneration and Alzheimer's disease through the use of the worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster [7–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Neither of these organisms, however, have a reproductive anatomy similar to mammals and so would not be suitable alternatives with which to investigate the male reproductive system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Few other invertebrates have been extensively investigated as potential surrogates of male (or female) reproductive function, for either biomedical or chemical safety testing, however mollusks have been proposed as potential surrogates for androgen testing, since they have a reproductive anatomy that is, at least superficially, similar to that of vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Like mammals, the snail’s male reproductive tract extends from the testis (or ovotestis in hermaphrodite snails), has seminal vesicles and a prostate gland, and terminates in a penile glandular complex (around the preputium) containing sebaceous glands and a penis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Evidence from toxicological studies also indicate possible commonalities in the reproductive development and reproductive responses of some mollusk species with those seen in mammals [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>For example, developmental exposure to the synthetic androgen, 17α-methyltestosterone (MT) caused hyperplasia in the epithelial tissue of reproductive glands and inhibition of spermatogenesis in male Marisa cornuarietis (a freshwater prosobranch/gonochoristic gastropod mollusk) [14] while female adult M. cornuarietis developed imposex (imposition of penis growth in females) after 150 days of MT exposure [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Adult pond snails, Lymnaea stagnalis (a pulmonate/hermaphrodite gastropod), demonstrated histological damage to the albumen and prostate glands after 8 weeks of exposure to 100 ng/L of MT [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Studies with gastropods have also shown exposure to vertebrate androgens (e.g. testosterone), anti-androgens (e.g. cyproterone-acetate) or estrogens could modulate free or esterified testosterone concentrations within the exposed snails [17,18], suggesting exogenous exposures to vertebrate-type endocrine active substances may disrupt androgen homeostasis in mollusks [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, exposure of males of different gastropod species (M. cornuarietis, Nucella lapillus and Hinia reticulatea) to the fungicide vinclozolin, shown to have anti-androgenic properties in mammals, were reported to cause a reduction in the length of the penis and penis sheath [14], further supporting the suggestion that mammalian-like mechanisms through which androgens and anti-androgens could act may be present in mollusks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Based on the above literature it was expected that androgen exposure might stimulate the growth of male specific tissues (e.g. prostate) and cells (e.g. sperm), and perhaps inhibit the growth of female specific tissues (e.g. albumen gland) and cells (e.g. oocytes). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although their function has yet to be fully elucidated, putative vertebrate-like male hormones such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone; as well as steroidogenic androgen- and estrogen-producing enzymes, such as aromatase and 5α-reductase; have been found in the gonads and digestive tract of several invertebrate groups [19–23], particularly mollusks and annelids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the genes encoding for 5α-reductase have been sequenced in several mollusk species (e.g. Crassostrea gigas (ECK36980), Lottia gigantea (Pid: 194080)), perhaps suggesting that similar mechanisms exist in invertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Prior to the commencement of the research presented in this manuscript, the presence of a ‘classical’ androgen receptor (AR) in mollusks had been inferred [24,25], but this has remained an area of controversy [26], since homologues have not been identified despite investigations specifically searching for the gene [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recently, systematic searches of mollusk genomes have failed to identify an androgen receptor [28,29] homolog suggesting that the reported effects of androgens in mollusks must be attributed to a different mechanism, either using different nuclear receptors or potentially through non-genomic membrane-bound receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that genes, proteins and physiological processes that are common to both mollusks and mammals underlie the response of the male reproductive system to androgens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The tropical freshwater pulmonate snail, B. glabrata, was selected as a test species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other gastropods, it has a relatively well-documented physiology and had been widely studied, including a recent preliminary genome sequence [30], due to its medical importance as the intermediate host for the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is also easily bred in the laboratory with a short generation time, thus making it an attractive test model for mechanistic research and in vivo testing. B. glabrata were exposed during development to two potent androgens; the natural vertebrate steroid, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the anabolic steroid methyltestosterone (MT), after which reproductive tissues and organs were assessed for stimulatory (e.g. male tissue reproductive growth or advanced spermatogenesis) or possible disruptive (e.g. to female reproductive tissues or oocyte development) effects using morphological, histopathological and differential gene expression analyses, to test the hypothesis that androgens would elicit similar effects in mollusks to that seen in mammals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis was that B. glabrata might show a consistent physiological or genetic response to androgens, making them suitable as a model test organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>When taken together, our results provide ample evidence to refute this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of the in vivo developmental exposure to two potent androgens, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 17α-methyltestosterone (MT); was to investigate whether developmental exposure to these androgens would affect the growth of reproductive glands and organs in B. glabrata and/or whether specific molecular markers of androgen exposure could be determined in a mollusk, thus providing an invertebrate alternative model for male reproductive toxicity testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>However we found no consistent effects on B. glabrata. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="sec026"><title><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Effect of androgens on survival and growth </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Hatchling survival in both the DHT and MT studies was lower in the 250 ng/L and 500 ng/L (MT or DHT) than the dilution water control (DWC) or solvent control (SC) treatments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>This suggests there may have been some toxicity to the developing snails at these concentrations (although mortality in the MT study was generally lower than in the DHT study). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Toxicity has not been previously reported in other gastropod species exposed to similar nominal concentrations of androgens [14,16,41,42,45], and the dosing series for these experiments were designed to mimic concentrations documented to have endocrine effects in mollusks [14,16,41] and aquatic vertebrates [32,33] i.e. in the tens to hundreds of ng/L range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>However, the experimental design of earlier work with mollusks differs from this study, in that many were static-renewal rather than continuous dosing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Investigators measuring exposure concentrations in static renewal systems often find much lower (sometimes &lt;20%) than nominal exposure concentrations [17,45], whereas in this study exposure concentrations of 80–110% nominal MT and 65–70% nominal DHT where measured. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Therefore snails in our experiments may have been exposed to higher concentrations than similar species in other studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>In vertebrates, exposure to androgens has been reported to increase somatic growth; for example in developmentally exposed fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), DHT significantly increased weight and length in males (20 ng/L DHT) and females (200 ng/L DHT) [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>No dose dependent trend could be identified for shell size or total weight in the DHT study; on average the smallest snails were found in the 62.5 ng/L DHT treatment, and the largest in the 125 ng/L DHT treatment (S2 File; Table B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>In the MT study, the largest snails were found in the DWC treatment and the smallest in the 250 ng/L MT (S1 File; Table B), and as with the DHT study, no dose dependent trend could be seen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>B. glabrata, like other pulmonate gastropods, is a typical r-selection reproductive strategist, with large numbers of offspring and relatively high levels of mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was expected that a proportion of the hatchlings (~30% from unpublished preliminary work in our laboratory) would not survive to reproductive age, thus reducing the density in the exposure tanks over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>As mortality levels were variable, there were differences in densities of the snails between some of the tanks, perhaps contributing to variable growth rates between tanks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Even in replicate DWC tanks, however, with similar survival and densities, significant differences were found in shell size and total weight of the snails i.e. DWC tanks from the MT study (S1 File; Table A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>To account for these variations in total weight of individual snails between tanks, measurements of size and/or weight of the glandular and ovotestis tissues were normalized by individual total weight prior to statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title><text><SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>No consistent dose-related effects of androgens on reproductive tissue size and histopathology </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>One of the primary markers of androgen exposure in vertebrate models, such as the Hershberger test, is increased size/weight of male specific organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>For example, in a pubertal rat assay (enhanced OECD test guideline 407) MT exposure resulted in increased prostate weight in males treated with 200 mg/kg/day [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant effect on normalized Glandular Complex (GC) (including prostate gland) size was found for B. glabrata snails exposed to either MT or DHT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>There were also no consistent significant dose-related effects on normalised albumen gland weight in the MT or DHT exposure studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Although the albumen glands of the 62.5 ng/L and 125 ng/L MT exposed snails were much larger than those from the DWC, SC, 250 ng/L and 500 ng/L treated snails, there were significant intra-replicate differences in albumen gland weight in both the 62.5 and 125 ng/L treatments (S1 File; Table H), suggesting this was not an effect of MT exposure, but an artefact or ‘tank’ effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>In the DHT study, there were no such within-replicate differences and no significant effects of androgen exposure on albumen gland weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>In general, gastropod albumen gland size is thought to be related to accumulation of secretory products in the tissue, due to different stages of the egg-laying cycle [47,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Enlarged albumen glands were reported just before egg laying in Helisoma duryi [49] and in L. stagnalis egg laying status has also been shown to affect albumen gland size with lower weights in those snails that had laid more eggs [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>This factor could account for the variation in albumen gland size in the MT study, as some individuals may have laid eggs whereas others had not. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>In vertebrate models, histopathological changes to gland structure or development are also reported in androgen-exposed individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>For example, in pubertal male rats, histology of the seminal vesicle and prostate gland show enhanced glandular development (after 1 mg/kg/day Testosterone Propionate by subcutaneous injection) [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>In comparison, no histological impact of MT or DHT exposure was observed in the albumen gland or the Glandular Complex (GC) of androgen-exposed B. glabrata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Differences were observed between individual snails in the staining of the epithelium of the tubules in the albumen gland, but these variations were found across all treatments, and were due to the presence of more vacuolated cytoplasm and less secretory granules in the epithelium [47,52], possibly due to variation in the egg-laying cycle of the snails at the time of sampling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>A varying appearance in the structure, such as dilation of the tubules of the albumen gland, has been linked with different physiological states due to metabolic processes and sexual activity in L. stagnalis [53] and has been reported in control snails by Czech et al. [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>The lack of effects of MT or DHT exposure on secondary sexual glands in B. glabrata is somewhat in contrast to previously reported experiments with L. stagnalis, which showed a low level of degeneration to the albumen and prostate glands after 8 weeks exposure to 100 ng/L MT in adult snails [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Differences in species and the timing of exposure (adult vs. juvenile) may account for the different observations between our study and that of Czech et al. [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>In a range of vertebrate models, androgen exposure has been documented to impact gonadal development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>For example, female pubertal rats exposed to 200 mg/kg/day MT had significantly reduced ovary weight [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes), developmentally exposed to androgens via the water, in a similar way to B. glabrata in this study, exhibited male skewed sex ratios and testis-ova at average concentrations of 27.75 ng/L MT [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>In another study juvenile P. promelas exposed to 20 and 200 ng/L of DHT for 45 days induced significant advancement in spermatogenesis in males and caused sexual disruption in females [33]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>No differences in oogenesis or spermatogenesis were observed in any of the MT or DHT exposed snails compared to controls and no significant effect of androgen exposure (MT or DHT) was found on the ovotestis weight. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>The lack of gross histopathological changes to the ovotestis in B. glabrata exposed to MT is in contrast to the recent work of Rivero-Wendt et al. [42], in which adult B. glabrata were exposed semi-statically to MT (0.01 mg/L to 1 mg/L MT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>Rivero-Wendt et al. [42] reported that nominal MT concentrations of 0.1 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L significantly increased the area of ovotestis acini occupied by mature spermatozoa, compared to the water control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>This might suggest much higher concentrations of MT than used in our study (mg/L vs. ng/L) could stimulate spermatogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>However, it is also worth noting that in their study the solvent control (0.001% ethanol) snails showed the largest average area occupied by sperm (almost double that of the water control). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>This suggests MT may not have been the overriding factor in increasing sperm production in these snails and highlights the importance of considering possible solvent mediated affects in toxicology studies [55]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>We identified differences in gene expression using SSH between pooled B. glabrata albumen gland from MT-exposed (125 ng/L MT) and solvent control samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent investigation of expression of each gene in individual snails revealed that these differences were mainly attributable to one individual, even though equal amounts of RNA had been pooled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>This one individual may have been responding to MT, however the difference could be due to other factors, such as whether the individual had just laid an egg mass. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>The absence of significant dose-dependent physiological (DHT and MT) or molecular responses (MT) on B. glabrata was surprising considering the number of publications that suggest gastropod mollusks have physiological levels of vertebrate-type androgens naturally occurring in their tissues, use vertebrate-type androgens in reproduction or are reproductively disrupted by exogenous androgen or anti-androgen exposure [11,14,15,25,27,42,58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>For example, in the freshwater prosobranch gastropod, Marisa cornuarietis, MT showed masculinizing (imposex) effects in adult female snails from 100 ng/L (nominal) to complete virilization at 1 μg/L (nominal) [11], and disruption to both spermatogenesis, oogenesis and overall fecundity above nominal concentrations of 100 ng/L MT [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of publications documenting effects of androgens are in prosobranch (generally gonochoristic) gastropods rather than pulmonate (hermaphrodite) gastropods such as B. glabrata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Considering the large evolutionary divergence of gastropods it might not be surprising that they show different responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>However, a number of studies have suggested either a role of vertebrate androgens in pulmonate gastropod reproduction in Biomphalaria alexandrina [25] or stimulatory effects of androgens to reproductive tissues in B. glabrata [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>As previously discussed, Rivero-Wendt and colleagues may have identified a solvent effect on spermatogenesis, rather than an effect of steroid androgens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>Evidence for the localization of the androgen receptor in B. alexandrina was obtained using a monoclonal antibody for the mouse protein [25], which, since we now know that there is no snail AR homologue [29], may have been due to non-specific or incorrect binding in the snail. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Recent reviews on vertebrate sex steroids in mollusks by Scott [26,59] also question the validity and robustness of published studies on this topic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>For instance, Scott [59] documents the following: of the 17 studies which report reproductive or endocrine effects of steroid androgens in mollusks none had within study replication (e.g. replicate dosed tanks) and only one study measured the concentration of chemical dosed into the tank to verify exposure level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Indeed, by using replication and assessing within-treatment variation in our study we found variation between replicate tanks could be more significant than those between treatment concentrations, allowing us to discount possible chemical mediated effects as the driver of the variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>This may not have been apparent if we had only used one tank per test concentration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>In a recent publication by Giusti et al.[60] (in another pulmonate gastropod L. stagnalis), which measured exposure concentrations and used adequate replication, it was found that although testosterone altered the expression of 49 proteins in L. stagnalis, many of these proteins were considered to be modulated as a general toxicity response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Specific reproductive proteins such as Piwi; a germline stem-cell protein, and ovipostatin; a protein produced in the prostate, were not found to be significantly altered by exposure to testosterone, although they were altered by other known vertebrate endocrine disruptive compounds [60] via, as yet, unidentified mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Indeed, neither Giusti et al. [17,45] nor Czech et al. [16] found significant reproductive effects of testosterone or methyltestosterone in adult L. stagnalis, suggesting vertebrate type androgens do not regulate reproduction in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Consequently Giusti et al. [45] concluded that testosterone would not be a good positive control in reproductive chemical testing in L. stagnalis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>These reports in adult pulmonate gastropods, as well as the recent finding that B. glabrata draft genome [29] contains no convincing orthologues for the AR, support our finding of no significant effect of steroid androgens on B glabrata reproductive physiology. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>In summary, we assessed gross morphology, histopathology and gene expression to identify possible effects of androgens on developing B. glabrata. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>We confirmed that the snails were exposed to the compounds in the expected nominal range and used within study replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>However, none of these techniques showed significant effects of androgen exposure, demonstrating that growth and development of the reproductive tract in B. glabrata is unaffected by developmental exposure (embryo through to sexual maturity) to either MT or DHT, both of which are potent androgens in vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The paucity of physiological and molecular effects of androgen exposure in B. glabrata in our laboratory is supported by systematic genomic searches for the androgen receptor in the preliminary B. glabrata genome, where we found no convincing orthologues for the androgen receptor despite identifying 39 other nuclear receptors representing all major NR groups [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The consequence of these findings are significant and suggest B. glabrata and possibly other mollusks species would not be appropriate models for testing androgenic or anti-androgenic compound and that this species could not be used as a replacement for vertebrates in testing androgenic or anti-androgenic compounds toxicity or mode of action testing research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Although outside of the scope of the B. glabrata research presented here, investigation of the functions of other mollusk nuclear receptors may produce further understanding of general mollusk endocrinology and underpin mechanistically appropriate methods of using mollusks to support the 3Rs strategy in reducing and replacing vertebrates in biomedical research. </plain></SENT>
