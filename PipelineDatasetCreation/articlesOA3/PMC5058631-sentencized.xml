</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulins or antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins essential to the vertebrate immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulins of the γ isotype (IgGs) are composed of 2 identical light chains (LCs) of either κ or λ isotype and 2 identical IgG heavy chains (HCs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The most prevalent isotype found in human serum, IgGs are also commonly used as therapeutics, with &gt;30 monoclonal IgGs approved for therapeutic use in a wide range of indications.1 The domain architecture of IgGs is complex, and includes both V- and C-class Ig-fold domains.2 The V-class Ig-fold domains of the HC and LC (VH and VL, respectively) are responsible for the immense diversity that allows the immune system to generate an adaptive immune response to eliminate pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The variable domains are a combination of a myriad of V, D and J (VH) or V and J (VL) gene elements, and are paired with one another to provide improved diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Upon immune stimulation, these domains undergo hypersomatic mutation directing their affinity toward a particular antigen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The V-genes are spliced with the constant (C-class Ig-fold) HC and LC genes, and the full HC and LC proteins are expressed, assembled via chaperones and secreted by immune B cells.3 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Once assembled, IgGs have the well-known ‘Y’ shape comprising 2 Fab (antigen-binding fragment) moieties consisting of the HC/LC pairing region that are the antibody ‘arms’ and the Fc (fragment crystallizable) moiety consisting of the HC homodimerization/FcγR binding region that is the ‘stalk’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The Fab and Fc regions are distinct globular protein units separated by a flexible hinge region with little to no noncovalent interactions between them.4,5 Once assembled, both the Fab and Fc regions are disulfide-linked dimers (hetero- and homodimer, respectively) with uncommonly high solubility and thermal stability properties compared to most other human proteins.5 The general high stability/solubility contributes to long-term plasma residency and their utility as therapeutics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This is not to suggest that stability/solubility fallibilities have not been observed for monoclonal IgGs when pushed to manufacturing and formulations extremes.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The folding and stability of Fabs is complex and highly inter-domain dependent with a strong cooperativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The CH1 domain within the Fab HC, is intrinsically unfolded in isolation and binds to the BiP chaperone, requiring LC binding for chaperone release and antibody secretion.3 Most biophysical studies with Fabs have focused on IgG heavy chains associated with κ light chains.7 Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the inter-domain interactions within Fabs was provided by Röthlisberger et al., who performed a dissection of the energetics of predominately murine Fabs with varied VH and VL thermal stability and showed that the VH/Vκ and CH1/Cκ heterodimeric subunits significantly stabilize one another not through specific non-covalent interactions between the VH/CH1 interface or the Vκ/Cκ interface, where inter-domain interactions are sparse, but by acting as ideal linkers to stabilize each heterodimeric interface (VH/Vκ and CH1/Cκ) kinetically.8 Where the VH/Vκ domains are stability limiting, addition of CH1/Cκ subunits can increase their thermal unfolding midpoints (Tm) by as much as 15–25 °C.7,9 In κ LC Fabs with low variable domain stabilities, variable domains can unfold first, while in Fabs with very stable variable domains, CH1/Cκ can unfold first.5,8,10 However, most κ LC Fabs contain moderately stable variable domains that unfold cooperatively with CH1/Cκ within the Tm range of 70–80 °C.7,8,10,11 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We wished to expand what we know of the domain interactions within Fabs, in particular the relationship between the VH/VL subunits and CH1/CL subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The thermodynamic relationship between VH/Vλ and CH1/Cλ is much less studied than that of VH/Vκ and CH1/Cκ, even though immunoglobulins containing λ LCs are of similar prevalence as those with κ LCs in humans.12 Interestingly, the extracellular region of α/β T-cell receptors (TCRs) maintain a heterodimeric structure similar to antibody Fabs,13 with both the TCRα and TCRβ chains consisting of N-terminal V-genes and C-terminal C-class domains (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Like antibody Fabs, the TCR heterodimer is stabilized by an inter-chain disulfide at the C-terminus of the C-class domains before membrane insertion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In this study, we generate Fabs with both native and non-native V-gene and C-gene pairings (Fig. 1) and characterize their unfolding properties to compare inter-domain subunit cooperativity within antibody Fabs of different light chain and overall constant domain composition.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To fully understand the inter-domain interactions within the Fabs we generated, it was important to have benchmark measurements with the constant domains (Cκ and Cλ) and heterodimeric constant domain subunits (CH1/Cκ and CH1/Cλ) in isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>We elected to perform differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to take advantage of the technique's ability to discriminate complex, multi-domain unfolding events (typical for immunoglobulins) due to the derivative nature of the thermal unfolding data and ability to experimentally measure ΔHunfolding.18 When studied by DSC, both Cκ and Cλ demonstrate single and reversible thermal unfolding curves (albeit 30% reduced ΔHcal for Cλ upon cooling and reheating). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The midpoints of thermal denaturation (Tms) were low (58–59 °C) compared to what has generally been observed for intact Fabs.5 IgG1 CH1 did not express in isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This is not surprising given that it is known to be intrinsically unfolded in isolation.19 The CH1/Cκ and CH1/Cλ subunits, however, did express well in the E. coli periplasm or when secreted from mammalian cells as heavy chain fusions to IgG1-Fc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>DSC experiments with the heterodimers showed a significant increase in thermal stability for both Cκ and Cλ upon complexing with CH1 (Fig. 3A, 4A, Table 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Thermal unfolding by DSC of the wild-type pertuzumab Fab compared to the individual VH/Vκ and CH1/Cκ subunits demonstrated the typical large increase in both stability and cooperativity that is often observed when combining the variable and constant domain subunits within κ LC-containing Fabs (Fig. 3A).8,11 Within the scFv, one domain was clearly less stable and was identified below as VH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>As a native-like Fab consisting of all 4 domains, VHCH1/VκCκ, all the domains are stabilized to the extent that they unfold cooperatively as a single unit. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>We next evaluated the specific ability of the CH1/Cκ subunit to promote such a dramatic increase in Fab stability when paired with VH/Vκ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>In their 2005 report, Röthlisberger and coworkers describe that the stabilization of the individual VH/Vκ and CH1/Cκ subunits is likely not the result of non-covalent stabilizing interactions between the V-genes and C-genes since this interface is quite small, but rather the result of a stronger overall interface between HC and LC, with each subunit acting as an ideal linker for one another, which stabilizes the HC/LC interface.8 Based on this, we wished to learn how specific the CH1/Cκ subunit stabilization is to VH/Vκ subunits and whether related constant domain subunits could similarly stabilize the VH/Vκ subunit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The first and most obvious subunit to replace CH1/Cκ is CH1/Cλ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Structurally, Cκ and Cλ are similar and use similar residues to interact with antibody CH1 domains; however, the sequence homology is only 40%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated replacing the entire CH1/Cκ subunit with the TCR Cα/Cβ subunit, which is structurally homologous and has been shown capable of pairing with VH/Vκ.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>DSC data with the native and chimeric Fab constructs clearly shows that the native and stabilizing pairing of CH1/Cκ with VH/Vκ is highly specific and not easily reproduced with structural homologues (Fig. 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>The pertuzumab Fab containing Cλ instead of Cκ does experience some stabilization via the combination; the VH domain Tm increases by 9°C (Table 2), but unfolds at a temperature too low compared to the Vκ and CH1/Cλ subunit to observe cooperativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>We identified the VH domain as the domain of least stability by adding destabilizing mutations within VH and analyzing the resulting thermal unfolding profile (Fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The Cλ-containing pertuzumab Fab secreted well from HEK293F cells as a well-behaved heterodimer of roughly 50 kDa, unlike the pertuzumab scFv, which expressed poorly and contained a high percentage of aggregates. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The protein α-lactalbumin was used as a positive control because it is known to bind ANS under acidic conditions where it loses its binding capacity for Ca2+ and forms a partially unfolded state with significant α-helical content.24 Only at pH 2.0 did the Cα/Cβ-containing Fab bind ANS, suggesting that a partially folded state could only be induced under non-native conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>It seems unlikely that Cα/Cβ are fully unfolded at neutral pH given the large amount of exposed hydrophobic surface area that would be expected to induce aggregates, a trait that is not observed, and the fact that the Cα/Cβ inter-domain disulfide bond forms so readily. </plain></SENT>
