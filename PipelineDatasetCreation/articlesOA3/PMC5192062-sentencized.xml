<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It can occasionally be pathogenic causing oral thrush, intertrigo and genital candidiasis in healthy populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in immunocompromised hosts, Candida can cause chronic mucocutaneous or invasive infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by recurrent or persistent infections affecting the nails, skin and oral and genital mucosae caused by Candida spp., often C. albicans.1, 2 CMC is one of the infectious phenotypes in patients with inherited or acquired T-cell deficiencies.3, 4 These clinical observations demonstrate the pivotal role of T-cell immunity in host defense against superficial Candida infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that Th17 cells, together with other cells expressing retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γT (RORγT), such as γδT cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells, produce interleukin (IL)-17 and have an essential role in host defense against mucocutaneous Candida infections in mice and humans.2, 3, 5, 6 In contrast, invasive fungal infections are also observed in patients with quantitative and/or qualitative disorders of neutrophils, such as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), autosomal-recessive (AR) caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency and neutropenic conditions.7, 8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients with autosomal-dominant (AD) hyper IgE syndrome (HIES), AD signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function (GOF), AR autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), or AR CARD9, IL-12 receptor β1 (IL-12Rβ1), IL-12p40 or RORγT deficiencies, develop CMC as one of the major infectious phenotypes associated with the other clinical and infectious manifestations.2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 These specific conditions are designated as Syndromic CMC (Table 1) and occur in association with impaired IL-17 immunity (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with AD HIES develop CMC and staphylococcal infections associated with other clinical manifestations, such as elevated serum IgE, characteristic facial features, pneumatocele and retained primary teeth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These patients have severely decreased frequencies of circulating IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells, probably associated with impaired STAT3-dependent signaling downstream of IL-6, IL-21 and/or IL-23.15, 17, 19, 20 The presence of CMC is also identified in one patient with AR HIES with TYK2 mutation.21 However, a follow-up study reported that the core clinical phenotype of TYK2 deficiency is mycobacterial and/or viral infections, with an association of CMC.22 Patients with APECED present with CMC in addition to polyendocrinopathy and ectodermal dysplasia.23, 24 These patients produce neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-17A, IL-17F and/or IL-22, leading to development of CMC.9, 13, 25 Neutralizing antibodies against these Th17-produced cytokines are also identified in patients with thymoma who develop CMC.9 Patients with AR CARD9 deficiency develop CMC, deep dermatophytosis and invasive fungal infections.7, 8, 26 They present with decreased frequency of circulating IL-17-producing T cells and impaired neutrophil-killing of C. albicans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with AR IL-12p40 or IL-12Rβ1 deficiency develop Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), a primary immunodeficiency with selective host susceptibility to intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis BCG, environmental mycobacteria and Salmonella that is associated with impaired IL-12-induced interferon gamma (IFN-γ) signaling.27, 28, 29 These patients occasionally develop mild CMC and show decreased frequencies of circulating IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells as a result of impaired IL-23 responses.10, 16, 17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In 2011, AD STAT1-GOF was found to be responsible for CMC disease (CMCD), typically defined as CMC in patients without any other prominent clinical signs.30, 31 Subsequent studies revealed that AD STAT1-GOF is the major genetic etiology of CMCD, explaining more than half of all CMCD cases.32, 33, 34 In the classification of primary immunodeficiency compiled by the Primary Immunodeficiency Expert Committee of the International Union of Immunological Societies, AD STAT1-GOF, together with four genetic etiologies directly related to defective IL-17 signaling, is categorized as CMC, which is often referred to as CMCD.35, 36 However, recent studies revealed that patients with GOF mutations in STAT1 present with broad clinical manifestations, including bacterial, viral, mycobacterial and invasive fungal infections, autoimmune diseases, aneurysms and tumors.33, 34 Therefore, AD STAT1-GOF is categorized as Syndromic CMC in this review. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Recently, a new primary immunodeficiency due to biallelic mutations in RORC, encoding RORγ and RORγT, was identified (designated as AR RORγT deficiency).12 RORγT is a master transcription factor of Th17 cells; thus, these patients showed a markedly decreased frequency of circulating IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells, which probably underlies the CMC seen in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, all RORγT-deficient patients also developed MSMD, probably because of the impairment of IFN-γ production associated with mycobacterial infections.12 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The definition of CMCD is typically CMC in patients without any other prominent clinical signs.1, 37 However, this definition is not strict, and some CMCD patients have other infectious diseases, such as infection with Staphylococcus aureus.38, 39 Therefore, the term CMCD is now used to refer to patients presenting with CMC as the major clinical phenotype, and its etiology is neither related to genes known to cause severe combined immunodeficiency or combined immunodeficiency, nor genes responsible for Syndromic CMC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Four of the five genes implicated in CMCD (IL17F, IL17RA, IL-17RC and TRAF3IP2/ACT1) are directly involved in IL-17 signaling (Table 1).38, 39, 40 These genetic disorders clearly reveal the pure and nonredundant role of IL-17 in mucocutaneous immunity to Candida in humans (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The IL-17 cytokine family consists of six members (IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E and IL-17F), whereas the IL-17 receptor family consists of five members (IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE; Figure 2).41 IL-17 cytokines form disulfide-linked homodimers, and IL-17A and IL-17F can also form heterodimers (IL-17A/F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>IL-17A and IL-17F share the strongest sequence homology and are produced by a distinct subset of T helper cells, Th17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Receptors for all IL-17 cytokines also form homodimers or heterodimers, and each combination recognizes distinct IL-17 cytokines, with IL-17RA as the common subunit for each complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, the receptor complex formed by IL-17RA/C recognizes IL-17A and IL-17F, whereas the complex formed by IL-17RA/B recognizes IL-17E (CD25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In each case, signaling triggers recruitment of ACT1 as an adaptor molecule for downstream signaling (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>IL-17A and IL-17RA are the original members of the IL-17 cytokine and receptor families, respectively, and, as such, are commonly referred to as IL-17 and IL-17R. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Mutations in four genes, IL17F, IL17RA, IL-17RC and TRAF3IP2 (which encode ACT1) that directly relate to IL-17A/F-induced, IL-17RA/C-mediated signaling, have been identified in patients with CMCD.38, 39, 40 Furthermore, mutations in IL17RA and TRAF3IP2 also affect IL-17E-induced, IL-17RA/B-mediated signaling (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These clinical and experimental observations strongly suggest that defects in IL-17 signaling have a pivotal role in host mucocutaneous immunity against Candida in humans. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>HIES is a primary immunodeficiency disease, which is characterized by elevated serum IgE levels, recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, eczema and pulmonary infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>It was first described in 1966 and was originally named Job's syndrome.42 HIES has either a dominant or recessive pattern of autosominal inheritance, with the rare AR HIES largely shown to be caused by mutations in DOCK8 (OMIM ID: 243700); in addition, AD HIES has been shown to be mainly caused by germline heterozygous STAT3 mutations (OMIM ID: 147060).15 STAT3 has a central role in signal transduction downstream of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The STAT3 mutations identified in AD HIES patients are loss-of-function (LOF) and exert a dominant-negative effect on wild-type STAT3-mediated signaling.15 In addition to their infectious phenotype, patients with STAT3 mutations present with multiple clinical manifestations, including characteristic facial features, high-arched palate, retained primary teeth, scoliosis, osteoporosis and hyperextensibility of joints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>STAT3-deficient patients also frequently develop CMC associated with other infectious and clinical manifestations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>A large cohort study, collecting 60 patients with germline STAT3 mutations, revealed that 85% of the STAT3-mutated patients develop CMC, including oral (63%), genital (18%), cutaneous (16%) and esophageal (8%) candidiasis and chronic onychomycosis (57%).43 C. albicans was the major pathogen isolated in 88% of collected samples obtained from infected sites.43 These patients have severely decreased frequency of circulating IL-17A- and IL-22-producing T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, naive CD4+ T cells isolated from patients demonstrated significantly impaired differentiation into Th17 cells, probably associated with impaired STAT3-dependent signaling downstream of IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23.15, 17, 19, 20 Together, AD HIES patients who develop CMC as one of the many clinical manifestations associated with impaired Th17 differentiation are thus categorized as Syndromic CMC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>APECED, also called APS-1 syndrome, is an AR inherited disorder caused by biallelic mutations in AIRE (OMIM ID:240300). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Affected patients suffer from autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, such as Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism and hypogonadism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>They also develop alopecia areata, vitiligo and ectodermal dystrophy, such as nail dystrophy, or dental enamel dysplasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>CMC is one of the major infectious phenotypes of APECED, observed in up to 98% of patients (Table 1).25 Patients with APECED develop neutralizing autoantibodies against cytokines IL-17A (41%), IL-17F (75%) and/or IL-22 (91%).9 However, no other anticytokine autoantibodies have been detected in these patients (including against IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, IL-23 or IFN-γ).13 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from APECED patients with CMC show decreased IL-17F and IL-22 secretion in vitro, following stimulation with heat-killed C. albicans hyphae,9 and this cellular phenotype is correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies against IL-17A, IL-17F and/or IL-22 in patient serum.9 These results clearly reveal that autoimmunity in APECED targets not only endocrine organs, but also IL-17 immunity via production of high titer of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in a specific impairment of host mucosal immunity to C. albicans.9 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>CARD9 is an intracellular adaptor molecule that, together with its binding partners BCL10, Malt1 and NEMO, mediates signals from C-type lectin-like receptors, Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, to induce transcription and production of proinflammatory cytokines via nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In 2009, a primary immunodeficiency, which associates with a genetic defect of CARD9, was identified in the patients who suffer from CMC and invasive fungal infections (OMIM ID:212050).7 A homozygous mutation, Q295X, in CARD9 was identified in those patients.7 Subsequent studies revealed that patients with AR CARD9 deficiency also suffer from deep dermatophytosis, invasive Exophiala dermatitidis, subcutaneous Phaeohyphomycosis and Candida-species meningoencephalitis and/or colitis, and are thus considered Syndromic CMC.18, 26, 44, 45 There are several reports describing a decreased frequency of circulating IL-17-producing cells in CARD9-deficient patients, probably explaining the clinical phenotype of CMC.7, 18, 45 On the other hand, several studies also report that the frequency of circulating IL-17-producing cells in CARD9-deficient patients is equivalent to healthy controls.44, 46 Therefore, there is some controversy regarding the frequency of circulating IL-17-producing cells in CARD9-deficient patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils kill both serum-opsonized and unopsonized C. albicans via distinct mechanisms; reactive oxygen species production by the NADPH oxidase system has an important role for neutrophil-killing of serum-opsonized Candida, whereas neutrophil-killing of unopsonized Candida requires complement receptor type 3 (CR3) and CARD9.47 Neutrophils from CARD9-deficient patients show a selective C. albicans-killing defect that is CR3- and CARD9-dependent, but NADPH oxidase-independent.8 Furthermore, patients with AR CARD9 deficiency are particularly predisposed to meningoencephalitis caused by Candida species.18 This might be explained by the enhanced requirement of CR3- and CARD9-dependent neutrophil-killing in the limited access of plasma proteins that is required for opsonization in cerebrospinal fluids,8 as well as the finding that neutrophils from CARD9-deficient patients normally inhibit germination of Aspergillus fumigatus, consistent with the clinical observation that no CARD9-deficient patients were reported to have Aspergillus species infection.8, 18 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the absence of IL-23 protein or defective cellular responses to IL-23 forms the likely molecular cause of CMC in these patients.10, 16, 17, 49, 50 Indeed, patients with AR-complete IL-12p40 or IL-12Rβ1 deficiencies show decreased frequencies of circulating IL-17-producing cells, albeit a less severe reduction than observed in patients with AD HIES. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Germline monoallelic hypomorphic or LOF-STAT1 mutations are responsible for AD MSMD (AD STAT1 deficiency; OMIM ID: 614892). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>These STAT1 mutations do not disturb STAT1 protein expression, but exert a dominant-negative effect on IFN-γ-induced STAT1-mediated signaling.48 In 2011, monoallelic GOF-STAT1 (OMIM ID: 614162) mutations were shown to cause the AD form of CMCD (Table 1).30, 31 These mutations impair dephosphorylation of STAT1, leading to hyperphosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr701 in response to IFN-γ, IFN-α/β and IL-27 stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>This finding has enabled the development of a simple flow cytometry-based STAT1 functional test to facilitate the diagnosis of CMCD patients with GOF-STAT1 mutations.32 GOF-STAT1 mutations are preferentially identified in the coiled-coil domain and DNA-binding domain of STAT1, whereas there are no obvious hot spots for LOF-STAT1 mutations (Figure 3).30, 31, 33, 48, 51, 52 Moreover, GOF-STAT1 mutations are a major mechanism of molecular pathogenesis of CMCD, and are reported to explain more than half of the cases of this disorder.30, 31, 32, 33, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>ACT1 is an adaptor molecule that interacts with multiple partners, including members of the IL-17R family.39, 41 Upon stimulation, ACT1 is recruited to IL-17RA, IL-17RB and/or IL-17RC (and probably IL-17RE) by homotypic dimerization of two SEFIR domains, and activates the NFκB, mitogen-activated protein kinase and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein pathways (Figure 2).39 ACT1 also has an inhibitory role in B-cell survival by negatively regulating CD40 and B-cell-activating factor receptor through interaction with TRAF3.75 The T536I ACT1 mutation does not disturb its protein expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>However, this mutation specifically impairs the homotypic interaction of ACT1 with IL-17RA, IL-17RB and IL-17RC, abolishing responses to IL-17A and IL-17F in fibroblasts and to IL-17E in leukocytes 39 (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
