</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>For group-living animals, the position of an individual relative to its group mates can have a significant impact on its fitness [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A number of influential early biologists (including Galton [3], Williams [4] and Hamilton [5]) posited that individuals should aim to minimize their exposure to potential predators by moving into areas of the group with greater local density (often towards the centre of the group [6]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Differences in age, sex, social rank or other individual properties can generate variation in susceptibility to risk [1,7–13], and studies in wild primates [14–16] and other animals [17,18] have often found that younger, or potentially more vulnerable, group members are found closer the group's centre. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, both theoretical [19] and empirical [20–23] work suggests that peripheral positions can also be associated with higher foraging success due to having first access to resources, and can give individuals better access to personal and social information [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In primates, males, who are typically larger and less vulnerable, are often found towards the front of moving groups [14,25–29] where they can gain earlier access to food [21,29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patterns of spatial positioning have also been linked to dominance, with high-ranking individuals typically occupying more central locations [14,20,29,31–33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>While the risks and rewards of individuals’ spatial positions are likely to be related to where they are located, relative to the global structure of their group [1,34], the mechanisms that result in individuals having consistent spatial positions need not rely on global information, but could arise from variation in individual movement patterns (e.g. speed [35,36]) and/or variation in how individuals move relative to others [37–41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Simulation studies have highlighted several potential mechanisms that generate differences in spatial positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Romey [41] first investigated how individual variation in interaction rules influenced spatial organization of groups, finding that individuals with smaller preferred nearest neighbour distances tended to end up at the centre of groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Couzin et al. [37] found that individuals with a smaller zone of repulsion (the distance below which they will be repelled from others) tended to be more central, and also found that faster individuals, or those that tended to align direction of travel more strongly with that of neighbours, tended to be located at, or close to, the front of groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Finally, Hemelrijk [42] suggested that the tendency of high-ranking individuals to occupy central positions could be an outcome of dominance interactions: when subordinate individuals are regularly displaced, their high relative mobility may cause them to occupy peripheral positions within the group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Despite extensive theoretical research, few empirical studies have tested whether variation in how individuals move or interact with others could drive the well-documented patterns of spatial organization in animal groups [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>One reason is that quantifying interaction rules requires highly detailed and spatially-explicit observations of many, or all, individuals within a group [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Further, many of the proposed mechanisms to explain patterns of spatial positioning are likely to be difficult to differentiate using observational data alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, a common feature of most proposed interaction rules is that slight differences in how they are parametrized, such as the strength of the interaction, the interaction range or the number of conspecifics that an individual interacts with, can lead to variation in how individuals are positioned relative to others in their group [37,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Having large nearest neighbour distances, a faster movement speed or higher rates of displacing others will all result in individuals having fewer close neighbours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Simply maintaining cohesion with a smaller or larger number of neighbours is also a mechanism that could drive spatial organization in animal groups. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Despite the large number of studies linking characteristics such as age, sex, and dominance to variation in within-group positioning, we still have little understanding of the role of individual differences in driving patterns of spatial organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="?"><plain>Are individuals, rather than age–sex or dominance classes, found in consistent spatial positions? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="?"><plain>Are individual differences in spatial positioning linked to variation in how they move or interact with other group members? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tracked the movements of nearly all members of a wild baboon troop (Papio anubis) using simultaneous high-resolution (1 Hz) GPS over the course of 14 days (see electronic supplementary material, supplemental experimental procedures and figure S1) [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We first evaluate the degree of consistency in where individuals are positioned relative to their group mates, both in terms of their distance from the centre and their distance towards the front of the group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>We then use a location prediction algorithm [46,47] that takes information about the future movement of group members to predict the location of a focal individual, and the known trajectory of that individual to estimate the prediction error. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We modified this algorithm to evaluate the number of neighbours (which we call the neighbourhood size) that resulted in the smallest prediction error for each individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We then tested whether an individual's neighbourhood size correlates with the patterns of intra-group positioning we observe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Finally, we implement a simple movement model, inspired by our findings, to investigate whether a mechanism based on variation in neighbourhood size can drive patterns of spatial organization in groups. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Fieldwork was conducted at the Mpala Research Center (MRC) in central Kenya. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>From 21 to 29 July 2012, we captured 33 of 46 members of a troop of wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) using two arrays of individual traps (1 m3) baited with maize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Seven individuals were too small to be fit with a collar and were immediately released. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We chemically immobilized the rest of the baboons using ketamine (15 mg kg−1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>We estimated the age of each individual based on patterns of dental eruption and evidence of sexual maturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Individuals with deciduous dentition were classified as juveniles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Subadult and adult males were distinguished based on their body size and the development of secondary sexual characteristics, including their mantle, musculature and canine size and morphology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Females were considered adult if they had full, permanent dentition and were parous (based on the elongation and darkening of their nipples) or showed evidenced of cycling (based on the morphology of their sexual skin). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Nulliparous females that were cycling but still had one or more deciduous teeth were classified as subadult (see electronic supplementary material, table S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We fit 26 baboons (14 adults, 10 subadults and two large juveniles) with GPS collars (e-Obs Digital Telemetry, Gruenwald, German). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>One collar failed almost immediately, so analyses reported here are based on movement data from 25 individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Collared adults and subadults represented approximately 80% (23/29) of the total number of adults and subadults in the troop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Adults and large subadults were fit with D-cell battery collars weighing 300 g while smaller, C-cell collars (230 g) were used on small subadults and juveniles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>All collars weighed less than 5% of individual body weight, and were equipped with a break-away mechanism (Advanced Telemetry Solutions, Isanti, MN, USA) that automatically detached the collar at the end of the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>GPS collars were programmed to record location estimates continuously at 1 Hz during daylight hours (6–18 h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Sampling at this rate, C-cell collars had sufficient charge to collect data for 14 days, while D-cell collars remained active for approximately 30 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>All analyses presented here use data from the first 14 days of the study because the majority of collars remained active during this period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>However, several collars failed early due to a programming bug, and so the total number of individuals tracked each day varied between 16 and 25 (electronic supplementary material, table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>To estimate error, we conducted a test walk with a pair of GPS collars fixed 1 m apart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The average relative positional error was 0.26 m (95% CI: 0.03–0.69). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, applied limited processing to the raw data, only interpolating few missing points and removing erroneous points (see electronic supplementary material). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The alpha male was determined via direct behavioural observations of his consistent priority of access to food, displacements of other individuals in the troop, and his receipt of submissive behaviour from other individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>However, because the troop we studied was not habituated to human observers and baboons were not individually identifiable, we could not collect sufficient observations to reconstruct the rest of the dominance hierarchy through direct behavioural observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Instead, an approximate dominance ranking for all troop members was determined by extracting approach–avoid interactions from the movement data using an automated procedure, and ranking the members of each sex separately based on an Elo score analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Although our inferred dominance hierarchy is consistent with our observations, our analyses also address patterns of spatial positioning related to age–sex class differences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>These are a good indicator of an individual's general dominance within the troop, with all males being dominant over all females. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Candidate approach–avoid events were saved as .kml files, displayed in Google Earth, and evaluated by an observer blind to the identities of the interacting individuals (M.C.C.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Interactions that were determined to be very likely to be displacements (N = 290) were subsequently used to calculate each individual's Elo score [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Elo score-based ranking is a standard approach that computes scores based on the wins and losses among pairs of individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The basic principle of this ranking algorithm is that wins against competitors who are much more highly ranked result in a larger increase in score than wins against closely ranked competitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Individuals that repeatedly win contests (in this case displace others) will gain high scores, whereas the scores of those that are displaced will drop (as a result of losing these contests). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Thus, higher scores mean that individuals are more dominant (they were the ‘displacer’ more often than they were ‘displaced’). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Because Elo scores are dependent on the order at which events occur (i.e. the scores are updated based on the current difference in the two interacting individuals’ values), we recalculated individuals’ Elo scores 1000 times while randomizing the order of events each time, and took the mean of these Elo scores to determine an individual's dominance rank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>We note that the alpha male (2427) determined from this procedure was consistent with the individual we had identified as the alpha male through direct behavioural observation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>We combined generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with permutation tests [49–51] to quantify (i) the stability of individuals’ spatial positions, (ii) the patterns of positioning related to age and sex and (iii) whether spatial positioning was related to dominance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Analysis (i). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>We first measured the stability of individuals’ spatial positions by fitting a model of normalized distance from centroid with individual identity (ID) fitted as a random effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Distances were normalized by computing the z-score (subtracting the mean distance across all group members at a given moment and dividing by the variance in these distances) to account for changes in group spread over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>From this model, we extracted the proportion of the variance that was explained by individual identities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We tested whether this value was higher than expected by chance using a permutation test where we fit the same model after randomizing individuals' identities each day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>That is, each day we independently swapped the identity labels of individuals present, which enabled us to maintain the structural integrity of daily tracks, while randomizing identities across the 14 days of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>By repeating this procedure 1000 times, we generated a distribution of per cent variance explained by identity from which we calculated a two-tailed p-value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>This approach also enabled us to control for the changes in the presence/absence of individuals on different days arising from collar failures (see electronic supplementary material, table S1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Analysis (ii). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>We tested whether there was a significant overall effect of age and sex class on the patterns of individual spatial positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>We assigned each individual to one of five age–sex classes, and added this factor as a fixed effect to the model described above (individual identity was included as a random effect in every model). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>To assess whether the effect of age–sex class was greater than expected by chance, we measured the variance in the coefficient values in the observed model, and compared this to the distribution of variances in coefficient values from 1000 permutations of the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>This permutation test differed from the procedure described above because we randomized the individual attributes across all days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>That is, we swapped the identity and the age–sex class data together, and did this across all days together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>This model maintains the consistency of GPS tracks both within and across days and the consistency of identity with age-sex class. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>To test whether differences existed between age–sex class (rather than overall across all classes), we performed pairwise comparisons for each combination of age–sex classes (i.e. two factors in each model) by subsetting the data where we excluded individuals from other age–sex classes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>We used the same permutation test to evaluate the statistical significance of each model, but this time comparing the observed coefficient value to the distribution of coefficient values drawn from applying the same model to the 1000 permutated versions of the data [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Note that in these pairwise comparisons, we excluded the juvenile age–sex class because only two juveniles were present in the data. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the association between social dominance and spatial positioning using a model of normalized distance from the centroid as a function of dominance rank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>In this model, we fit dominance rank as a fixed effect and controlled for age–sex class patterns by including age–sex class as a random effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>To evaluate statistical significance, we compared the observed coefficient value of the dominance effect to a distribution drawn using the same approach as described in analysis (ii) applied to 1000 permutated versions of the data, where in each permutation we randomized the dominance rank of individuals across all days. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>We tested whether our positioning results were biologically meaningful by comparing them to individual's measures of surroundedness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Surroundedness is a measure based on circular statistics that has been proposed as a robust measure of spatial centrality within groups [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated the stability of individual spatial positions, as well as the effects of age–sex class and dominance along the front-to-back axis (where a position of 0 is at the centre of the group and positive values are towards the front in the direction of travel). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Revealing the mechanisms that determine how animals form and maintain groups is fundamental to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of social organization [37,53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>The study of the spatial organization of baboon troops in particular has had a long history, from the original proposal of DeVore &amp; Washburn [9] that adult males surround juveniles to protect them from predators, to more recent theoretical work that has emphasized that positioning patterns may arise through individuals optimizing the trade-off between predation risk and foraging competition [19,54–56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In our study, we observed that although individual positioning within baboon troops is highly dynamic, individuals showed consistent patterns of within-group spatial positioning, with their distributions of positions, relative to the group's centre and direction, being consistent across days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>As has been reported in previous work on primates [14–16] and other animals [57], individual differences in spatial positioning were found to be associated with both age and sex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>We found that subadults (in particular subadult males) were generally positioned closer to the group centre than adults, and were consequently more surrounded by troop mates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>This observation is broadly consistent with the hypothesis that more vulnerable members of the group should be more sensitive to predation risk, and thus prefer to occupy positions in which they are more surrounded by their conspecifics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>We also found that within a given age–sex class, dominant individuals tended to occupy more central positions within the group than subordinates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>That higher-ranked animals were more central is consistent with previous empirical results from a range of taxa [21,22,31,42,57–59], and with the theory that dominant individuals can better afford central positions as they can displace competitors from food sources [6,42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>While many studies report consistent inter-individual, or class-level, differences in spatial positioning within groups, few address the underlying mechanisms that could drive such patterns [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Differences in position could easily result from some individuals being more strongly attracted to (or repulsed by) the centre of the group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>However, this would require animals to maintain a global overview of where all, or most other, group members are positioned, a feat that becomes more challenging when group sizes exceed a few individuals or in habitats that limit sensory perception. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>Theoretical models of collective motion have repeatedly shown that group-level coordination can emerge from individuals responding only to nearby neighbours (i.e. following simple local interaction rules) without any need for global awareness [37,60,61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>For example, in simulation models where individuals are programmed with different parameters for their repulsion rules, those using rules that lead to smaller nearest neighbour distances tend to occupy more central positions [37,41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Our results are consistent with a simple local mechanism that could generate the emergent patterns of spatial positioning that we observe—individuals that maintain cohesion with a larger number of neighbours inherently end up at the centre of the group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The reason for this result is simple—the centroid of a greater number of an individual's nearest neighbours will on average be closer to the centre of the group [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Thus, the patterns of consistent individual positioning that have been widely observed in animal aggregations may not require individuals to have global information about their group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Instead, differences in position can emerge from a simple geometrical truism, highlighting the potential generality of neighbourhood size as a mechanism underlying spatial organization in baboons and other animal aggregations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Our analysis also allows us to reject the possibility that the negative relationship we observe between individuals’ neighbourhood sizes and their mean distance from the troop centroid is purely an artefact of averaging, whereby individuals who spent more time near the centre have more data from these high-k instances, and consequently, appeared to have a larger neighbourhood size on average. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>If this were the case, we would then expect those same individuals to have low k values on the rarer occasions when they are found near the periphery of the group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>By incorporating only a narrow range of individuals’ current distances from the centroid at the time of prediction, essentially controlling for this potential bias, we found that the negative relationship between individuals’ k values and their mean distance from the centroid was maintained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>That is, individuals with higher k values have higher k values regardless of where they are currently positioned in the group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that individual's neighbourhood size is an individual-level characteristic, and not a by-product of its current spatial position. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether differences in movement alone, as opposed to movement resulting from interactions, could explain patterns of spatial positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In homing pigeons (Columbia livia), individual differences in speed have been shown to explain many of the patterns of positioning and leadership [35,36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in groups with stop–go movements, commonly found in terrestrial organisms, more active individuals could be in peripheral positions more often if their high activity means that they keep reaching the group edge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, we found no relationship between the per cent of time that individuals spent moving and their distance from the centroid (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results are not directly explained by simple differences in movement behaviour. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>By ruling out alternative explanations, our study lends credence to the hypothesis that variation in local interaction rules drives the global patterns of spatial organization frequently observed in primates and other animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Baboons that maintain cohesion with a larger set of neighbours could be drawn towards the centre of the group without any need for information about the locations and configuration of all troop mates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>While this local mechanism provides a plausible explanation for how patterns of positioning relative to the centre of the group can emerge, it does not address the patterns of front-to-back positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Theoretical models have shown that differences in local interactions can lead to self-sorting along the front–back axis [37], and frontal positions have been linked to differences in individual motivation to gain preferential access to food sources [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Any such factor adding a greater force (or speed) for some individual in the direction of movement could lead to variation in front–back patterns of positioning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Our study does not reject the hypothesis that variation in spatial positioning is linked to trade-offs in costs/benefits of having different spatial positions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Instead, we suggest that variation in neighbourhood size could be a simple mechanism on which selection arising from cost/benefit trade-offs can act, as neighbourhood sizes could be closely linked to competitive environments or safety from predators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>For example, following the Hemelrijk dominance hypothesis [42], subordinates could be more peripheral because having larger neighbourhood sizes could lead to more encounters, and agonistic interactions, with central dominants, thus driving the evolution of smaller neighbourhood sizes in subordinates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to that hypothesis, we only observed a within-class effect of dominance on centrality, and subordinate males were consistently more central than most adult males despite the fact that subordinate males should be most impacted by dominance interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Our models reveal a significant portion of variation in positioning determined by individual identity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>One factor that we could not address is the relatedness among individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Individuals with more kin, or those that are more related to others, could have stronger tendencies to remain closer to others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Such patterns could drive some of the individual-level differences in neighbourhood sizes we observed, and would be particularly strongly defined among adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>In fact, our data does suggest that there is greater individual variation in spatial positioning among adults compared to subadults (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Hence, such a mechanism warrants further investigation in a troop where more background information is available. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Elucidating the mechanism driving variation in within-group positioning is important, as it is this mechanism upon which selection arising from ecological conditions can act. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>Identifying the individual rules underlying group-level patterns is a challenging task, as many rule sets can give rise to similar aggregate patterns, making it difficult if not impossible to definitively pin down this mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>However, here we present a simple mechanism by which individuals could achieve consistent positions within groups, and show that such a mechanism is consistent with our data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Given its simplicity, individual variation in neighbourhood size (being attracted to, and maintaining cohesion with, varying numbers of individuals) is a plausible mechanism that could be responsible for shaping the spatial organization of many animal groups. </plain></SENT>
