Our previous studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the process of metastasis and in the migration of cancer cells.

The BDNF-induced migratory activity was blocked by inhibitors of ERK, PI3K and TrkB when MDA-MB-231 cells were examined, but only an inhibitor of ERK blocked this activity when HUVEC cells were used. Furthermore, decreased migratory activity was found for &#x025b3;BDNF and &#x025b3;TrkB cell lines. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of MDA-MB-231 cells showed that BDNF is a key factor that is able to regulate a network made up of metalloproteases and calmodulin. Protein expression levels in a tissue array of tumor slices were found to be correlated with patient prognosis and the results showed that there was significant correlation of TrkB expression, but not of BDNF. expressionwith patient DFS and OS.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that up-regulation of the BDNF signaling pathway seems tobe involved in the mechanism associated with early recurrence in triple negative breast cancer cell. In addition, BDNF can function in either an autocrine or a paracrine manner to increase the migration ability of both MDA-MB-231 cells and HUVEC cells. Finally, overexpression of TrkB, but not of BDNF, is significantly associated with a poor survival outcome for TNBC patients.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Taipei Veterans General Hospital Taiwan, ROC</institution></funding-source><award-id>(V104C-015, V105C-018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3046-6250</contrib-id><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Jen-Hwey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Center of Excellence for Cancer Research at Taipei Veterans General Hospital phase II</institution></funding-source><award-id>MOHW103-TD-B-111-02, MOHW104-TDU-B-211-124-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3046-6250</contrib-id><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Jen-Hwey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The genomic microarray analysis of the resected tumor tissues obtained from breast cancer patients can be accessed at GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95700">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95700</ext-link>)(GSE95700).

In spite of the availability of the multiple modalities for the treatment of breast cancer that have been developed over the past decades, chemotherapy remains the main treatment for TNBC. This approach does not result in survival levels and outcomes as good as those of other subtypes of breast cancer. Overall, TNBC accounts for approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and is generally found to be high grade and have a high proliferative index. Recent evidence has suggested that TNBC may be composed of a number of distinct subtypes; these have been identified either by gene expression analysis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]or using clinical/pathological correlations [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This heterogeneity impacts on clinical survival and outcome and differs between the various subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some subtypes may relapse quickly despite several types of therapy being used, while others may remain as a stable disease after proper adjuvant treatment. Although some promising targets, such as PARP and the genes involved in the DNA damage pathway, have been proposed as therapeutic targets for TNBC treatment, the critical biomarkers that are involved in the process of early metastasis still remains to be investigated in detail.</p><p>There has been good evidence to show that the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer metastasis and progression [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The cell types involved in the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment are not limited to stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but other cell types, such as macrophage and endothelial cells, are also involved. For example, Snail, when acetylated, modulates cancer cells to promote the recruitment of macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cancer cell growth and how these interact with their adjacent endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recent investigations have suggested that phosphorylation of Src and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1&#x003b1;) are key factors involved in the promotion of bone metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in the tumor progression of estrogen-negative breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the interaction between breast cancer cells and endothelial cells interaction remains unknown.</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the &#x0201c;neutrophin&#x0201d; family is widely expressed in mammalian brain. BDNF is well known to support the survival of existing neurons and to encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous research has focused on how BDNF is involved in neural development, neural regeneration, muscle repair, muscle regeneration and muscle differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] BDNF activates various biological functions and this mainly occurs via one cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, namely tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in the regulation of carcinogenesis and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, overexpression of BDNF and TrkB has been demonstrated to act as a predictor of a poor clinical outcome and a worse survival when patients are suffering from human bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and breast carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>BDNF/TrkB signaling plays important roles in tumor metastasis and is recognized as a therapeutic target in treatment of breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. While controversy that BDNF predicts adverse pathological and clinical outcome in breast cancer patients remains [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the precise mechanism by which BDNF is involved in cancer cell signaling, and how BDNF affects the microenvironment of breast cancers, is need to be further elucidated.</p><p>Previously, using genomic microarray analysis of paired (non-recurrent and recurrent) resected tumor tissues obtained from breast cancer patients [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], activation of the BDNF pathway has been found to be crucial to the clinical recurrence of TNBC tumors (<xref rid="pone.0178173.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, BDNF is known to modulate a number of endothelial functions, such as promoting angiogenic tube formation [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]and increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Accordingly, it was of interest and is important that the role of BDNF in the tumor cell microenvironment is investigated. To try to answer these questions, in this study we targeted the interaction of cancer cell with endothelial cells using a TNBC cell line.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0178173.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0178173.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Up-regulated pathways in recurrent stage II+IIIA triple negative breast cancer.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0178173.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0178173.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pathways</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BDNF signaling pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.81E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Integrated Breast Cancer Pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.07E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EGF EGFR Signaling Pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.46E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cytoplasmic Ribosomal Proteins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.34E-09</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TSH signaling pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.04E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.75E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Insulin Signaling</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.48E-08</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wnt Signaling Pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.78E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adipogenesis</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.93E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TGF beta Signaling Pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.43E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lymphocyte TarBase</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.90E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prostate Cancer</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.95E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Androgen receptor signaling pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.69E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Muscle cell TarBase</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.72E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Focal Adhesion</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.92E-07</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wnt Signaling Pathway and Pluripotency</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.62E-06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Integrated Pancreatic Cancer Pathway</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.68E-06</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neural Crest Differentiation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.95E-06</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t001fn001"><p>BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>The human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 (ER-low, PR-low and HER2-low) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and was maintained in F12 MEM (NO.12400-024,Gibco, NY,USA) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin.

Previously, we have measured the BDNF level in the cultured media of different breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) and the results showed that only MDA-MB-231 cells, but not other cell types, secreted BDNF into the culture media in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0178173.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the role of BDNF in cancer cell-endothelial cell interactionsusing breast cancer cells.</p><p>Although BDNF is well known to be involved in neural development, regeneration and differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], several lines of evidence have recently suggested that BDNF and its negative regulatory microRNA may play important roles in cell proliferation and in the metastasis of breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]and non-small lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, BDNF has been shown to promote non-small lung cancer proliferation in an autocrine manner and metastasis of neuroblastoma through STAT3 and PI3K and MAPKsingalling pathway, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that BDNF affects not only MDA-MB-231 itself in an autocrine manner, but also affects HUVEC cells in a paracrine manner. These results are in agreetment with previous investigations that have described the role of BDNF in the regulation of cell survival/growth in breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], in neuroblastoma and in myeloma, either in an autocrinal manner or in a paracrinal manner [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>The interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment are an essential feature of tumor progession and metastasis. The cell types involved in such interactions are not necessarily stromal cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but may include macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and T cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Many factors are well known to be related to the metastatic or invasive potential of human cancer cells. For examples, nitric oxide promotes the invasive activity in lung cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; and changes energy metabolism (increased glycolysis), which affects the tumor-endothelial interaction of bladder carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recent evidence has suggested that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the modulation of cancer metastasis during gastric cancer [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the matrix metalloproteases are known to be involved in tumor metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Our results obtained using ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrate that there is linkage between calmodulin expression, expression of MMPs and BDNF expression and it should be noted that this is consistent with above literature. It is also important to note that BDNF and VEGF/VEGFR play different roles in the multi-step process that makes up cancer metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The former promotes the transendothelial migration of cancer cells into vessels and the cells' survival in the circulatory system, while the latter enhances subsequent vascular proliferation at the colonization site. Our results have shown that BDNF increased eNOS, but not VEGF/VEGFR2, expression, and this supports the above hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>In terms of the protein's molecular and clinical roles, BDNF has been reported to be a target marker for predicting clinical outcomes in breast cancers [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0178173.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, controversy still exists as to the exact role of BDNF in tumor suppression and promotion [<xref rid="pone.0178173.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our clinical dataset shows that there is a good correlation between TrkB expression and patients&#x02019; outcomes, but not BDNF expression and patients&#x02019; outcomes, in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival. We attribute the discrepancy in these results to the characteristics of BDNF, which can be secreted outside cells and thus is able to affect the adjacent microenvironment. This may make the quantification of cellular BDNF expression unreliable. However, there is a need for more evidence in order to clarify the exact role of BDNF when predicting patient prognosis.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that BDNF-TrkB signaling plays an important role in the interaction between cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and endothelial cells (HUVEC) and that TrkB expression in tumor cells is correlated with a poor prognosis of patients with TNBC subype cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178173.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Gene expression omnibus.</title><p>The data includes the name of the repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95700">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95700</ext-link>) and the relevant accession numbers (GSM list).</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178173.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178173.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Experimental design.</title><p>The genomic microarray analysis of the resected tumor tissues obtained from breast cancer patients identified a number of possible critical signaling pathway differences between the recurrent and non-recurrent TNBC.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0178173.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0178173.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Heat map analysis.</title><p>Heat map analysis showed the differentially expressed genes between non-recurrent and recurrent triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
