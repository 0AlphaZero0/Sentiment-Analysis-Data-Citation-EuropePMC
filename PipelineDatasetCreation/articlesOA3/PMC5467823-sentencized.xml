</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Research on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains limited area compared to other subtypes of breast cancer and exhibits novel features including heterogeneity and various stemness characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In spite of the availability of the multiple modalities for the treatment of breast cancer that have been developed over the past decades, chemotherapy remains the main treatment for TNBC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This approach does not result in survival levels and outcomes as good as those of other subtypes of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Overall, TNBC accounts for approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers [1, 2] and is generally found to be high grade and have a high proliferative index. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has suggested that TNBC may be composed of a number of distinct subtypes; these have been identified either by gene expression analysis [3]or using clinical/pathological correlations [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This heterogeneity impacts on clinical survival and outcome and differs between the various subtypes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Some subtypes may relapse quickly despite several types of therapy being used, while others may remain as a stable disease after proper adjuvant treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Although some promising targets, such as PARP and the genes involved in the DNA damage pathway, have been proposed as therapeutic targets for TNBC treatment, the critical biomarkers that are involved in the process of early metastasis still remains to be investigated in detail. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>There has been good evidence to show that the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in cancer metastasis and progression [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The cell types involved in the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment are not limited to stromal cells [9], but other cell types, such as macrophage and endothelial cells, are also involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>For example, Snail, when acetylated, modulates cancer cells to promote the recruitment of macrophages [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in cancer cell growth and how these interact with their adjacent endothelial cells [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have suggested that phosphorylation of Src and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1α) are key factors involved in the promotion of bone metastasis [12] and in the tumor progression of estrogen-negative breast cancers [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the interaction between breast cancer cells and endothelial cells interaction remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the “neutrophin” family is widely expressed in mammalian brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>BDNF is well known to support the survival of existing neurons and to encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Previous research has focused on how BDNF is involved in neural development, neural regeneration, muscle repair, muscle regeneration and muscle differentiation [16–18] BDNF activates various biological functions and this mainly occurs via one cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, namely tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in the regulation of carcinogenesis and metastasis [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Moreover, overexpression of BDNF and TrkB has been demonstrated to act as a predictor of a poor clinical outcome and a worse survival when patients are suffering from human bladder cancer, neuroblastoma and breast carcinoma [20–22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>BDNF/TrkB signaling plays important roles in tumor metastasis and is recognized as a therapeutic target in treatment of breast cancer [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>While controversy that BDNF predicts adverse pathological and clinical outcome in breast cancer patients remains [23], the precise mechanism by which BDNF is involved in cancer cell signaling, and how BDNF affects the microenvironment of breast cancers, is need to be further elucidated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Previously, using genomic microarray analysis of paired (non-recurrent and recurrent) resected tumor tissues obtained from breast cancer patients [24], activation of the BDNF pathway has been found to be crucial to the clinical recurrence of TNBC tumors (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BDNF is known to modulate a number of endothelial functions, such as promoting angiogenic tube formation [25]and increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, it was of interest and is important that the role of BDNF in the tumor cell microenvironment is investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To try to answer these questions, in this study we targeted the interaction of cancer cell with endothelial cells using a TNBC cell line. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Cancer metastasis is a process that requires interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>In this article, the modulatory effects of BDNF on the interaction between cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and endothelial cells (HUVEC) was investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have measured the BDNF level in the cultured media of different breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468) and the results showed that only MDA-MB-231 cells, but not other cell types, secreted BDNF into the culture media in a time-dependent manner (S3 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the role of BDNF in cancer cell-endothelial cell interactionsusing breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Although BDNF is well known to be involved in neural development, regeneration and differentiation [16, 17], several lines of evidence have recently suggested that BDNF and its negative regulatory microRNA may play important roles in cell proliferation and in the metastasis of breast cancer [22, 29]and non-small lung cancer [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BDNF has been shown to promote non-small lung cancer proliferation in an autocrine manner and metastasis of neuroblastoma through STAT3 and PI3K and MAPKsingalling pathway, respectively [21, 31]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that BDNF affects not only MDA-MB-231 itself in an autocrine manner, but also affects HUVEC cells in a paracrine manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>These results are in agreetment with previous investigations that have described the role of BDNF in the regulation of cell survival/growth in breast cancer [29, 32], in neuroblastoma and in myeloma, either in an autocrinal manner or in a paracrinal manner [33, 34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment are an essential feature of tumor progession and metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>The cell types involved in such interactions are not necessarily stromal cells [9], but may include macrophages [10], endothelial cells [11], and T cells [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Many factors are well known to be related to the metastatic or invasive potential of human cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>For examples, nitric oxide promotes the invasive activity in lung cancer cells [36]; and changes energy metabolism (increased glycolysis), which affects the tumor-endothelial interaction of bladder carcinoma [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has suggested that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the modulation of cancer metastasis during gastric cancer [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>In addition, the matrix metalloproteases are known to be involved in tumor metastasis [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Our results obtained using ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrate that there is linkage between calmodulin expression, expression of MMPs and BDNF expression and it should be noted that this is consistent with above literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>It is also important to note that BDNF and VEGF/VEGFR play different roles in the multi-step process that makes up cancer metastasis [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The former promotes the transendothelial migration of cancer cells into vessels and the cells' survival in the circulatory system, while the latter enhances subsequent vascular proliferation at the colonization site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Our results have shown that BDNF increased eNOS, but not VEGF/VEGFR2, expression, and this supports the above hypothesis [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In terms of the protein's molecular and clinical roles, BDNF has been reported to be a target marker for predicting clinical outcomes in breast cancers [23, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, controversy still exists as to the exact role of BDNF in tumor suppression and promotion [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Our clinical dataset shows that there is a good correlation between TrkB expression and patients’ outcomes, but not BDNF expression and patients’ outcomes, in terms of disease-free survival and overall survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>We attribute the discrepancy in these results to the characteristics of BDNF, which can be secreted outside cells and thus is able to affect the adjacent microenvironment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>This may make the quantification of cellular BDNF expression unreliable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>However, there is a need for more evidence in order to clarify the exact role of BDNF when predicting patient prognosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have demonstrated that BDNF-TrkB signaling plays an important role in the interaction between cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and endothelial cells (HUVEC) and that TrkB expression in tumor cells is correlated with a poor prognosis of patients with TNBC subype cancers. </plain></SENT>
