<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the genomes of cultivated Cycloclasticus contain multiple clusters of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, none of the symbiotic Cycloclasticus genomes examined in this study, neither from the mussels nor the two sponge species, contained genes or transcripts attributable to PAH degradation (Supplementary Note 1-2, Supplementary Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>These genomic and transcriptomic results were supported by incubation experiments on board with Cycloclasticus-bearing B. heckerae gill tissues: Despite numerous attempts, we never observed oxidation of 14C-labelled naphthalene to 14CO2 by gill tissues, while control experiments with Cycloclasticus pugetii ATCC 51542 always showed naphthalene oxidation (see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Methods). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>We found genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic evidence for the use of short-chain alkanes as an energy and carbon source in the Cycloclasticus symbionts examined in this study (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The first step in the oxidation of short-chain alkanes is their oxidation to an alcohol, and we hypothesize that this step is catalyzed by copper-containing membrane-associated monooxygenases (CuMMO) in the symbiotic Cycloclasticus (Fig. 4 and 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>CuMMOs that oxidize hydrocarbon compounds are called particulate hydrocarbon monooxygenases (pHMOs), and the most well characterized of these is particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), which oxidizes methane to methanol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>It is now known that the phylogenetic and functional diversity of pHMOs is much greater than previously recognized, and pHMOs that are capable of oxidizing short-chain hydrocarbons have been recently described30. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>We found genes encoding pHMOs (pmoCAB) in the Cycloclasticus symbionts of all three host species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>These genes were genetically distant and phylogenetically distinct from the pMMO genes of the methane-oxidizing symbionts of these hosts and were most closely related to bacteria found in the DWH oil plume (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The Cycloclasticus symbiont pmoA sequences belonged to two groups: Group Z31 and a clade of pHMOs related to those of short-chain alkane degrading Nocardioides32 and Mycobacterium33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The latter clade formed a sister group to Group X pHMOs, which are suggested to have a high affinity to ethane34 or ethylene35 (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Hereafter we refer to this clade as Group X-like pHMOs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Transcriptomic analyses of the symbiotic Cycloclasticus from four B. heckerae individuals and the two encrusting sponge individuals revealed that their pHMO genes were the most highly expressed genes compared to all other genes involved in carbon metabolism (Fig. 4, Supplementary Tables 6, 7) (transcriptomic sequencing of the branching sponge was not possible, as insufficient RNA was recovered). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Proteomics revealed that the subunit A of Group Z pHMO was among the most highly expressed Cycloclasticus proteins in three B. heckerae individuals (Supplementary Table 8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The second step in the oxidation of short-chain alkanes, after these have been oxidized to alcohol, is the formation of an aldehyde. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In many bacteria that oxidize alcohols, this reaction is catalyzed by pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (PQQ-ADH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found genes encoding PQQ-ADHs in the symbiotic Cycloclasticus of all three host species, and these were also highly expressed in their transcriptomes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The membrane-bound PQQ-ADH was also found in the Cycloclasticus proteome of one B. heckerae individual (Supplementary Table 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>The symbiotic Cycloclasticus PQQ-ADH sequences were highly similar (91%) to PQQ-ADHs assumed to oxidize ethanol and higher alcohols, rather than methanol36 (Supplementary Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>In the third step of short-chain alkane degradation, the aldehydes are oxidized to carboxylic acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>This step could be carried out by the PQQ-ADHs of the symbiotic Cycloclasticus, as these enzymes have been shown to oxidize aldehydes to carboxylic acids in butane-degrading Pseudomonas spp.37. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This third step could also be achieved via tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases (AORs), which are known to use short-chain alkane derived aldehydes as their substrate38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>AORs were highly expressed in the transcriptomes of Cycloclasticus symbionts of all three host species, and also present in the proteomes of Cycloclasticus from two B. heckerae individuals (Supplementary Table 8, 9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The genomes of the Cyclolcasticus symbionts from all three host species encoded genes that enabled them to fix carbon derived from C2-C4 alkanes (Fig. 4), and many of these genes were highly expressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>These pathways are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Notes 7 - 8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>While carbon derived from C2 – C4 alkanes appears to play a central role in the metabolism of the symbiotic Cycloclasticus, it is unlikely that they can use methane or other C1 compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>While pMMOs and PQQ-ADHs are also highly expressed in metabolically active methanotrophs39,40, their genes are phylogenetically distant from those of the symbiotic Cycloclasticus, suggesting functional divergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Moreover, genes encoding key enzymes in C1 assimilation pathways such as the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, the serine cycle, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle were not present in the Cycloclasticus symbiont genomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>In summary, given that genes involved in PAH degradation were not detected in our metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data, and the high expression levels of genes involved in the use of short-chain alkanes such as pHMOs, PQQ-ADHs, and AORs, the symbiotic Cycloclasticus investigated in this study most likely use gaseous non-aromatic short-chain hydrocarbons as energy and carbon sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>This is surprising, as all cultivated Cycloclasticus are able to degrade PAH, but do not appear to use short-chain alkanes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Our study provides genomic and transcriptomic evidence for the use of short-chain alkanes by symbiotic and free-living Cycloclasticus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>We thus provide a direct link between the phylogenetic identity of these bacteria and their metabolic function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm earlier studies that found indirect evidence for the use of short-chain alkanes by Cycloclasticus based on their dominance in DWH plumes with high rates of propane and ethane consumption, and stable isotope probing with propane and ethane at natural hydrocarbon seeps10,34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>These results show that metabolic versatility within the clade of closely related Cycloclasticus (&gt;98% 16S rRNA identity) is higher than previously assumed and not limited to PAH degradation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Within the very closely related clade of Cycloclasticus that have been cultivated (Fig. 3, top clade), we found no evidence for genes involved in the use of short-chain alkanes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>These bacteria appear to rely solely on PAH degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In contrast, SAGs from the DWH contained genes for the use of both PAH and short-chain alkanes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Such a versatile metabolism could be advantageous for Cycloclasticus in their ephemeral environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>During the early development of hydrocarbon plumes, short-chain alkanes are abundant, and their use costs less energy than that of PAHs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>However, as plumes mature, the concentrations of short-chain alkane can decrease, and the plume Cycloclasticus can then switch to using PAHs10,43,44. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>It is intriguing that the symbiotic Cycloclasticus are the only bacteria within this genus that lack the ability to degrade PAHs, despite the high concentrations of PAHs in Campeche Knoll asphalts45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>(Some SAGs from DWH do not have genes for PAH degradation (Fig. 3), but these genomes are only 25 – 50 % complete.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Unlike DWH oil plume Cycloclasticus, symbionts experience a consistent supply of short-chain alkanes, determined by the host’s location above a hydrocarbon source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The host can enhance the metabolic capacity of symbionts by providing a continuous supply of dissolved gases via active pumping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Moreover, given their protected environment within host tissues, the Cycloclasticus symbionts would not experience competition with free-living short-chain alkane degraders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the low aqueous solubility of PAH compared to short-chain alkanes, as well as diffusion barriers across the host cell membrane could limit the access of these symbionts to PAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The selective advantage in maintaining the large suite of genes needed for PAH degradation appears to no longer exist for symbiotic Cycloclasticus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Similarly, we could envision a similar selection-driven loss in free-living Cycloclasticus from environments with a continuous supply of short-chain alkanes, such as surface asphalt and sediments at hydrocarbon-rich seeps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>Future molecular and physiological studies on both symbiotic and free-living Cycloclasticus are needed to test these hypotheses and gain a better understanding how this group of bacteria contributes to the consumption of hydrocarbons. </plain></SENT>
