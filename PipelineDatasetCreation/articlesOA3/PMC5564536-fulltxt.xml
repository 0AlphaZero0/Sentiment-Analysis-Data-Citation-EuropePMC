They occur in diverse taxa, from flies to nematode worms, to insects, to mammals, and are well-known regulators of a variety of developmental processes, particularly relating to neural development, sex determination and testis development, chondrogenesis and cell fate decision [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Research on SOX family proteins began with the identification of <italic>SRY</italic> (the sex determining region of chromosome Y), which is the founding member of the SOX family of transcription factors. It functions as a master regulator of mammalian sex determination pathways and mediates the differentiation of Sertoli cell lineages in the bipotential genital ridge in both humans and mice [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In vertebrates, the SOX family proteins are comprised of more than 20 <italic>Sox</italic> genes members which can be further subdivided into groups A-J based on the sequence alignments of the evolutionarily conserved HMG box domain [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Approximately 10 <italic>Sox</italic> genes have also been identified and documented as present in many invertebrate species including <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and other lower metazoans. However, the developmental functions of invertebrate <italic>Sox</italic> genes remain largely unknown [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>SOX proteins are characterized by an evolutionarily conserved high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain which can specifically recognize and bind to the consensus sequence (A/T)ACAA(T/A) or to related sequence motifs in the minor groove of the DNA. Such a binding process induces a topological 60-90&#x000b0; bend of the DNA helix in order to transactivate the transcription of target genes [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Accumulating evidence relating to many studies indicates the emerging elucidation of multiple roles of the 79-amino-acid HMG box. This includes its role in the DNA binding and bending of biochemical properties as well as in protein-protein interactions with partner proteins in diverse cellular events [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The nucleocytoplasmic transport of protein molecules (&#x0003e;40 kDa) across the nuclear envelope through the nuclear pore complexes is a highly dynamic activity occurring between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It is required for the complex regulation of diverse cellular functions [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Both human SRY and SOX9 contain a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif and a basic cluster NLS motif, located in the N-terminal and C-terminal of the HMG box, respectively [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The N-terminal NLS resembles two highly basic consensus sequences separated by 9-12 residues. It interacts with calcium-activated calmodulin to increase the nuclear import of SRY and SOX9 and subsequent transcriptional activities [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The C-terminal NLS of SRY interacts with importin-&#x003b2; and mediates nuclear localization through a Ran-GTP dependent pathway [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The SOX subgroup E proteins, including SOX8, SOX9 and SOX10, harbor a well-characterized leucine-rich motif. This is a nuclear export signal (NES) located in the HMG box [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The nuclear export signals in SOX9 and SOX10 are recognized by CRM1 and can be specifically inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The NLS/NES, within the HMG box, are essential for the subcellular localizations and nuclear import/export equilibrium of SOXE proteins. Loss-of-function studies have suggested that the HMG box stimulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties of SOX proteins and is responsible for the highly dynamic regulation network of SOX proteins during development [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we studied the roles of SOX proteins in Chinese mitten carb <italic>E. sinensis</italic>. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>E. sinensis</italic> SOX14A/B proteins shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and can response to LMB. These results suggested that SOX14A/B may have a novel nuclear export signal. To date, however, there is no crustacean cell lines available for the study of <italic>E. sinensis</italic> Sox proteins. Due to the high transfection efficiency and easy genetic methods of the human embryonic kidney HEK293T cell line, we choose it as our model cell line in this study.</p><p>In this study, we found that both <italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B contain two nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal, localized in the HMG box, which mediate nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of these two transcriptional factors. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that a non-classic nuclear export signal that occurs in the HMG box of SOX14A/B proteins but which lies outside of the subgroup E SOX proteins, is functional and that the nuclear export of SOX14A and SOX14B can be blocked by LMB. This have indicated that the nuclear export of SOX14A and SOX14B is regulated by a CRM1 dependent mechanism. Here we reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SOX14A and SOX14B in cultured cells and provide the first evidence that the hydrophobic NES, located on these two SOX proteins are functional.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Subcellular distribution of <italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B in cultured cells</title><p>Our clone of the <italic>Eriocheir sinensis Sox14a</italic> (GenBank accession no.

The amino acids of the HMG box in <italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> SOX14 are highly conserved. Multiple sequence alignments have indicated that both the HMG box of SOX14A and SOX14B are evolutionarily conserved with other SOX proteins in both <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">2B</xref>). Compared with other reported NLS sequences (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>), we found that both <italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B proteins contain two putative nuclear localization signals at either side of the HMG box [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The nuclear localization signals are comprised of an N-termini bi-partite NLS, which contains two groups of basic residues separated by 9-11 residues, and a monopartite C-termini NLS, which is characterized by a short stretch of 4-5 basic residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, a candidate nuclear export signal is also located in the HMG box of SOX14A and SOX14B. Alignments of the NES sequences with other representative leucine-rich NESs within the HMG box of SOX9 and SOX10 have suggested that the NES signal in SOX14A and SOX14B are potential but not valid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>The gene structures of <italic>E. sinensis Sox14a</italic> and <italic>Sox14b</italic> and the multiple sequence alignment of the HMG box of SOX14A/B and other representative SOX proteins</title><p><bold>A</bold>.

The fluorescence intensities of EGFP/RFP/DAPI were analyzed in representative cells to indicate the expression pattern of transfected proteins. Strikingly, we found that the subcellular distributions of SOX14A and SOX14B proteins are different in cultured cells. In the cultured 293T cells, SOX14A proteins were distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, and in a relative predominantly cytoplasmic pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, SOX14B exhibited an almost exclusively nuclear distribution pattern, with little distribution within the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>).

The SOX14A NES wild-type EGFP fusion proteins were expressed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and were also mainly localized in the nucleus beyond treatment with LMB. This suggests that SOX14A NES can respond to the LMB and is required for nuclear export. When all leucines in NES were substituted for the alanines (SOX14A NES 2L-2A), the amounts of nuclear export were decreased. A similar result can also be seen in the single substitution NES L-A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

Similarly, SOX14B NES-RFP fusion proteins were widely expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. They then gradually accumulated in the nucleus upon the addition of LMB (5.0 ng/ml) for 3h. When both of the leucines were replaced by the alanines in SOX14B NES, the amount of SOX14B NES 2L-2A RFP fusion proteins were slightly decreased (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similar results were also shown in single substitution SOX14B NES L-A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).

Further research into the nuclear import mechanisms of SOX proteins revealed that nearly all of SOX protein members contain these two conserved nuclear localization signals at the either end of the HMG box and these two NLSs contribute to the subcellular location and nuclear transport of SOX proteins during many developmental events [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>SOX proteins recognized and binding by the importins are complex and regulated the nuclear localization signals locating at the both ends of the HMG box.

Exportin 4 functions as efficient nuclear import receptor of SOX2 and SRY proteins.

We have also demonstrated that the HMG box on SOX14A and SOX14B are crucial to the nuclear import of these two transcription factors. These different locations of EGFP and RFP may be due to the different nuclear import efficiencies of the HMG box in SOX14A and SOX14B. Target deletions of the N-termini NLS or the C-termini NLS largely excluded the SOX14A and SOX14B proteins from the nucleus. Combined depletion of the N-termini NLS and C-termini NLS significantly decreased the nuclear accumulation of SOX14A and SOX14B in the cultured cells.

In summary, these data suggests that the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of SOX14A and SOX14B are not involved in the nuclear localization of SOX14A and SOX14B and that the HMG domains are required for the nuclear import of these two proteins.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>The molecular mechanisms involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of <italic>E. sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B</title><p><bold>A</bold>. The HMG box is necessary for nuclear import of SOX14A and SOX14B.

And the classical leucine-rich sequence of HMG box is necessary and sufficient to export the SOX9/10 protein out of the nucleus. In our study, we found that the N-termini NLS and the C-termini NLS of SOX14A/B mediates the nuclear import across the nuclear pore complex, this could be mediated by calmodulin and Importin-&#x003b2;. Strikingly, we found a new nonconventional nuclear export pathway which activates SOX14A and SOX14B transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the CRM1-dependent pathway. We demonstrated that the leucine-rich NES sequence located in the HMG box is response to leptomycin B.

LMB, a <italic>Streptomyces</italic> metabolite, can directly bind to CRM1 and disrupt the interactions between CRM1 and leucine-rich or hydrophobic NES in order to inhibit the CRM1 mediation of nuclear export [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To date, the best characterized molecular mechanism involved in the nuclear export of the SOX proteins is the CRM1-dependent pathway. The CRM1 nuclear export receptor can recognize and bind to the leucine-rich NES found in the subgroup E proteins (including SOX9 and SOX10) to mediate the nuclear export of SOX proteins across the nuclear envelope [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. SOX9, as well as SOX10, harbors a perfect leucine-rich NES, which is a spaced and large hydrophobic NES consensus sequence &#x003a6;1-x<sub>2&#x02013;3</sub>-&#x003a6;2-x<sub>2&#x02013;3</sub>-&#x003a6;3-x-&#x003a6;4 (where &#x003a6;=L, I, V, F, M and x represents any amino acid). Previous studies have demonstrated that the functional leucine-rich NES on SOX9 and SOX10, and the CRM1-specific inhibitor LMB can block the nuclear export and then repress nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of these two SOXE proteins [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

Due to the lower affinities of CRM1 with nearly all other NES in non-subgroup E proteins, the nature of the nuclear export mechanisms in other SOX proteins has been a long-standing question for studies relating to SOX transcription factors [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>To solve this problem, we have used <italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> SOX14A and SOX14B proteins as the models.

We found that the nuclear export of SOX14A and SOX14B can be significantly inhibited by the CRM1-specific inhibitor LMB. In summary, the nuclear export of SOX14A/B can also be inhibited by LMB.
