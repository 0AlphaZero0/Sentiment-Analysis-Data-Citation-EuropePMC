</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Over two-thirds of patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the United States of America (USA) and Europe are aged 65 years or older.1–3 These older patients do not fare as well with intensive induction therapy, having complete remission (CR) rates &lt;50%, a median survival of 4–9 months, and increased induction mortality (15–30%).4–6 Hypomethylating agents (decitabine and azacytidine) are commonly used in the treatment of less fit, older patients with AML in the USA and Europe.7 The pivotal DACO-016 study demonstrated a superior CR/CR without platelet recovery (CRp) rate with decitabine versus investigators’ choice of treatment (including low-dose cytarabine or best supportive care) in 485 older patients with AML (median age 73 years) who were ineligible for cytotoxic chemotherapy (17.8% versus 7.8%, P=0.001)7 and improved survival with decitabine, leading to the approval of decitabine for the treatment of AML in the elderly in Europe.7,8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Vosaroxin is a non-anthracycline anticancer quinolone-derivative that intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, causing site-selective DNA breaks, G2 arrest, and apoptosis.9 Vosaroxin is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and can induce apoptosis independently of P53 function.9–11 In a phase II dose regimen optimization study in patients with previously untreated, unfavorable prognosis AML ≥60 years of age, single-agent vosaroxin resulted in a CR/CRp rate of 32%, a 30-day mortality of 12%, and a median survival of 7.0 months.12 The 72 mg/m2 days 1 and 4 and 90 mg/m2 day 1 and 4 schedules of single-agent vosaroxin were well tolerated with the highest CR/CRp rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The pivotal phase III, randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational clinical study of the efficacy and safety of vosaroxin and cytarabine versus placebo and cytarabine in patients with first relapsed or refractory AML (VALOR) (n=711) demonstrated that vosaroxin in combination with intermediate-dose cytarabine produced a significantly superior remission rate (30% versus 16%; P&lt;0.0001) and improved overall survival (OS) with equivalent 60-day mortality as that following cytarabine alone.13 The overall survival benefit with the combinations was most prominent in patients older than 60 years (7.1 months versus 5.0 months, P=0.003). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess whether the addition of vosaroxin to decitabine can improve response rates and OS compared to established outcomes with decitabine alone while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Older patients with AML more frequently have an antecedent hematologic disorder, unfavorable cytogenetics, and poorer performance status at presentation.4,5 As a result, the outcomes of elderly patients with AML has not improved significantly over the last four decades.3,24,25 Overall, standard induction regimens can achieve CR/CRp rates of 45–50%, median survival of 4–9 months with an 8-week mortality rate of up to 30%.4–6,10 These dismal outcomes have resulted in a shift over the last decade to lower intensity strategies such as HMA or low-dose cytarabine in Europe and the USA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Phase II and III trials of decitabine in elderly patients with AML have shown CR/CRp rates of 18–25% with median survival of 7–8 months and 60-day mortality rates of 10–18%.7,14 In the DACO-016 trial the response rate, median survival, and 60-day mortality in the low-dose cytarabine or supportive care comparator arm were inferior to those in the decitabine arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In an effort to further improve outcomes, decitabine was administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 in an extended 10-day regimen with a reported CR/CRi rate of 64%, 8-week mortality of 15%, and median OS of 13.7 months.26 However, these superior outcomes have not been reproduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>In a randomized trial of azacytidine versus standard of care in 488 older patients (age ≥65 years) with AML, a response rate of 27.8% and a median survival of 10.9 months were reported for azacytidine27 as compared to 25.1% and 6.5 months, respectively for the control arm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>The 74% response rate among the patients treated on this trial does, therefore, compare favorably to those achieved with intensive chemotherapy, single-agent decitabine in a 5-day or 10-day dose regimen, or azacytidine in older patients with AML.4,25–28 Although the median OS of 9.8 months for all patients in this study is similar to that which has been achieved with intensive chemotherapy or HMA, the 70 mg/m2 dose of vosaroxin at induction produced a clearly improved, encouraging median survival (14.6 months). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The reported incidences of adverse karyotype and TP53 mutations in older patients with newly diagnosed AML are 20–25% and 5–10%, respectively.29–32 Typically, patients with these characteristics are resistant to standard cytotoxic therapy, having remission rates of 32–36% and a median survival of 4 – 7 months with standard therapies.33–35 Welch et al. treated 114 patients (88 with AML and 26 with MDS) with a 10-day regimen of decitabine in monthly cycles and reported high rates of morphological remission (46%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>They specifically noted higher response rates among patients with an unfavorable cytogenetic profile than among those with intermediate- or favorable-cytogenetic profiles (67% versus 37%; P&lt;0.001) and among patients with TP53 mutations as compared to those without TP53 mutations (100% versus 41%; P&lt;0.001).36 The patients in our trial had poor prognostic factors with 35% having an adverse karyotype and 20% having TP53 mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>A potential benefit of vosaroxin is its ability to induce apoptosis independently of TP53 function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>In this trial, we noted ORR of 65% and 77% among patients with an adverse karyotype and mutated TP53, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the findings of Welch et al., the response rates in TP53 mutated patients were similar to but not better than the ORR of 74% for our entire group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>In spite of the improved response rate, the median OS for TP53 mutated patients was &lt;6 months with the major reason for poor OS among these patients being relapsed/refractory disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>In summary we believe that both our data and those from Welch et al. support the use of HMA-based therapies for patients with complex cytogenetic abnormalities and TP53 mutations, at least to achieve an initial response. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In summary, as has been well described in the past, patients who progressed to AML after having received treatment with HMA had a worse outcome than those who had not received prior HMA therapy, although the numbers are small. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>MRD status has emerged as a very important prognostic factor for long-term outcomes in AML patients treated with cytotoxic induction.17,37–39 This was one of the first trials to monitor MRD status and correlate it with outcome in patients treated with hypomethylator-based therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>A multicolor flow cytometric immunophenotype for detecting MRD in AML was used in this trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The methodology of MRD detection used at our institution has been previously published.17,18 MRD at remission was evaluated in 81% of the patients who achieved remission. </plain></SENT>
