Transcriptional regulators and post-transcriptional effectors like microRNAs orchestrate this process of high cellular plasticity and its malignant consequences. Here, using microRNA sequencing in a time-resolved manner and functional validation, we have identified microRNAs that are critical for the regulation of an epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition and of mesenchymal tumour cell migration. We report that miR-1199-5p is downregulated in its expression during an epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition, while its forced expression prevents an epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition, tumour cell migration and invasion in vitro, and lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-1199-5p acts in a reciprocal double-negative feedback loop with the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition transcription factor Zeb1. This function resembles the activities of miR-200 family members, guardians of an epithelial cell phenotype. However, miR-1199-5p and miR-200 family members share only six target genes, indicating that, besides regulating Zeb1 expression, they exert distinct functions during an epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">miRNAs have been involved in tumour development and progression.

Both processes induce a global reorganization of a cell&#x02019;s constitution and allow switching back and forth between two different cell phenotypes to endow the necessity of tissue plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In the context of malignant tumour progression, epithelial tumour cells can undergo an EMT upon diverse extracellular stimuli and consequently gain metastatic capabilities. Among many growth factors and environmental cues, such as tissue hypoxia, transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF&#x003b2;) strongly activates the dedifferentiation process in epithelial tumour cells and, thus, induces global changes in a cell&#x02019;s transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. This allows tumour cells to disseminate from the primary tumour and to intravasate and survive in the blood circulation.

An EMT also provides cells with increased chemoresistance, thus impeding efficient therapy of malignant mesenchymal cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of ~22 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by either inducing target messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation or preventing mRNA translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the context of an EMT, miRNA-200 family members (miR-200a/b/c, miR-141 and miR-429) take a central stage: they are required to maintain an epithelial cell morphology by degrading the transcripts of the EMT-inducing transcription factors (TFs) Zeb1 and Zeb2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Members of the miR-200 family bind to specific seed sequences in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (3&#x02032; UTR) of Zeb1 and 2 mRNAs and destabilize them. During an EMT, members of the miR-200 family are downregulated in their expression, which results in the increased expression of Zeb1 and 2. Conversely, Zeb1 and Zeb2 directly suppress the transcription of miR-200 family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

However, miR-200 family members and miR-1199-5p seem to exert distinct functions; they share only six of their many target mRNAs, among them Zeb1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of EMT-associated miRNAs</title><p id="Par6">To identify regulatory miRNAs involved in the gradual process of an EMT, we performed miRNA sequencing on a detailed time course of a TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT in normal murine mammary gland cells (NMuMG subclone E9; NMuMG/E9). Analysis of the kinetics of miRNA transcript regulation during an EMT in a time-resolved manner identified 32 differentially expressed miRNAs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering illustrated that approximately half of the differentially expressed miRNAs showed a continuous increase in their expression during an EMT, whereas the other half exhibited decreased expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). In order to identify the miRNAs functionally impacting on a TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT, we performed a microscopy-based screen in which NMuMG/E9 cells were transfected with miRNA mimics and cultured in the absence or presence of TGF&#x003b2; for 4 days (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Subsequently, mesenchymal cell characteristics were monitored by high-content fluorescence microscopy analysis and quantified, including the deposition of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin and the formation of focal adhesions and of actin stress fibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Nine out of 32 differentially expressed miRNAs were able to block or at least delay the EMT process: miR-125b-5p, miR-181b-2-3p, miR-1247-3p, miR-200a-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-429-3p, miR-1199-5p, miR-145a-3p and miR-504-5p. Conversely, the forced expression of miR-145a-5p and miR-6944-3p promoted an EMT in epithelial NMuMG/E9 cells. Changes in cell morphology, the localization of the epithelial adhesion junction protein E-cadherin as well as the mRNA levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, fibronectin and Zeb1 further confirmed the impact of the different miRNAs on the EMT process (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a&#x02013;c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of miRNAs critical for an EMT and cell migration. <bold>a</bold> Expression profiling of miRNAs during a TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT in NMuMG/E9 cells.

MiRNAs are powerful, post-transcriptional regulators of a cell&#x02019;s transcriptome and, therefore, they are able to coordinate changes of a cell&#x02019;s morphology and functional capabilities necessary for an EMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In the present study, we have set out to identify and characterize such EMT-regulatory miRNAs in normal and tumorigenic breast cancer cells. Using miRNA-sequencing analysis of the kinetics of EMT, we identified 32 strongly regulated miRNAs by a global, time-resolved miRNA profile of TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT. Subsequently, we have tested the miRNAs&#x02019; functional contribution to an EMT and to mesenchymal tumour cell migration. Among a number of miRNAs, we identify miR-1199-5p as a strong regulator of an EMT. Its transcript levels as well as its promoter activity are continuously decreased during an EMT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-1199-5p downregulation is required for cell dedifferentiation, for mesenchymal tumour cell migration and invasion, and for lung metastasis formation in vivo. Finally, we report that during an EMT, this exonic miRNA is mechanistically embedded in a reciprocal, direct negative feedback loop with the TF Zeb1. The double-negative feedback loop with Zeb1 during an EMT is reminiscent of the miR-200 family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Indeed, consistent with previous reports, the miR-200 family members miR-200b-3p and miR-429-3p have been identified by our EMT screen as critical mediators of an epithelial cell phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">While the gain of function approaches of miR-1199-5p and miRNA family members has clearly repressed an EMT, we have repeatedly failed to demonstrate an effect of loss function approaches on EMT by interfering with miR-1199-5p and also with miR-200 family member activities. Interestingly, transient transfection of a miR-1199-5p sponge construct or a miR-1199-5p inhibitor did not lead to a loss of miR-1199-5p function in epithelial NMuMG/E9 cells, as determined by 3&#x02032; UTR reporter assays, yet was not sufficient to increase Zeb1 expression or to induce an EMT. Of note, sponge constructs or miRNA inhibitors against miR-200b-3p and miR-200c-3p also did not alter Zeb1 expression or the induction of an EMT (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the regulation of Zeb1 expression on the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level is complex and we suppose that the loss of one Zeb1 regulator (miR-1199-5p or miR-200b/c-3p) is not sufficient to increase Zeb1 levels and to jumpstart an EMT. The overlapping double-negative feedback loops between miRNAs and TFs may act as a &#x02018;buffered system&#x02019; to compensate for the loss of one regulator and thus ensure a system&#x02019;s functionality.</p><p id="Par31">Our genome-wide analyses of the three miRNAs revealed a large number of regulated genes, which underscores their critical functions during an EMT. However, only six genes were identified as common direct targets of the three miRNAs, including Zeb1, Col5a1, Zfp9, Sox12, Cdon and Ncs1. The latter five are so far &#x02018;unknowns&#x02019; in the context of an EMT and malignant tumour progression, most of which might be of interest considering their potential function. For instance, Sox12, together with Sox11 and Sox4, is a member of the SoxC TF family, of which Sox4 has an established role in EMT and breast cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.
