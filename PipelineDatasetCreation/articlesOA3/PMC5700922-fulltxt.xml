Identification of molecular targets and anti-fibrotic therapies could provide new treatment strategies for CTS. The contribution of SSCT cells to fibrosis and the signaling pathways that initiate and aggravate fibrosis in CTS remain unknown. Here we report that platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR&#x003b1;) positive (&#x02009;+&#x02009;) cells accumulate in CTS SSCT and that the presence of fibrotic growth factor, PDGF-AA, results in increased proliferation of PDGFR&#x003b1;+ cells via PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Although PI3K inhibition decreased proliferation, there was no change in fibrosis-related gene expression. Indeed, protein levels of fibrosis signaling mediator TGF-&#x003b2; remained the same and the second messenger, Smad2/3, accumulated in the nucleus. In contrast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which can be induced with metformin and AICAR inhibited proliferation, TGF-&#x003b2; expression, and altered cell morphology in SSCT cells. Further we show that AMPK activation by metformin reduced collagen III levels and the ratio of Collagen I to Collagen III. Both AICAR and metformin reduced F-actin and significantly reduced the fiber cross alignment. Our results suggest that PDGFRa signaling may be an important fibrosis target and that activators of AMPK, may be an important therapeutic approach for treating CTS.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy with incidence reported to be 2&#x02013;5% in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

PDGF-A binds to PDGFR&#x003b1; homo or heterodimers with high affinity, but does not bind to PDGFR&#x000df; homodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. We, therefore examined PDGFA and PDGFR&#x003b1; signaling in this study.</p><p id="Par12">SSCT cells derived from CTS patients increase proliferation upon PDGF-AA stimulation, and this proliferation was suppressed by inhibition of PDGFR signaling using imatinib, the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), and MEK inhibitor (U0126). PDGFR&#x003b1; mediates its effect through several signaling pathways including PI3K-Akt, and Ras-MAPK. In our study, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, strongly decreased both cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation after PDGF-AA, however, LY294002 either had no effect on fibrotic gene expression (TGF-&#x003b2;, CTGF, Col I, Col III, Smad3). TGF-&#x003b2; signaling regulates many cellular functions, such as cell growth, apoptosis and cell fate determination. These functions are not solely regulated by the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway but are also regulated by crosstalk between TGF-&#x003b2; and other signaling pathways. TGF-&#x003b2; signaling leads to the phosphorylation of the Smad2 and Smad3 C-terminal SxS motif, encouraging their interaction with Smad4 and promoting the translocation of the Smad2/3&#x02013;Smad4 complexes and accumulation within the nucleus where they regulate targeted gene expression in cooperation with other cofactors. The function of this pathway is also affected by other signaling pathways. Notably, PI3K/AKT pathway has been showed to modulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling through a direct interaction with Smad3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, as well as inhibiting the Smad2/3 activity by modulating their degradation via phosphorylation of a particular threonine residue within the Smad2/3 linker region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Furthermore, Smad3 signaling has been found to be regulated by PDGFR&#x003b1;, but not PDGFR&#x003b2;, through direct binding with TGF-&#x003b2; receptor II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, indicating that PDGFR&#x003b1; signaling can upregulate TGF-&#x003b2; expression though Smad3. Further, Furukawa <italic>et al</italic>. reported that activation of Smad3 was stimulated by p38 MAPK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, which are also upregulated by PDGFR&#x003b1; activation though PDGF-AA stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Activation of PDGFR&#x003b1; signaling by PDGF-AA can directly stimulate Smad3 or p38 MAPK pathway and may result in activation of TGF-&#x003b2;.</p><p id="Par14">To test whether fibrotic gene expression and cell proliferation could be suppressed concurrently, we activated AMPK by treatment with metformin or AICAR. AMPK is known as a cellular energy sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and regulates inflammatory status and cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

We evaluated the efficacy of metformin and AICAR on the AMPK activity on cell growth, anti-fibrotic effect gene expression, and protein expression and cellular alignment. Our results demonstrated that AICAR and metformin inhibit cell proliferation in SSCT cells treated with PDGF-AA, and also suppressed Smad3 expression. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of metformin in anti-fibrotic <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments using 3D culture insert. Metformin treatment increased Col I production and decreased Col III in <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture indicating a shift to a less fibrotic state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In contrast PDGF-AA treatment decreased Col I and increased Col III. The ratio of Col I to Col III is a measure of pathology of SSCT fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In skin, Col I and Col III exist in a ratio of approximately 4:1, however, the ratio alter 2:1 when hypertrophic and immature scars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Chikenji and colleagues reported that the ratio of Col I to Col III was 4:1 in normal SSCT tissue and nearly 1:1 in SSCT of CTS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, Oh <italic>et al</italic>. reported that, in SSCT of CTS patients, the diameter of the collagen fibrils was larger and the density of the collagen fibrils was lower than normal SSCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. These results indicate that the alteration of the ratio of Col I to Col III with thickening and fragility of SSCT in CTS patients may result from increased fibrotic SSCT cells and hyperactive PDGFR signaling resulting in altered ratios of Col III and Col I, along with an overall increase in ECM. Interestingly, metformin improved the ratio of Col I to Col III above 1.0, similar to the ratios found in normal SSCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Metformin treated cells also decreased F-actin expression, which is a stress fiber, and resulted in aligning along cell shape and orientation as compared to SSCT cells with and without PDGFA treatment. Decreasing F-actin by treatment with metformin in this study may occur by activating AMPK. Previously AMPK activation has been shown to reduce F-actin expression via phosphorylation of RhoA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and thereby inhibits cell spreading and migration by attenuation of lamellipodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.

The reduction in stress fibers by activation of AMPK may attenuate mechanosensitivity in SSCT cells, suggesting that metformin may reduce CTS progression by mechanical stress, which is caused by friction force on SSCT during wrist and finger motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">Several non-surgical treatments are available for management of CTS.

In this study, we demonstrated that metformin has a possibility to improve the SSCT fibrosis in CTS patients and may also prevent development of CTS.

Secondary antibodies used Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated IgG (1:800; 111-606-003, Jackson immunoResearch). Nuclei were stained by DAPI (1:1000; Dojindo). Actin filaments were stained by CytoPainter Phalloidin-iFluor 488 Reagent (1:1000; ab176753, Abcam) according to the manufacture&#x02019;s instruction. The Z-stack images were acquired for 3D reconstruction and analyzed the volume of collagen I and collagen III with confocal laser scanning microscopy and NIS Elements (Nikon).</p><p id="Par27">Data of F-actin alignment was calculated as dispersion of the F-actin angle. Dispersion is the extent to which the magnitude of the set of data differs, that is the degree of diversity, and the dispersion is known as the square of the standard deviation. F-actin angle was defined the line of F-actin which passed long axis of nucleus against the 3D scaffold alignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="Par28">Normality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk test. Pairwise t tests assessed difference percentage of PDGFR&#x003b1; positive cells between control tissue and CTS tissue. A One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to assess the difference among each cell culture conditions. Pairwise comparisons were made only when the One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test indicated statistical significance. <italic>P</italic>-values for multiple comparisons were adjusted by Holm methods. A repeated measure ANOVA was conducted to assess the concentration dependent manner of each inhibitor and activator agents. Statistical analyses were performed using EZR, which is a graphical user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.
