</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>SSCT cells derived from CTS patients increase proliferation upon PDGF-AA stimulation, and this proliferation was suppressed by inhibition of PDGFR signaling using imatinib, the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), and MEK inhibitor (U0126). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>PDGFRα mediates its effect through several signaling pathways including PI3K-Akt, and Ras-MAPK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>In our study, the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, strongly decreased both cell proliferation and Akt phosphorylation after PDGF-AA, however, LY294002 either had no effect on fibrotic gene expression (TGF-β, CTGF, Col I, Col III, Smad3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>TGF-β signaling regulates many cellular functions, such as cell growth, apoptosis and cell fate determination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>These functions are not solely regulated by the TGF-β pathway but are also regulated by crosstalk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>TGF-β signaling leads to the phosphorylation of the Smad2 and Smad3 C-terminal SxS motif, encouraging their interaction with Smad4 and promoting the translocation of the Smad2/3–Smad4 complexes and accumulation within the nucleus where they regulate targeted gene expression in cooperation with other cofactors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>The function of this pathway is also affected by other signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Notably, PI3K/AKT pathway has been showed to modulate TGF-β signaling through a direct interaction with Smad327,28, as well as inhibiting the Smad2/3 activity by modulating their degradation via phosphorylation of a particular threonine residue within the Smad2/3 linker region29. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Smad3 signaling has been found to be regulated by PDGFRα, but not PDGFRβ, through direct binding with TGF-β receptor II30, indicating that PDGFRα signaling can upregulate TGF-β expression though Smad3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Further, Furukawa et al. reported that activation of Smad3 was stimulated by p38 MAPK33, which are also upregulated by PDGFRα activation though PDGF-AA stimulation34. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the alteration of the ratio of Col I to Col III with thickening and fragility of SSCT in CTS patients may result from increased fibrotic SSCT cells and hyperactive PDGFR signaling resulting in altered ratios of Col III and Col I, along with an overall increase in ECM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, metformin improved the ratio of Col I to Col III above 1.0, similar to the ratios found in normal SSCT6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>Metformin treated cells also decreased F-actin expression, which is a stress fiber, and resulted in aligning along cell shape and orientation as compared to SSCT cells with and without PDGFA treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Decreasing F-actin by treatment with metformin in this study may occur by activating AMPK. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Previously AMPK activation has been shown to reduce F-actin expression via phosphorylation of RhoA43, and thereby inhibits cell spreading and migration by attenuation of lamellipodia44. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>The reduction in stress fibers by activation of AMPK may attenuate mechanosensitivity in SSCT cells, suggesting that metformin may reduce CTS progression by mechanical stress, which is caused by friction force on SSCT during wrist and finger motion47,48. </plain></SENT>
