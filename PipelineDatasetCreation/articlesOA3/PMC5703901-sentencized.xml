<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It plays a critical role in sterol catabolism by converting 3β-hydroxy steroids to 3-oxo-4-ene steroids8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, ChO can be used for biosynthesis of steroid hormones and other pharmaceutical steroids9,10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This enzyme is also known as a virulence factor in pathogenic species, i.e., Mycobacterium sp.11 and Rhodococcus equi 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>ChO has emerged as a useful biotechnological tool employed for the determination of serum and food cholesterol levels13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Protein engineering provides a rigorous strategy and allows the creation of novel enzymes for biotechnological applications14,15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Rational design based on structure and function relationships has achieved significant success for improving enzymatic performance16,17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>For instance, Toyama and co-workers introduced amino acid substitutions into Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase using site-directed mutagenesis and structural comparisons to investigate substrate specificity and affinity18. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Recently, Pimelobacter simplex (also called Arthrobacter simplex) is widely used in the steroids transformation for its high tolerance to organic solvents21, and a novel putative cholesterol oxidase gene from Pimelobacter simplex, PsChO, was identified22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>PsChO is a novel flavin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the dehydrogenation at C3-position of cholestane skeleton substrates (Figs 1 and S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, enzymatic activity and substrate selectivity remain poorly understood, and this has hampered its application toward industrial catalyst. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, successful rational design of functional PsChO would greatly advance our understanding of this family of enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Moreover, insight into substrate selectivity of PsChO can be achieved by structural comparison of the wild-type (WT) and mutants using molecular simulations (MD). </plain></SENT>
