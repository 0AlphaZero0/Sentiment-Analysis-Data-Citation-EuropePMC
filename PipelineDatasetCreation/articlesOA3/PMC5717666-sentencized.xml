</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Floral displays often consist of multiple signal components which transmit information simultaneously across multiple sensory modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These displays are complex in that they broadcast visual, olfactory, tactile, gustatory, electrostatic and even acoustic information [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These signals are metabolically costly and difficult to produce [4], and additional floral display components add not only the metabolic cost of the display component itself [5–7] but also the risk of attracting herbivores [8] and predators which target pollinating insects [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="?"><plain>So, why invest in these multimodal displays? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Many non-exclusive hypotheses have been developed to explain the ubiquity of multimodal or multicomponent signals in nature [10–13], including frameworks dedicated solely to floral signal complexity [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These hypotheses are frequently categorized as relating to either the content of a signal being transmitted, the efficacy of a signal (and how effectively the signal is transmitted through the environment), or the influence of one signal on the receiver's response to another [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Several of the efficacy-based hypotheses relate to the transmission of signals in varying environmental conditions, which are known to affect the generation, reception and transmission of signals [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Varying levels of light, humidity, wind speed and wind direction all have the potential to reduce the efficacy of a signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The efficacy backup hypothesis [13] states that individual signals act as a backup to others in varying environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By communicating signals across multiple sensory modalities, signal producers increase the likelihood of a signal being received. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An example of this is seen in wolf spiders (Schizocosa ocreata) where males, which use both visual and vibratory signals during courtship displays, were observed using more visual signals while on substrates which inhibit the transmission of seismic signals [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This ‘backing up' of signals is also seen in plant–pollinator systems where floral scents act as a backup to floral colour signals in low-light conditions in bumblebees Bombus impatiens [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Floral displays present a unique opportunity to investigate this hypothesis as plant–pollinator relationships have evolved in the presence of multiple abiotic and biotic environmental conditions which have the potential to obscure the transmission of signals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Plants produce a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which mediate interactions between plants and their pollinators, seed dispersers and potential antagonists [8,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These VOCs primarily move through the environment through two processes: diffusion, whereby molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration; and advection, whereby molecules are transported through the motion of a moving fluid [19,20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is also likely that convection [21] and boundary layer effects [22] are also affecting this movement of VOC molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Advection in particular is important in the development of odour plumes, which are high concentrations of VOCs interspersed with air [20,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As VOCs cannot be directed and potentially move slowly through the environment (when compared with signals of other modalities, such as visual information), there is more time for environmental noise to affect their transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This, coupled with the fact that the vastly different physiologies of plants and their pollinators are potentially subjected to a greater array of environmental interference compared with more closely related signallers and receivers, puts volatile transmission at particular risk to environmental noise [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>VOCs can be affected by environmental noise during their production by the plant, or during their transfer through the air, or during their reception and processing by the receiver [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine two types of environmental noise which affect the transmission of VOCs during their transfer through the air: chemical interference and air turbulence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These have been proposed as the two main sources of noise affecting the transmission of floral VOCs, and have the potential to affect both location and context information [24–26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Chemical interference occurs if different plant species share VOCs making the desired flowers more difficult to localize [25], or when fragrance blends from multiple species with varying VOC ratios mix in such a way as to change the content of a signal to a receiver [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Considering that over 1700 VOCs have been identified from plant species, and more importantly the high frequency of particular single compounds such as the monoterpenes limonene, myrcene and linalool in floral scents [27], there is substantial potential for these interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Airborne chemicals, such as tropospheric ozone, hydroxyl radicals and nitrate radicals, can also interact with VOCs [28,29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Air turbulence, which is defined as random fluctuations in the velocity of a fluid [30] and is highly affected by wind, also has the potential to affect VOC transmission through the disruption of odour plumes [20,23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Low-to-medium wind speeds are beneficial to flying insects as they can narrow an odour plume into a straighter structure which can be more easily followed, although some turbulence-generated heterogeneity in the plume may be important to allow orientation [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>However, wind speed becomes detrimental above a certain threshold, as increased turbulence disrupts the structure of odour plumes increasing their spatial and temporal heterogeneity [19,30,32–36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This connection is implied in male long-horned bees, where search times are negatively correlated with wind speed for winds between 0 and 2.7 m s−1, but positively correlated at wind speeds above 2.7 m s−1 [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These increases to search times as well as limited flight movement control during greater wind speeds [38] highlight the detrimental effect high wind speeds can have on pollination interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We argue here that bumblebees have the capacity to use visual information as a backup for olfactory information in the presence of environmental noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Previous tests of the efficacy backup hypothesis have shown bumblebees to use scents to back up colour signals in low-light conditions [17], giving precedence for sensory backup of other modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>This, coupled with both the susceptibility of olfactory signal transfer to noise [24] and the fact that scent rather than colour has been shown to be the preferred discriminating factor in honeybees [39], suggests that this sensory backup could take place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this study, we test the converse possibility of Kaczorowski et al. [17], who suggest that under well-lit conditions, visual signals can play an efficacy backup role for olfactory signals when the latter are obfuscated by noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We used essential oils from other plant species to simulate chemical interference (hereafter referred to as the chemical interference test), and an electric fan to simulate high wind speeds (hereafter called the wind-simulation test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>We recorded learning times, the number of successful drinks and the number of correct choices a forager bee made after landing on an artificial flower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that both chemical interference and interference from high wind speeds will detrimentally affect bee foraging efficiency and that these effects will be mitigated with the introduction of an additional visual signal component to act as a backup. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>We examined bumblebee foraging behaviour in the presence of one of two types of environmental noise which affect the transfer of volatiles: chemical interference and high wind speeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly show that both chemical interference and high wind speeds have detrimental effects on the foraging behaviour of B. terrestris in scented unimodal flowers, but the inclusion of an additional visual signal component to floral displays negated these effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>This suggests that in scenarios where olfactory communication is compromised, visual signal components can act as a backup, supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis as an explanation for the evolution and maintenance of multimodal floral signals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Both chemical interference and high wind speeds caused foragers to take more flower visits to reach the learning criterion in unimodal scented flowers compared with foragers presented with unimodal scented flowers without either interference type (figures 3a and 4b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>These results correspond with the claim by Wilson et al. [24] that olfactory communication between plants and pollinators is vulnerable to chemical interference and windy conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>The total number of rewarding drinks as well as the number of correct choices made after landing was also lower in foragers presented with either of the two interference types and unimodal scented flowers compared with their counterparts which were not presented with interference (figures 3 and 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>These results complement a previous study [23] in which background odours affected the ability of hawkmoth Manduca sexta to correctly navigate an odour plume to its source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>The detrimental effects on learning time, the total number of rewarding drinks and the number of correct choices made after landing were mitigated in foragers presented with bimodal floral displays and either interference type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The increase in post-landing accuracy also complements a previous study [17] where the converse possibility was explored and similar accuracy benefits were found when olfactory signals were used as a backup for visual signals in low-light conditions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>These detrimental effects to foraging efficiency are likely to have negative consequences to both plant and pollinator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Reductions in total number of rewarding drinks would limit the net energy gained by individual bees during foraging and subsequently the colony, negatively affecting survival, growth and reproductive output [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>A decrease in correct choices made after landing may also be detrimental to plant fitness via increased clogging of stigmas by foreign pollen or pollen loss on interspecific species [47,48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that in windy habitats with crowded, scented vegetation (e.g. common to Mediterranean habitats), coloured flowers with species specific fragrances would enhance pollinator constancy and foraging efficiency [49,50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This implies that visual stimuli can act as a backup for olfactory stimuli and that multimodal displays are more reliable stimuli in the presence of olfactory interference, giving further support to the efficacy backup hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>These results mirror a previous study [17] in which olfactory stimuli were found to act as a backup for visual signals for flowers at different levels of illumination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>In the light of the previous study [17], our own findings, and the observation of honeybees using scent as the primary discriminating factor over colour [39], it is possible that both visual and olfactory modalities backup each other, with bees using whichever stimuli are most conspicuous at the time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This also complements a previous study [51] in which bumblebees used spatial arrangements of either visual or olfactory stimuli to reduce nectar discovery times. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects to forager learning times also suggest that both chemical and wind interference can affect associative learning in B. terrestris. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>This effect on learning may have detrimental effects to the level of flower constancy a forager reaches, lessening benefits to the plant, and potentially increase the costs associated with switching plant species for the pollinator [52,53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>This also suggests that flower constancy resulting from multimodal learning is more beneficial to flowers than unimodal learning in the presence of environmental variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>These findings are particularly relevant to nocturnal or crepuscular flowers and pollinators, such as hawkmoths, which rely heavily on olfactory cues to identify and discriminate between flowers, putting them at particular risk of noise which compromises olfactory communication [54–57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Although nocturnal, these foragers can still incorporate visual display components into their search behaviour as seen in the hawkmoth Deilephila elpenor, which can use colour vision to discriminate between coloured stimuli in light condition equivalent to dim starlight [58]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Curiously, chemical interference also impeded foraging on purely visual artificial flowers (figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>This could be an indication of multisensory integration whereby information from one sensory modality influences processing in another modality [59], which has been discussed in relation to bee vision and olfaction [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>This also implies that chemical interference may be detrimental to foraging efficiency even when visual cues are available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, this effect of impeded foraging may also be caused by the essential oils overstimulating the odour receptor cells causing disorientation in the bees, which occurs with other volatiles such as naphthalene [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>If this hindered foraging efficiency is caused by essential oil induced disorientation, our findings suggest that multimodal stimuli may mitigate the effects of insect repellents. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Considering the results, chemical interference has the potential to affect plant–animal interactions in multiple ways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Flowering plants and pollinators inhabiting environments with high plant species richness, such as tropical forests [62] or Mediterranean climatic regions [63], would be particularly susceptible to disruption by chemical interference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Chemical interference could also affect pollinator behaviour in environments with lower plant species richness if the perceptual systems of a pollinator experiences a similarity between odours [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Depending on the perceptual similarity of available odours, their concentration, and the variation of odours experienced during their learning, this phenomenon (referred to as olfactory generalization) could occur in areas of lower plant species richness [65]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>Pollinators may mitigate these effects of olfactory noise through perceptual filtering, whereby only particular odours present in complex odour blends are detected by the antenna and only a select few of these detected volatiles elicit behavioural responses [66–69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>This perceptual filtering could assist in the location of particular flowers in the presence of multiple VOCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, olfactory noise could be beneficial to plants that are at risk of attracting herbivores through their volatiles [8], or to food-deceptive Batesian mimic flowers [70] which could potentially receive more visits from pollinators if the olfactory signals of rewarding flowers have compromised efficacy during learning or foraging. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>These effects of chemical interference also relate to atmospheric pollution, which affects all terrestrial ecosystems and potentially affects VOC transfer at a global level [71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>McFrederick et al. [64] propose that the distance at which pollinators can detect highly reactive volatiles has changed from kilometres during pre-industrial times to less than 200 m in modern times due to the destruction of volatiles via chemical reactions with atmospheric pollutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>It would be of interest to know which VOCs are particularly reactive to atmospheric pollutants and consequently which plants, pollinators and environments are put at particular risk by these pollutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Wilson et al. [22] suggest that characterizing entire ‘odoromes’, the collective scent profile of habitats, would be a useful tool in understanding the baseline levels of olfactory noise that insects encounter as well as increasing our understanding of how airborne pollutants from anthropogenic sources affect volatile signalling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>With these data, we would also gain insights into which habitats have collective scent profiles that facilitate or hinder the transmission of volatile signals used by pollinators, herbivores or insect parasitoids and predators. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>It would also be valuable to explore other interactions which would be affected by chemical interference and turbulence caused by increased wind speeds in contexts other than pollination, as VOCs play important roles in other multitrophic interactions including the repelling of herbivores, attracting predators and parasitoids and signalling to other plants [72,73]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that in some instances, the inclusion of additional blends of floral volatiles may not contribute towards noise or decreases in the efficacy of a learned VOC blend. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In cases where odour blends have no chemical overlap or have shared compounds that are not perceived by the forager, it is unlikely that there would be any detrimental effects to signal transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It has also been speculated that in some instances, the presence of additional and contrasting VOC blends may enhance a response to a learned VOC blend by highlighting the perceptual contrast [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>However, the detrimental effects demonstrated in the treatments with chemical interference imply that this is not the case with the VOCs used within our study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In terms of interference through high wind speeds, we saw detrimental effects to learning speeds, nectar collection rate and post-landing accuracy, mirroring the negative effects found in previous studies [35,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This disruption to foraging behaviour is likely to be caused by turbulent air movements stretching, compressing and tearing apart odour filaments alongside the creation of odour-free gaps, creating difficulties when locating the source of the odour [20,75]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>It is also unknown if the flight arenas used within the experiments are large enough to allow for this formation and subsequent degradation of odour plumes which are of ecologically relevant sizes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Therefore, field experiments done in natural wind and airborne chemical environments of study organisms would be beneficial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Alpine meadows [76] and Mediterranean climactic regions [77] would make appropriate study locations as habitats at risk of this wind-related noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Wind speeds are also projected to increase in certain environments due to climate change [78,79]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Depending on the environment, these increases in wind speed may possibly decrease the distance at which plants can elicit a behavioural response from their pollinators through odour plume disruption [80]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Communication between plants and their visitors is of extreme importance to all terrestrial ecosystems and by understanding the factors which influence the evolution and effectiveness of this information transfer we gain a great insight into how this relationship can be affected in a changing world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that both chemical interference and high wind speeds have negative effects on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees B. terrestris in scented unimodal flowers, but the inclusion of an additional visual signal component to the floral displays negated these negative effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>This suggests that visual signal components can act as a backup in environments where olfactory communication is compromised, benefitting both plant and pollinator, and supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis as an explanation for the evolution and maintenance of multimodal floral signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>It is our hope that this study provides a proof of concept for these effects on the transmission of olfactory signals and inspires future research into which areas these interference types are most (or least) likely to occur, and at what spatial scales. </plain></SENT>
