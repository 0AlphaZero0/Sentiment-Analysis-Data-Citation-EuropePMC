</text></title><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Malaria is still a major global public health problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>According to the World Malaria Report 2016, more than 200 million people suffer from malaria and over 400,000 people die as a consequence of this disease [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Malaria is caused by parasitic protozoans belonging to the genus Plasmodium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>At least five species of Plasmodium are capable of infecting humans, including P. falciparum, P. knowlesi, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Among them, P. falciparum causes the most-often fatal and medically severe form of the disease, and has thus received the most attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The animal malaria parasites, such as P. berghei, P. chabaudi, P. vinckei, and P. yoelii, are natural parasites of rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>They are usually used as models to study malarial infections in the laboratory [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Two biological features of P. falciparum are particularly noteworthy regarding its ability to cause human disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>One is that, as a human malaria parasite, P. falciparum can invade and parasitize human erythrocytes, while the rodent malaria parasites are infectious to rodent species but not humans, suggesting that P. falciparum possesses some properties required for parasitizing human erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The other feature is that P. falciparum is much more virulent than all other human malaria species. P. falciparum infection may progress to severe malaria, which manifests as one or more of the following severe complications: cerebral malaria (CM), severe malaria anemia, and acidosis/respiratory distress (RD) [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Among these complications, CM accounts for a significant proportion of malaria-related deaths and shows potential for the induction of neurological deficits in survivors [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by the accumulation of P. falciparum-infected RBCs (iRBCs) at the pigmented trophozoite stage in the microvasculature of the brain [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Very few malaria deaths have been reported for P. vivax and P. knowlesi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In fact, P. vivax rarely kills the infected individual and is responsible for most cases of benign tertian malaria [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Identification of the genetic basis of the aforementioned biological features can help in the discovery of genes contributing to human disease, the development of new strategies to prevent P. falciparum infecting humans, and the treatment of severe malaria in humans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Recently, the genome sequences of several malaria parasites have become publicly available [8], making comparative genome analysis a practical strategy to search for human disease-related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>A series of genes contributing to human disease have been identified by this method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>For example, the comparative analysis of human and rodent malaria parasite genomes revealed that two enzymes, PF3D7_0520500 and PF3D7_0614000, which are essential enzymes in thiamine biosynthesis, are absent in rodent malaria parasites [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>As the elimination of thiamine greatly impairs the erythrocytic multiplication rates of malaria parasites, the presence of the thiamine synthesis pathway in human malaria parasites can be seen as an adaption to increase the viability of such parasites in human erythrocytes and contribute to human pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a comparison of the genome of non-cytoadherent P. falciparum D10 to that of cytoadherent P. falciparum 3D7 revealed a subtelomeric deletion on the right arm of chromosome 9 in D10 [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Further experimental study of 25 genes in this subtelomeric region indicated that the absence of virulence-associated protein 1 (PfVAP1) was responsible for the non-cytoadherent phenotype of D10, demonstrating that PfVAP1 is a virulence-related factor [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Although comparative genome analysis is feasible for the identification of genes associated with a particular phenotype, there were two limitations in previous analyses: First, earlier analyses only focused on genes specific to a group of species (group-specific), while genes conserved across all species but expanding in a group of species (group-expansion) were usually not considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Second, using the previous method to identify the species-enriched genes among n species required at least \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \left(\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{n}{2}\right) $$\end{document}n2 comparisons, which makes the task quite resource-intensive when n is too large. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In this study, to identify genes related to human disease in the P. falciparum genome, we developed a virtual genome method that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Three human malaria parasites, namely, P. falciparum, P. knowlesi and P. vivax, and three rodent malaria parasites, namely, P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii, were selected because these species have NCBI taxon IDs, and their host-tropism and virulence are relatively well characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that all of the analyzed malaria parasites had a common virtual genome, where each virtual gene actually represents a cluster of real genes whose protein sequences are similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic difference can be attributed to differences in the expression of virtual genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Genes associated with a particular biological feature are those highly or specifically expressed in the group of species with such features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To look for genes linked to human disease, first, we established a protein sequence similarity network through sequence alignment and utilized the modularity method to partition this network into thousands of clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The obtained clusters varied in terms of the number of genes, ranging from one to more than 1000 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Each cluster was considered a virtual gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Second, we compared the enriched values of all clusters in human malaria parasites with those in rodent malaria parasites to find genes responsible for P. falciparum parasitizing human erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Third, we looked for genes related to virulence by comparing cluster values in P. falciparum with those in P. vivax and P. knowlesi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Finally, to discover novel molecules contributing to CM, we integrated gene expression data and extracted virulence-related genes highly transcribed at the trophozoite stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>One candidate gene was selected as an attractive starting point for follow-up experimental investigation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>P. falciparum can parasitize human erythrocytes and is the most virulent malaria parasite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>To identify the genetic basis of these important biological features, we performed comparative analysis of three human and three rodent malaria parasite genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We assumed that all of these Plasmodium species have a common virtual genome, but differ in virtual gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Genes highly expressed in a subgroup of Plasmodium species are frequently associated with the unique feature of such parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>For example, var. is specific to P. falciparum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>It encodes the prime virulence factor PfEMP1 involved in the attachment of infected erythrocytes to microvascular [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To find species-group enriched genes, we performed protein sequence alignment to construct a network where each edge represents a significant hit between query and target (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Then, we developed a modified BGLL (see methods) algorithm and applied it to identify sequence clusters within this network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Genes within each cluster are significantly similar in their protein sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Finally, the members of each cluster are allocated to the Plasmodium species from which they are derived, generating enriched values of all clusters in those species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>The enriched value of a cluster can be considered to reflect the expression level of such a cluster. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Species group-enriched clusters can be found by comparing the cluster values in all ingroup species with those in outgroup species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Genes within the enriched clusters are then defined as species group-enriched genes.Fig. 1Identification of group-enriched genes by virtual genome method. a Workflow of our comparative analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>Protein sequence alignment was performed using phmmer to construct a protein similarity network where each edge represents a significant hit between query and target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Then, a modified BGLL algorithm was applied to find clusters within this network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Each cluster was considered as a virtual gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Genes within these clusters were allocated to the species from which they originated, subsequently generating enriched values of all clusters in six species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Group-enriched genes can be identified by comparing cluster values in ingroup species with those in outgroup species. b The number of edges and the number of components included in the protein similarity networks that were obtained under different thresholds. c The number of clusters identified by the modified BGLL algorithm using different cut-off values of modularity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Components 1 (PC1) and 2 (PC2) represent 79% and 9% of total variance, respectively </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Each protein sequence of the six Plasmodium species was used as a query and searched against the total protein sequences of these species by phmmer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>Figure 1b shows the numbers of edges and components within the disconnected network using expectation values ranging from 1E − 1 to 1E − 16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship between the number of edges and the threshold values was almost linear, an unapparent knee point was still observed at 1E − 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The number of components significantly increased at 1E − 4 and mildly increased at 1E − 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Further decrease in the threshold led to a slight increase in the number of components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we set the threshold as 1E − 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The resulting disconnected network consisted of 931,335 edges and 3768 components. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>We then adopted a modified BGLL algorithm to identify sequence clusters within this disconnected network (see Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>Figure 1c shows the number of clusters identified using different modularity cut-off values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>An increase in cut-off values from 0.4 to 0.5 led to a significant drop in the number of clusters, implying that many cluster structures were not well identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>The number of clusters had a relative apparent increase when the cut-off value was reduced from 0.2 to 0.1, indicating that several homologs had been classified into different groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>To avoid the presence of a supercluster consisting of several independent clusters and the misclassification of remote homologs, we set the cut-off value to 0.2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Under this condition, 33,314 genes were grouped into 4605 clusters (Additional file 1: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Thus, we achieved a virtual genome which represents a collection of 4605 virtual genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Among the obtained clusters, some of them, such as Cluster_12 and Cluster_223 consisting of 4 and 9 genes, respectively, comprise genes from a single Plasmodium species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>Some clusters, such as Cluster_15 and Cluster_16 which contain 39 and 19 genes, include genes from six species (Additional file 2: Figure S1), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Cluster_1 has the largest number of members, and it contains 1096 vertices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>The genes within this cluster were all from rodent malaria parasite genomes, but absent in human malaria parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>A total of 426 clusters constitute a member. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the obtained sequence clusters, we generated the expression profiles of all clusters in six Plasmodium species, and each column shows the enrichment values of all clusters in such a species (Additional file 3: Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis (PCA) of all of these cluster values demonstrated that P. falciparum differs from five other species in the second component, which represents 9% of the variance, while P. yoelii differs from other parasites in the first component, which represents 79% of the variance (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the cluster profiles of six Plasmodium species can reveal species group-enriched genes, including group-specific genes and group-expansion genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>For example, Cluster_32 is composed of 227 genes and found to be unique to P. falciparum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Genes within this cluster encode RIFIN/STEVOR proteins which exist specifically in P. falciparum [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Additionally, Cluster_161, which consists of 27 FIKK genes, was found in all species, but was much more abundant in P. falciparum than in all other Plasmodium species, consistent with the report that the FIKK gene had been amplified in P. falciparum to approximately 20 sequence-related members [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our method was shown to be feasible for identifying species group-enriched genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>In comparison with previous genomic analysis where comparison was performed between any two of these species [9], our method outperforms this in two aspects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>First, our analysis is more comprehensive than the previous approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In our analysis, we can identify both group-specific and group-expansion genes, while in the previous comparative analysis, the investigators usually only focused on group-specific genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Second, our method makes the identification of genes underlying phenotypic differences much simpler than the previous analysis because we avoid performing comparative analysis of all pairs of species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, we looked for P. falciparum genes linked to the infection of human erythrocytes and virulence by our method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>A cluster was considered to be enriched in a group of species if its minimal value in all ingroup species was fivefold higher than its maximal value in the outgroup species. </plain></SENT>

PF3D7_1322100 is a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase gene and its protein product methylates histone H3K36 and plays a role in immune evasion [20, 21]. PF3D7_0807700 encodes a serine protease, DegP, which has a role in the growth and development of P. falciparum through its ability to confer protection against thermal/oxidative stress [22].

<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The GBP protein contains a tandem repeat that can bind with glycophorin on the erythrocyte surface [35], implying that this protein might have a role in mediating the binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected ones. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par44"><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In this study, to identify P. falciparum genes that contribute to human disease, we developed a virtual genome method that can be applied to identify genes enriched in a group of species, including group-specific genes and group-expansion genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>By this method, we looked for protein-coding genes in the P. falciparum genome that are responsible for parasitizing human erythrocytes, for human virulence, and for CM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Our method can be used not only for malaria genome comparisons, but also for other pathogen genome comparisons, such as for Toxoplasma gondii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>As mentioned previously, our method is much simpler and more comprehensive than previous comparative analysis methods; however, it has two limitations that should be pointed out. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>One limitation is that we used the modified BGLL algorithm to find disjointed clusters, but in practice many clusters overlap to some extent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Some vertices were shared by many clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is reasonable that an algorithm allowing cluster overlap should outperform the current BGLL method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Actually, we attempted to apply the extended Girvan and Newman algorithm and the clique percolation method to identify clusters overlapping within the protein similarity network [37, 38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Owing to high requirements for computational resources and the analysis not being finished even 7 days after program initiation, we had to choose the fast-greedy method of using the BGLL algorithm instead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Another limitation is that edge weight was not considered when performing modularity analysis, leading to a failure to identify some clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>For example, in the P. falciparum genome, the DBL family has three members, including genes encoding erythrocyte binding antigen-175 (EBA-175), EBA-140, and EBA-181 [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>They were assigned with var. gene family members to Cluster_63, as all of these genes produce proteins containing DBL domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Actually, despite significant similarities among these protein sequences, their alignment scores were quite different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>The scores between any two members of the DBL family were much higher than those between members of the DBL family and members of PfEMP1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>To overcome this issue, we can introduce edge weight, which represents the degree of conservation between the query and the target, to construct a weighted network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The identification of clusters within the weighted network might provide a better result. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>We compared cluster values in human malaria parasites with those in rodent malaria parasites in the search for P. falciparum genes potentially responsible for parasitizing human erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>In total, 115 genes were identified to be enriched in human malaria parasites and to participate in many biological processes, such as thiamine biosynthesis, parasite growth and development, and purine metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>One peculiarity of human malaria parasites is that these species contain several genes whose proteins are involved in trafficking and the display of membrane proteins on the surface of infected erythrocytes, including three EMP1-trafficking protein-coding genes and SURFIN4.2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>The disruption of some of these genes in P. falciparum resulted in a complete lack or greatly reduced expression levels of surface proteins on the surface of infected erythrocytes [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Thus, we proposed that human malaria parasites are capable of utilizing a distinctive transport system to export proteins on the membrane of infected erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 57 clusters that consist of 289 genes from P. berghei were enriched in rodent malaria parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Most of these genes are located within subtelomeric regions which usually contain various repeated elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Subtelomeric regions are usually responsible for frequent duplication events and recombination events, which are mechanisms for generating antigenic diversity of genes and enhancing the adaption of organisms to the environment [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Cellular component analysis demonstrated that most of the proteins encoded by these genes are displayed on the surface of erythrocytes, and thus could be potential targets of the host’s immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>In light of these results, we speculated that the majority of rodent parasite-enriched genes are probably involved in antigenic variation and immune evasion, subsequently contributing to survival in rodent erythrocytes and the establishment of long-lasting chronic infection, a process that is essential in malaria parasites to ensure mosquito transmission and the completion of the life cycle [41]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par47"><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>To search for genes related to the virulence of P. falciparum parasites, we compared enriched values of all clusters in P. falciparum with those in P. vivax and P. knowlesi. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Finally, we identified 493 candidate genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Some of these genes encode proteins related to cytoadhesion, such as RIFIN/STEVOR and PfEMP1 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Others participate in erythrocyte invasion and the inhibition of antithrombin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>In particular, a number of the P. falciparum-enriched genes were shown to be associated with membrane protein trafficking, including genes from the FIKK, PfMC2TM, EPF3, and EPF4 families, suggesting that P. falciparum has a more powerful membrane protein transporting system than the other two human malaria parasites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation for this is that the P. falciparum parasite has developed a unique cytoadhesion and antigenic variation system encoded by genes from var., rifin/stevor, or other families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>The trafficking and correct exposure of these molecules on infected erythrocytes require the assistance of a number of trafficking proteins encoded by the aforementioned genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these trafficking proteins could be novel therapeutic targets to reduce pathogen virulence by decreasing the exposure of virulence factors on the surface of erythrocytes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par48"><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to discover novel genes that contribute to CM, by the integration of FFT analysis, we identified 55 candidate genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Considering that surface antigen PIESP2 contains the gap-junction-related Neuromodulin_N domain and anti-PIESP2 might protect against malaria, we finally chose this protein as an interesting target for further experimental study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Supposed that PIESP2 participated in CM, blockage of this antigen by an antibody could be a promising strategy to prevent CM for the following reasons: One is that the P. falciparum parasite has an approximately 48-h intraerythrocytic developmental cycle and PIESP2 is highly expressed at the trophozoite stage, which means that the antibody against PIESP2 has more than 20 h to recognize and bind with this antigen before the release of new merozoites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Therefore, compared with antibodies against invasion-related parasite proteins, anti-PIESP2 might be more effective to prevent malaria infection because the parasite invasion process is extremely rapid (taking less than 2 min) and is only at risk of immunological attack for a very short time [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The other reason is that antibody against PIESP2 might disrupt the interaction between PIESP2 and its interactant on the endothelium surface, subsequently decreasing the binding of infected erythrocytes on the microvasculature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>To date, we have successfully produced a soluble extracellular domain of PIESP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Efforts to elucidate the function of PIESP2 are currently ongoing. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>BGLL algorithm consists of two steps: in the first step, each node is considered a cluster. </plain></SENT>
