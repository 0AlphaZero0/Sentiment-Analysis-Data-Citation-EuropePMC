</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>African tick-bite fever (ATBF), caused by Rickettsia africae, is the most common tick-borne bacterial zoonosis in sub-Saharan Africa,1 where two of its main vectors, the ticks Amblyomma variegatum (central Mozambique northwards) and Amblyomma hebraeum (mostly in South Africa), are usually found to have high infection rates in nature (&gt;50%) and have significant aggressiveness to bite humans.1 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical profile of ATBF consists of an abrupt onset of fever, fatigue, headache, and myalgia, approximately 5–7 days following a bite by an infected tick. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The present report, to our knowledge, is the first confirmed case of ATBF in a South American traveler that returned from sub-Saharan Africa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that R. africae has been identified in at least 22 sub-Saharan countries,1 the well-reported relevance of ATBF among febrile travelers, and the increasing number of people from all over the world traveling for different purposes (including ecotourism and outdoor activities) to potential endemic areas for ATBF,2,6 the real number of cases, incidence, morbidity of this rickettsial disease among travelers worldwide is not known, and certainly underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This probably results from a somatization of elements: a usually mild disease, not rarely self-limited; a poor clinician awareness with a possible misdiagnosis; and a limited access to laboratorial tools for diagnosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, some years ago, four cases of spotted fever illness were reported in Argentinean travelers returning from South Africa.12 While the clinical profiles of the cases were compatible with ATBF, there was no confirmatory diagnosis for R. africae or any other spotted fever-specific agent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In the present report, some factors contributed to the early suspicion, opportune treatment—early and empiric therapy with the first line antimicrobial, doxycycline—and appropriated laboratorial investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we have previously reported an imported and fatal case of Mediterranean spotted fever in a Portuguese traveler that arrived at Brazil, which was also confirmed by rickettsial isolation and molecular detection.13 The recognition that eschar (tache noire) as an important clue for diagnosis of some rickettsial diseases was essential for the suspicion of the case presented here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Because of the cross-reactivity of antibody responses to spotted fever group Rickettsia species,1 clinicians must be aware of the importance of submitting appropriate samples for molecular detection or isolation techniques when available, as serology alone is not sufficient to identify the species responsible for infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Thanks to the appropriated collection of samples in this report, we could isolate and identified R. africae as the etiological agent. </plain></SENT>
