Using a classic question regarding the frequency of paired fin loss in teleost fishes as a case study, we sought to create automated methods to facilitate the integration of broad-scale trait data with a sizable species-level phylogeny. Similar to the evolutionary pattern previously described for limbs, pelvic and pectoral fin reduction and loss are thought to have occurred independently multiple times in the evolution of fishes. We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify the presence and absence of pectoral and pelvic fins of 12,582 species. To do this, we integrated a synthetic morphological supermatrix of phenotypic data for the pectoral and pelvic fins for teleost fishes from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (two presence/absence characters for 3047 taxa) with a species-level tree for teleost fishes from the Open Tree of Life project (38,419 species). The integration method detailed herein harnessed a new combined approach by utilizing data based on ontological inference, as well as phylogenetic propagation, to reduce overall data loss. Using inference enabled by ontology-based annotations, missing data were reduced from 98.0% to 85.9%, and further reduced to 34.8% by phylogenetic data propagation. These methods allowed us to extend the data to an additional 11,293 species for a total of 12,582 species with trait data. The pectoral fin appears to have been independently lost in a minimum of 19 lineages and the pelvic fin in 48. Though interpretation is limited by lack of phylogenetic resolution at the species level, it appears that following loss, both pectoral and pelvic fins were regained several (3) to many (14) times respectively. Focused investigation into putative regains of the pectoral fin, all within one clade (Anguilliformes), showed that the pectoral fin was regained at least twice following loss. Overall, this study points to specific teleost clades where strategic phylogenetic resolution and genetic investigation will be necessary to understand the pattern and frequency of pectoral fin reversals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Ancestral state reconstruction</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics pipeline</kwd><kwd>evolutionary morphology</kwd><kwd>fishes</kwd><kwd>inference</kwd><kwd>missing data</kwd><kwd>ontology</kwd><kwd>paired fins</kwd><kwd>phenotype</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1062404</award-id><award-id>DBI-1062542</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">University of South Dakota</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100011411</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>How often&#x02014;across all 33,000<inline-formula><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The information required to answer these straightforward questions regarding character evolution, namely trait data and a relatively resolved species-level phylogeny, has not been readily available at the scale of tens of thousands of species until recently (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hinchliff et al. 2015</xref>). Investigators interested in addressing such macroevolutionary questions have been confronted with challenges when attempting to combine trait data with phylogenies at magnitudes not readily supported by current tools (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Arbuckle 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hunt and Slater 2016</xref>). <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Alfaro et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that some of these challenges involve producing and manipulating large-scale phylogenies. In addition, the development of larger phylogenies has further exposed the lack of resources necessary to visualize and interpret results (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Harmon et al. 2013</xref>). Not only are tools for mapping large trait data sets on phylogenies lacking, but phylogenetic programs also lack the scalability necessary to approach macroevolutionary questions (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Harmon etal. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Harris and Arbuckle 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Hunt and Slater 2016</xref>). Although methods to investigate trait evolution at larger scales are improving (e.g., iTOL: <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Letunic and Bork 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Harmon et al. 2013</xref>), many still lack the ability to integrate data sets across multiple data formats and analyses.</p><p>The peculiar absence of paired fins in fishes such as eels (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 2006</xref>) has fascinated scientists since at least the time of Aristotle (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Ogle 1882</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Leunissen 2010</xref>). Notably, over the past 40 years, ichthyologist <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Nelson (1976</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) documented the absence of pelvic fins in members of 92 teleost families (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>), which represent nearly one-quarter of all fish families. This led him to conclude that pelvic fins have been independently lost at least 50 times (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>). His analysis, as well as subsequent ones (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2010</xref>); however, did not consider phylogenetic relationships, in which absence or presence at an ancestral node determines the number of putative losses. Further, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson (2006)</xref> summarized data at the family level, for example, for Ophichthidae: &#x0201c;pectoral fins present or absent,&#x0201d; often without naming the species associated with a particular condition or citing the primary literature in this regard. In contrast to data on pelvic fins, the frequency of pectoral fin loss is poorly documented, with few exceptions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Britz 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al. 2011</xref>). Further, whether pectoral or pelvic fins may have been regained following loss remains uncertain (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2010</xref>). Though there are known exceptions to Dollo&#x02019;s law, that is, that the loss of a complex trait is evolutionarily irreversible (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gould 1970</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Farris 1977</xref>), questions concerning the taxonomic scope, frequency of reversal, and potential genetic bases (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Collin and Miglietta 2008</xref>) remain unanswered.</p><p>Addressing any broad-scale question concerning the evolution of traits requires a comprehensive source of data. Such large data sets must be readily extractable and computable, as manual aggregation from a dispersed literature is essentially intractable. Free text phenotypic descriptions from the literature that are tagged with appropriate ontology terms [via Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)] provide semantic information that allows for automated collection and computation of morphological data across species (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Deans et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>). For paired fin data, we used the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB; kb.phenoscape.org) as the source for computable phenotypes across vertebrates. The KB contains ontology-annotated phenotypic data based primarily on published character matrices (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>), but also some monographic treatments (e.g., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2016</xref>). It is particularly enriched in vertebrate skeletal features, such as fins, limbs, and their support structures. The ontology-based data uniquely allow inference of the presence or absence of a phenotypic feature based on indirect descriptions of the feature or its parts. For example, such inference has been shown to greatly enlarge the available data (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>), a desirable feature here given the paucity of direct statements by authors concerning the presence/absence of paired fins. Thus, rather than combing through publications relevant to 33,000<inline-formula><tex-math id="M2">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For teleost fishes, the recent literature includes some well-resolved and broad-scale trees based on molecular data (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Near et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Betancur et al. 2013</xref>), though there are several impediments to their use. First, they involve only a subset of teleost species; for example, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Betancur et al. (2013)</xref> sampled 1410 species. Second, when the terminal taxa are at a supra-specific level, for example, families, orders, and superorders as in the <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Near et al. (2012)</xref> tree, it is difficult to know which species were included in these groupings at the time of analysis (though actual species sampled were provided in the case of <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Near et al. 2012</xref>). Further, even if authors report the species included in an analysis (as in <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Near et al. 2012</xref>), the effort to add these manually to a large tree is untenable. Third, assembling published trees that likely differ in topology becomes increasingly difficult to accomplish manually at large scales, and requires automated methods of tree synthesis. Thus we accessed the Open Tree of Life project (Open Tree; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opentreeoflife.org">http://opentreeoflife.org</ext-link>) for a comprehensive tree for teleosts at the species level (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Hinchliff et al. 2015</xref>). The Open Tree dynamically constructs a tree by synthesizing published phylogenies along with taxonomic data using the &#x0201c;propinquity&#x0201d; supertree pipeline (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Redelings and Holder 2017</xref>). The output includes detailed provenance reports (e.g., node support, conflicts, and resolutions) associated with nodes resolved by a source other than the reference taxonomy.</p><p>While comprehensively synthesizing all available paired fin trait data for teleosts was the first step in investigating patterns in fin evolution, we also applied new methods to extend existing data, while minimizing overall data loss. This was achieved by several means. First, we used inferred trait data (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2016</xref>) to fully utilize existing information on paired fins in the literature. For example, if an author reports that part of a fin is present in a particular taxon, then the fin itself is inferred to be present. Second, we propagated data that investigators associated with families and genera in their matrices and descriptions to the species level, thus extending the data as intended by the authors and generating a more comprehensive matrix for ancestral state reconstruction. Finally, we improved the method of taxonomic reconciliation between taxa to which trait data are attached and taxa included in the phylogeny. This was necessary because different sources of names are used in taxonomies referenced by the Phenoscape KB and the Open Tree of Life. The total expansion of phenotypic data through ontology-based inference and taxonomically-based propagation was substantial and is a valuable model to be followed for macroevolutionary studies.</p><p>Using questions concerning the frequency of paired fin loss in fishes as an example, we demonstrate the use of new knowledge resources to address basic questions involving large-scale phenotypic evolution. Increasing the taxonomic scope makes apparent the value of these new resources, as well as deficiencies in existing methods to integrate the data. The bioinformatics pipeline developed in the process of this work reflects a set of essential requirements for large-scale macroevolutionary syntheses.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="SEC1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="SEC1.1"><title>Large-scale Computable Phenotypic Data</title><p>To compile large-scale morphological data on pectoral and pelvic fin presence/absence across all teleost fishes we needed a publically available source containing computable phenotypic data that allowed extraction of a single matrix across a specified taxon. The Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB) contains 21,569 character states annotated with 526,221 phenotypes for 5208 extant and fossil vertebrates from 171 comparative studies (as of October 21, 2016). Twenty-two of the 171 studies in the KB were added to fully represent the distribution of pectoral and pelvic fins across teleosts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary</ext-link> Table S1 available on Dryad at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v0s27">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v0s27</ext-link>). These studies are primarily phylogenetic, but also include monographic treatments (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2016</xref>) and reviews (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>). Phenotypic data from the KB are annotated with taxonomic names from the Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology (VTO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vto/2016-1017/vto.owl">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/vto/2016-1017/vto.owl</ext-link>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Midford et al. 2013</xref>). The VTO is built upon the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, which provides the hierarchical backbone for extant taxa; valid species are drawn from the expert source, the Catalog of Fishes (CoF; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Eschmeyer et al. 2013</xref>). PaleoDB (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Uhen et al. 2013</xref>) supplements extinct taxa (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Midford et al. 2013</xref>). The VTO (July 2012) contains fewer teleost species (31,726) than the current CoF (33,191; November 20, 2017) because it has not been updated with a new version of the CoF.</p><p>Characters were annotated using the Entity&#x02013;Quality (EQ) formalism (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Mungall et al. 2007</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) with Phenex software (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Balhoff et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Specifically, ontological terms and relationships representing anatomical aspects of the paired fins, girdles, their parts and developmental precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) were drawn from the Uberon multispecies anatomy ontology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/2016-09-07/uberon.owl">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/releases/2016-09-07/uberon.owl</ext-link>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Mungall et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Haendel et al. 2014</xref>). Quality terms that represent the variation in these anatomical entities, such as presence/absence, size, or shape, were drawn from the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/releases/2016-09-15/pato.owl">http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pato/releases/2016-09-15/pato.owl</ext-link>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gkoutos et al. 2005</xref>). New terms were added to Uberon as driven by the curated literature, for example, the structure &#x0201c;pelvic intercleithral cartilage&#x0201d; was used in the description of the pelvic fin for gobiiform fishes (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>), and thus it was added to Uberon with label &#x0201c;pelvic intercleithral cartilage&#x0201d; and identifier UBERON:4300151, and related to other terms as a type of &#x0201c;cartilage element&#x0201d; (UBERON:0007844) and a type of &#x0201c;pelvic region element&#x0201d; (UBERON:0005179). Terms and relationships in Uberon were edited using the ontology editing software Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; v4.3 (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Noy et al. 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Subgraph from the Uberon anatomy ontology showing the relationships of terms associated with pectoral fin and girdle.

For example, if an author states that a genus lacks a fin, we annotated absence (&#x0201c;0&#x0201d;) to the genus. If an author indicates that a fin is absent at the family level, we annotated absence to the family. In cases where authors describe features for supra-familial-level taxa, but do not specify family membership in the grouping, the annotation was applied to the supra-familial taxon named in the publication. For example, &#x0201c;sixteen principal branched caudal fin rays&#x0201d; is stated to characterize Osteoglossomorpha (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>), and thus we annotated &#x0201c;Osteoglossomorpha&#x0201d; with this character; lower taxonomic levels were not annotated. However, where authors indicate family membership, we applied annotations to the contained families. For example, synapomorphies for Lampridiformes (also &#x0201c;Lampriformes&#x0201d;) were applied to seven families, as per the authors&#x02019; description that &#x0201c;Lampridiformes comprise seven monophyletic families, Veliferidae, Lamprididae (also &#x02018;Lampridae&#x02019;), Stylephoridae, Lophotidae, Radiicephalidae, Trachipteridae, and Regalecidae,&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>). Authors may also describe characters for higher-level taxa not contained in the VTO (e.g., &#x0201c;Holacanthopterygii&#x0201d; in <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>) and for which member taxa were not specified; in these cases annotations were not made. Finally, in cases where the taxonomy used in a publication differed from the VTO, we annotated the anatomical features to the taxa as intended by the author. For example, some taxa included in Osmeridae by <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson (2010)</xref> are elevated to their own family (Plecoglossidae) in the VTO; we ensured that the characters were applied to the relevant taxa within the family Plecoglossidae.</p><p>In cases where a higher-level taxon was described as polymorphic for the presence and absence of a particular fin, we investigated the literature to determine which of its species possess or lack the fin, and we curated the species-level data from these studies into the KB. However, in cases in which a polymorphism described for a higher-level taxon could not be traced in the literature to particular species, we excluded the data for the higher-level taxon, as was the case for pelvic fin absence asserted for the catfish families Schilbidae and Siluridae (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 2006</xref>).</p><p>An additional challenge for annotation of data in review papers, particularly at the family level or above, is the frequent lack of alternative character state descriptions. For example, eels (Anguilliformes) were asserted to have the apomorphic feature &#x0201c;pelvic girdle and fins absent&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wiley and Johnson 2010</xref>), and although by implication one might assume that the alternative state &#x0201c;pelvic girdle and fins present&#x0201d; might apply to other fishes, it is not stated by the authors. In these cases, we annotated only the asserted state and never an implied alternative state so as to not misrepresent author intent. The guidelines developed for annotation that reflect the above conditions were added to the Phenoscape Guide to Character Annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Guide_to_Character_Annotation">http://phenoscape.org/wiki/Guide_to_Character_Annotation</ext-link>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dahdul et al. 2010</xref>), and followed consistently.</p></sec><sec id="SEC1.2"><title>Synthetic Morphological Supermatrix</title><p>We used the OntoTrace tool (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>) to retrieve a synthetic morphological supermatrix of presence/absence characters from the KB pertaining to two characters [pectoral fin: (1) present, (0) absent; pelvic fin: (1) present, (0) absent] for all teleost taxa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S1 available on Dryad, 06/08/2017). The following query was used to obtain the matrix: taxon &#x0201c;Teleostei&#x0201d; and entities &#x0201c;pectoral fin&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;pelvic fin.&#x0201d; The matrix is in NeXML format (<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Vos et al. 2012</xref>) and contained data provenance in the metadata. OntoTrace uses inference enabled by the logical relationships among ontology-annotated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) to infer the presence or absence of entities that were not directly asserted by an author. For example, the character &#x0201c;pectoral fin rays are unbranched&#x0201d; in <italic>Neocyttus rhomboidalis</italic> was described by <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Tyler et al. (2003)</xref>, based on direct evidence from a voucher specimen at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 91746; <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Tyler 1980</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Tyler et al. 2003</xref>). The character was annotated as Entity: &#x0201c;pectoral fin ray,&#x0201d; Quality: &#x0201c;branched&#x0201d; and the computer then inferred that the pectoral fin rays and the pectoral fin are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The converse, however, is not true; the presence of pectoral fin does not imply that any particular part is present. The absence of a paired fin, however, would be inferred from the absence of its girdle, as seen in <italic>Acanthostracion quadricornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) based on multiple voucher specimens from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (e.g., ANSP 98614, ANSP 98615, ANSP 9816; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Santini and Tyler 2003</xref>). This reflects domain knowledge that paired fins are never present without their supporting girdle structures. However, the opposite condition, that is, presence of a girdle, does not imply that the fin is present. There are several examples in fishes where the pectoral girdle is present, but the pectoral fin is absent (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 2006</xref>), such as the black pomfret (<italic>Parastromateus niger</italic>), the Parona leatherjacket (<italic>Parnoa signata</italic>), and the fanfin (<italic>Robia legula</italic>). Finally, the absence of a paired fin can also be inferred from the absence of the larval fin or fin bud, but not the converse, that is, the presence of a larval fin or fin bud does not imply the presence of a fin. For example, in the William&#x02019;s tonguefish (<italic>Symphurus williamsi</italic>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Aceves-Medina et al. 1999</xref>), the larval pectoral fin does not persist in development and thus adults lack the pectoral fin.</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Ontology-based inference of presence and absence.

When a taxon is shown to have both presence and absence for one of the paired fins, it indicates a polymorphic condition, an apparent polymorphism, or a conflict in the data. Actual polymorphisms are those described at the species level and reference the same source publication. Apparent polymorphisms are described at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., genus, family) and the specific taxa that show presence and/or absence were not described by the author. Because apparent polymorphisms are not traceable to particular species and do not factor into ancestral state reconstruction, they were replaced with &#x0201c;?&#x0201d; in the matrix.

These were distinguished by applying an algorithm that used the associated metadata within the synthetic morphological supermatrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S1 available on Dryad) to identify whether a character state comes from an author assertion, or inference.

Cells for taxa with character states based on a direct author assertion were coded as &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; for asserted presence or &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; for asserted absence. These cells were considered to be asserted even if the same character state resulted from inference. Only cells that did not contain an author-supported assertion were counted as inferred and represented as a &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; in the matrix.

These data, if used as ancestral states, could potentially enable a more accurate assessment of position and frequency of character state change. Data at higher-level internal nodes, however, are not utilized by current tools for ancestral state reconstruction without manual editing, which is not feasible for large-scale data. For example, the R package PhyTools (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Revell 2012</xref>) has not implemented the ability to do reconstruction using data at internal nodes (Liam Revell, personal communication, June 6, 2015), but it has developed a workaround method, which could not be applied at this scale. Thus, an algorithm was developed and applied to propagate data at the genus and family levels to the species contained within these higher level groups, based on the VTO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Taxonomic levels above family were not considered for propagation. Existing species-level data (asserted or inferred) were never replaced by the propagated species-level data. Species in the VTO previously lacking data were thus automatically added to the data matrix with the propagated data. During the propagation process, all higher-level taxa were removed from the matrix, and the propagated matrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S3 available on Dryad) contained data only at the species level.</p></sec><sec id="SEC1.4.5"><title>Reconciliation of taxon names.</title><p>The synthetic morphological supermatrix from OntoTrace (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S1 available on Dryad) contained taxon names from the (VTO; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Midford et al. 2013</xref>).

This model was used instead of likelihood methods, as the tree lacked branch lengths and because polymorphic species are not currently supported by categorical data likelihood calculations in Mesquite. Although branch lengths could potentially be estimated for more informative distance-based optimization methods, but with such a large highly unresolved phylogeny, it would not likely provide additional information. However, ancestral reconstruction with a standard parsimony method provided insight into where major transitions of interest occur along the branches. Mesquite was used to summarize state changes over trees to determine the minimum and maximum number of gains and losses across all Most Parsimonious Reconstruction (MPR) mappings. To determine the minimum number of regains of a trait following loss, polytomies were randomly resolved and branch lengths were computed using the R package APE (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Paradis et al. 2004</xref>) and summarized using Mesquite.

</p><p>Because ancestral reconstruction across all teleost fishes suggested that the pectoral fin has been regained a minimum of three times in Anguilliformes, we investigated this in more detail. A comparison in the reconstruction was done using various topologies with the following parameters: unordered parsimony, computing branch lengths and performing Mk1 likelihood, randomly resolving polytomies, and assuming missing data as presence. This showed that random resolution of 1000 polytomies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> File S4 available on Dryad) in Anguilliformes minimized the number of regains to two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>; Supplementary Table S6 available on Dryad).</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Visualization of pectoral fin presence (black) and absence (red) across the 1073 species of eels (Anguilliformes).

Many excellent examples have demonstrated the value of this approach, primarily by acquiring the trait data through direct observation of a limited number of species and mapping it to a companion phylogeny that is often generated using molecular data. The availability of trait data, however, is limited by the time required for traditional data acquisition, whereas large phylogenies are increasingly available because of the ease of collection and analysis of molecular data. Concatenation of trait data across different characters and taxa that are reported in dispersed studies have been manual, and thus rarely accomplished on a large scale. As a result, trait data are sparse, even for relatively simple traits, such as presence/absence of a structure.</p><p>It was recently shown that morphological data can be readily integrated across matrices by annotating it with ontologies and thus making it computable (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Ram&#x000ed;rez et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Dahdul et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Walls et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Deans et al. 2015</xref>). A substantial level of missing data, however, is the inevitable result of combining separately published morphological data matrices each containing different sets of characters and taxa. Ontology annotations, however, enable the extension of sparse morphological data to additional species through inference (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Uniquely in this study, we used phylogenetic propagation, that is, transferring data from families and genera to included species, to further extend the data. In doing so we increased the number of species with data and dramatically reduced missing data to 34.8% in the final output matrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S4 available on Dryad; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). The use of propagation was motivated by the goal to preserve the data associated with higher-level taxa, which were included as taxonomic units in over a quarter of the phylogenetic studies mined in the assembly of the supermatrix. There were several considerations in this process. First, we propagated the data from genera and families, but not higher-level ranks, given the increasing expectation of evolutionary changes in character state with increasing divergence time. Second, we eliminated all annotations of polymorphisms (&#x0201c;0&#x00026;1&#x0201d;) to higher-level taxa so that they were not propagated. Authors use these annotations, which we termed &#x0201c;apparent polymorphisms,&#x0201d; as a shorthand to indicate that both the presence and absence of a trait are found in the species contained in the higher-level clade. In these cases the identity of the specific species that possess or lack a particular structure is not provided. Propagating both states to descendant species would be uninformative and misleading, and hence we removed these annotations. Third, we never propagated data from higher-level nodes to species that had existing data. That is, if a species had either asserted or inferred data, it was never &#x0201c;overwritten&#x0201d; by data propagated from the higher-level node. However, we found that the risk of propagating erroneous data to species is in fact relatively low, at least for fin presence/absence: only 12 of the 11,293 species would have had erroneous data propagated to them. Fourth, we used care at the time of annotation to match the author&#x02019;s intended higher-level taxon with the corresponding member species in the taxonomy used in constructing the supermatrix. However, we recognize the risk of propagating the data to species unintended by the original author because of changes in taxonomic inclusion (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Franz et al. 2015</xref>). For example, Callichthyidae, according to <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson (2006)</xref>, possess pectoral fins and consist of about 8 genera and 177 species. However, Callichthyidae in the VTO (derived from CoF; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Midford et al. 2013</xref>), consist of 9 genera and 211 species. Because &#x0201c;pectoral fin present&#x0201d; was annotated to &#x0201c;Callichthyidae&#x0201d; as per the VTO, this trait was linked to each of these 211 species following propagation. These data are now applied to species not considered by the original author, thus clearly incurring a risk that they may be incorrect.</p><p>After propagation, nearly twice as many species had data for the pectoral fin versus the pelvic fin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>), though before propagation, the number is similar between fins. This is because the number of families and genera from which data are propagated is higher for the pectoral fin (151 families, 97 genera) versus pelvic fin (90 families, 71 genera). In addition, most of the families in the VTO to which pectoral fin data are annotated are more speciose (e.g., Loricariidae, 899 species; Callichthyidae, 211 species) than those for which there are pelvic fin data (e.g., Congridae: 214 species; Synodontidae: 71 species).</p><p>The question of confidence arises with respect to data that are generated through inference. Clearly a high level of certainty can be associated with direct author statements concerning morphological features at the species level, particularly if they are associated with voucher specimens. For example, the asserted absence of the pelvic fin and girdle in the knifefish (<italic>Apteronotus apurensis</italic>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Albert 2001</xref>) comes from the author&#x02019;s observations on voucher specimens that are housed in various collections, for example, the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH). The specimen lot numbers provide access to the specific individuals on which the observations were made (e.g., FMNH 85499, FMNH 100738). A similar level of confidence can be associated with the inferred presence or absence of morphological features, particularly if inferred from an observation on vouchered material. For instance, the presence of a pelvic fin in the armored catfish (<italic>Acanthicus hystrix</italic>) was inferred based on the observation by <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Armbruster (2004)</xref> on vouchered specimens that &#x0201c;two rows of the first pelvic-fin ray are fused&#x0201d; in this species. Even though the author did not directly state that the pelvic fin is present, the logic leading to an inference of presence is based on their reproducible observation.</p><p>Though large-scale molecular phylogenies are increasingly obtainable, they are rarely available at the scale required by this study (33,000<inline-formula><tex-math id="M13">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The Open Tree supertree pipeline yielded a phylogeny that to our knowledge is the most comprehensive synthetic tree ever assembled for teleosts, harvesting 200 source phylogenies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> File S2 available on Dryad). In contrast, a recent large supertree assembled for a study on basal vertebrates relied on 118 source trees (38 for teleosts) and had only 2730 tips across extinct and extant fishes (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Larouche et al. 2017</xref>). The Open Tree approach affords access to all source trees, node-based provenance, and brings in species that may not have been included in source trees through a reference taxonomy. The latter point was critical in this work, because many of the species with trait data had not previously been studied phylogenetically, thus not available in source trees.</p><sec id="SEC3.1"><title>Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Directions in Integrating Traits and Trees</title><p>Two developments made the opportunity ripe for this study: huge phylogenies with provenance, and computable traits with tools for aggregation into a supermatrix. Taxonomic reconciliation, that is, matching taxa from different sources, was the primary challenge involved in merging the trait data from the KB with the phylogenies provided by Open Tree. Neither Phenoscape nor Open Tree is attempting to develop a taxonomic standard; both are harvesting a subset of the available resources. One source of differences in the case of teleost fishes is the lack of incorporation of the expert fish reference taxonomy (CoF) into the Open Tree taxonomy. The impact of the different taxonomic composition of these sources was marked: valid species with data were lost, and species with no data, mainly all of which do not have valid names, were added. Over 8000 species in the teleost Open Tree are not recognized in the Catalog of Fishes (Supplementary Table S2 available on Dryad) and thus lacked data on the phylogeny. These tips contribute substantial uncertainty and noise to the optimization results. Future unification of disparate sources by the broader taxonomic community will reduce some reconciliation issues.</p><p>Taxonomic reconciliation across multiple data sources is an active research area, and current methods frequently use the taxon name as the integrative unit (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Patterson 2003</xref>). This introduces several challenges, such as resolving synonyms, abbreviations, misspellings, and handling improper naming syntax (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Cranston et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al. 2016</xref>). Moreover, homonyms can exist when a single taxonomic name belongs to multiple tips within the same taxonomy (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Cranston 2017</xref>). Available solutions include using online servers that perform name resolution, such as Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS), which act as scientific name repositories that aggregate data from different sources (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Boyle et al. 2013</xref>), and the use of software like the toolkit distributed by Global Names Architecture (GNA; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al. 2016</xref>). The Open Tree integrates multiple source taxonomies to build the Open Tree taxonomy, and names are matched from individual taxonomic sources to identify the correct taxonomic name (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Redelings and Holder 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Rees and Cranston 2017</xref>). However, these solutions do not support the VTO, which thus required us to develop another method for efficient reconciliation. Taxonomy ID can be used as an alternative for taxon name (<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Thomson and Shaffer 2010</xref>). However, depending solely on NCBI taxonomy IDs for reconciliation was inefficient because a large number of VTO taxa (9522) in the propagated matrix did not have any reference to NCBI taxonomy IDs. Therefore, two reconciliation methods&#x02014;based on taxon name and NCBI taxonomy IDs&#x02014;were integrated in this work. Taxonomic reconciliation at large scale, however, remains a major challenge.</p><p>A second major technical challenge in this work was the lack of tools that support visualization and manipulation of trees at this large scale. Branch navigation on large-scale phylogenies is cumbersome, and manual efforts to investigate state changes along branches are difficult. The next generation of tools must facilitate navigation to specific nodes and support more complex analyses (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Gruenstaeudl 2016</xref>).</p><p>A third challenge involves the lack of branch lengths in the synthetic tree, which limits the analysis of character evolution. Clearly the transitions between finned and finless states are not symmetric. If branch lengths could be considered, it would allow more robust distance-based analyses to be performed, which can account for models of asymmetric change. A putatively high cost transition (e.g., regain of fins after loss), for example, would be more likely on a long branch than a short one. This would enable an understanding of the parameters under which fin regain is likely and where additional phylogenetic analysis might valuable in clarifying highly unlikely transitions. As recently observed (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Pyron 2017</xref>), little attention has been paid to the dynamics of evolutionary transitions in discrete morphological characters; the addition of branch lengths to synthetic trees would enable the use of additional models.</p><p>Additional challenges included the substantial level of curation required to develop and maintain resources for phylogenetic trees and ontology-based trait data. Manual curation of trait data is manual and time-consuming (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dahdul et al. 2015</xref>), as is the curation of phylogenies for Open Tree. The addition of new natural language processing (NLP) machine-learning curation methods is critical. The approach here clearly demonstrates the value of integrating these data, and it highlights the need for automated tools.</p><p>Finally, the methods and pipeline demonstrated here to integrate a large-scale morphological supermatrix from the Phenoscape KB with a Teleostei species-level tree from the Open Tree of Life are currently limited in generalizability. Currently the pipeline functions for a matrix that includes only the pectoral and pelvic fins, though the methods and algorithms in the code can be adapted for other characters. A future goal of this work is to develop a more generic pipeline to integrate any large-scale morphological data set coming from the Phenoscape KB with any large-scale phylogeny.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3.2"><title>Data Conflicts Motivate Future Studies</title><p>One of the benefits of machine reasoning, as previously pointed out (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. 2015</xref>), is that conflicts in the data are automatically isolated. That is, cells where both presence and absence are indicated for a particular trait in a single taxon are made obvious and data provenance is available to further investigate the conflict. Conflicts may result from differing assertions among authors, which may in turn be due to observations of different specimens or different interpretations of the same material. There may also be conflicts between asserted and inferred data, and these were the most common type reported by <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dececchi et al. (2015)</xref>. In the supermatrix generated here, only 0.04% of the species-level data (6 of 16,408 populated cells) were conflicted, excluding actual polymorphisms. All six conflicts were between asserted and inferred data. For example, the presence of the pelvic fin in the airbreathing catfish <italic>Gymnallabes typus</italic> was inferred from a character describing the thickness of its first pelvic fin ray (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">De Pinna 1993</xref>). However, a different author asserted that the pelvic fin was absent for this species (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 2006</xref>). In another example, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Poulsen (2015)</xref> observed &#x0201c;transparent pectoral fin lobes&#x0201d; in the bobtail snipe eel (<italic>Neocyema erythrosoma</italic>), but noted the apparent absence of the pectoral skeleton. The annotation &#x0201c;pectoral girdle skeleton, absent,&#x0201d; however, from which the absence of a pectoral fin is inferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), results in a conflict with the same author&#x02019;s assertion of pectoral fin presence. The inference reflects the anatomical knowledge formalized in the ontology, that the presence of a pectoral fin is dependent on the presence of a pectoral girdle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In fact, the presence of the fin without the underlying girdle has not been reported in any other species. This conflict, like all of the conflicts surfaced through such automated syntheses, leads back to an examination of the evidence. Here we discovered that only five specimens of this rare species have ever been collected (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">DeVaney et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Poulsen 2015</xref>), and absence of the pectoral skeleton was described as &#x0201c;apparent&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Poulsen 2015</xref>); this raises the possibility that the pectoral girdle may in fact be present. On the other hand, <italic>Neocyema</italic> is a member of a group of deep-sea fishes (Saccopharyngiformes) with many reduced skeletal features, and perhaps the loss of the pectoral girdle is another instance of reduction. This particular conflict, like the others, identifies species and features for further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3.3"><title>How Often Were the Paired Fins Lost (and Regained)?</title><p>The questions of how often, and in which taxa, paired fins were lost have been the subject of many studies in ichthyology, and our work not only demonstrates how these can be answered automatically and at scale, but it also provides species-level data from disparate sources in a phylogenetic framework to provide insight into fin evolution at the macroevolutionary scale. Previous investigators have concluded that pelvic fins appear to be more readily lost or reduced across teleosts than other fins (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Larouche et al. 2017</xref>) and possibly with greater frequency than other structures, including for example, scales (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>) and the gas bladder (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">McCune and Carlson 2004</xref>). The expectation that pectoral fin loss is much rarer than pelvic fin loss (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2010</xref>) was born out by our analysis, which indicates more than double the minimum number of independent losses of the pelvic fin (48) compared to the pectoral fin (19) for the phylogeny under consideration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><p>The apparent ease of pelvic fin loss has been examined from a genetic standpoint in several species, including the well-known example of the three-spined stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al. 2010</xref>), the Japanese pufferfish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>; <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Tanaka et al. 2005</xref>), and the tiger tail seahorse (<italic>Hippocampus comes</italic>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. 2005</xref>). These studies showed different genes or enhancers responsible for pelvic fin loss, indicating that similar phenotypes can evolve by different mechanisms. Studies focused on potential genetic differences that may underlie the difference in frequency of pectoral versus pelvic fin loss, however, have not yet been done.</p><p>With respect to pectoral and pelvic fin evolution, there are contradictory expectations as to whether reversal following loss has (<xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Yamanoue et al. 2010</xref>) or has not (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Nelson 1990</xref>) occurred. There is a large literature on the irreversibility of evolution and Dollo&#x02019;s law (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Gould 1970</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Farris 1977</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Wagner 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kohlsdorf and Wagner 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Klimov and OConnor 2013</xref>), yet also examples of putative reversals, for example, digit regain within multiple lineages of squamates (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Kohlsdorf and Wagner 2006</xref>). Genetic studies suggest that the persistence of developmental pathways may provide a route for reversal (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Collin and Miglietta 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses indicate that a substantial number of reversals have occurred in the evolution of the paired fins (minimum of 2 for pectoral fins; 14 for pelvic fins), though interpretation is compromised by the species-level polytomies throughout the teleost tree and the lack of branch lengths, which limit the optimization methods that can be used. To determine whether polytomies could be resolved such that reversal was not required, we focused on one monophyletic clade, the eels (Anguilliformes), in which most of the losses and all of the putative regains of the pectoral fin occurred. This was a clade, in fact, where we manually curated recent phylogenies (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Santini et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Fielitz 2013</xref>) into Open Tree, and the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>) is up-to-date and resolved with respect to the most recently published studies for Anguilliformes. Our analysis showed that among 1000 different randomly resolved topologies, the pectoral fins re-evolved following loss a minimum of two times: once within <italic>Hoplunnis</italic> (duckbill eels with nine species; Family: Nettastomatidae) and again in <italic>Macrocephenchelys</italic> (conger eels with two species; Family: Congridae; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). This points to species where regain is a very strongly supported hypothesis that could be examined further using genetic tools, for example. Additionally, it points to areas in the tree for strategic resolution, that is, regions of the tree where evolutionary questions, such as understanding the phylogenetic pattern and frequency of reversals and their biological basis, could be answered through further phylogenetic analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="SEC4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The opportunity to understand the broad patterns of evolution of organismal features, foundational knowledge for many types of studies, is at hand with the tools in place to reuse and synthesize the data. The time-consuming nature of curating phylogenies and trait data into the formats and databases appropriate for their automatic aggregation into larger-scale synthetic products is an immediate challenge, though cultural shifts with respect to data in the life science community and advances in machine learning are progressing. As our case study shows, rendering traits computable enables the extension of relatively sparse data to taxa for which the presence or absence of a trait had not been directly asserted. Further, by propagating author assertions about features for high-level taxa to species for which asserted or inferred data are missing, we show that trait data can be further and significantly extended. An additional benefit from these automated approaches lies in readily discoverable errors in data or knowledge by uncovering conflicts in the data. Such potential errors are not easily found through manual means.</p><p>Given the increasingly broad scope of comparative questions across biology, a sizable and growing legacy literature, and the difficulty and expense of new data collection, automated means of existing data reuse and extension by way of inference and data propagation are critically important. Equally important is ensuring that the users of these products have access to the provenance of the data, including the traits for each taxon and the phylogenetic resolution and the means by which they were generated. This case study also revealed several important technical challenges to such integration. Current difficulties in aligning taxonomic sources impede ready integration, and new tools are needed to analyze and visualize the data on large trees.</p><p>Finally, from the standpoint of understanding the relative frequencies of pectoral and pelvic fin loss and regain, this study provides evidence that the pelvic fin is independently lost in more than twice the number of lineages as the pectoral fin, and that these fins were regained several to many times in the course of teleost evolution. The general method outlined here, of an automated mapping and extension of traits mined from dozens of studies, to trees assembled from over a hundred more, offers rapid assessments of trait distribution. These in turn set the stage for in-depth analyses of the potential underlying evolutionary mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank F. Santini and K.
