</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data synthesis required for large-scale macroevolutionary studies is challenging with the current tools available for integration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a classic question regarding the frequency of paired fin loss in teleost fishes as a case study, we sought to create automated methods to facilitate the integration of broad-scale trait data with a sizable species-level phylogeny. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar to the evolutionary pattern previously described for limbs, pelvic and pectoral fin reduction and loss are thought to have occurred independently multiple times in the evolution of fishes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify the presence and absence of pectoral and pelvic fins of 12,582 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To do this, we integrated a synthetic morphological supermatrix of phenotypic data for the pectoral and pelvic fins for teleost fishes from the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (two presence/absence characters for 3047 taxa) with a species-level tree for teleost fishes from the Open Tree of Life project (38,419 species). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The integration method detailed herein harnessed a new combined approach by utilizing data based on ontological inference, as well as phylogenetic propagation, to reduce overall data loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using inference enabled by ontology-based annotations, missing data were reduced from 98.0% to 85.9%, and further reduced to 34.8% by phylogenetic data propagation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These methods allowed us to extend the data to an additional 11,293 species for a total of 12,582 species with trait data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pectoral fin appears to have been independently lost in a minimum of 19 lineages and the pelvic fin in 48. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Though interpretation is limited by lack of phylogenetic resolution at the species level, it appears that following loss, both pectoral and pelvic fins were regained several (3) to many (14) times respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Focused investigation into putative regains of the pectoral fin, all within one clade (Anguilliformes), showed that the pectoral fin was regained at least twice following loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study points to specific teleost clades where strategic phylogenetic resolution and genetic investigation will be necessary to understand the pattern and frequency of pectoral fin reversals. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="?"><plain>Are they ever regained? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The information required to answer these straightforward questions regarding character evolution, namely trait data and a relatively resolved species-level phylogeny, has not been readily available at the scale of tens of thousands of species until recently (Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>2015; Hinchliff et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Investigators interested in addressing such macroevolutionary questions have been confronted with challenges when attempting to combine trait data with phylogenies at magnitudes not readily supported by current tools (Harris and Arbuckle 2016; Hunt and Slater 2016). Alfaro et al. (2009) suggest that some of these challenges involve producing and manipulating large-scale phylogenies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition, the development of larger phylogenies has further exposed the lack of resources necessary to visualize and interpret results (Harmon et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Not only are tools for mapping large trait data sets on phylogenies lacking, but phylogenetic programs also lack the scalability necessary to approach macroevolutionary questions (Harmon etal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>2013; Harris and Arbuckle 2016; Hunt and Slater 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Although methods to investigate trait evolution at larger scales are improving (e.g., iTOL: Letunic and Bork 2007; Harmon et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>2013), many still lack the ability to integrate data sets across multiple data formats and analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The peculiar absence of paired fins in fishes such as eels (Nelson 2006) has fascinated scientists since at least the time of Aristotle (Ogle 1882; Leunissen 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Notably, over the past 40 years, ichthyologist Nelson (1976, 1984, 1994, 2006) documented the absence of pelvic fins in members of 92 teleost families (Nelson 1990), which represent nearly one-quarter of all fish families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>This led him to conclude that pelvic fins have been independently lost at least 50 times (Nelson 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>His analysis, as well as subsequent ones (Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>2010); however, did not consider phylogenetic relationships, in which absence or presence at an ancestral node determines the number of putative losses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Further, Nelson (2006) summarized data at the family level, for example, for Ophichthidae: “pectoral fins present or absent,” often without naming the species associated with a particular condition or citing the primary literature in this regard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In contrast to data on pelvic fins, the frequency of pectoral fin loss is poorly documented, with few exceptions (Britz 2010; Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>2010; Brown et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Further, whether pectoral or pelvic fins may have been regained following loss remains uncertain (Nelson 1990; Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Though there are known exceptions to Dollo’s law, that is, that the loss of a complex trait is evolutionarily irreversible (Gould 1970; Farris 1977), questions concerning the taxonomic scope, frequency of reversal, and potential genetic bases (Collin and Miglietta 2008) remain unanswered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Addressing any broad-scale question concerning the evolution of traits requires a comprehensive source of data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Such large data sets must be readily extractable and computable, as manual aggregation from a dispersed literature is essentially intractable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Free text phenotypic descriptions from the literature that are tagged with appropriate ontology terms [via Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)] provide semantic information that allows for automated collection and computation of morphological data across species (Deans et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>2015; Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>For paired fin data, we used the Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB; kb.phenoscape.org) as the source for computable phenotypes across vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>The KB contains ontology-annotated phenotypic data based primarily on published character matrices (Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>2015), but also some monographic treatments (e.g., Nelson 2006; Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>It is particularly enriched in vertebrate skeletal features, such as fins, limbs, and their support structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The ontology-based data uniquely allow inference of the presence or absence of a phenotypic feature based on indirect descriptions of the feature or its parts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>For example, such inference has been shown to greatly enlarge the available data (Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>2015), a desirable feature here given the paucity of direct statements by authors concerning the presence/absence of paired fins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Thus, rather than combing through publications relevant to 33,000\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} }{}$+$\end{document} teleost species and manually compiling a matrix encompassing the full scope of data relevant to our question, ontology-annotated data, including both author-asserted and machine reasoned data populating the KB, can be automatically exported into a data set for analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Obtaining a fully resolved phylogenetic tree, in this case for all extant and extinct teleost species, is a major challenge for any large-scale analysis of trait evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>For teleost fishes, the recent literature includes some well-resolved and broad-scale trees based on molecular data (Near et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>2012; Betancur et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>2013), though there are several impediments to their use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>First, they involve only a subset of teleost species; for example, Betancur et al. (2013) sampled 1410 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Second, when the terminal taxa are at a supra-specific level, for example, families, orders, and superorders as in the Near et al. (2012) tree, it is difficult to know which species were included in these groupings at the time of analysis (though actual species sampled were provided in the case of Near et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Further, even if authors report the species included in an analysis (as in Near et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>2012), the effort to add these manually to a large tree is untenable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Third, assembling published trees that likely differ in topology becomes increasingly difficult to accomplish manually at large scales, and requires automated methods of tree synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Thus we accessed the Open Tree of Life project (Open Tree; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opentreeoflife.org">http://opentreeoflife.org</ext-link>) for a comprehensive tree for teleosts at the species level (Hinchliff et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>The Open Tree dynamically constructs a tree by synthesizing published phylogenies along with taxonomic data using the “propinquity” supertree pipeline (Redelings and Holder 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The output includes detailed provenance reports (e.g., node support, conflicts, and resolutions) associated with nodes resolved by a source other than the reference taxonomy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>While comprehensively synthesizing all available paired fin trait data for teleosts was the first step in investigating patterns in fin evolution, we also applied new methods to extend existing data, while minimizing overall data loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>This was achieved by several means. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>First, we used inferred trait data (Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>2016) to fully utilize existing information on paired fins in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>For example, if an author reports that part of a fin is present in a particular taxon, then the fin itself is inferred to be present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Second, we propagated data that investigators associated with families and genera in their matrices and descriptions to the species level, thus extending the data as intended by the authors and generating a more comprehensive matrix for ancestral state reconstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Finally, we improved the method of taxonomic reconciliation between taxa to which trait data are attached and taxa included in the phylogeny. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>This was necessary because different sources of names are used in taxonomies referenced by the Phenoscape KB and the Open Tree of Life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The total expansion of phenotypic data through ontology-based inference and taxonomically-based propagation was substantial and is a valuable model to be followed for macroevolutionary studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>Using questions concerning the frequency of paired fin loss in fishes as an example, we demonstrate the use of new knowledge resources to address basic questions involving large-scale phenotypic evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Increasing the taxonomic scope makes apparent the value of these new resources, as well as deficiencies in existing methods to integrate the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>The bioinformatics pipeline developed in the process of this work reflects a set of essential requirements for large-scale macroevolutionary syntheses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>To compile large-scale morphological data on pectoral and pelvic fin presence/absence across all teleost fishes we needed a publically available source containing computable phenotypic data that allowed extraction of a single matrix across a specified taxon. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="303" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="304" pm="."><plain>Uniquely in this study, we used phylogenetic propagation, that is, transferring data from families and genera to included species, to further extend the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="305" pm="."><plain>In doing so we increased the number of species with data and dramatically reduced missing data to 34.8% in the final output matrix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> Matrix S4 available on Dryad; Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="306" pm="."><plain>The use of propagation was motivated by the goal to preserve the data associated with higher-level taxa, which were included as taxonomic units in over a quarter of the phylogenetic studies mined in the assembly of the supermatrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>There were several considerations in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>First, we propagated the data from genera and families, but not higher-level ranks, given the increasing expectation of evolutionary changes in character state with increasing divergence time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Second, we eliminated all annotations of polymorphisms (“0&amp;1”) to higher-level taxa so that they were not propagated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Authors use these annotations, which we termed “apparent polymorphisms,” as a shorthand to indicate that both the presence and absence of a trait are found in the species contained in the higher-level clade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>In these cases the identity of the specific species that possess or lack a particular structure is not provided. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>Propagating both states to descendant species would be uninformative and misleading, and hence we removed these annotations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Third, we never propagated data from higher-level nodes to species that had existing data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>That is, if a species had either asserted or inferred data, it was never “overwritten” by data propagated from the higher-level node. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>However, we found that the risk of propagating erroneous data to species is in fact relatively low, at least for fin presence/absence: only 12 of the 11,293 species would have had erroneous data propagated to them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Fourth, we used care at the time of annotation to match the author’s intended higher-level taxon with the corresponding member species in the taxonomy used in constructing the supermatrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>However, we recognize the risk of propagating the data to species unintended by the original author because of changes in taxonomic inclusion (Franz et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>For example, Callichthyidae, according to Nelson (2006), possess pectoral fins and consist of about 8 genera and 177 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>However, Callichthyidae in the VTO (derived from CoF; Midford et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>2013), consist of 9 genera and 211 species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Because “pectoral fin present” was annotated to “Callichthyidae” as per the VTO, this trait was linked to each of these 211 species following propagation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>These data are now applied to species not considered by the original author, thus clearly incurring a risk that they may be incorrect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>After propagation, nearly twice as many species had data for the pectoral fin versus the pelvic fin (Fig. 4), though before propagation, the number is similar between fins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>This is because the number of families and genera from which data are propagated is higher for the pectoral fin (151 families, 97 genera) versus pelvic fin (90 families, 71 genera). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>In addition, most of the families in the VTO to which pectoral fin data are annotated are more speciose (e.g., Loricariidae, 899 species; Callichthyidae, 211 species) than those for which there are pelvic fin data (e.g., Congridae: 214 species; Synodontidae: 71 species). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>The Open Tree supertree pipeline yielded a phylogeny that to our knowledge is the most comprehensive synthetic tree ever assembled for teleosts, harvesting 200 source phylogenies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syx098#supplementary-data">Supplementary Material</ext-link> File S2 available on Dryad). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a recent large supertree assembled for a study on basal vertebrates relied on 118 source trees (38 for teleosts) and had only 2730 tips across extinct and extant fishes (Larouche et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The Open Tree approach affords access to all source trees, node-based provenance, and brings in species that may not have been included in source trees through a reference taxonomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>The latter point was critical in this work, because many of the species with trait data had not previously been studied phylogenetically, thus not available in source trees. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Two developments made the opportunity ripe for this study: huge phylogenies with provenance, and computable traits with tools for aggregation into a supermatrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Taxonomic reconciliation, that is, matching taxa from different sources, was the primary challenge involved in merging the trait data from the KB with the phylogenies provided by Open Tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Neither Phenoscape nor Open Tree is attempting to develop a taxonomic standard; both are harvesting a subset of the available resources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>One source of differences in the case of teleost fishes is the lack of incorporation of the expert fish reference taxonomy (CoF) into the Open Tree taxonomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>The impact of the different taxonomic composition of these sources was marked: valid species with data were lost, and species with no data, mainly all of which do not have valid names, were added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Over 8000 species in the teleost Open Tree are not recognized in the Catalog of Fishes (Supplementary Table S2 available on Dryad) and thus lacked data on the phylogeny. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>These tips contribute substantial uncertainty and noise to the optimization results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>Future unification of disparate sources by the broader taxonomic community will reduce some reconciliation issues. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Taxonomic reconciliation across multiple data sources is an active research area, and current methods frequently use the taxon name as the integrative unit (Patterson 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>This introduces several challenges, such as resolving synonyms, abbreviations, misspellings, and handling improper naming syntax (Cranston et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>2014; Patterson et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Moreover, homonyms can exist when a single taxonomic name belongs to multiple tips within the same taxonomy (Rees and Cranston 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Available solutions include using online servers that perform name resolution, such as Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS), which act as scientific name repositories that aggregate data from different sources (Boyle et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>2013), and the use of software like the toolkit distributed by Global Names Architecture (GNA; Patterson et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>The Open Tree integrates multiple source taxonomies to build the Open Tree taxonomy, and names are matched from individual taxonomic sources to identify the correct taxonomic name (Redelings and Holder 2017; Rees and Cranston 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>However, these solutions do not support the VTO, which thus required us to develop another method for efficient reconciliation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>Taxonomy ID can be used as an alternative for taxon name (Thomson and Shaffer 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>However, depending solely on NCBI taxonomy IDs for reconciliation was inefficient because a large number of VTO taxa (9522) in the propagated matrix did not have any reference to NCBI taxonomy IDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Therefore, two reconciliation methods—based on taxon name and NCBI taxonomy IDs—were integrated in this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>Taxonomic reconciliation at large scale, however, remains a major challenge. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>A second major technical challenge in this work was the lack of tools that support visualization and manipulation of trees at this large scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Branch navigation on large-scale phylogenies is cumbersome, and manual efforts to investigate state changes along branches are difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>The next generation of tools must facilitate navigation to specific nodes and support more complex analyses (Gruenstaeudl 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>A third challenge involves the lack of branch lengths in the synthetic tree, which limits the analysis of character evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Clearly the transitions between finned and finless states are not symmetric. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>If branch lengths could be considered, it would allow more robust distance-based analyses to be performed, which can account for models of asymmetric change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>A putatively high cost transition (e.g., regain of fins after loss), for example, would be more likely on a long branch than a short one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>This would enable an understanding of the parameters under which fin regain is likely and where additional phylogenetic analysis might valuable in clarifying highly unlikely transitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>As recently observed (Pyron 2017), little attention has been paid to the dynamics of evolutionary transitions in discrete morphological characters; the addition of branch lengths to synthetic trees would enable the use of additional models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Additional challenges included the substantial level of curation required to develop and maintain resources for phylogenetic trees and ontology-based trait data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Manual curation of trait data is manual and time-consuming (Dahdul et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>2015), as is the curation of phylogenies for Open Tree. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>The addition of new natural language processing (NLP) machine-learning curation methods is critical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>The approach here clearly demonstrates the value of integrating these data, and it highlights the need for automated tools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Finally, the methods and pipeline demonstrated here to integrate a large-scale morphological supermatrix from the Phenoscape KB with a Teleostei species-level tree from the Open Tree of Life are currently limited in generalizability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Currently the pipeline functions for a matrix that includes only the pectoral and pelvic fins, though the methods and algorithms in the code can be adapted for other characters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>A future goal of this work is to develop a more generic pipeline to integrate any large-scale morphological data set coming from the Phenoscape KB with any large-scale phylogeny. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>One of the benefits of machine reasoning, as previously pointed out (Dececchi et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>2015), is that conflicts in the data are automatically isolated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>That is, cells where both presence and absence are indicated for a particular trait in a single taxon are made obvious and data provenance is available to further investigate the conflict. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Conflicts may result from differing assertions among authors, which may in turn be due to observations of different specimens or different interpretations of the same material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>There may also be conflicts between asserted and inferred data, and these were the most common type reported by Dececchi et al. (2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>In the supermatrix generated here, only 0.04% of the species-level data (6 of 16,408 populated cells) were conflicted, excluding actual polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>All six conflicts were between asserted and inferred data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>For example, the presence of the pelvic fin in the airbreathing catfish Gymnallabes typus was inferred from a character describing the thickness of its first pelvic fin ray (De Pinna 1993). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>However, a different author asserted that the pelvic fin was absent for this species (Nelson 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>In another example, Poulsen (2015) observed “transparent pectoral fin lobes” in the bobtail snipe eel (Neocyema erythrosoma), but noted the apparent absence of the pectoral skeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>The annotation “pectoral girdle skeleton, absent,” however, from which the absence of a pectoral fin is inferred (Fig. 2), results in a conflict with the same author’s assertion of pectoral fin presence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>The inference reflects the anatomical knowledge formalized in the ontology, that the presence of a pectoral fin is dependent on the presence of a pectoral girdle (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>In fact, the presence of the fin without the underlying girdle has not been reported in any other species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>This conflict, like all of the conflicts surfaced through such automated syntheses, leads back to an examination of the evidence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>Here we discovered that only five specimens of this rare species have ever been collected (DeVaney et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>2009; Poulsen 2015), and absence of the pectoral skeleton was described as “apparent” (Poulsen 2015); this raises the possibility that the pectoral girdle may in fact be present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Neocyema is a member of a group of deep-sea fishes (Saccopharyngiformes) with many reduced skeletal features, and perhaps the loss of the pectoral girdle is another instance of reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>This particular conflict, like the others, identifies species and features for further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="SEC3.3"><title><text><SENT sid="400" pm="?"><plain>How Often Were the Paired Fins Lost (and Regained)? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The questions of how often, and in which taxa, paired fins were lost have been the subject of many studies in ichthyology, and our work not only demonstrates how these can be answered automatically and at scale, but it also provides species-level data from disparate sources in a phylogenetic framework to provide insight into fin evolution at the macroevolutionary scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Previous investigators have concluded that pelvic fins appear to be more readily lost or reduced across teleosts than other fins (Nelson 1990; Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>2008; Larouche et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>2017) and possibly with greater frequency than other structures, including for example, scales (Nelson 1990) and the gas bladder (McCune and Carlson 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>The expectation that pectoral fin loss is much rarer than pelvic fin loss (Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>2010) was born out by our analysis, which indicates more than double the minimum number of independent losses of the pelvic fin (48) compared to the pectoral fin (19) for the phylogeny under consideration (Tables 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>The apparent ease of pelvic fin loss has been examined from a genetic standpoint in several species, including the well-known example of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; Chan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>2010), the Japanese pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes; Tanaka et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>2005), and the tiger tail seahorse (Hippocampus comes; Lin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>These studies showed different genes or enhancers responsible for pelvic fin loss, indicating that similar phenotypes can evolve by different mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>Studies focused on potential genetic differences that may underlie the difference in frequency of pectoral versus pelvic fin loss, however, have not yet been done. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>With respect to pectoral and pelvic fin evolution, there are contradictory expectations as to whether reversal following loss has (Yamanoue et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>2010) or has not (Nelson 1990) occurred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>There is a large literature on the irreversibility of evolution and Dollo’s law (Gould 1970; Farris 1977; Wagner 1982; Kohlsdorf and Wagner 2006; Klimov and OConnor 2013), yet also examples of putative reversals, for example, digit regain within multiple lineages of squamates (Kohlsdorf and Wagner 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Genetic studies suggest that the persistence of developmental pathways may provide a route for reversal (Collin and Miglietta 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>Our analyses indicate that a substantial number of reversals have occurred in the evolution of the paired fins (minimum of 2 for pectoral fins; 14 for pelvic fins), though interpretation is compromised by the species-level polytomies throughout the teleost tree and the lack of branch lengths, which limit the optimization methods that can be used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>To determine whether polytomies could be resolved such that reversal was not required, we focused on one monophyletic clade, the eels (Anguilliformes), in which most of the losses and all of the putative regains of the pectoral fin occurred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>This was a clade, in fact, where we manually curated recent phylogenies (Santini et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>2013; Tang and Fielitz 2013) into Open Tree, and the phylogeny (Fig. 5) is up-to-date and resolved with respect to the most recently published studies for Anguilliformes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>Our analysis showed that among 1000 different randomly resolved topologies, the pectoral fins re-evolved following loss a minimum of two times: once within Hoplunnis (duckbill eels with nine species; Family: Nettastomatidae) and again in Macrocephenchelys (conger eels with two species; Family: Congridae; Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>This points to species where regain is a very strongly supported hypothesis that could be examined further using genetic tools, for example. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="423" pm="."><plain>Additionally, it points to areas in the tree for strategic resolution, that is, regions of the tree where evolutionary questions, such as understanding the phylogenetic pattern and frequency of reversals and their biological basis, could be answered through further phylogenetic analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="425" pm="."><plain>The opportunity to understand the broad patterns of evolution of organismal features, foundational knowledge for many types of studies, is at hand with the tools in place to reuse and synthesize the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="426" pm="."><plain>The time-consuming nature of curating phylogenies and trait data into the formats and databases appropriate for their automatic aggregation into larger-scale synthetic products is an immediate challenge, though cultural shifts with respect to data in the life science community and advances in machine learning are progressing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="427" pm="."><plain>As our case study shows, rendering traits computable enables the extension of relatively sparse data to taxa for which the presence or absence of a trait had not been directly asserted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="428" pm="."><plain>Further, by propagating author assertions about features for high-level taxa to species for which asserted or inferred data are missing, we show that trait data can be further and significantly extended. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="429" pm="."><plain>An additional benefit from these automated approaches lies in readily discoverable errors in data or knowledge by uncovering conflicts in the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="430" pm="."><plain>Such potential errors are not easily found through manual means. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="431" pm="."><plain>Given the increasingly broad scope of comparative questions across biology, a sizable and growing legacy literature, and the difficulty and expense of new data collection, automated means of existing data reuse and extension by way of inference and data propagation are critically important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="432" pm="."><plain>Equally important is ensuring that the users of these products have access to the provenance of the data, including the traits for each taxon and the phylogenetic resolution and the means by which they were generated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="433" pm="."><plain>This case study also revealed several important technical challenges to such integration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="434" pm="."><plain>Current difficulties in aligning taxonomic sources impede ready integration, and new tools are needed to analyze and visualize the data on large trees. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="435" pm="."><plain>Finally, from the standpoint of understanding the relative frequencies of pectoral and pelvic fin loss and regain, this study provides evidence that the pelvic fin is independently lost in more than twice the number of lineages as the pectoral fin, and that these fins were regained several to many times in the course of teleost evolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="436" pm="."><plain>The general method outlined here, of an automated mapping and extension of traits mined from dozens of studies, to trees assembled from over a hundred more, offers rapid assessments of trait distribution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="437" pm="."><plain>These in turn set the stage for in-depth analyses of the potential underlying evolutionary mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
