</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Metastasis is responsible for 90% of deaths from solid tumors (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It involves the escape of cancer cells from the site of the primary tumor, their entry into the circulatory system, and finally, colonization of and proliferation at a distant organ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, this process is highly inefficient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Only an estimated 0.2% of the disseminated tumor cells are able to form a lesion at distant organ sites (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A well-studied mechanism of metastasis is single cell dissemination where carcinoma cells acquire migratory and invasive traits via an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These cells can then utilize blood or lymph circulation to reach distant organ sites, where they reacquire epithelial traits of cell–cell adhesion and apico-basal polarity via a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) to establish metastases (4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have highlighted that EMT is not a binary process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Rather, cells en route to a mesenchymal phenotype can acquire a stable hybrid epithelial–mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) phenotype (5, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These observations have called into question the indispensability of a complete EMT followed by MET in metastasis (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Instead, collective migration of tumor cells via clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been suggested as an alternate mechanism of metastasis (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Clusters of tumor cells had been detected in the bloodstream of cancer patients even before the characterization of EMT as a driver of cancer metastasis (9, 10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>These clusters of tumor cells can efficiently seed secondary tumors, exhibiting up to 50 times the metastatic potential of individually migrating tumor cells (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Tumor cell clusters accounted for &gt;90% of metastases in a mouse model of breast cancer (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Abundance of CTC clusters in the bloodstream has been associated with significantly poor prognosis in breast cancer and in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (11, 13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Multiple factors are believed to be responsible for the heightened metastatic potential of these CTC clusters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>These include effective response to mechanical signals and chemical gradients by cells in CTC clusters as compared to migrating single tumor cells (14, 15), better evasion of the host immune system (16), and potential cooperation among heterogeneous cell types in CTC clusters (17, 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that collectively invading tumor cells from the primary lesion often co-express epithelial and mesenchymal markers (19–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Thus, cells in CTC clusters tend to manifest a hybrid epithelial–mesenchymal (hybrid E/M) phenotype and to retain cell–cell adhesion characteristics (8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype that has been reported to predominantly metastasize via CTC clusters (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Characterized by breast erythema, edema, and peau d’orange presenting with or without a noticeable tumoral mass (23, 24), IBC involves tumoral infiltrate in the dermal lymphatics and about 30% of IBC patients have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis as compared to only 5% of non-IBC type breast cancer patients (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Though only 2–4% of breast cancer cases each year in the United States are of the IBC type, IBC patients account for 10% of the annual breast cancer-related mortalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>A hallmark of IBC is the presence of cohesive clusters of tumor cells in the local lymph nodes (26) and IBC patients have larger and a higher frequency of CTC clusters as compared to non-IBC breast cancer patients (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Abundance of CTC clusters has been shown to be associated with poor progression-free survival in IBC patients (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Despite their great propensity to metastasize, tumor cells in the primary lesion and in metastatic lesions of IBC maintain a high expression E-cadherin, a hallmark of epithelial cells (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>IBC thus presents an exciting model for the study of collective dissemination of tumor cells via CTC clusters and of the prognostic potential of these clusters of migrating tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The results presented here strengthen the argument for investigating IBC to elucidate the mechanisms underlying collective dissemination of tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Here, we invoke concepts from theoretical models of evolution to investigate cluster-based dissemination of tumor cells and analogous IBC characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Theoretical studies suggest that systems with a more hierarchical structure are more adaptable (28–30) due to their ability to efficiently span the space of possible states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical systems are also more robust to perturbations because a hierarchical network architecture has a buffering effect that hinders the propagation of local perturbations to a majority of nodes (30, 31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical organization, thus, emerges over time in physical systems that are evolving in a changing environment with a rugged fitness landscape exhibiting numerous peaks and valleys (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Given that tumor cells involved in metastasis and invasion progress through many different microenvironments (32–34), one can expect the expression of genes associated with a metastatic phenotype to be more hierarchically organized in instances of successful macrometastases as compared to instances with no metastasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We quantified the hierarchical organization in the expression of two distinct sets of genes, one associated with collective dissemination of tumor cells and the other related to IBC, in cancer cell lines and in breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, we used the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) metric. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The CCC for a set of genes takes into consideration the collective expression of all genes within the given set and the correlations between the expression levels of different genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It captures the level of hierarchical organization in the collective expression of genes in the given set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>A higher CCC indicates greater hierarchical organization in the expression of genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>The CCC was first used for comparing tree-like relationships represented by different dendrograms (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>It has been used previously to quantify the differences in expression of metastasis-associated genes in breast cancer patients with different clinical outcomes (36) and to quantify the differences in expression of genes predictive of clinical outcome in adult acute myeloid leukemia in patients belonging to different risk categories (37). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The goal of the present study was to determine whether the hierarchical organization in the expression of two sets of genes of interest is different in cell lines exhibiting different EMT-associated phenotypes and in tumor samples from breast cancer patients exhibiting features of IBC and non-IBC type disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The first set of genes investigated here includes 87 genes reported to be associated with collective dissemination of tumor cells as CTC clusters: genes differentially expressed in cells forming CTC clusters as compared to individual CTCs (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The second gene set includes 78 genes reported to be differentially expressed in tumor samples from IBC patients in comparison to tumor samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>We observed that the CCC for both of these gene sets was higher in (a) epithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines and (b) tumor samples from IBC patients as compared to tumor samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>A higher CCC further correlated with worse disease progression in breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>In light of these observations, we propose that the metastatic aggressiveness of IBC potentially derives from the hierarchical organization in the expression of collective dissemination-associated genes in metastasizing tumor cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>To quantify the hierarchy in the expression of a set of genes in different groups of patients and cell lines, we used a metric called the CCC (35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>The CCC is a measure of how well a hierarchical clustering of nodes in a network reproduces the distances between nodes in the original network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Intuitively, the CCC is a measure of how tree-like a network is. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Since a tree topology is a prototypical hierarchical structure, a measure of the tree-like characteristic of a network allows us to aptly quantify the underlying hierarchy in the structure of the network. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>For calculating the CCC of a given network, we defined the distance between nodes i and j as the Euclidean commute time distance (ECTD) between the two nodes, which is given by the square root of the mean first passage time taken by a random walker to travel from node i to node j and then back to node i. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>The ECTD between nodes i and j depends not only on the weight of the edge between nodes i and j but also on the number of different possible paths between the two nodes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Cancer metastasis via migrating clusters of CTCs has emerged as a critical mechanism of seeding secondary tumors in recent studies (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Although rare in comparison with individually disseminated cancer cells, CTC clusters can efficiently seed secondary tumors at distant organ sites (11, 12), and their presence in the bloodstream of cancer patients has been shown to be associated with poor disease prognosis, i.e., worse overall survival and worse disease-free survival (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying collective dissemination of tumor cells is, therefore, important for predicting metastasis, which remains the principal cause of cancer-associated mortalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Determinants of single cell versus collective dissemination of tumor cells, however, remain elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Here, we have analyzed the topology of the network of genes implicated in the collective dissemination of tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the topology of the network of genes reported to be differentially expressed in tumor samples from IBC patients as compared to tumor samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our analysis suggests that maintenance of the epithelial phenotype in cancer cells disseminating from the primary tumor contributes toward metastasis via collective migration of tumor cells as CTC clusters. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that the expression of genes differentially expressed in tumor cells migrating as clusters as compared to individually migrating tumor cells (12) exhibits a more hierarchical organization in epithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines among both, immortalized breast cancer cell lines (39) and the cancer cell lines in the NCI60 panel (41, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>The importance of expression of such genes involved in cell migration, cell–extracellular matrix interaction, and cell–cell adhesion in the classification of NCI60 cell lines has been observed previously (64). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Retention of some epithelial characteristics by cancer cells disseminating from the primary tumor has been reported to contribute toward collective invasion by tumor cells as CTC clusters (12, 65, 66). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>A more hierarchical organization in the expression of these genes may contribute toward a more robust epithelial phenotype in these cell lines (28–31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Higher hierarchical organization in the expression of these genes is also observed in tumor samples from IBC patients as compared to tumor samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>This difference may contribute toward the strengthened presentation of epithelial characteristics such as cell–cell adhesion and juxtracrine signaling in tumor cells from IBC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>The retention of these characteristics can foster the collective migration of tumor cells from the primary breast lesion (65). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Further, our results reveal that hierarchical expression of collective dissemination-associated genes is of diagnostic relevance in IBC, thereby strengthening the case for IBC as a model system for the study of collective dissemination of tumor cells (22) and indicating the potential usefulness of mechanistic studies of tumor cell dissemination in determining the principles underlying IBC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Next, we investigated the hierarchical organization in the expression of genes previously reported to be differentially expressed in tumor samples from IBC patients as compared to tumor samples from non-IBC breast cancer patients (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>The expression of these genes was more hierarchically organized in IBC samples as compared to non-IBC samples across multiple independent datasets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Further, epithelial cell lines exhibited a more hierarchical expression of these genes as compared to mesenchymal cell lines among immortalized breast cell lines (39) and among the cell lines in the NCI60 panel composed of nine different tumor types (41, 42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Thus, both collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated genes exhibited a similar trend of higher CCC in immortalized breast cell lines or cancer cell lines as well as in tumor samples from IBC patients, adding to the existing evidence on collective dissemination via tumor emboli as the predominant mode of IBC metastasis and consequent aggressiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, the expression of canonical EMT-inducing transcription factors (52) was more hierarchically organized in non-IBC breast cancer samples as compared to IBC samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results reinforce the notion that a complete EMT is not involved in IBC metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Rather, it is the collective migration of tumor cells that are able to retain some epithelial characteristics that contributes toward the metastatic aggressiveness of IBC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>The results presented here further strengthen the emerging notion that a complete EMT followed by MET is not necessarily as prevalent during cancer metastasis (7, 21) as posited earlier (67). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Both collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated gene sets exhibited a higher CCC in breast cancer patients with faster posttreatment metastatic relapse as compared to patients with slower posttreatment relapse (53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was observed in our calculations of the CCC for patients with SCLC (54), another metastatically aggressive cancer reported to metastasize via clusters of CTCs (55–57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a more hierarchical organization in the expression of genes involved in the collective dissemination of tumor cells may contribute toward a more aggressive behavior in metastatically aggressive tumors such as IBC and SCLC, which predominantly metastasize via clusters of CTCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>A mechanism-based investigation of the cross-talk between collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated genes may, therefore, be a promising next step. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Further, samples from breast cancer metastases to lymph nodes and liver (59) exhibited a lower CCC as compared to breast cancer metastases to skin for collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated gene sets (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>While metastasis of tumor cells to distant organs such as the skin is a complex, multi-step, and highly inefficient process, migration of tumor cells from the primary lesion to the local lymph nodes is likely to be a more facile process and can be brought about by the passive flow of the lymph. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Metastasis to the liver is facilitated by the extravasation of migrating tumor cells into the liver via the fenestrated hepatic vascular epithelium (58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the CCC for both gene sets, collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated, with a higher rate of and propensity for metastasis to distant organs clearly speaks of the survival advantage afforded to migrating tumor cells by collective dissemination as clusters of CTCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>These advantages include enhanced ability to resist anoikis (cell death upon detachment from the substrate), evasion from immune system recognition, potential polyclonality, and enhanced ability to seed secondary tumors (68). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>In fact, CTC clusters can include non-tumor cells such as immune cells, platelets, and cancer-associated fibroblasts, thereby reproducing the primary tumor microenvironment conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Such an environment may contribute toward the survival of disseminating tumor cells in transit, promoting cancer metastasis (69). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>A commonly used approach to determine if an a priori defined set of genes is associated with phenotypic differences between two groups is GSEA (70, 71). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This method involves finding if the given set of genes is over-represented among genes that are differentially expressed in the two phenotypic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>To determine if insights similar to those described above can be obtained via GSEA for the collective dissemination-associated gene set and for the IBC-associated gene set, we used the GSEA software provided by the Broad Institute (61) to calculate enrichment scores for the two gene sets in the data from Grosse-Wilde et al. (39), i.e., epithelial versus mesenchymal cell lines, and in the data from Iwamoto et al. (45), i.e., IBC versus non-IBC breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>While we consistently obtained a higher CCC for collective dissemination-associated and IBC-associated gene sets in epithelial cell lines and in tumor samples from IBC patients, the expression of genes in these sets was not always enriched in epithelial versus mesenchymal cell lines or in IBC versus non-IBC patient samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Together, these results indicate that the CCC need not correlate with GSEA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In fact, the CCC of a set of genes for two samples with a k-fold change in the expression of all genes in the set will be the same. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>The CCC can thus provide insights in addition to those that may be obtained from a direct analysis of gene expression data by using GSEA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>The CCC of a gene network can be a robust metric of functional significance of a set of genes in different phenotypic groups, independent of the enrichment score calculated for the given gene set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>It provides a prognostic measure based on the collective expression of genes in cells exhibiting different phenotypes beyond that provided by GSEA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>The classical view of cancer is that it involves de-differentiation of host cell pathways (36, 72). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Since IBC is more metastatically aggressive as compared to non-IBC breast cancer, host cell pathways are likely to be more disrupted in tumor samples from IBC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This is indeed observed for breast tumor samples from the study by Iwamoto et al. (45). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Of the 100 randomly generated gene sets, 41 exhibited a significantly higher CCC in the non-IBC breast cancer group as compared to the IBC group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the host cell pathways are disrupted to a greater extent in IBC as compared to non-IBC breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>However, structure in the pathways involving genes that promote cancer progression may be selected for as the disease advances. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that the expression of adult acute myeloid leukemia-associated genes is more hierarchically organized in samples from patients in whom the disease relapsed during the follow-up period as compared to patients that underwent complete remission upon treatment (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Similarly, for breast cancer metastasis-associated genes, hierarchical organization was higher in patients who developed distant metastases during the follow-up period as compared to patients who did not (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Here, we propose that due to the role of maintenance of an epithelial phenotype in collective dissemination of tumor cells and the subsequent metastatic efficiency of CTC clusters, a hierarchical organization in the expression of these genes may be selected for in metastatically aggressive cancers like IBC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>A measure of hierarchical organization, here the CCC, can thus be a useful biomarker in cancer prognosis, particularly in the case of IBC. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>We have shown that a set of genes previously reported to be associated with the collective dissemination of tumor cells (12) is more hierarchically expressed in epithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines, thereby indicating a role for epithelial characteristics in the collective migration of tumor cells as clusters of CTCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>We further showed that IBC, an aggressive breast cancer subtype that metastasizes primarily via CTC clusters, exhibits a more hierarchical organization in the expression of these collective dissemination-associated genes as compared to non-IBC type breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Along similar lines, we showed that for genes differentially expressed in IBC as compared to non-IBC tumor samples, the expression is more hierarchical in tumor samples from IBC patients and in phenotypically epithelial cell lines, suggesting a a role for the retention of some epithelial traits in the metastatically aggressive nature of IBC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our work indicates that at least some maintenance of the epithelial phenotype in disseminating tumor cells during disease progression plays a key role in successful metastasis of cancer to distant organs, and that IBC can be a suitable model system for studying mechanisms of collective migration of tumor cells as CTC clusters. </plain></SENT>
