</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Health promotion is on the global agenda,1 both at population level and in specific settings such as workplaces,2,3 cities,4 schools5 or healthcare organizations.6 The risks targeted include smoking, hazardous alcohol consumption as well as nutrition and insufficient physical activity—issues which are central to reducing the global burden of non-communicable diseases.7 In all settings, the need for health promotion is significant—not least among patients in healthcare organizations.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Targeting quality improvement in the field of hospital-based health promotion or clinical health promotion (CHP),9 the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed and validated standards and indicators.10–12 In addition, the last few decades have shown a rise in randomized studies providing high-level evidence on the short-term benefits of CHP within the healthcare settings themselves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the intensive types of CHP interventions have been shown to significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient safety in a matter of weeks.13–16 The WHO standards and indicators for CHP are widely used in many countries around the world—not least among the members of the WHO’s International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals &amp; Health Services (HPH), which represents about 700 hospitals from all continents.6 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Systematic and widespread implementation of the evidence for CHP, however, remains a major challenge.17–20 The challenges related to implementation of evidence in healthcare are not unique to CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Rather implementation is a general problem across all aspects of healthcare.21–23 Over the years, more than 60 strategic implementation and dissemination processes, models and frameworks have been developed to further integration of evidence into practice and thus improve healthcare quality.24 These span an array of processes and frameworks, but the effects of these initiatives on clinical outcomes are scantly investigated in randomized designs.25,26 Testing the effect of the WHO standards and indicators for CHP in the form of a strategic quality improvement process was only recently attempted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This testing was done in an eight-country multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT) with 36 clinical hospital departments, entitled “WHO-HPH Recognition Process”.17,20 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The WHO-HPH Recognition Process RCT tested the effect of using the WHO standards and indicators in a fast-track strategic implementation process, introduced at the level of the clinical department over the course of 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The effects studied were health gains of patients and staff, improvements in documentation of lifestyle risks, improvements in delivery of related CHP services to patients in need of them and improvements in compliance with the WHO standards and indicators.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The RCT was designed with the hospital departments as the unit of randomization and analysis and departments were randomly allocated to either the strategic implementation process or to continuation of their own usual implementation routines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition to the WHO standards and indicators, the RCT’s proposed strategic implementation process also relied on validated CHP documentation models,27,28 drew on more theoretical elements from implementation science23,25,26,29,30 and on general quality improvement tools, such as the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle, quality plans, surveys, medical record audits and issuing of recognition certificates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The data collection in the RCT covered patient, staff and clinical department levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The health status of patients and staff was assessed via Short Form 36 version 2 (SF36v2) health surveys.31,32 Patient lifestyle risks and related delivery of CHP services were assessed via medical record audits using the CHP documentation models.27,28 Department-level performance was assessed with the WHO standards.10 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The performance of the departments regarding the WHO standards was recognized at the finalization of the 1 year implementation by a certificate (91%−100% standards compliance was gold level). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The RCT did not find significant effect on health gains of patients or staff, but it did show that the strategic implementation process itself improved documentation of lifestyle risks, delivery of related CHP services as well as compliance with the WHO standards.20 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Qualitative methods are needed to answer how participants experience a given intervention and how it works.33 In order to explore how staff experienced and perceived the WHO-HPH process, and how the process might be improved in the future, we used an interpretive data synthesis approach34-36 of semi-structured in-depth key-informant interviews37,38 with staff and managers as our data source. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The key-informant approach was limited in the sense that it was non-ethnographic; not looking for any cultural understanding per se, but rather looking for “informants who might be expected to have specialized information on particular topics”.39 The study was conducted and reported according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) framework.40 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>About half (53%) of the informants were women. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>The informants were from 14 hospitals in four countries: Taiwan, Czech Republic, Malaysia and Japan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>All worked at intervention-group clinical hospital departments, which had undertaken the 1-year implementation of the WHO-HPH Recognition Process (Table 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The informants’ perceptions of and experiences with the implementation of the WHO-HPH Recognition Process revolved around four global themes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The first theme concerned awareness, cultural re-orientation, integration of CHP into daily practice as well as optimism related to CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>This is presented below with the title “It reminded us of health promotion.” The second theme concerned learnings, competences and understanding of CHP. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>This is presented with the title “CHP has become the norm.” The fourth theme concerned improvements in structure, documentation and working practices as well as a more evidence-based and systematic approach to CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>This is presented with the title “Now we have data to show them.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="section14-2050312118792394"><title><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Global theme 1: “it reminded us of health promotion.” </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>The first theme concerned awareness of CHP, cultural re-orientation toward CHP and integration of CHP into daily practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>It also concerned a re-kindled optimism regarding the potential results of CHP work. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>The general raise in awareness of CHP importance, the cultural re-orientation and the integration of CHP into daily practice is illustrated by these quotes from informants:Before we came into contact with this (the WHO-HPH process)—we were just dealing with patients before - and after we joined this, we found that actually we had abandoned something here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>It kind of reminded us a lot of health promotion. (Manager, Taiwan)We were probably starting to forget that kind of view (the view of CHP), but by working with this project, people were reminded of what they have to do. (Manager, Japan)Over the months and gradually with a year now, I think almost all of our staff have habitualized this (CHP) into the clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Regarding the re-kindled optimism concerning CHP, informants talked about increases in dialogue about CHP and about what they think could viably be obtained through CHP in future:[…] over the year, I think we have […] recognized that, uhm, augmenting the health awareness of our patients and also our staff does translate into better clinical outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>It may be not that significant at first, but I think, at least we believe now that if we continue to do this, we will actually make a difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan)We use this model, and I think, it is the same for any hospital. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>But especially for this hospital, we know that, if we do this, we can improve. (Manager, Japan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>In summary, this theme shows that informants perceive the process to have brought about greater awareness of CHP within their departments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Informants felt the process had made CHP a more prominent part of, or habit in, their daily clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>This highlights a perceived cultural re-orientation of the departments toward CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The theme also highlights a rekindled optimism regarding the potential results of implementing patient-centered CHP altogether. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="section15-2050312118792394"><title><text><SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>Global theme 2: “The whole process was educational.” </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The second theme concerned learnings on CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>These learnings were perceived to be both at a specific level, in terms of competences and skills related to CHP, but also at a more overall level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>Regarding the specific learnings, informants often felt that they had acquired specific new skills related to CHP practice; related to project management, communication and execution in clinical settings; related to role modeling and related to collaboration around CHP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>This is illustrated by the following quotes:We began to say, okay; when we do health promotion, there is a process of data collection […] you look at the results, there is a way to analyze, and you need to see, if there is room for improvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>So I think, the whole process was educational. (Doctor, Malaysia)(Personally, I) learned how to communicate with the patients and make them listen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>(Nurse, Czech Republic)We learned […] about the weight, ehm, weight control skills, nutrition consultation among the patients, exercise program […]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Regarding the more overall learnings on CHP, informants talked about how the process increased understanding of CHP and its importance in a broader sense:I think, I have gained more understanding of HPH […]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Japan)(the process) is a more structured way to promoting health than before, so that’s what I learned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>(Nurse, Malaysia)Through this project, we learned that working with our patients on their individual lifestyles was very important […] so now we know, we have to do it”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>(Nurse, Japan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>In summary, this theme shows that informants felt that the process had resulted in learnings related to CHP, both at individual and group levels among staff in the departments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The learnings that took place were perceived to be both specific, related to concrete skill and CHP competences, but also more general in terms of greater understanding of CHP and the evidence to support its integration in clinical settings. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The third theme concerned normalization and legitimacy of CHP work as well as benefits that resulted from the process and barriers to implementation encountered along the way. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Regarding normalization and legitimacy, informants talked about how CHP ceased being something extra or an add-on service and instead became communicated and recognized broadly as a new “norm” and thus a natural, legitimate part of clinical practice:[…] we just continue (the WHO-HPH process), because it (CHP) has become the norm, so we will continue. (Nurse, Taiwan)[…] We have tried for several years to find and open some prevention programs, and it was very difficult […] (now we are) supported from our management […] we have built up the (CHP) program and it has helped us a lot. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Czech Republic)Basically the model (the WHO-HPH process) has been built in, so we just do it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan)I think that the habit will not change […] I will keep, keep on this project, keep on this method […]. (Manager, Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Concerning the implementation of the process, informants talked about the benefits that they perceived to have resulted from it:(Now) we have the ambulatory for smokers that want to stop with the habit, so this is the one thing and the biggest (change). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>That is what I think. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Czech Republic)It is a bonus for the patients, because the hospital is now paying attention to their issues in health, especially in the Joint Centre […] overweight is a heavy burden on their (the patients’) joints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>So for patients this is a good development. (Nurse, Taiwan)Through these programs, I have seen that some of the staff they have changed their lifestyles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Especially, I have seen doctors climbing stairs, you know, during lunchtime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>(Nurse, Malaysia)[…] the postoperative recovery actually improved […] the number of days in bed and the exercise afterwards has been improved […] this helps in their (the patients’) post-operative recovery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Informants also, but to a lesser degree, talked about the barriers to implementation of the process, which they had encountered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>These revolved mainly around professional habits, patient compliance and availability of time and personnel:At first it was not easy, because ehm, getting so many doctors, especially those had been practicing for a long time, to change their habits is not an easy thing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan)(The) hard parts (of the WHO-HPH process were) to try to tell our patients to do, what they promised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>But sometimes they promised something, but by the time … the reality is different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Czech Republic)It is difficult for us to find the time […] communicating (about CHP) with the patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Japan)There was still some difficulties to the actually practice, because we had no fixed personnel to work on this. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Taiwan) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In summary, this theme shows how the informants’ experienced normalization and increased legitimacy of CHP work as a result of the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>CHP went from being viewed as an extra add-on service to being regarded broadly in the departments as a legitimate, core part of the clinical work—the new “norm.” The theme also shows, what informants perceived to be, the benefits of and barriers to implementation of the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The benefits included structural improvements, more holistic care, patient and staff lifestyle improvements and improvements to patient outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The barriers included changing old professional habits, assuring patient compliance and finding the needed time and personnel resources. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>The fourth theme concerned how the WHO-HPH Recognition Process brought about improvements in structure, documentation and working practices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>It shows a perceived shift toward a more evidence-based and systematic approach to CHP:We are not just giving testimony anymore. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>We’ve got research […] So with this kind of process, this way of doing things, collecting data, it also gives us more power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Now we have data to show them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Malaysia)People […] work, and we have scientific data, and then moving from it. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Taiwan)I think was meaningful […] through this HPH recognition project, we found many challenges that we should work on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>(Manager, Japan)It (the WHO-HPH process) makes sense because […] it is actually making us better, you know, uhm in a way, uhm of documenting patients in a structured way […]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>(Nurse, Malaysia) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Practically, these changes and improvements often related to improved documentation of lifestyle risks in the medical records and also to more systematic delivery of services to the patients in need of them:Previously we did not have this kind of system, so maybe they (the staff) asked (patients about lifestyle), but they did not record it. (Manager, Taiwan)The change that I noticed, for instance, was the medical records system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>(after the process) there was a corner that I should write in with health promotion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>(Doctor, Japan)(The department is) better now. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Generally, the informants felt that their departments had moved toward a more evidence-based and research-oriented approach to CHP—a development which was in turn seen as enabling, since it helped informants justify CHP work more easily to top-management and others by way of more compelling data on the effect of CHP. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>This study has a number of limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>All informants were from departments in HPH member hospitals that had undertaken the WHO-HPH Recognition Process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>In this way, our informants may represent a motivated group, and results may be quite different outside HPH hospital settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>The first-hand experiences with the project, which informants generally had, increase the trustworthiness of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of informants from several countries and cultures is a strength, as it may broaden representativeness, but it is also a limitation, since it meant greater variability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>In terms of validity, the year that passed from process start to interviews may have promoted recall bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>This might have caused under-reporting of problems and negative aspects of the process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Also, the interview guide had not been validated in advance, which is a further limitation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>The overall positive attitudes of informants may be connected to four general limiting factors: power, situation, culture and language/translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>Regarding power, the interviewer was part of the site-visit auditor group—which came to the hospital departments, validated their data and scored them with certificates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>Regarding situation, a closed-door interview situation was not always obtained, so sometimes managers, HPH Network officials and others were in the room during interviews. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Regarding culture, it is well described that complex face-keeping practices and politeness-related social codes exist, not least in Asian cultures, and that these have important ramifications on all types of communication,51,52 with research interviews not likely to be any exception. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>And finally, regarding language/translation, none of the informants were native English speakers and field-notes ascertain that translation could at times be a challenge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>These four general limiting factors may have added to an asymmetrical power relationship between interviewer and informants, have reduced the likelihood of negative utterances, and they may altogether have impacted the free, honest and open dialogue, which is often envisaged as the ideal interview situation.45 Realistically, however, a research interview is probably never power free, given its nature as a purpose-built type of conversation set up to produce useful data to answer, in the researcher’s eyes, useful data to answer clear research objectives.53 On this basis, the four general limiting factors in this study may be regarded, simply, as what was possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>The four general limiting factors have been presented to make resulting limitations transparent and to allow readers to evaluate potential effects53 on findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>The large sample of informants interviewed in this study could also give rise to ethical concerns, since it might be interpreted as excess data collection and thus unnecessary use of informants’ time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Conversely, having a large sample could also be regarded as legitimate safe-guarding against potential language/culture and ability barriers to adequate communication, articulating, expressing and reflecting on experiences and opinions,37 especially since it would have been costly to have had to return back to hospitals in other continents, in case of lacking data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the interviews were very rarely regarded as an inconvenience by informants, who rather viewed the interviews as a positive part of or de-briefing to the process itself, thus reducing potential ethical concerns related to excess data collection. </plain></SENT>
