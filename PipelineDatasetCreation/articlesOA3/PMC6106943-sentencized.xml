</text></title><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are a taxonomically diverse group that include some of the most important emerging and re-emerging pathogens of wildlife, livestock and human beings worldwide [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Among arbovirus vectors, the majority of recent genomic studies have been carried out on the mosquitoes Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) due to their involvement in human to human transmission of a wide-range of arboviruses, their relative ease of colonization and recent technical advances in genome sequencing and annotation technologies [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>While these studies have led to major advances in control of the arboviruses these species transmit and our understanding of what drives susceptibility to infection [5–7], tools and resources for use with many other vector groups remain neglected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>To date, no genomic analyses have been carried out for vectors of non-zoonotic arboviruses that are pathogenic to livestock and wildlife. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Among the most important of these vector groups are Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), species of which transmit internationally important arboviruses of ruminants, equines and deer [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In recent years, unprecedented outbreaks of Culicoides-borne arboviruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV) have inflicted huge economic losses on the livestock sector of Europe (e.g. estimate of US$ 1.4 billion in France in 2007) through clinical disease and accompanying restrictions against the movement of livestock imposed to limit virus spread [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Globally, BTV outbreaks initiate non-tariff trade barriers restricting the movement of livestock and livestock germplasm, and cause a decrease in ruminant productivity in regions as diverse as India and the USA [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Globally, the economic impact of bluetongue has been estimated to US$ 3 billion [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Culicoides are notoriously difficult to culture under laboratory conditions and their small size of approximately 1.5 mm body length renders them far from ideal subjects for transcriptomic and genome manipulation studies [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Only one of 14 confirmed vector species of Culicoides is currently colonized, Culicoides sonorensis Wirth and Jones [8, 15]. Culicoides sonorensis colonies have already provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of vector competence for BTV [16], a de novo transcriptome [17], and have been used to construct a physical map of the C. sonorensis genome which consists of four chromosomes [18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to infection and transmission of arboviruses by Culicoides is determined in part by the heritability of barriers to virus dissemination following ingestion of the bloodmeal [13, 20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence of a midgut infection barrier, a midgut escape barrier and a haemocoel dissemination barrier in C. sonorensis (formerly C. variipennis or C. v. sonorensis [22]) have been defined [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence to date of salivary gland barriers preventing transmission in any species of Culicoides [24], as has been inferred in several species of mosquitoes [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of the genetic basis for vector competence of C. sonorensis for BTV, using maternal inheritance properties, identified a 90 kd protein and used antibodies to this protein to isolate and characterize a cDNA clone encoding a glutathione S-transferase class delta enzyme [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Differential gene regulation in response to BTV infection, however, has not been investigated to date. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In this study, we sequence, de novo assemble, annotate and explore the first full genome of C. sonorensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We then use transcriptomic analyses both to improve gene prediction within the genome build, and to elucidate differential gene expression associated with Culicoides competence for a BTV serotype 1 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The full genome sequence and transcriptome analyses are important resources for further studies of this phylogenetic group which is separated from the other major Dipteran vector families by at least 220 million years [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition to being a valuable resource for comparative study of vector phylogenomics, the provision of Culicoides genomes is of interest as a group that demonstrates several unique features, including a great capacity for long-distance dispersal by semi-passive flight and the ability to reach huge population density under suitable conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In addition, their close association with livestock raises questions concerning both host preference and vector competence for arboviruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Many of these questions can be readily addressed by understanding genetic diversity within populations which will be enhanced by the provision of comparative genomic data, but also in the long term by yielding targets for transgenic modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The present genome provides a resource to facilitate all these studies. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par66"><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The genome assembly of C. sonorensis has a similar size to that of other Diptera species for which their genome is available, except for Ae. aegypti which has an unusually large genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>There is however some discrepancy between the estimated size using the method of Schell et al. [36], the size of the original assembly and the size once redundancy is removed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The difference in estimated and assembled sizes could be due to the high level of redundancy as this will spread the coverage across different regions of the genome assembly that would be otherwise collapsed after redundancy removal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Thus, the overestimate of the size can be ultimately linked to the heterogeneity of the starting DNA material used for sequencing the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Various measures (the high proportion of BUSCO genes present in multiple copy, and estimates of genome size and redundancy using read mapping and alignment approaches) indicate the presence of a high level of redundancy in the assembly (Table 2), which could result from genetic variation within and amongst individuals used to sequence the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>However, the individuals come from a colony that has not had any outbreeding for over 40 years, which should have reduced the genetic variation among the individuals of the colony. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>When the redundancy is collapsed the number of scaffolds is reduced by half, the genome size is reduced by 40 Mb and the N50 increases, resulting in a less fragmented genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>However, the coverage of BUSCO genes was not affected but the number of duplicate gene copies was reduced by more than 50%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>In addition, 20% of the genes were removed after the redundancy analyses, although 80% still had a high confidence hit gene in the collapsed genome, indicating that they had been duplicated during the assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Of those reported in the present study, 62 were affected by redundancy but 60 still had a homologous gene in the collapsed assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>In our view, the redundancy analysis can be considered as an analysis of confidence in the gene models of the original genome assembly, and there is high confidence in 80% of the genes annotated while 20% of the gene models should be considered as low confidence as they could be the result of assembly artefacts, miss-predicted genes, or gene families with several copies difficult to distinguish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a proportion of the redundancy was due to heterozygosity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>In addition, another part of the redundancy corresponded to repetitive elements of the genome, and these were reduced by 20% in the collapsed genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>The low GC content of the genome, which is the lowest of any Diptera species sequenced so far, is likely to have had an impact in the assembly of particularly AT-rich regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Thus, the discrepancy between the genome sizes before and after the redundancy is removed can be partly explained by the heterogeneity of the starting material for sequencing affecting the gene prediction, but also partially due to naturally occurring repeat regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>Whether these genes and repeat elements are real or an artefact of the assembly process can only be verified with further experimental work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Long read-sequencing approaches would likely help reduce this redundancy. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par73"><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>Here we present the first annotated genome of the biting midge, C. sonorensis, a vector of economically important viruses of livestock, such as bluetongue virus (BTV) and Schmallenberg virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>This genome has been fundamental in gaining information about the genetics of BTV transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Thus, gene expression comparison between females susceptible to a full infection by BTV and those females refractory to full BTV infection, identified 165 genes that are candidates to be involved in vector competence in this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Of these genes, the gst-1 gene was identified previously to be involved in BTV transmission, while the antiviral helicase ski2 involved in suppressing the replication of dsRNA viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>Overall, the publication of the genome and transcriptomes will lead to advances in the control of economically relevant arboviruses of livestock. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>In addition, this genome fills a phylogenetic gap of more than 200 million years, and will be a useful source of comparative data for studies of vector competence across Diptera. </plain></SENT>
