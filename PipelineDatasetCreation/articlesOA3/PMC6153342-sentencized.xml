</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Mycoplasma bovis was first isolated in 1961 in the United States from a dairy herd with an outbreak of mastitis (Hale et al., 1962). M. bovis is one of the major causative agents of bovine mycoplasmosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations are broad, including bronchopneumonia, mastitis, otitis, arthritis, keratoconjunctivitis, meningitis, and genital disorders (Bürki et al., 2015a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This bacterium is an emerging pathogen in industrialized countries, leading to high economic losses in dairy and beef cattle production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Management of bovine mycoplasmosis is challenging as chronic infections in combination with subclinical development of the disease are often observed (Maunsell et al., 2011; Nicholas, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, current vaccines are ineffective in the field and antibiotic treatments generally fail, while resistance to antimicrobials is increasing (Gautier-Bouchardon et al., 2014; Perez-Casal et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In Switzerland, M. bovis was predominantly associated with pneumonia and subclinical mastitis (Burnens et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In the mid-2000s, a rise in the severity of mastitis cases due to M. bovis was observed (Aebi et al., 2012, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>A similar trend was documented in Northern Italy (Radaelli et al., 2011), Austria (Spergser et al., 2013), and Israel (Lysnyansky et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Molecular epidemiology studies of Austrian and Swiss strains revealed distinct genotypes suggesting a switch in the circulating M. bovis genotypes in Switzerland in parallel with an increased number of severe mastitis cases (Bürki et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether the currently circulating M. bovis strains show higher predilection or virulence toward mammary gland cells than older strains (Bürki et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Tissue predilection of specific M. bovis strains has not been previously reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Past research focused mainly on blood cells and partially neglected a potential role of other cell types like epithelial cells in disease development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>To establish an efficient infection, bacteria have to adhere to host cells, multiply or persist in the host, and evade the host immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms of pathogenicity of M. bovis have been described and disease development seems to be multifactorial (Bürki et al., 2015a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Adhesion is one of the first steps of mycoplasma infection (Rottem, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Several surface exposed proteins were characterized as adhesins (Sachse et al., 1993, 1996, 2000; Thomas et al., 2003b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanisms of cell-dependent adhesion are still not understood due to a lack of knowledge of the corresponding eukaryotic receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Recently, three adhesins were identified: α-enolase, NOX and TrmFO. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>They were shown to bind to plasminogen and fibronectin, serving as a bridge between the bacterial adhesins and the host cell receptors (Song et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Binding to plasminogen and fibronectin might facilitate invasion and dissemination in the host, as described for other bacteria (Raymond and Djordjevic, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Occasional intracellular localization of M. bovis in inflammatory host cells was previously shown in vivo (Adegboye et al., 1995; Rodríguez et al., 1996; Maeda et al., 2003; Kleinschmidt et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>More recently, in vitro uptake of M. bovis by several bovine blood cell types was demonstrated (van der Merwe et al., 2010; Suleman et al., 2016; Jimbo et al., 2017; Bürgi et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Moreover, invasion of primary embryonic calf turbinate (PECT) cells, the Embryonic Bovine Lung (EBL) cell line, and the Embryonic Bovine Tracheal (EBTr) cell line was shown (Bürki et al., 2015b; Suleman et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>To date, the molecular mechanisms involved in M. bovis invasion of bovine cells and a potential differential permissivity dependent on the cell type have not been described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Invasion of M. bovis in different cell types might contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium. M. bovis may reside in a protective niche evading the host immune response and antimicrobial treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, invasion of host blood cells could also lead to systemic spread of this bacterium (Bürki et al., 2015a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies indicated that cytotoxicity, apoptosis and host cell proliferation after infection with M. bovis differ among host cell types (Bürki et al., 2015a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Infected PBMCs were studied, considering cytotoxic effects, induction of apoptosis and viability of host cells, but results were inconsistent (Vanden Bush and Rosenbusch, 2002; van der Merwe et al., 2010; Gondaira et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>However, M. bovis was shown to inhibit proliferation of PBMCs (Vanden Bush and Rosenbusch, 2002; van der Merwe et al., 2010; Suleman et al., 2016, 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Studies analyzing distinct blood cell types gave clearer results. M. bovis infection delayed apoptosis in monocytes (Mulongo et al., 2014) and alveolar macrophages (Suleman et al., 2016), whereas a reduction in host cell viability and induction of apoptosis was observed in infected neutrophils (Jimbo et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Additionally, a slight induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity after M. bovis infection was observed in bovine macrophage cell lines (Bürgi et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Compared to blood cell types, little is known about the effects of M. bovis on epithelial cells. M. bovis infection induced a slight cytotoxic effect in bovine endothelial cells, whereas a strong increase in apoptosis was observed in human epithelial cells (Sokolova et al., 1998; Lu and Rosenbusch, 2004). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of M. bovis effects on epithelial cells is fragmentary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>In the present study, host–M. bovis interactions using bovine epithelial cells from different organs were investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify virulence phenotypes in bovine epithelial cells resulting from infection with two strains of M. bovis, with a focus on bovine epithelial mammary gland cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Strain L22/93 was isolated in 1993 in Switzerland from the lung of a cow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This strain was assigned to the sequence type (ST) 17 by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (Bürki et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Strain JF4278 was isolated from the milk of a cow with mastitis and pneumonia in Switzerland in 2008 (Aebi et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>This strain was originally submitted to the database as ST 5 on the basis of sequencing PCR amplicons (Bürki et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>It was later discovered that the adh-1 allele assignment was incorrect and that the isolate actually lacks that locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The current, updated pubMLST profile (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_mbovis_isolates">https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_mbovis_isolates</ext-link>), including the absence of the adh-1 locus, is consistent with the genome sequence data (Genbank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="NZ_LT578453">NZ_LT578453.1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>This finding was subsequently confirmed by repeating the analysis of the isolate based on PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>The missing adh-1 locus means that the isolate is not typeable by the MLST reference method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Other isolates similarly lacking the adh-1 locus have also been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>As a result, an effort to modify the scheme to restore the ability to type all isolates is underway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>There are a number of other isolates in the pubMLST database for which no adh-1 locus is given. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Strains of M. bovis were grown at 37°C in SP4 medium (Freundt, 1983) supplemented with 50 μg/mL cefoxitin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Pre-cultures were grown for 20 h from frozen stocks diluted 1:100 in SP4 broth medium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The concentration of all pre-cultures was measured by performing 10-fold serial dilutions and plating on SP4 agar plates. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Recently, the genetic characterization of M. bovis isolates from cattle and bison suggested host-specific genotypes (Register et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>It was later shown that M. bovis isolates from bison and cattle display differential effects on inhibition of cell proliferation and delay of apoptosis in bovine and bison blood cells (Suleman et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Invasiveness of M. bovis isolates from bison was shown to be reduced compared to an isolate from a calf in the EBL cell line but not in the EBTr cell line (Suleman et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>This observation has not been explained and should be addressed by additional experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated adhesion, cell invasion, cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and cell proliferation in bovine epithelial cells using two M. bovis strains. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>Both strains of M. bovis were able to adhere to all bovine epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The adherence rate was in the range of previous studies (Sachse et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 2003a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>However, our quantitation protocol has the advantage of not requiring specialized training or waste management as is necessary when experiments involve radioactive metabolic labeling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Both strains showed higher adherence to the cell line compared to primary cells (Figure 1) but JF4278 displayed higher adhesion rates than L22/93 to all three epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>These experiments did not reveal adhesion predilection of one strain to a specific cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>A previous study was also unable to associate adherence tropism of certain cells types to M. bovis isolates from different organs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Invasion of epithelial cells by M. bovis was assessed by two complementary methods, gentamicin protection assays and confocal fluorescence microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Both assays led to the identification of intracellular bacteria (Figures 3B, 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>These findings support previous in vitro and in vivo observations with epithelial cells from the respiratory tract (Rodríguez et al., 1996; Maeda et al., 2003; Bürki et al., 2015b; Suleman et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>However, M. bovis was not detected in the cytosol of epithelial cells of the udder collected from pathological material (Stanarius et al., 1981; Radaelli et al., 2011), while invasion of bMec cells was observed (Figures 3B, 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>The in vivo relevance of invasion of epithelial mammary gland cells has not yet been defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the “severe mastitis phenotype” is not associated with differential invasiveness of the two tested M. bovis strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>However, after 54 h of co-infection with bMec cells in the gentamicin protection assay, the L22/93 strain has a significant lower titer compared to JF4278 (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>This significant difference in titers between the two strains was found to be more prominent in co-culture with bMec cells compared to the other cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>This cannot be explained by the reaching of a growth plateau. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Indeed, at the same time point without supplementation of gentamicin, approximately 105 L22/93 were recovered (Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no statistically relevant differences were observed in the cytotoxic effect of both strains toward bMec cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be necessary to assess if this discrepancy is a true variation in generation time between the two strains in co-culture with bMec cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed M. bovis inside and outside bovine cells (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>In a previous study using a similar protocol, no extracellular mycoplasmas were detected after the initial treatment of cells with gentamicin (Bürki et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy observed between the two studies might be explained by technical reasons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>In the present study a rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against PG45T was used as primary antibody, while in the previous study a mouse monoclonal IgG1 primary antibody was used (Bürki et al., 2015b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>The polyclonal serum might be more sensitive than monoclonal antibodies since it targets more epitopes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the previous experiments were performed using epifluorescence and not confocal microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether the mycoplasmas detected outside cells after the gentamicin treatment evaded cells and reattached, as suggested with the closely related M. agalactiae, or if they derive from lysed eukaryotic cells (Hegde et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>After 24 h of infection with M. bovis, cytotoxicity was slightly increased in all the cell types (Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Therefore, cell disruption cannot be ruled out as a source of extracellular mycoplasmas after 54 h of infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Collectively, the confocal fluorescence microscopy shows occasional intracellular localization of M. bovis in epithelial cell types and confirms the results from the gentamicin protection assay. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>Strain L22/93 showed a higher cytotoxic effect toward PECT cells and induced more apoptosis in MDBK cells compared to bMec cells (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>Although this is not definitive evidence, it might be linked to the reduced growth of L22/93 in co-culture with bMec cells (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>Indeed, lower mycoplasma counts during infection could lead to decreased severity of the disease (Nilsson et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>In in vivo experiments, low infectious doses of M. bovis produced significantly fewer lung lesions and cytopathic effects compared to high infectious doses (Prysliak et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="394" pm="."><plain>Similarly, another in vitro study showed that high M. bovis counts reduced viability and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PBMCs (Gondaira et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="395" pm="."><plain>Additionally, an M. bovis encoded secretory nuclease was shown to induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in Bomac cells (Zhang et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="396" pm="."><plain>The growth rate of specific strains of M. bovis in organs or cells might be a relevant parameter in the development of lesions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="397" pm="."><plain>However, JF4278 did not significantly alter viability of infected cells (Figure 6A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="398" pm="."><plain>Since JF4278 generally reaches higher titers than strain L22/93 in co-culture with epithelial cells (Figure 3B), a sole dependency on the amount of mycoplasmas on the reduction of cell viability is questionable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="399" pm="."><plain>Additionally, bMec cells were found to be contaminated with BVDV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="400" pm="."><plain>Although interactions with BVDV cannot be totally excluded, a previous study showed that co-infection with BVDV in Bomac cells did not substantially change cell invasion, mycoplasmal growth or cytotoxicity after infection with M. bovis (Bürgi et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="401" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytotoxicity was slightly but often not significantly increased after infection with M. bovis in all cell types (Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="402" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, apoptosis was induced in MDBK cells infected with L22/93. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="403" pm="."><plain>However, induction of apoptosis was found to be unchanged in primary epithelial cells infected with either strain of M. bovis (Figure 6C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="404" pm="."><plain>Therefore, other cell death routes might be of importance for M. bovis infected epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="405" pm="."><plain>Bacterial infections were shown to trigger caspase-1 associated pyroptosis and TNF-induced necrosis (Blériot and Lecuit, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="406" pm="."><plain>Additionally, activated caspase-1 is involved in the cleavage and activation of pro-IL1-β and pro-IL-18 (Blériot and Lecuit, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="407" pm="."><plain>Since, epithelial cells were shown to be the source of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL1-β after infection with M. bovis (Zbinden et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Gondaira et al., 2018), these cell death routes could be of importance for infected epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="408" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity due to M. bovis was not as evident as with M. mycoides mycoides (Pilo et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="409" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was tested to assess if cell death might be concealed/obscured by increased cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="410" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was not increased by M. bovis compared to uninfected cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="411" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cytotoxicity measured was not associated with cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="412" pm="."><plain>However, low concentrations of JF4278 increased proliferation of primary epithelial cells significantly compared to uninfected cells (Figures 7C,D), but when cells are associated with large amounts of mycoplasmas the proliferative effect is lost. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="413" pm="."><plain>High amounts of strain L22/93 associated with cells even led to an anti-proliferative response of primary epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>The same observation was also previously made with PBMCs (Suleman et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>However, the in vivo relevance of this finding is not clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study showed no adherence predilection to specific epithelial cells associated with strains JF4278 and L22/93. M. bovis is able to invade different epithelial cells in vitro, including epithelial mammary gland cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>However, no differences in invasion rates were observed between the two strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a dose dependent effect of M. bovis on proliferation of primary epithelial cells was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>Strain L22/93 showed less severe cytopathic effects on bMec cells compared to MDBK and PECT cells and this could be linked to the bacterial titers measured in co-culture with the respective epithelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>However, a direct link between bacterial titers reached during gentamicin protection assays and the reduced viability of PECT and MDBK cells would require further proof. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>Future studies should focus on the induction of cell death pathways in different infected cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two recently published genomics studies characterized several factors potentially related to M. bovis virulence (Parker et al., 2016; Rasheed et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
