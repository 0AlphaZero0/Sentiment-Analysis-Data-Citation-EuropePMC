<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>We chose to investigate the m-TORC1/2 inhibitor in the context of weekly paclitaxel, as this regimen is often used in the setting of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [9], and taxanes are commonly used in the treatment of platinum-resistant NSCLC (with comparable efficacy between weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel and better tolerability profile) [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Toxicities of fatigue, nausea, anaemia, and diarrhoea in this dose-escalation cohort were not dissimilar to previous studies combining m-TOR inhibitors such as everolimus [12], ridaforolimus [13], or the m-TORC1/2 inhibitor, MLN028 [14], with weekly paclitaxel regimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Hyperglycaemia, which has been commonly reported with m-TOR inhibitors, occurred at a very low incidence in our study [all grades: N = 8 (11%), grade 3/4: N = 1(1%)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>It was noted that many earlier studies were in breast cancer, where weekly paclitaxel is often used as standard-of-care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Of interest, in our study, patients with heavily pre-treated HGSOC tolerated vistusertib at 50 mg bd 3 days per week in combination with weekly paclitaxel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>However, patients with sqNSCLC needed a dose reduction of vistusertib to 25 mg bd 3 days per week. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Patients with sqNSCLC often exhibit risk factors and co-morbidities that correlate with poor tolerance of chemotherapy such as hypoxia, a history of smoking, and pulmonary fibrosis [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported on the increased risk of infections of patients treated with PI3K pathway inhibitors used as part of combination therapy [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>In our experience, this is the first time that it has been necessary to recommend two separate doses for different tumour types within the same study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>The PK profile of vistusertib was not significantly different from previous reports in single-agent studies [5] and was no different when administered alone or in combination with paclitaxel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The pharmacodynamic profile of vistusertib in PRP showed administration of vistusertib led to abrogation of AKTSer473 phosphorylation, providing proof-of-principle of the desired biological effect of inhibiting the PI3K–Akt-m-TOR pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes of patients receiving the combination of weekly paclitaxel and vistusertib in this non-randomised phase I expansion were encouraging for the patient groups explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>In the ovarian cohort, the three median lines of previous treatment were: 12% of patients were platinum-refractory, 48% had progressed within 6 months of the last platinum treatment, and 96% had progressed within a year of their last platinum treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, the RECIST and CA125 response rates were 52% and 64%, respectively, with a progression-free interval of 5.8 months, which is better than historic data reported for the use of weekly paclitaxel therapy [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>The control chemotherapy arm of a contemporary phase III study studying the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in the setting of 2nd or 3rd line chemotherapy in a platinum-resistant disease state achieved a response rate of 12% and progression-free survival was 3.9 months [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>The results of the TAX-TORC study have led to a randomised phase II study of weekly paclitaxel versus paclitaxel and vistusertib, which is ongoing (ISRCTN16426935) [18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>The standard-of-care of sqNSCLC changed with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors with response rates of ∼15% in patient cohorts not selected for PD-L1 expression confirmed by randomised control trials [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>In the TAX-TORC study, at the tolerated doses of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2/week) and vistusertib (25 mg bd 3/7 days), the response rate and progression-free survival was 35% and 5.8 months, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>These data exceed traditional outcomes for the sqNSCLC population beyond first-line therapy and demonstrate potential for benefit and warrant further evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>A possible use of this regimen could be in the setting of patients with sqNSCLC who do not have expression of PD-L1 [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>We attempted to identify biomarkers of response to the combination by studying a panel of 67 genes that were known to be commonly mutated in HGSOC [21] and sqNSCLC [22]. </plain></SENT>
