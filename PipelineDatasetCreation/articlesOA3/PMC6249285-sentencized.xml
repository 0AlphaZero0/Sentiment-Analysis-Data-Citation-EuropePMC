<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Despite the differences between the bilin-type chromophores (biliverdin (BV) vs. phytochromobilin) and their covalent binding sites (PAS vs. GAF domain7) in bacterial and plant PCMs, the photoinduced processes that interconvert the two parent states Pr and Pfr follow similar pathways with spectrally distinguishable Lumi and Meta intermediates8,9.Fig. 1Domain arrangement and overview of the phytochrome photocycle. a Domain arrangement of different phytochromes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The photoconversions between the parent states Pr and Pfr14 are coupled to downstream signalling processes via the modulation of an attached output module, typically a histidine kinase15,16. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Coupling starts in the last step of the respective photoconversion with the formation of a Meta intermediate17 and comprises a secondary structure transition in a sensor-output interconnecting region, the PHY tongue18,19 (Fig. 1b), which probably represents a reaction pattern common to all phytochromes18–20. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Also, structural details of the chromophore pocket are very similar, including the ZZEssa stereochemistry of BV and the exocyclic double bond of ring A of the chromophore, which results in sp3 hybridization of the C2 atom and therefore an out-of-plane oriented bond to the methyl group at this position. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In this sense, the Gln190-Trp440 couple may represent a trigger for the reorganization of the tongue (group III structural changes), which takes place in at least two steps, starting with the reorganization of the loop-coil region as observed in Mol A of the Meta-F state (Agp2-PAiRFP2) that precedes the transition of the α-helical segment to a β-sheet structure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Here the formation of the hydrophobic pocket for ring D via reorientation of Tyr165 and Phe192 and the hydrogen bonding interactions of Tyr165 with the rotated Arg202 via two new water molecules is a structural motif that can be deduced from the various Pr state structures of prototypical bacterial (Agp1-PCMSER13 of A. fabrum [PDB entry 5HSQ30], DrBphP-PCM of D. radiodurans [e.g. PDB entry 4Q0J18]) and cyanobacterial (Cph1-PCM of Synechocystis sp. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Also in plant phytochrome AtPhyB-PCM of A. thaliana (PDB entry 4OUR32) in its (dark adapted) Pr state, very similar rotameric states of the corresponding amino acids were found although the two water molecules between the Tyr and Arg residues were not resolved in that structure due to the low resolution (3.4 Å) (Fig. 7f–i). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>In the Pfr structures of the bathy phytochrome PaBphP and the prototypical phytochrome of DrBphP, the conformations of all three amino acids (Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg202 in Agp2) are very similar to those observed in the present Pfr structures of Agp2-PCM and Agp2-PAiRFP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these results, alternating conformations of Tyr165, Phe192 and Arg211 (numbering of Agp2) have been observed in the mixed Pr/Pfr state crystals of the Q188L PaBphP variant29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the reorientation of the chromophore-binding Cys is not restricted to Agp2 since all known structures show an α-facial and β-facial orientation of the chromophore-binding Cys in Pr and Pfr, respectively (Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In view of these findings, we hypothesize that the group II structural changes are a common mechanistic element for the Pfr→Pr phototransformations of all phytochromes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The group III structural changes refer to the structural transition of the tongue and its initiation by Gln190/Trp440. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Here we note similarities in the structural data for the prototypical DrBphP18 since His201 undergoes a comparable conformational change as its counterpart Gln190 in Agp2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Trp451 of DrBphP (Trp440 in Agp2), which is resolved in three of the four molecules within the asymmetric unit of the Pfr-like structure, shows different conformations, which one may take as an indication for an increased flexibility at this position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the tongue region is also not completely resolved. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>After the secondary structure transition of the tongue is completed, the domain arrangement within the PCM is changed as well18–20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>These major conformational changes in the protein, which occur during the transfer from the Meta intermediate to the final product of the phototransformation, were proposed to affect the structure and thus the activity status of the output module. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>The present results, however, do not provide any information about these final steps of the photoinduced reaction cascade and the role of the output module in signalling, folding and back reaction as shown by other experiments (e.g. refs. 8,32–35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>This is also true for the possible role of dimerization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In this context, we wish to point out that the organization of monomers within the crystal packing do not allow for any conclusions about functionally relevant and concentration-dependent protein–protein interactions in solution, specifically when, as in the present case, surface residues have been substituted (e.g. ref. 30). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we have presented the crystal structure of an intermediate that is placed in a key position for coupling the photoconversion of the photoreceptor module with the (de-)activation of the output module. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In view of similar structural motifs, the proposed general mechanistic model for the Pfr→Pr photoconversion of the bathy phytochrome Agp2, as summarized in Fig. 9, may also hold for prototypical phytochromes, in line with previous suggestions for the Pr→Pfr photoconversion18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>With the structural and spectroscopic data presented here, we are getting closer to identifying the mechanistic features that are common to the photocycles in both prototypical and bathy phytochromes towards a general scheme with small subtype-specific differences. </plain></SENT>
