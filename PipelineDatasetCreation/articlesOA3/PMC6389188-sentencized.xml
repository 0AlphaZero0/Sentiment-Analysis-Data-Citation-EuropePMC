</text></title><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors (TFs) are essential for the regulation of precise and coordinate gene expression via activating and/or repressing transcription in response to various endogenous and environmental signals, which plays crucial roles in the regulation of gene networks for many important developmental processes and defense responses in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>TFs are usually classified into different families based on the sequence of DNA-binding domains and other conserved motifs [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP)-box genes encode a family of plant-specific TFs that contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain of 76 amino acids called the SBP domain [2, 3], which can form two tandem zinc fingers (Cys-Cys-His-Cys and Cys-Cys-Cys-His), and possesses a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus partially overlapping with the second zinc finger [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The SBP domain is involved in both nuclear import and binding to a consensus DNA sequence with a GTAC core motif and gene-specific flanking regions [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>AmSBP1 and AmSBP2 are the first SBP-domain proteins discovered in plants, which were isolated from Antirrhinum majus in an in vitro approach and named after their binding ability to the promoter of the floral meristem identity gene SQUAMOSA [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Since then, SBP-box genes have been found in diverse plant species, including single-celled green algae, mosses, gymnosperms, and angiosperms [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genome-wide identified and analysis of the whole gene family were reported recently in some species, such as Arabidopsis [9, 10], rice [3], tomato [11], grape [12], apple [13], castor bean [14], Populus [15], Citrus [16], Gossypium [17], pepper [18], tobacco [19], oilseed rape [20], soybean [21], and moso bamboo [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, there are 16 SBP-LIKE (SPL) genes, which can be categorized into eight clades based on the amino acid sequence of their conserved SBP domain: AtSPL1/12/14/16, AtSPL2/10/11, AtSPL3/4/5, AtSPL6, AtSPL7, AtSPL8, AtSPL9/15, and AtSPL13 [3, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Among them, ten genes from five clades (AtSPL2/10/11, AtSPL3/4/5, AtSPL6, AtSPL9/15 and AtSPL13) are targeted by miR156 [3, 23], an evolutionarily highly conserved miRNA in plants that plays master function of regulating the transition from the juvenile to the adult phase of vegetative development (vegetative phase change) [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>SPL genes control many aspects of plant development and physiology, including the vegetative phase change, flowering time, leaf initiation, shoot and inflorescence branching, fruit development and ripening, floral organ development and fertility, pollen sac development, trichome development, root development, and stress responses [8, 9, 26–28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Recent studies provide a detailed picture of the function of miR156-targeted SPL genes in Arabidopsis: AtSPL2/9/10/11/13/15 contribute to both the juvenile-to-adult phase transition (vegetative phase change) and the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition (reproductive phase change or flowering), with AtSPL9/13/15 being more important than SPL2/10/11 [9]; AtSPL3/4/5 were previously reported to redundantly promote flowering through direct activation of LEAFY (LFY), FRUITFUL (FUL), and APETALA1 (AP1) [29], and they may act synergistically with the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-FD module to induce flowering under long-day (LD) condition [30], whereas a recent study suggested that AtSPL3/4/5 don’t play a major role in vegetative phase change or flowering, but promote the floral meristem identity transition [9]; AtSPL6 does not have a major function in vegetative morphogenesis [9], it can positively regulate a subset of defense genes, however, and plays a role in effector-triggered immunity [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Among the miR156 non-targeted SPL genes, AtSPL7 is a central regulator of copper (Cu) homeostasis and play a major role in cadmium (Cd) response [32, 33]. AtSPL8 was found to be a tissue-dependent regulator in GA signaling and regulate early anther development and gynoecium differential patterning in concert with multiple miR156 targeted SPL genes, as well as trichome formation on sepals, stamen filament elongation, and root growth [34–37]. AtSPL14 gene may function to delay phase transition [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par16"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Studies in other species revealed that SPL genes underwent an extensive neofunctionalization during their evolution. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Only one recent study functionally characterized two petunia SPL genes, PhSBP1 and PhSBP2, which showed that they have overlapping but divergent functions in the reproductive transition and leaf initiation rate [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Recently, the whole-genome sequencing was achieved for inbred derivatives of two wild Petunia species, P. axillaris N and P. inflata S6 [50], which provides a good opportunity to study the important gene family of TFs on a genome-wide scale. P. hybrida was considered to be originated from the hybridization of two biological species, one with erect habit and white flowers (P. axillaris), and the other with decumbent stems and purple flowers (P. integrifolia). P. inflata was previously considered as a synonym of P. integrifolia, and subsequently as a subspecies under P. integrifolia (P. integrifolia Subsp. inflata), but a recent study accepted it as distinct from P. integrifolia with the unfolded and straight calyx lobes as useful diagnostic characters [51]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Recently, phylogenetic reconstruction with 104 full length SBP-box protein sequences from five species including moss, Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and maize demonstrated that the SBP-box genes form two lineages (group I and II) through an early duplication event, and the latter is further divided into two distinct subgroups (subgroup II-1 and II-2) caused by several rounds of duplication [55]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>In this work, the SPL genes were identified from four Petunia species at genome or transcriptome scale, followed by cloning and sequencing of the orthologs from a hybrid petunia line W115. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to several other species in Solanaceae family, including tomato [11], pepper [18], and potato [57], Petunia appears to contain a larger number of SPL genes (21 vs. 15), suggesting possible more duplication events of SPL genes in Petunia genome or faster loss of some members in other Solanaceae species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Similarly, there are much more Group IV SPL members in Petunia than in Arabidopsis, five vs. one, suggesting these duplicated genes must undergo fast subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization, and may play redundant but divergent functions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>Usually, the gene functions are expected to correlate in a large extent with their expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>In this study, the expression of PhSPL genes in various tissues were investigated by qPCR analysis, which indicated PhSPLs exhibited distinct expression patterns in terms of specificity and expression level (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>Similar to the results from many other species, where SPL genes exhibited higher expression levels in the shoot apices (apical buds), inflorescences (panicles), and flower buds [11, 13, 60], most PhSPLs expressed predominantly in the axillary buds, inflorescences, and/or flower buds (Fig. 7), suggesting they might be involved in the development of these organs in petunia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>There is no obvious correlation between gene structures and expression patterns, although some genes within the same group demonstrated similar expression profiles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>SPL Group I and II genes are characterized by their large size and lack of miR156 and miR157-binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that these two groups of SPL genes were almost ubiquitously expressed across different plant organs [8, 55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>For instance, SlySBP7, the Group I gene in tomato, is expressed in seedlings, roots, stems, leaves, vegetative shoot apices, inflorescences, flowers, and fruits [11]; the four Arabidopsis Group II genes, AtSPL1, AtSPL12, AtSPL14, and AtSPL16, are expressed wildly in seedlings, roots, rosette and cauline leaves, shoot apical meristem, flowers, and fruits [3, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>Petunia Group I (PhSPL7) and Group II (PhSPL12a/b/c/d) genes also showed ubiquitous expression in all tested tissues, although they were expressed most strongly in different tissues, and PhSPL12c exhibited much lower expression levels than other genes (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Currently, the only functional analysis of Group I genes is limited to Arabidopsis SPL7 (AtSPL7), which was characterized to play a pivotal role in the regulation of copper homeostasis [32]. PhSPL7 may have similar functions to AtSPL7 based on their conserved gene structures and expression patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>Functional data for Group II genes exist for two members, PpSBP2 and AtSPL14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>Like AtSPL7, PpSBP2 is involved in the regulation of copper homeostasis in Phycomitrella patens [61], while AtSPL14 is involved in response to the fungal toxin fumonisin B1 (FB1) and may also function to delay the juvenile to adult transition [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Functional diversification in Group II make the function prediction of PhSPL12a/b/c/d genes unreliable, while their expression patterns suggest that they should play redundant roles in regulating the development of axillary buds, inflorescences and/or flowers, with PhSPL12c may also in cotyledon development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>It might also be of interest to investigate if PhSPL12a to PhSPL12d are associated with programmed cell death in response to the FB1 in petunia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Group III SPL genes also lack the miR156/157-binding site, although short relative to Group I and II genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>The first Group III gene to be functionally characterized was AtSPL8 in Arabidopsis, which is a tissue-dependent regulator of GA response and regulate early anther development and gynoecium differential patterning, trichome formation on sepals, stamen filament elongation, and root growth [34–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>High expression of the AtSPL8 orthologs SlySBP8a and SlySBP8b in inflorescences, carpels, and young fruits but very low in roots, seedlings, and stamens of tomato suggests at least partial conservation of function in gynoecium differentiation [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>In maize and rice, AtSPL8 ortholog (LG1 and OsLG1, respectively) is involved in development of the ligule and auricule [42, 43], and controls the branch angle of tassel and panicle, respectively [44–46]. PhSPL8 was expressed more highly in inflorescences, flower buds, and young fruits versus other tissues, suggesting it may play partial conserved roles in inflorescence, anther and gynoecium development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Group IV contains only one SPL gene (AtSPL6) in Arabidopsis, but three genes (SlySBP6a/b/c) in tomato, five genes (PhSPL6a/b/c/d/e) in petunia (Fig. 2), five genes (PpSBP3/6/6b/13/14) in Phycomitrella, and no orthologs in the fully sequenced genomes of rice and other grasses [8], suggesting a loss of this gene lineage at least in some monocots and differential duplication and expansion in different species. AtSPL6 and its ortholog NbSPL6 of Nicotiana benthamiana play a conserved role in the TIR-NB-LRR receptor-mediated plant innate immunity [31], while the function of PpSBP3 was characterized to repress reproduction development [62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In petunia, expression of the five Group IV SPL genes suggests divergence of function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Similar to AtSPL6 and SlySBP6a [10, 11], PhSPL6a and PhSPL6b were expressed constitutively across the plant, but PhSPL6a expressed predominantly in axillary buds, flower buds, and roots while PhSPL6b expressed mainly in roots, inflorescences, and axillary buds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>By contrast, PhSPL6c and PhSPL6d expression was somewhat tissue-specific and confined primarily to the axillary buds and inflorescences; PhSPL6e showed very low expression and mainly in axillary buds, bracts and cotyledons (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The additional duplications of SPL6 in petunia also suggest functional redundancy, which need to be characterized yet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Group V contains three SPL genes (AtSPL2, AtSPL10, and AtSPL11) in Arabidopsis, while only one member (PhSPL2) exists in petunia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Recent studies demonstrated that AtSPL2/10/11 have overlapping functions in promoting vegetative phase change and flowering [9]. AtSPL2 might also control floral organ development and plant fertility by directly regulating ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 (AS2) expression [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that PhSPL2 was expressed mainly in bracts and inflorescences, which is different from the constitutive expression of AtSPL2/10/11 and tomato orthologs SlySBP2 and SlySBP10 [11, 63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>The special expression pattern of PhSPL2 suggests a distinct function from Arabidopsis genes, which remains to be revealed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>AtSPL3/4/5 are Group VI SPL genes in Arabidopsis, which were previously considered to redundantly promote vegetative phase change and flowering based on the overexpression data [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Recent detailed analysis of spl mutants, however, revealed that AtSPL3/4/5 play a major role in floral meristem identity transition rather than in vegetative morphogenesis or flowering induction [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Similar to Arabidopsis, the single AtSPL3/4/5 ortholog AmSBP1 in snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) is involved in initiating flower development after the switch to inflorescence development; silencing of AmSBP1 also causes an increase in vegetative branching under long days [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the tomato AtSPL3 ortholog CNR is required for fruit ripening [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In petunia, there are five Group VI SPL genes, PhSPL3, PhSPL4a, PhSPL4b, PhSPL4c, and PhCNR, with significantly different expression patterns and levels (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>A recent study demonstrated that PhSBP1 (PhSPL3) and PhSBP2 (PhSPL4c) differentially promote discrete stages of the reproductive transition, and PhSBP1, possibly also PhCNR, accelerates leaf initiation rate [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the relatively high expression of PhSPL3 and PhSPL4c in axillary buds, inflorescences, and late stage of shoot apices (Fig. 7) [49]. PhCNR also expressed mainly in axillary buds, however, our sequence analysis demonstrated that PhCNR, as well as PaCNR and PiCNR, is likely to be pseudogene due to nucleotide change or deletion mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Compared with PhSPL3 and PhSPL4c, PhSPL4a and PhSPL4b showed much lower expression, especially PhSPL4a that only expressed very faintly in inflorescence and cotyledon (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The differential expression was also found in tomato Group VI SPL genes, SlySBP3, SlySBP4, and CNR [11], suggesting divergent and elusive evolution of functions in this group. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Expression and functional data demonstrated that Group VII SPL genes were involved in various aspects of above ground plant development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>In Arabidopsis, the single SPL Group VII gene AtSPL13 has been implicated in the regulation of the post-germinative switch from the cotyledon stage to the vegetative-leaf stage [65]; it also plays overlapping roles with SPL2/10/11 and SPL9/15 in promoting vegetative and reproductive phase change [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the AtSPL13 ortholog in maize and rice, TGA1 and OsSPL16, is involved in ear glume development [39] and controls grain size, shape and quality, respectively [40, 41], suggesting divergent functional evolution of the Group VII SPL genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Different from AtSPL13 that is expressed highly in the hypocotyl, shoot apical meristem, leaf primordia, and developing inflorescence [9, 65], PhSPL13 expressed mainly in inflorescence and bract in petunia (Fig. 7), suggesting it might have distinct functions from AtSPL13. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Similar to AtSPL2/10/11, AtSPL9 and AtSPL15 belonging to Group VIII also contribute to both the vegetative and reproductive phase change, and play more important role than SPL2/10/11 [9]. AtSPL9 was also suggested to be involved in petal trichome initiation, anthocyanin pigment accumulation, and sesquiterpene biosynthesis [66–68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The genome-wide analysis indicated that petunia contains three Group VIII SPL genes, PhSPL9a, PhSPL9b, and PhSPL9c. The expression of PhSPL9a and PhSPL9c was mainly in the inflorescences, while PhSPL9b was expressed constitutively in all tissues, although with relatively low expression levels (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of PhSPL9a or PhSPL9b in Arabidopsis resulted in early flowering with significantly reduced number of rosette leaves, suggesting PhSPL9a and PhSPL9b may have conserved functions in promoting the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>However, differential expression pattern between PhSPL9a and PhSPL9b implied their distinct functions in petunia, which awaits to be characterized in the future. </plain></SENT>
