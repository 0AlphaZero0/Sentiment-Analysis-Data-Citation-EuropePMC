</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are acquired, neoplastic disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective and dysplastic myeloid cell differentiation, in particular dyserythropoiesis leading to anemia in more than 80% of cases.1 The main prognostic factors in MDS, which define the risk of MDS progression to acute myeloid leukemia and patients’ survival, include the number and importance of cytopenias as well as the percentage of bone marrow blasts and the cytogenetic abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These factors are combined in a recently revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R).2 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For lower-risk MDS, essentially characterized by anemia related to ineffective erythropoiesis, first-line treatments generally include (in the absence of the 5q chromosomal deletion) erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) (mainly epoetins and darbepoetin) with or without granulocyte - colony - stimulating factors to improve anemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Subsequent treatments include lenalidomide, hypomethylating agents, luspatercept and other investigational drugs (APG-101, imetelstat, etc.). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The response rate to ESA according to International Working Group 2006 criteria [i.e. erythroid hematologic improvement (HI-E), including red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence or an increase of hemoglobin level &gt;1.5 g/dL] is approximately 50% for patients with favorable prognostic factors, with a median response duration of 20 to 24 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Our results, confirmed by other groups, suggest that this treatment does not increase the risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia and improves overall survival.3,4 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Known prognostic factors for a favorable response to ESA in MDS patients include early stage disease, serum erythropoietin (sEPO) levels below 500 U/L and no or low requirement for RBC transfusion,5 while trilineage dysplasia may be associated with a lower response rate to ESA and/or shorter duration of response.6 We also found that a score based on IPSS-R, serum ferritin level and sEPO concentration can efficiently predict the response,7 while patients with mutations in at least three genes have a lower response rate.8 The mechanisms of primary resistance or loss of response are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Relapse may be explained in only 25% to 30% of patients by a detectable progression of MDS with, as shown by worsening of cytopenias other than anemia, increasing numbers of bone marrow blasts or frank progression to acute myeloid leukemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis may, therefore, help to predict the response to ESA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Over the past 20 years, new approaches in multipara-meter flow cytometry have contributed to the diagnosis of MDS by quantifying myeloblasts, hematogones and dysgranulopoiesis using the Ogata score.9–13 However, few studies have specifically addressed the late stages of erythroid differentiation.10,14 The flow cytometry RED score10 was developed as a whole bone marrow flow cytometry protocol using the nuclear dye CyTRAK orange to gate nucleated cells without lysing red blood cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The RED score is based on the evaluation of dyserythropoiesis with CD71 and CD36 coefficient of variation values and hemoglobin levels according to gender. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It ranges from 0 to 7, with a RED score ≥3 predicting MDS with a sensitivity of 77.5% and a specificity of 90%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>By combining the RED and the Ogata scores, the sensitivity can reach 87.9% and the specificity 88.9%.10 Interestingly, ineffective erythropoiesis has been correlated with high levels of serum growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily that is produced by erythroid precursors at the end of the differentiation process.15,16 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Upon chronic RBC transfusions, patients with lower-risk MDS may develop iron overload. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>A greater insight into iron homeostasis in MDS patients can be obtained by monitoring specific markers of iron metabolism including hepcidin, in correlation with ferritin and levels of transferrin saturation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In this trial, we aimed to find biomarkers predicting response to epoetin zeta in patients with lower-risk MDS and to use these to evaluate the efficacy of a biosimilar drug to epoetin alfa in such patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>The findings of this study suggest that epoetin zeta is as effective as other ESA3,4 in this group of patients with lower-risk MDS with relatively favorable characteristics (only 28% of them were transfusion-dependent and their median sEPO level was relatively low), with a HI-E response rate of 47.6% and a median duration of response of 26.1 months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin.20,21 The two major results of our study are that a low hepcidin:ferritin ratio and a high RED score were predictive of lower HI-E, while GDF-15 &gt;2000 pg/mL and hepcidin:ferritin &lt;9 could be predictive factors of shorter response duration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that iron homeostasis parameters and dyserythropoiesis have been observed to have a predictive value with regards to response to ESA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide, is produced mainly by hepatocytes and secreted into the plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>This peptide lowers the amount of iron in the serum by inhibiting iron export by ferroportin, a membrane-bound cellular iron exporter present on macrophages and at the basolateral site of enterocytes, which release iron into the circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin is suppressed by increased erythropoietic iron demand and is upregulated in the presence of increased iron levels or elevated body iron stores.22,23 In this study, a tendency to lower hepcidin:ferritin ratios was found in RARS patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, hepcidin suppression should lead to an increase of iron transport across the cell membrane and, therefore, greater delivery of iron to transferrin for the needs of increased erythropoiesis, but as MDS patients have ineffective erythropoiesis, hepcidin suppression actually results in iron overload and a potential toxicity to erythropoiesis with the Fenton reaction leading to an excess of reactive oxygen species particularly in RARS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>This suggests that erythropoiesis and iron homeostasis are tightly related and that dyserythropoiesis, as measured by the RED score, influences iron equilibrium by suppressing hepcidin and increasing iron absorption. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>The erythroid mediator GDF-15, produced in response to erythropoietin by erythroblasts, has been described as a potential suppressor of hepcidin expression.15 However, the correlation between GDF-15 and hepcidin levels was poor in studies in phlebotomized mice and in MDS patients.24,25 Recently, the role of GDF-15 in the regulation of hepcidin production in physiological and pathological settings has been challenged by the discovery of erythroferrone, which has been demonstrated to be the real suppressor of hepcidin.26 GDF-15 levels are elevated in thalassemia and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, two disorders with a high degree of ineffective erythropoiesis15,16,27 and correlate with the severity of anemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>GDF-15 level is, therefore, more the reflection of erythroid precursor activity and a useful indicator of ineffective erythropoiesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Taken altogether, hepcidin suppression by increased erythropoietic activity appears to underlie the development of abnormal iron overload in anemia, independently of RBC transfusions and is strongly correlated with worse erythroid response to ESA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Hepcidin, routinely available in some countries, can be measured by mass spectrometry and international laboratories are working to uniform hepcidin analysis.28,29 This assay could also be used for MDS studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>To conclude, our results could lead to the use of hepcidin measurements to predict response to ESA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Patients with a low hepcidin:ferritin ratio, high RED score and high GDF-15 level may require other treatments than ESA alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>These treatments should aim at improving the use of iron in MDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>We recently showed potential positive effects of low doses of deferasirox in MDS patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that this drug quenches levels of reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of nuclear factor-κB in erythroblasts, which in turns induces proliferation of these cells and possible improvement of anemia.30 An ongoing clinical trial is investing the use of low-dose deferasirox in anemic patients with lower-risk MDS who have failed to respond to treatment with ESA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT03387475). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>Secondly, increasing hepcidin level could prevent further accumulation of iron and reduce iron-mediated tissue injury by redistributing iron from parenchymal tissues to macrophages where iron is less toxic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>A clinical trial with an agonist of hepcidin (LJPC-410) is ongoing in patients with β-thalassemia with myocardial iron overload (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT03381833). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>In patients with dysregulated iron homeostasis, hepcidin agonists or low-dose deferasirox could be considered in combination with ESA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>Concerning the RED score, the data are consistent with those of other flow cytometry scores described by the European LeukemiaNet predicting a lower response to ESA or hypomethylating agents in MDS patients.31–33 Flow cytometry techniques have been recommended by international expert panels for use in the diagnosis of MDS, particularly in order to measure dyserythropoiesis objectively.14,34 A French national survey on the practical use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of MDS showed that about 12 of the 50 French centers that routinely perform flow cytometry for the diagnosis of myeloid neoplasms use flow cytometry for the diagnosis of MDS and only four centers use the RED score (Orianne Wagner-Ballon, personal communication). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>However, if other larger studies confirm the usefulness of the RED score in the prediction of response to ESA, these techniques will be used more often in a practical way. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>To conclude, in our series, the flow cytometry RED score and hepcidin:ferritin ratio enabled identification of patients who would not respond to ESA, and GDF-15 levels and hepcidin:ferritin ratio predicted shorter duration of response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>These results warrant confirmation in larger series. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>In patients with MDS, other treatments aimed at restoring redox and iron homeostasis could efficiently improve the erythroid response. </plain></SENT>
