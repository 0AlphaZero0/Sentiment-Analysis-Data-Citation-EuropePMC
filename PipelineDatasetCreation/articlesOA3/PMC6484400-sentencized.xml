</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Breast cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease and one of the most common female cancers worldwide.1 Although great progress has been achieved in early diagnosis and systemic therapy of breast cancer in recent years, metastasis remains a major obstacle in the effective treatment of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In breast cancer, the role of NF‐E2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) in tumour growth is controversial and likely context dependent.2, 3 However, emerging evidence has indicated that increased activity can enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis is a key to develop novel therapeutic approaches to treat metastatic breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Redox status is a well‐recognized actor in the adaptation of cancer cells to therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Redox adaptation is important in cancer cells drug resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The transcription factor Nrf2 is the master regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective systems.4 The antioxidant response is principally mediated by the transcription factor Nrf2, which induces the transcriptional activation of several genes involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis, chemoresistance and cytoprotection.5 In recent years, accumulating evidence implies the importance of Nrf2 deregulation in tumourigenesis.5 Despite the recent progress in the characterization of Nrf2 transcription factors, biological functions of Nrf2 remain to be explored. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several types of cancer cells display a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to an aberrant metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction or activation of oncogenes.6 Under physiological conditions, Nrf2 localizes in the cytoplasm where it is bound by Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 (Keap1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Kelch‐like ECH‐associated protein 1 forms a complex with Cul3 and Rbx1, and this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can bind and ubiquitinate Nrf2, resulting in Nrf2 proteasomal degradation.7 The stabilized Nrf2 accumulates in nuclei, heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins and activates target genes for cytoprotection through the antioxidant response element (ARE)/electrophile response element (EpRE).8 The function of Nrf2 in chemoresistance has been demonstrated in diverse types of cancers, including cisplatin resistant bladder cancers.9 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The migration and invasion of tumour cells are crucial in cancer metastasis.10 Warburg effect is an important expression of tumour cell metabolic reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, tumour metabolic reprogramming occurs in many metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the Krebs cycle process.11 The PPP is irreplaceable in the rapid proliferation of tumour cells regarding the provision of raw materials for macromolecular biosynthesis and maintenance of cellular redox status.12 Recent studies have suggested that PPP is raised in many tumour cells, but maintenance of high hyperplastic in tumour cells through the PPP remains unanswered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Notch signalling pathway is a classical pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recent studies show that Notch pathway was involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and invasion.13 It should be noted that Nrf2 is related to Notch pathway.14 The synergy of Nrf2 and Notch pathway promotes survival rate of tumour cells, differentiation, invasion and metastasis in the condition of abnormal expression of Nrf2 and Notch pathway.15 It is possible that Nrf2 can adjust the Notch pathway through affecting the PPP and leads to a change in breast cancer cell proliferation and migration, and need to explore its mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this study, we demonstrate that Nrf2 leads to increased proliferation, migration, invasion in breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found, for the first time, a novel function of Nrf2 in the Notch1 signalling pathway via PPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Modulation of glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)/ Hypoxia inducing factor 1α (HIF‐1α) expression by Nrf2 is therefore involved in the Notch1 pathway‐mediated regulation proliferation, migration, invasion of breast cancer. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Metabolic reprogramming by transcription factor Nrf2 could contribute to the development of breast cancer.11 However, the mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression need further research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The present results show that Nrf2 overexpression promoted tumour proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB‐231, silencing of Nrf2 could suppress those cancer phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Nrf2 or knockdown of Keap1 increased the expression of G6PD, the rate‐limiting enzyme of PPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of Nrf2 increased the expression of Notch1 gene via G6PD/HIF‐1α. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The levels of HES‐1, Snail, E‐cadherin, N‐cadherin, the downstream gene of Notch1 pathway were changed by Notch1 up‐regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>There were opposite effects through knockdown of Nrf2 gene or overexpression of Keap1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that Nrf2 was proved to be a novel therapeutic target to breast cancer, which provide a new intervention targets for intervention of breast cancer metastasis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>NF‐E2‐related factor 2 is important in protection of oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>However, some studies have shown that the survival and development of cancer cells were promoted through excessive expression of Nrf2 and its target genes.22 Recent data suggest that the there are different degrees of Keap1 mutations in patients with lung cancer.23 Activation of Nrf2 can promote cell tumourigenicity, and knockdown of Nrf2 can inhibit tumour growth, metastasis and invasion.24 The target genes of Nrf2 are vital in tumour metastasis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The main function of heme oxygenase 1 (HO‐1), the main target gene of Nrf2, is to participate in maintaining cells redox equilibrium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It is reported that the survival rate of lung cancer patients with high level of HO‐1 is lower than patients with low expression of HO‐1.25 NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) is another gene activated by Nrf2 and also the key gene of oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Compared with no‐metastatic tumours, NQO1 in metastatic tumours showed higher expression.26 In this study, we observed that high levels of Nrf2 expression significantly correlated with higher proliferation and migration of breast cancers cells, all of which precludes shorter overall survival and a higher recurrence rate in breast cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that Nrf2 promotes breast cancer metastasis and may serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role in regulation of oxidative stress, Nrf2 also involves in the anabolic metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>NF‐E2‐related factor 2 directly activates six genes involved in PPP and NADPH production pathway, including G6PD, PGD, TKT, TALDO1 and malic enzyme 1 (ME1), through binding of this transcription factor to AREs of these gene promoters.11 The metabolic reprogramming provides energy and metabolites to facilitate rapid growth and proliferation of cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The PPP is important in promoting cancer proliferation, differentiation and survival.27 Overexpression of G6PD is a prognostic factor in multiple cancers and is associated with tumour progression, metastasis or recurrent disease.28 The oxidative PPP converts G6P, a glycolytic intermediate, into ribulose‐5‐phosphate and generates NADPH, which is used for GSH production, detoxification and biosynthesis of lipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Pentose phosphate pathway is up‐regulated in many types of tumours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The activities of G6PD and TKT, key PPP enzymes, were increased in cancer cells.29 In this work, we found that the two key PPP enzymes, G6PD and TKT, were up‐regulated in Nrf2‐overexpressed MCF‐7 and MDA‐MB‐231 cells, whereas ectopic overexpression of Keap1 and Nrf2 knockdown counteracts the increase of G6PD and TKT expressions in breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that PPP is activated in Nrf2‐overexpressed breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>In addition, targeting Nrf2 as a combination therapy/chemically induced synthetic lethality target, an approach that has shown excellent results for breast cancer therapy.30, 31 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>NF‐E2‐related factor 2 can interact with other signalling pathways key genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Notch pathway is one of them, Notch1 is crucial in cell survival, abnormal expression of Notch1 has been considered as a universal phenomenon in small cell lung cancer.34 NF‐E2‐related factor 2 can activate Notch1 and regulate the proliferation of haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs).35 The results are consistent with our findings that inhibition of Notch1 lowered the expression of its target genes HES‐1 and inhibited the tumour proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The invasion behaviour of malignant tumour is accompanied with loss of E‐cadherin, and increase of N‐cadherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>Cut Notch1 can reduce EMT pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Previous research has shown that Notch1 downstream gene expression is related to the EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with the results of our research that inhibition of Notch1 enhances the expression of E‐cadherin, but lowers the expression of Snail and N‐cadherin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the reduction of EMT pathway by Notch in breast cancer cells and the importance of Notch1 in breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>A model of Nrf2‐mediated Notch1 activation via G6PD/HIF‐1α axis in breast cancer cells has been shown in Figure 8. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>In summary, our findings suggest that Nrf2 contributes to metastatic ability of basal type breast cancer cells through G6PD/HIF‐1α/Notch1 signalling axis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Nrf2‐dependent G6PD/HIF‐1α activation provokes Notch1 signalling by up‐regulation of Jagged1 and Hes1, thereby promoting EMT in breast cancer cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Further study on Nrf2/G6PD/HIF‐1α/Notch1 signalling axis is demanded for realization of basal type breast cancer treatment. </plain></SENT>
