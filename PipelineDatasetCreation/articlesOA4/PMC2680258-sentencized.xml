<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A strikingly intermediate filament (IF)-like cytoskeleton, composed of crescentin, is also present in Caulobacter crescentus and determines its specific cell shape. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Research of the two past decades has revealed that bacterial cells are architecturally surprisingly complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bacteria, like eukaryotes, use protein filaments for spatial organization of their cells, and a large variety of cytoskeletal elements has already been identified in bacteria (Graumann, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Best studied of these are the FtsZ-and MreB-family proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily related to tubulin and actin of eukaryotic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>FtsZ and MreB are widespread and conserved in bacteria and fulfil important functions, including spatial orchestration of cell division, growth and morphogenesis [recently reviewed in Michie and Lowe (2006),Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner (2007),Graumann (2007),Harold (2007),Pichoff and Lutkenhaus (2007),Thanbichler and Shapiro (2008)]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The morphogenetic function of the bacterial cytoskeleton appears to depend greatly on its ability to recruit and spatially organize proteins involved in the synthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan (PG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>PG consists of long glycan strands cross-linked by short peptide side-chains into one huge molecule encasing the cell and functions as an exoskeleton to maintain cell shape and to withstand turgor pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At the same time, turgor pressure may act as a driving force in cell wall expansion during growth (Koch, 1985; Harold, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Thus, according to this model, growth and morphogenesis are intimately coupled in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>By allowing cell wall expansion only at certain positions dictated by cytoskeletal structures and driven by turgor pressure (and\or other forces), different shapes can be generated (Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner, 2007; Harold, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The helical cytoskeletal structure formed in vivo by the bacterial actin MreB defines a cylinder and thus determines the common rod shape of many bacteria (Jones et al., 2001; Kruse et al., 2003; Figge et al., 2004; Dye et al., 2005; Carballido-Lopez, 2006; Carballido-Lopez et al., 2006; Divakaruni et al., 2007; Mohammadi et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Ends of the cell cylinder are capped by hemispherical poles, generated by a cell division process guided by the action of bacterial tubulin FtsZ, which forms a constricting ring structure at the cell division site (Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991; Daniel and Errington, 2003; Varma and Young, 2004; Margolin, 2005; Aaron et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cocci generally do not contain MreB and are made up of two poles created by FtsZ-directed cell division (Jones et al., 2001; Pinho and Errington, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the cell shape arsenal of bacteria contains much more than just spheres and straight rods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Obviously, other spatial organizers besides MreB and FtsZ must exist in bacteria to determine more complicated forms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A step further in understanding bacterial morphogenesis was the identification of the intermediate filament (IF)-like protein crescentin in an aquatic bacterium with a characteristic crescent-like cell shape, Caulobacter crescentus (Ausmees et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The laterally localized crescentin cytoskeleton converts the FtsZ-and MreB-dependent simple straight rod into a curved or helical rod, depending on the length of the cell (Ausmees et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, despite the remarkable architectural and biochemical relatedness of crescentin to IF proteins, a sequence similarity search failed to reveal crescentin homologues in other bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Thus, the additional morphogenetic factors in other MreB\FtsZ-bacteria with complex shapes remain to be uncovered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="?"><plain>How general is the above outlined morphogenetic model based on the actions of MreB, FtsZ and additional cytoskeletal elements, such as crescentin? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, at least one large and important group of bacteria, the actinomycetes, seem to use a different modus operandi for cell growth and morphogenesis that is independent of MreB and FtsZ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>These bacteria grow in a polarized fashion: rod-shaped species, such as Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium assemble new cell wall at both cell poles, while filamentous ones, such as Streptomyces, grow by hyphal tip extension analogously to how filamentous fungi grow (Daniel and Errington, 2003; Flärdh, 2003a,Flb; Ramos et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2007; Letek et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The actinomycetes exhibit extraordinary diversity, regarding their morphology (from simple coccoid to complex branching and multicellular filaments), lifestyle (e.g. pathogenic like Mycobacterium or symbiotic like Frankia), physiology, metabolism (e.g. production of a multitude of secondary metabolites by Streptomyces) and colonization of various environmental niches (Ventura et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The coiled coil protein DivIVA seems to have an important role in generation of polarity in these bacteria (Flärdh, 2003a; Letek et al., 2008), but other than that, the molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse morphologies of actinomycetes are relatively poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of the main objectives of the present study was to investigate the incidence of the IF-like function in bacteria, prompted by the intriguing observation that crescentin, the bacterial counterpart of metazoan IF, did not appear to be conserved in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="?"><plain>Was acquisition of crescentin by C. crescentus just an isolated event or might a similar function, perhaps carried by structurally similar proteins albeit with diverging primary sequences, be more common? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that proteins with a basically IF-or crescentin-like architecture are in fact present and widespread in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Experimental analysis of a conserved group of such proteins from actinobacteria demonstrated that IF-like biochemical properties accompanied the basic IF-like architecture of these proteins and also revealed a novel cytoskeletal function in actinobacterial growth and morphogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Together our data suggest that an IF-like cytoskeleton, based on a versatile structural element of a segmented coiled coil rod, is more widespread in bacteria than previously thought. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Despite poor sequence conservation all eukaryotic IF proteins share a similar building plan, consisting of a central rod domain of alternating coiled coil segments and linkers, flanked by more globular head and tail domains (Fig. 1, top) (Herrmann and Aebi, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The rod domain is absolutely essential for filament formation (Parry et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The bacterial IF-like protein crescentin also possesses an apparent rod domain with a different arrangement of coiled coil segments and linkers (Fig. 1) yet exhibits remarkably IF-like biochemical properties and has a cytoskeletal function (Ausmees et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We chose arbitrarily 26 bacterial genomes to survey for the presence of rod-domain proteins among the encoded proteomes (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>A rod domain was defined as a sequence of more than 80 amino acids in coiled coil conformation, positioned either as one continuous block or interrupted by short non-coiled coil sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>An additional condition was that the candidates should contain no known functional domains, such as a signal sequence, transmembrane segments, enzymatic activity, etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Out of 26 genomes 21 encoded at least one candidate protein with above mentioned properties, and 16 genomes encoded several (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>One putative crescentin-like rod-domain protein from each genome is schematically shown in Fig. 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>The analysed genomes represent distant phylogenetic groups, suggesting that proteins with a rod-like architecture are widespread among bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Further database searches revealed a conserved rod-domain protein family with members from at least 14 actinomycete species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of this family was a pair of clearly conserved sequence motifs at the N-terminal borders of the two first coiled coil segments, regardless of the different lengths of the respective segments and intervening linkers in individual proteins (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These conserved motifs are not discernible in crescentin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>However, the basically crescentin-like architecture of the actinomycete proteins and their lack of other known domains suggested that they might similarly have a structural or cytoskeletal function in vivo, so we subjected this family of proteins to further analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>An attempt to produce a polyclonal anti-FilP antiserum was unsuccessful, and the fusion of a short antigenic FLAG tag to the C-terminus of FilP rendered it partially non-functional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>However, the wild-type morphology and growth rate of the merodiploid filP+\filP-egfp strain suggest that the hybrid FilP\FilP-EGFP structures are functional. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Addition of the wild-type crescentin causes redistribution of crescentin-EGFP into dimmer and slightly discontinuous hybrid crescentin\crescentin-EGFP structures, which stretch from pole to pole along the concave side of the cells and are able to cause cell curvature (Ausmees et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="307" pm="."><plain>This indicates that †filP hyphae are more deformable and ‘softer’ than those of the wild-type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="308" pm="."><plain>Further, to measure the elastic properties of the hyphae, we recorded force curves as the tip of the cantilever approached, indented the hyphal surface for about 100 nm and then retracted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="309" pm="."><plain>Force volume (an array of force curves) was recorded over several areas containing apical parts of wild-type or †filP hyphae. Figure 6C displays an image reconstructed using compliance values calculated from an 80 × 80 array of force curves over a tip of a wild-type hypha. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="310" pm="."><plain>Compliance is the inverse of stiffness and the latter is defined as dFdI-1 with F being the force and I being the indentation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="311" pm="."><plain>Because of the pyramidal shape of the tip the edges of a cell experience deformation simultaneously in downwards and sidewise direction, which results in high apparent compliance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="312" pm="."><plain>To avoid edge effects 50 force curves along a line running parallel to the long axis of the hyphae in the highest part of the hyphal cylinder were used for analysis, resulting in average compliance values of 34.4 m N-1 and 44.1 m N-1 for wild-type and †filP hyphae respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="313" pm="."><plain>Single typical force-separation curves of †filP, and wild-type hyphae are shown in Fig. 6D. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="314" pm="."><plain>The steeper slope of the wild-type force curve implies lower compliance of the wild-type hypha compared with the †filP hypha. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="315" pm="."><plain>As both hyphae were indented by the same cantilever, this indicates that the hyphae of the wild-type strain are stiffer than those of the †filP strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>Another significant observation is that the ‘load’ and ‘unload’ curves match reproducibly over the entire surface of the wild-type hyphae (Fig. 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the wild-type hyphae undergo a fully reversible elastic deformation and revert to their original shape as the tip retracts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the †filP hyphae seemed to suffer a more persistent deformation, indicated by the significant hysteresis effect consistently present in all force curves (manifested as a loop between the load and unload curves as the cells demonstrate a delayed elastic recovery after deformation, Fig. 6D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>This is in agreement with other AFM data and can be explained by a softer cell surface and\or by lower turgor pressure of the †filP hyphae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data indicate that the FilP cytoskeleton affects the mechanical properties of the cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the current model of bacterial morphogenesis, according to which cytoskeletal elements control mechanical properties of the cell by spatially orchestrating the deposition of the stress-bearing exoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this to our knowledge the first time the impact of bacterial cytoskeleton has been demonstrated by direct probing of the physical properties of the cells. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>One of the objectives of this study was to address whether the IF-like cytoskeleton is confined to only one bacterial species or if it might be a more widespread phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>The latter notion was evoked by the high degree of diversity displayed by the sequences of IF proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>For example, there is only approximately 30% sequence identity between the rod domains of human and fruit fly lamins, and 27% between two human IF proteins lamin A and cytokeratin 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>Also, individual IF perform quite different functions and are present in different cell types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>This is in strong contrast with the strict conservation of the sequences and functions of the actin and tubulin proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>Apparently, the basic structure of IF proteins, consisting of a segmented coiled coil rod (supports assembly into cytoskeletal filaments) flanked by the head and tail domains (accommodate additional functional motifs), is a versatile design and can be adapted to various cellular functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>This could be a reason why the evolution of IF is less constrained than that of actin and tubulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>Thus, to address our objective, we first estimated the occurrence of the basic IF architecture among bacterial proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>Our analysis suggests that proteins with a segmented coiled coil rod domain are present in many diverse species (Figs 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>However, a cytoskeletal function has to be shown experimentally in each case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>We chose a protein (FilP) from a conserved actinobacterial rod-domain family and demonstrated that it indeed performed a cytoskeletal function in S. coelicolor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, members of that sequence-wise conserved actinomycete protein family display different architectures of the segmented rod domain (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, three tested members, representing different architectures, were able to form regular filaments in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>This supports the idea of a versatile coiled coil rod, which does not have to conform to a strictly defined sequence and architecture to support filament formation and a cytoskeletal function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>Rather, the specific architecture is probably tailored for the specific function of each protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>The common occurrence of rod domains in bacteria together with our experimental data suggest that diverse bacteria may possess a filament system composed of proteins sharing the basic design of IF elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether these proteins originate from a common ancestor or have been evolved independently. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Our analysis was restricted to previously uncharacterized rod-domain proteins without known functional domains in order to identify crescentin-like cytoskeletal elements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>However, there are also examples of proteins in which rod domains are coupled to a known function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>For example, rod-domain proteins TlpA from a Salmonella enterica virulence plasmid (Hurme et al., 1994) and Scc from Leptospira interrogans (Mazouni et al., 2006) were both shown to form filaments in vitro and in vivo in Escherichia coli cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>A common feature of these otherwise very different proteins is that both also bind DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>Another example is the AglZ protein from Myxococcus xanthus which carries a filament-forming coiled coil module coupled to a response regulator receiver domain (Yang et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>Very recently, a short (only 81 aa long) coiled coil protein ZapB was also shown to form striated filaments in vitro and have a role in FtsZ-ring assembly and cell division in E. coli (Ebersbach et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Thus, filament formation via coiled coil rod domains might be relevant in various functional contexts in a bacterial cell. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>FilP cytoskeleton in cell growth and morphology </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>The second goal was to characterize the novel cytoskeletal function identified in this study, performed by an S. coelicolor rod-domain protein FilP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>We have shown that a filP mutant was affected in growth and morphology, indicating that FilP has a role in both processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The observation that filP mutant hyphae were more compliant under direct mechanical probing with AFM suggests that the softness of the cells might lie behind both defects – the distorted morphology and the slower growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>One can envision that mechanical forces of the environment, such as turbulence in liquid or roughness of the solid substrate, would distort the softer †filP hyphae to a greater extent than the more rigid wild-type hyphae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>Thus, frequent change of growth direction might cause the undulating morphology of the mutant hyphae, while the wild-type hyphae are able to grow in a straight fashion in similar conditions (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="366" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that externally applied mechanical constraints induce long-persisting changes in bacterial cell shape. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="367" pm="."><plain>For example, E. coli cells forced to grow as cell filaments in circular microchambers retained a bent cell shape upon release into a liquid medium even after growth and cell division (Takeuchi et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="368" pm="."><plain>Reduced rigidity might also cause less efficient tip elongation of the †filP strain and explain its slower accumulation of biomass. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="369" pm="."><plain>Rigidity of the bacterial cells is mainly determined by the cell wall and by turgor pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="370" pm="."><plain>At present we cannot convincingly determine whether the increased compliance of the †filP strain is due to changes in the cell envelope structure or lower turgor pressure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="371" pm="."><plain>As discussed above, the strategic site of new cell wall synthesis in S. coelicolor is the tip of a growing or emerging hypha, where also a key protein in this process, DivIVA, localizes (Flärdh, 2003a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="372" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the tip regions of growing hyphae of the merodiploid filP+\filP-egfp strain consistently contained a strong fluorescence signal of FilP-EGFP evident as a filamentous structure, an apical spot or both (Fig. 4B and C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="373" pm="."><plain>Together, the presence of FilP within the zone of active growth and the abnormal softness of the cells in the absence of FilP suggest that it might have a role, although nonessential, in cell wall synthesis or maturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="374" pm="."><plain>Another possibility is that FilP somehow changes the composition or permeability of the cell membrane and by that affects turgor pressure and thus the rigidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="375" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that FilP structures might act as a mechanical support in resemblance with the IF network in mammalian cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="376" pm="."><plain>Cell wall expansion in bacteria involves lytic activity in order to break already existing cross-links and incorporate new PG precursors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="377" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the growing region additional mechanical support might be needed to compensate for the relative weakness of the exoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="378" pm="."><plain>A similar function has very recently been proposed for a cellulose synthase-like protein CslA of S. coelicolor (Xu et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="379" pm="."><plain>CslA localized to the hyphal tips and was responsible for the accumulation of a β-glycan polysaccharide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="380" pm="."><plain>The authors proposed that this polysaccharide, most likely cellulose, acts as a bandage to reinforce the growing tips of the hyphae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="381" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a FilP orthologue from S. reticuli has previously been shown to bind Avicel, a derivative of cellulose and was therefore named AbpS (Avicel-binding protein) (Walter et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="382" pm="."><plain>The authors also showed that AbpS oligomerizes (Walter and Schrempf, 2003), which agrees with our data showing that FilP forms filaments in vitro and in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="383" pm="."><plain>We assume that FilP and other proteins of the family might share the cellulose-binding ability of AbpS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="384" pm="."><plain>As FilP is also present at the hyphal tips and in the subapical regions, it must at least partially colocalize with CslA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="385" pm="."><plain>Future studies might clarify the significance of the cellulose-binding ability of FilP and the interaction network between the proteins populating the tip regions of elongating hyphae. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="386" pm="."><plain>The apparent involvement of FilP in determining the mechanical properties of S. coelicolor hyphae relates to the functions of metazoan IF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="387" pm="."><plain>Although IF have become more and more implicated in signalling, protein targeting and other dynamic cellular processes, one important aspect of their functions is mechanical, providing structural support to the cells and dealing with mechanical stress (Chou et al., 2007; Kim and Coulombe, 2007; Pekny and Lane, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="388" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several disease-causing mutations in genes encoding IF-proteins have been shown to, directly or indirectly, lead to increased fragility of affected cells and tissues (Omary et al., 2004; Herrmann et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="389" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the compromised rigidity of the †filP strain might render it more susceptible to the mechanical stresses inflicted by the environment and affect survival and fitness in nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="390" pm="."><plain>The presence of FilP-like proteins in other actinomycetes and in vitro filament formation by FilP-family proteins from Janibacter sp. and M. bovis suggest that a similar IF-like cytoskeletal function is conserved. Janibacter and Mycobacterium species display slightly irregular rod shape and are also known to adopt different morphologies under certain conditions (Martin et al., 1997; Ojha et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="391" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to study the cellular roles of FilP-family proteins in non-filamentous bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="392" pm="."><plain>Further research is also needed to understand the details of FilP localization, the relevance of its different cellular structures and whether FilP shares the property of other cytoskeletal elements, such as MreB and FtsZ, to act as a spatial organizer of cell wall construction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="393" pm="."><plain>To this end, we believe that our novel application of AFM offers a useful tool to address the roles of various cytoskeletal elements in the important task of building up a bacterial cell. </plain></SENT>
