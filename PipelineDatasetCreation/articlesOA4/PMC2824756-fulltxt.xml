The quantification and frequency for every V-J combination during ontogeny and development of the immune system remain to be precisely established. We have addressed this issue by building a model able to account for V&#x003b1;-J&#x003b1; gene rearrangements during thymus development of mice. So we developed a numerical model on the whole TRA/TRD locus, based on experimental data, to estimate how V&#x003b1; and J&#x003b1; genes become accessible to rearrangements. The progressive opening of the locus to V-J gene recombinations is modeled through windows of accessibility of different sizes and with different speeds of progression. Furthermore, the possibility of successive secondary V-J rearrangements was included in the modelling. The model points out some unbalanced V-J associations resulting from a preferential access to gene rearrangements and from a non-uniform partition of the accessibility of the J genes, depending on their location in the locus. The model shows that 3 to 4 successive rearrangements are sufficient to explain the use of all the V and J genes of the locus. Finally, the model provides information on both the kinetics of rearrangements and frequencies of each V-J associations. The model accounts for the essential features of the observed rearrangements on the TRA/TRD locus and may provide a reference for the repertoire of the V-J combinatorial diversity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lymphocytes of the immune system ensure the body defense by the expression of receptors which are specific of targets, termed antigens. Each lymphocyte, deriving from the same original clone, expresses the same unique receptor. To achieve the production of receptors covering the wide variety of antigens, lymphocytes use a specialized genetic mechanism consisting of gene rearrangements. For instance, the genes encoding the receptor of the alpha chain of the T lymphocyte receptor (TRA) spread over a 1500 Kb genetic region which includes around 100 V genes, 60 J genes, and a single C gene. To constitute a functional alpha chain, one of the V and one of the J genes rearrange together to form a single exon. The precise definition of these V-J combinations is essential to understand the repertoire of TRA. We have developed a numerical model simulating all of the V-J combinations of TRA, fitting the available experimental observations obtained from the analysis of TRA in T lymphocytes of the thymus and the blood. Our model gives new insights on the rules controlling the use of V and J genes in providing a dynamic estimation of the total V-J combinations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional antigen receptors expressed by T lymphocytes (TR) are generated during ontogeny by somatic recombination of gene segments coding for the variable (V), the joining (J), and the constant (C) segments <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Cobb1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The recombination mechanism is largely dependent on both the accessibility of the loci and the RAG enzymatic complex <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-JouvinMarche1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The murine TRA/TRD locus is composite, encoding TR &#x003b1; and &#x003b4; chains and encompassed of more than 100 functional V genes <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Baum1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In theory, each of the V genes may target one of the 49 functional J genes. The use of V and J genes during the process of recombination has been widely debated, and the studies support the consensus that V-J combinations are not random, with a use of J segments starting at the 5&#x02032; end (proximal to the V segments) and proceeding to the 3&#x02032; end <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Davodeau1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The accessibility of the J region is controlled by the TR &#x003b1; enhancer (E&#x003b1;), located at the 3&#x02032; end of the C gene <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Sleckman1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and by two promoters: i) T early &#x003b1; (TEA), located at the 5&#x02032; end of the J&#x003b1; region and ii) J49 located 15 Kb downstream of TEA. Both of the promoters are activated by E&#x003b1; <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Abarrategui1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. E&#x003b1; controls all the V to J associations whereas the two promoters are required for the rearrangements of the J genes situated at the 5&#x02032; end of the J&#x003b1; region. However, the analyses of TEA-deleted alleles and those of blockade of TEA transcription showed significant alterations in J use and support the hypothesis that the TEA promoter can regulate both positively the promoters located in the first 12 Kb of J genes and negatively the downstream promoters <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Abarrategui1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Mauvieux1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>A particularity of the TRA locus is an absence of allelic exclusion <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Marche1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and its ability to undergo multiple cycles of secondary rearrangements <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Petrie1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The process of successive rearrangements is stopped by either positive selection, which downregulates recombinase expression <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> or by cell death. Therefore, the impact of secondary rearrangements on the TR&#x003b1; gene assembly regulation remains to be defined.</p><p>Regarding the V and J gene use, it is suggested that the first V-J association targets the secondary one into a set of J segments located near the J segment involved in the primary rearrangement <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The rules governing the use of the V genes have not been clearly elucidated. Nevertheless, observations converge to a consensus: the use of V segments would progress from proximal V genes, located near the J region, towards the V genes located in the distal region <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. At this point in time, the mechanism involved in the control of accessibility of V genes remains to debate <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The current state of the technology permits the analysis of some V-J combinations, essentially those at the extremities of the locus but still fails to establish a complete estimation of the V-J combinations. The main obstacle comes from the fact that some V genes are duplicated in similar copies in the V region central part, making problematic their unambiguous identification by molecular methods <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Lefranc1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Consequently, numerical modelling of the V-J recombination process may offer valuable support to overcome the difficulty for accessing to a global view of TRA repertoire. For instance, if the J genes are chosen in a sequential way in the model, their use results unimodal, whereas it is known from experimental data that TRA/TRD locus displays two Hot Spots of recombination <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-JouvinMarche1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This discrepancy led us to build a mathematical model, parameterized from experimental data, on all V and J genes, including those in distal, proximal, and central positions. Confrontation between the data obtained from experiments and from modelling makes possible an estimation of dynamical parameters, such as the accessibility to rearrangements and the frequencies of the V-J associations, giving a more accurate estimation of the TRA combinatorial diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The goal of building a model representative of the V&#x003b1;-J&#x003b1; associations was to reproduce the global biological features of T lymphocyte V&#x003b1;J&#x003b1; rearrangements occurring in the TRA/TRD locus with a software algorithm. This algorithm must be parameterized to find the conditions that reproduce the experimental data. Adequacy between biological and simulated results tells that all the essential aspects of the studied process were included in the model. This modelling approach led us to gather and search for some biological data about the parameters controlling the V&#x003b1;-J&#x003b1; rearrangement process in the mouse TRA/TRD locus.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Update of the parameters controlling the mouse TRA/TRD locus utilization during rearrangements by an experimental approach</title><p>In order to build the model, we firstly required information about the physical position of the V and J genes in the TRA/TRD locus.

In addition, we needed to define parameters such as the opening location (the position where the opening mechanism begins), the opening speed for the access to V and J genes and the opening duration. Two more parameters were added, a first maturation step in order to eliminate the TRD genes and an opening offset as we supposed a certain rigidity of the DNA chain, thus two genes placed very close from each other cannot rearrange together.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000682-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000682.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>TRA/TRD locus characterization.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000682-t001-1" xlink:href="pcbi.1000682.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V region</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">J region</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Length (Kb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1300</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of elements</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">104</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of functional elements</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><sec id="s2a1"><title>Determination of the opening speeds for the V and J regions in the thymus</title><p>The data given in the first column of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t002">Table 2</xref> were obtained from rearrangements at the genomic level in BALB/c mice during thymic ontogeny and resume results presented in a previous work <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

First of all, concerning the frequencies of the associations, the main information supplied by the model is that 96&#x00025; (4704 out of 4900) of the V-J associations are probable. Hence, two areas where V-J combinations rarely occur could be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>): the &#x0201c;A&#x0201d; area as associations between proximal V and distal J and the &#x0201c;B&#x0201d; area as associations between distal V and proximal J. These occasional associations are a consequence of a non-synchronized availability for rearrangements of the concerned V and J genes, as already documented in experimental data <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Davodeau1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Secondly, the model gives estimation for the frequencies of each V-J combination building the whole combinatorial repertoire shape. In the third place, the model states the influence of the Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS) on the V-J association distribution, which remains until now debated <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Glusman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Livak1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For that purpose, we ran simulations with and without taking into account the RSS scores (available in IMGT). The 2D graphs of the V14 family repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g004">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>) show that introducing variations accordingly to the RSS scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>) does not drastically affect the shape of the global repertoire distribution but leads to a local effect on certain J genes. The algorithm for choosing the J genes regarding their RSS score values has been favorably tested by using the Monte Carlo method. In the fourth place, the model provides information on the contribution of each wave of successive rearrangements to account for the total of V-J associations. Therefore, we tested the occurrence of 1 to 6 successive rearrangements in simulations. With 1 or 2 rearrangements, only the proximal V to proximal J associations are observed. With 5 or more rearrangements, the repertoire presents a distal border effect, corresponding to numerous rearrangements of the distal V and distal J regions, which are incoherent with experimental data. In conclusion, the overall repertoire generated by the simulation is in accordance with experimental data only by allowing 3 to 4 rearrangements, with a delay of 24 hours per rearrangement. Moreover, the contribution of each wave of successive rearrangements appears to decrease accordingly to their rank; 40&#x00025; of the overall V-J associations is produced by the first wave of rearrangements, 33&#x00025;, 19&#x00025; and 8&#x00025; come from the subsequent rearrangement waves respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000682-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000682.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>Contribution of each rearrangement round into the total V-J combinatorial repertoire.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000682-t004-4" xlink:href="pcbi.1000682.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rearrangement</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">First</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Second</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Third</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fourth</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8&#x00025;</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b6"><title>Robustness of the model</title><p>To assure that the sampling size used in simulations was sufficient, we checked the representativeness of the repertoire by making sets of simulations ranging from 10<sup>2</sup> to 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> rearrangements.

Our quantitative approach points out that the physical position of the genes is the main structural parameter governing the uses of V and J genes. The J and V regions become accessible from proximal to distal genes according to an average &#x0201c;opening speed&#x0201d; of approximately 1 Kb/h for the J region and around 18 Kb/h for the V region. Interestingly, this difference between the V and J region opening speed values can be related to the gene density. In fact, the number of genes and the size of the V and J regions differ significantly. As a matter of fact, the V region length is 20 times larger than the J one (&#x0223c;1300 Kb versus &#x0223c;60 Kb), but the density of J genes is about 10 times higher than the density of the V genes (1 J by Kb versus 0.13 V by Kb). Consequently, the opening speeds calculated in terms of genes per hour is 1.4 for the V region and 0.83 for the J region (calculated as follows: the number of genes in the locus times the speed in Kb per hour, then divided by the length of the locus). Finally, taking into account the gene density of each region, the opening speeds of the V and J regions are almost identical. Our observations reinforce two putative scenarios being previously proposed to explain the opening of the J and V regions respectively. The first one, the J local service scenario was proposed for the J region <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It consists in a J use that follows small steps during the successive rearrangements. This local service is controlled by promoter activities associated to some of the other J genes. The second one, the V region express service proposes a large window for the gene accessibility to rearrangements controlled by enhancer activity. It reflects the larger utilization of a V region, whose genes are more scattered than those in the J one <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, the speed calculations also take into consideration the regulatory elements controlling the gene accessibility <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Osipovich1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

Furthermore, two areas (A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>) reveal rarely represented V-J combinations, due to the fact that the V and J genes involved in these combinations are not accessible to get rearranged simultaneously. Concerning the A area, when the proximal J genes are recombining, the distal V genes are still inaccessible, and when they become accessible, the proximal J genes are deleted because of previous rearrangements. Similarly, on the B area, the non-synchronized accessibility of the proximal V genes and the distal J genes explains that their associations are not observed in the simulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3a3"><title>The J region use confirms the existence of two Hot Spots</title><p>The progressive opening mechanism over the TRA locus provides V-J combinations that show a specific pattern; each given V gene is rearranged with a contiguous set of J genes. The distribution of these J genes presents a Poissonian distribution for the proximal V genes or a Gaussian shape for the distal V genes. The changes in the J use are progressive, depending on the V position: the more distal is a V gene, the more distal and larger is the set of J genes used, and the less represented are these V-J associations in the whole V-J repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). There are two main probabilistic bases for the occurrence of the Hot Spots in the J region observed in the simulation results. The successive rearrangements are achieved by consecutive random choices of J genes, considering the progression of their access to recombination and optionally their RSS score values. The first J gene choice, corresponding to the first rearrangement, follows a Poissonian law whereas individually the two other J gene choices follow a Gaussian law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Altogether, the consecutive random choices of J genes build a multimodal curve of occurrence, which allows the appearance of two Hot Spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g008">Fig. 8, solid line</xref>). The first Hot Spot results from the Poisson's distribution of the first J choice and the second one from the Gaussian distributions of the subsequent J choices. Moreover, it is important to remark that the density of J genes in the TRA locus is not uniform: J genes are less dense between J58-J47, J39-J28, and J14-J4, whereas they have a higher density between J45-J40 and J24-J15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The J gene density reaches its maximum in the area around J21-J22, corresponding to the place of the second Hot Spot. Interestingly, we observed the Hot Spots when the model parameter values were in the range where the opening dynamics allowed more frequent rearrangements within the areas of maximal gene density.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000682-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000682.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Successive rearrangements and building of the combinatorial repertoire shape.</title><p>Three successive draws of random integers were done successively, the first one giving an integer x1 between 0 and 10 following a Poissonian law.

However, the number of plausible secondary rearrangements remains unknown. Our model predicts that after the first maturation step of the TRA/TRD locus, consisting in the elimination of the TRD genes, the first V-J rearrangement of TRA is followed by a maximum of three secondary rearrangements. Nevertheless, each round of rearrangement contributes differently in the building of the whole repertoire, decreasing after each wave, and consequently, the fourth rearrangements have a weak contribution of 8&#x00025;. This estimation of 4 total rearrangements is based on a realistic model including opening speeds from ontogenic experiments and may be more precise than Warmflash theoretical model's results that proposes a higher number of successive rearrangements <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Warmflash1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. It is important to consider that the number of secondary rearrangements can be affected by the lifespan of the rearranging T lymphocytes. For instance, the ROR&#x003b3;-deficient mice, presenting a shorter lifespan of DP thymocytes, show essentially proximal J genes rearranged, while Bcl-xL&#x02013;transgenic mice, having DP with a longer lifespan, present a higher rate of distal J genes rearranged <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Guo1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3a5"><title>RSS influence</title><p>Regarding the Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS) influence, our model is able to incorporate the RSS diversity information through scores. The simulations using these RSS scores show a local quantitative influence but do not change the global profile of the frequency curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g005">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). In conclusion, the RSSs may only influence local specificities within the accessibility windows moving across the TRA/TRD locus in a bi-directional way. This is in good accordance with mouse TRB locus observations showing that V gene RSSs neither correlate with any particular restriction of J genes nor with any high V-J rearrangement frequencies <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3a6"><title>The sequential windowing model: a tool to determine the peripheral V-J association frequencies</title><p>We previously observed experimentally and tested statistically that the thymic and the peripheral repertoires showed similar profiles of J uses by the V14 family <xref rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. When we compared the experimental data of the uses of J genes by the V14 family members we found that the J use profiles fitted our model results. It is acknowledged that the V14 is a multimember family and may be representative of the J use by different V genes. Finally, our data suggest that the model would be used as a tool to determine the V-J association frequencies in the peripheral T lymphocytes.</p><p>All these remarks support the realistic character of our model, which includes the essential features of the V-J rearrangement process in the TRA/TRD locus. In conclusion, the combination of experimental and mathematical approaches gives new insights on combinatorial repertoire biases due to non-equiprobable V-J combinations in TRA/TRD rearrangements, and allows defining more accurately the TRA/TRD primary combinatorial repertoire. In the future, the model could be adapted to other loci and other species, to propose accurate estimations of the V-J combinatorial diversity, giving a dynamical vision of the immune diversity generation during differentiation of T cells and B lymphocytes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Nomenclature</title><p>Official nomenclature for V and J genes is chosen according to the IMGT database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imgt.cines.fr">http://imgt.cines.fr</ext-link>).
