</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arctic sea ice covers an area of about 15 × 106 km2 at its maximal extent during winter (Antarctic 18 × 106 km2; Fetterer and Knowles, 2002), providing an extensive (albeit shrinking; Serreze et al., 2007) habitat for microorganisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the annual lifetime of polar sea ice, it experiences wide ranges in environmental conditions, yet changes in its microbial (bacterial and archaeal) communities through the seasons are not well known (Mock and Thomas, 2005; Deming, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Winter sea ice in the Arctic is an extreme environment characterized by limited light, very cold temperatures in its upper horizons (to −35°C) and correspondingly high salinity (37–237‰) in its brine inclusions, where the organisms have been observed to reside (Junge et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The assumption that these microbial inhabitants are largely inactive during the winter has been tested infrequently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Working with first-year sea ice north of Barrow (Alaska) during the coldest month of the year (March), Junge and colleagues (2004) observed that a small percentage of cells (0.5–4.0% by CTC staining) were metabolically active to −20°C, the coldest ice horizon examined. Wells and Deming (2006b), working with landfast sea ice in Franklin Bay (Western Arctic, also in March), detected an increase in bacterial numbers (doubling time &gt; 4 days) in one of the three ice-brine samples they incubated at −12°C (salinity of 160‰). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Relative to other marine environments, bacteria in sea ice have proven highly amenable to cultivation: up to 50% of total counts from Antarctic ice (Helmke and Weyland, 1995) and 62% from Arctic ice (Junge et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The bacterial groups that have been cultured from polar sea ice consist primarily of Gammaproteobacteria of the orders Oceanospirillales and Alteromonadales, the marine Roseobacter clade of Alphaproteobacteria (Bowman et al., 1997; Brown and Bowman, 2001; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003; Buchan et al., 2005), and the Bacteroidetes (also known as Cytophaga–Flavobacter–Bacteroides). Betaproteobacteria and high G+C Gram-positives (Actinobacteria) have also been obtained in culture from Antarctic sea ice (Junge et al., 1998) and Baltic Sea ice (Kaartokallio et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Results from culture-independent methods, including cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), overlap remarkably well with culture-based results, confirming the prevalence of these bacterial groups in spring and summer sea ice (Brown and Bowman, 2001; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Archaea were not known from sea ice until recently, even though they are prevalent members of Arctic pelagic communities (Galand et al., 2006; 2008b; Wells et al., 2006) and comprise a sizable fraction of the biomass in Antarcticfrazil ice in late winter (Delong et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>To date, Archaea have only been detected in Arctic winter sea ice using domain-level probes, where they comprised ≤ 3.4% of the total assemblage (Junge et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>They appear absent in sea ice of later seasons by both culture-based and culture-independent methods (Brown and Bowman, 2001; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Possible shifts in community composition and richness in Arctic winter ice over time and increasingly severe conditions are not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>From cultivation studies of Antarctic sea ice, psychrophilic bacteria are thought to outlive psychrotolerant species during winter (Helmke and Weyland, 1995; Delille and Rosiers, 1996; Helmke and Weyland, 2004; Fiala et al., 2006), leaving them positioned to dominate during the biologically productive spring and summer months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Such common heterotrophic microorganisms may also begin their habitation of sea ice in relative abundance if attached to larger phytoplankton known to entrain selectively into ice by frazil ice scavenging (Grossmann, 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of microbial communities in polar sea ice, whether during or after ice entrapment, have not been examined using phylogenetic approaches, although these techniques have been used to study winter succession of bacterial and archaeal communities in polar waters (Murray et al., 1998; Murray and Grzymski, 2007), including surface waters at our study site (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The only ice examined by a PCR-based ‘fingerprinting’ technique for high-throughput analysis of microbial community structure (Osborn et al., 2000; Hewson et al., 2007; Fuhrman et al., 2008) is the warm (&gt; −5°C) and thin (&lt; 30 cm) ice of the brackish (5–6‰) Baltic Sea (Kaartokallio et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>There the dynamics of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes over the short (2 month) lifetime of this ‘mild’ ice were linked to exchange processes at the ice–water interface and progression of the ice-algal bloom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These features do not pertain to upper horizons of much colder, thicker and light-limited Arctic winter sea ice, the subject of this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>During the Canadian Arctic Shelf Exchange Study (CASES), when the CCGS Amundsen was immobilized in landfast sea ice of Franklin Bay (Western Arctic) through the winter, we first investigated the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of particulate matter, including microorganisms and particulate extracellular polymeric substances (pEPS), within the ice (Collins et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The same ice field was cored repeatedly each week from January through March, a period when ice thickness increased from 90 to 200 cm and upper ice temperatures were well below −5°C, leaving the ice impermeable (Golden et al., 1998) and the microbial communities entrapped. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We focused on the upper 70 cm of the ice, analysing three 10 cm horizons centred at 25, 45 and 65 cm below the ice surface (reserving subsamples for later phylogenetic analyses). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The results indicated winter losses of 38% and 49% of the total number of bacteria in the two coldest ice horizons (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>S1), where in situ temperatures had ranged from −15°C to −26°C (25 cm) and −12°C to −22°C (45 cm; the range at 65 cm was −9°C to −18°C; Collins et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>At these temperatures brine salinities are also extreme, from 130‰ to 230‰. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>We attributed some of the bacterial losses to virally mediated mortality, given measurements of viral production in ice brines from the same ice field (Wells and Deming, 2006b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>We attributed the persistence of the majority of bacteria throughout the ice to the generic cryoprotective effects of pEPS (Krembs and Deming, 2008), which had increased significantly in all three horizons during winter (Collins et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate effects of the increasingly severe conditions in the aforementioned sea ice on the structure and richness of the natural microbial communities found within it, beginning several weeks after ice formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Because bacterial communities that thrive within spring and summer sea ice differ substantially from pelagic communities prior to freeze-up, we hypothesized that extreme conditions in winter sea ice would exert selective pressure on the microbial community, favouring survival and subsequent dominance of the easily cultured psychrophilic Bacteria already known from spring and summer sea ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis we performed community fingerprinting of Bacteria (by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, ARISA) and Archaea (by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, T-RFLP) on the entire sample set collected during the CASES overwintering expedition (Collins et al., 2008), also generating complementary clone libraries of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes from selected samples of winter sea ice and under-ice seawater. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although we were unable to test directly for selection during the autumn freezing process, our results also bear upon this concept. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>The expectation that selective losses of dominant bacterial and archaeal community members would occur under the extreme conditions of winter sea ice was not realized in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>Although both bacterial growth and mortality had been inferred from changes in total bacterial counts (Wells and Deming, 2006b; Collins et al., 2008), microbial community succession was not detectable in the upper ice horizons we sampled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>We found no significant change in bacterial or archaeal richness or community similarity over the 3-month period of our investigation (Fig. 1, Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>Persistence of the dominant members of the sea ice microbial community through winter was also evidenced by the high proportion of total signal associated with members present in every sea ice sample analysed by ARISA (Table 1) and T-RFLP (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>Whereas culture-based studies of heterotrophic microbes had suggested forces at work in sea ice to select for psychrophilic over psychrotolerant strains (Kaneko et al., 1977; Delille and Rosiers, 1996; Delille et al., 1997; Fiala et al., 2006), not even the extreme conditions of the winter sea ice we studied exerted any more than very limited (statistically undetectable) selective pressure at the taxonomic level on the bacterial and archaeal communities entrapped in this ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>Techniques used with polar seawater to quantify differences in relative abundance of specific groups of microorganisms, like FISH (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008), quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA and functional genes like amoA (Galand et al., 2009b), or massively parallel hypervariable tag sequencing (Huse et al., 2008; Galand et al., 2009a), have not yet been applied to sea ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>Their use on winter sea ice might reveal subtle patterns of succession in bacterial and archaeal communities that escaped the sensitivity limits of our methods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>Many Bacteria and Archaea may lie dormant in winter sea ice (Kaneko et al., 1977; Helmke and Weyland, 1995), surviving without reproducing and thus limiting the possible mechanisms of selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Although Bacteria and Archaea were presumed to ‘survive’ if their DNA was present on our membrane filters, we have no data to demonstrate their continued viability in situ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Protistan bacterivores, which can selectively graze bacteria based on size and biochemical cues, are essentially absent from very cold Arctic winter ice (Krembs et al., 2002) and so are unlikely to contribute a selective effect, even if they may play a role in shaping the microbial community in warmer ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The persistence of the ice microbial communities that we measured through winter is consistent with cells being relatively inactive in very cold sea ice and surviving in the absence of bacterivores, whereas more active under-ice seawater communities are subject to predation and do change over the course of winter (Murray and Grzymski, 2007; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>Complete preservation in the ice, however, is inconsistent with reports of actively respiring cells in Arctic winter sea ice (Junge et al., 2004) and, from the same ice we sampled, examples of bacterial mortality (Collins et al., 2008) and viral and bacterial production in experimental ice brines (Wells and Deming, 2006b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>To reconcile the general absence of species-specific mortality reported here with the presumed presence of a mixture of active and inactive populations (whether taxonomically similar or not), both populations must share similar mortality rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>This assumption can be fulfilled if the primary mechanisms of mortality in the ice are taxonomically non-selective, despite the possibility that they may each affect active and inactive cells differently. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms to consider for non-selective mortality are virally mediated lysis and cell damage from co-occurring extremes in temperature and salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Modelled contact rates between viruses and bacteria in sea ice brines are extremely high (up to 600 times that in seawater; Wells and Deming, 2006b) and, under environmental stress, host specificity may give way to a broad range of infectable hosts (Wells and Deming, 2006a), linking both mechanisms under consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>Viral production (whether by species-specific or generalist phages) may play a role in mortality of any taxonomic group that remains active in the ice, whereas dormant populations might be affected not by viral reproduction from within but ‘lysis from without’ due to a large number of attached viruses (Delbrück, 1940). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>For a generalized protective mechanism for cells within sea ice, hydrated coatings of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that simultaneously buffer against external ice-crystal damage, osmotic shock and viral attack has been proposed (Krembs et al., 2002; Krembs and Deming, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>EPS are produced by many sea ice bacteria in culture (Mancuso Nichols et al., 2005; Marx et al., 2009), colonized by bacteria in sea ice (Meiners et al., 2004), and increased in abundance during winter in the ice we studied (Collins et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Production of EPS by a subset of microorganisms entrained into sea ice might serve all entrapped within it, including common seawater species not adapted to life in ice, thereby limiting species-specific mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The structure of these persistent winter sea ice communities is unique in resembling that of communities in autumn and winter seawater, measured in this study and reported by Alonso-Sáez and colleagues (2008) for our study site, rather than previously observed communities in spring and summer sea ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>For the first time, sea ice bacterial communities were observed (by both clone library and fingerprinting results) to be dominated by the common pelagic SAR11 clade Alphaproteobacteria, with only much smaller complements of the Alphaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriales well known from sea ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>While studies of later season sea ice have failed to detect Archaea, all of our winter ice (and seawater) samples contained them, with the dominant archaeon belonging to Marine Group I.1a Crenarchaeota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Clearly, these pelagic Bacteria and Archaea entrained into sea ice upon its formation and persisted through the winter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>Our community structure results also indicate that microorganisms from other habitats, including terrestrial soil, riverine waters and marine sediment, entrain into sea ice and persist through the winter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>Likely sources of the non-marine microorganisms include freshwater from the nearby Horton River, eroded soils from the Smoking Hills, and terrestrial organic matter from the Mackenzie River, the largest source of suspended particulates to the Beaufort Shelf (Macdonald et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>All of the dominant SAR11 phylotypes detected in our winter ice samples were highly similar to sequences from the coastal Beaufort Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Regarding the dominant SAR11 phylotypes detected in our winter ice samples, all were highly similar to sequences from the coastal Beaufort Sea (Galand et al., 2008a), central Arctic Ocean (Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002; Malmstrom et al., 2007), and Antarctic surface waters (Murray and Grzymski, 2007), even though absent from summer sea ice (Brown and Bowman, 2001; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003) and highly productive autumn sea ice near Antarctica (Brinkmeyer et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The only cultured representative of the SAR11 clade is ‘Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique’, an obligately oligotrophic alphaproteobacterium distributed widely throughout the waters of the global ocean (Morris et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>Although we detected two clades of SAR11 ITS sequences, no evidence was found to indicate ecotype differentiation (as suggested by García-Martínez and Rodríguez-Valera, 2000) between sea ice and seawater environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Because sequences within the SAR11 clade made up a larger fraction of the late winter sea ice library (70%) than the under-ice seawater library (48%), SAR11 may nevertheless overwinter more successfully in ice than in seawater. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>This inference is consistent with quantitative FISH studies by Alonso-Sáez and colleagues (2008), who detected a seasonal decrease in the relative abundance of SAR11 in Franklin Bay surface waters from 36% of total DAPI counts at the time of freeze-up (December) to 18% by late winter (March). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>The dominant archaeal phylotypes in our sea ice and seawater libraries, Marine Group I Crenarchaeota (Fig. 2, Table S4) have been identified from central Arctic seawater (Bano et al., 2004), Beaufort shelf nepheloid layers and riverine particles (Galand et al., 2006; 2008b;), and Antarctic seawater growing frazil ice (Delong et al., 1994), yet were absent from summer sea ice (Brown and Bowman, 2001; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003) and highly productive autumn sea ice near Antarctica (Brinkmeyer et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>These phylotypes clustered with the ‘Marine’ Group I Crenarchaeota rather than the ‘Freshwater’ Group I which are prominent in the Mackenzie River (Galand et al., 2008a,b;). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The seasonally high relative abundance of the Marine Group I Crenarchaeota that we detected both by T-RFLP (45% of total signal intensity) and clone library sequencing (91% of sequences in both libraries) in Franklin Bay is consistent with FISH counts in surface waters at the same site, showing a winter high for this group (to 16% of DAPI counts) that decreased to undetectable levels by late summer (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This trend is also consistent with results from Antarctic waters showing that the relative abundance of Marine Group I Crenarchaeota was highest during winter and inversely correlated with algal biomass (chlorophyll a) on seasonal time scales (Murray et al., 1998; Church et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The rarer Marine Group II Euryarcheota we detected were also closely related to phylotypes found prevalently in archaeal communities from the coastal Beaufort Sea (Galand et al., 2006; 2008b;) and central Arctic Ocean (Bano et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Although Archaea were identified by Junge and colleagues (2004) in winter sea ice, their FISH probes were generic for the domain Archaea so no further taxonomic assignment was possible. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Bacterial sequences from several frequently cultured groups of copiotrophic sea ice bacteria were absent from our winter clone libraries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Neither the bacterial sea ice nor seawater library harboured sequences from cold-adapted genera of the Oceanospirillales, Alteromonadales or Flavobacteriales commonly cultured and cloned from sea ice, including Colwellia, Glaciecola, Halomonas, Marinobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter, Psychromonas and Shewanella (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>S4, Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Instead, the majority of gammaproteobacterial phylotypes were related to recently cultured oligotrophic seawater clades OM60 and OM182 (Cho and Giovannoni, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>The OM60 clade is prominent in Arctic seawater (Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002; Kellogg and Deming, 2009) while the OM182 clade is seasonally abundant in Antarctic surface waters (Murray et al., 1998; Grzymski et al., 2006; Murray and Grzymski, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>A representative from the OM60 clade was reported in Arctic pack ice (Brinkmeyer et al., 2003), but no members of the OM182 clade have previously been identified from sea ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Cultured isolates of sea ice Alphaproteobacteria generally cluster with marine Roseobacter, but only one of our phylotypes was most similar to a cultured representative (Sulfitobacter sp.). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Others in the uncultured Roseobacter RCA cluster were detected infrequently in our libraries, consistent with their low abundance in seawater at our overwintering station (&lt; 5%; Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008). Bacteroidetes are well known from sea ice and often make up a sizable fraction of the community in polar seawater (Bano and Hollibaugh, 2002; Wells and Deming, 2003; Malmstrom et al., 2007), including at our overwintering site (Alonso-Sáez et al., 2008), yet made up only a small fraction of the bacterial clones in our winter sea ice library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The implication is that these common sea ice bacteria only become dominant in sea ice after the winter season has passed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Polaribacter, a genus of Bacteroidetes appearing in the ARISA analysis, provided a notable exception to the lack of representation by cultivated isolates in the winter sea ice we sampled (Table 1 and Table S1). Polaribacter spp., known for their production of gas vacuoles, have been cultured and identified as abundant Bacteroidetes from both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice (Gosink et al., 1998; Brown and Bowman, 2001; Junge et al., 2002; Brinkmeyer et al., 2003; Auman et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>The recent genome sequence of Antarctic seawater isolate Polaribacter irgensii strain 23-P (GenBank accession: AAOG00000000) may help elucidate their adaptations to sea ice, just as the genome sequence analysis of Polaribacter MED152 has revealed their adaptations to sunlit surface waters (e.g. rhodopsins; González et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>In this study, preferential entrainment of Polaribacter spp. into sea ice was inconclusive, because they were also detected in under-ice seawater by both cloning and ARISA, but the high intra-specific ITS variability we observed may prove useful in future tests of ecotype differentiation by these successful sea ice colonizing bacteria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Overall, the dominant presence of common seawater microorganisms and the absence of many known sea ice microorganisms in the Arctic winter ice we studied indicate that species-specific mortality during the winter was rare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The degree of similarity between winter ice and seawater communities also implies that selection during the freezing process must have been relatively minor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>The distinctive nature of well-known microbial communities in sea ice of the warmer biologically productive seasons must not be predetermined by selective survival of community members exposed to freezing and severe winter conditions, but rather as a result of competitive outgrowth by copiotrophs that overwinter below detection limit or arrive as immigrants once the warming ice becomes permeable. </plain></SENT>
