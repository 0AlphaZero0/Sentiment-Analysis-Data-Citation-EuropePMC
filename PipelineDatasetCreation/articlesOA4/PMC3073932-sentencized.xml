</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Starvation for nutrient and energy sources are common stresses confronted by bacteria in natural environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bacteria have limited energy reserves, so they need robust mechanisms to quickly shift between rapid and slow growth, as well as a strategy for long-term survival during periods of prolonged starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The response to starvation comprises an initial stage of scavenging and metabolic adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>If the missing essential nutrients are not replenished, there is a second stage of physiological adaptation, which includes the inhibition of growth and cell division, in order to retain viability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We have used Caulobacter crescentus, a gram-negative oligotrophic bacterium [1], as a model system to study the response to carbon deprivation. C. crescentus has a dimorphic life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Each asymmetric division yields a chemotactically-competent flagellated cell (swarmer cell) and a sessile cell with a polar stalk (stalked cell). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The core genetic network that drives cell cycle progression and cell division in C. crescentus is well characterized [2], [3], [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, the RpoS (σS) and SigB (σB) sigma factors are the master regulators of the general starvation-stress response [6], [7]. C. crescentus lacks orthologs of the rpoS and sigB genes, as do all other α-proteobacteria [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>An equivalent master regulator has not been identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>We have recently identified two factors involved in the adaptation of C. crescentus to carbon starvation: the SpoT ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase, which contributes to the regulation of the DnaA protein stability and initiation of DNA replication [10], and the CrfA small noncoding regulatory RNA controlling the mRNA stability of 27 transcripts [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>A comparison of gene expression profiles of C. crescentus growing under carbon- and nitrogen-limited continuous flow cultures was recently reported [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In these experiments, slow cell growth was supported by a constant supply of nutrients at low concentration, and the gene expression profiling captured the metabolic adaptations to the relative levels of carbon and nitrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This study identified genes differentially induced in carbon- versus nitrogen-limited conditions, among which are those predicted to require the alternative sigma factor RpoN for complete induction [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Here, we have studied the cells' response to an abrupt loss of carbon source resulting in the inhibition of mass accumulation and cell cycle progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We performed a global analysis of the differences between growing and carbon-starved C. crescentus cultures, through combined high-throughput proteome and transcriptome assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>By analyzing the response at the protein level, we took into account the fact that C. crescentus uses a complex array of regulatory strategies that include targeted proteolytic events [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We identified genetic regulatory pathways that mediate the transduction of carbon starvation signals and found that the SigT ECF sigma factor controls a core set of genes that are activated by carbon depletion, osmotic stress and exposure to heavy metals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>We identified gene clusters that are differentially expressed upon carbon starvation at specific stages of the cell cycle. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Under prolonged starvation, there is a pronounced loss in viability [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In order to identify proteins that participate in the carbon starvation response, we incubated cultures in minimal M2 medium in the absence of glucose, and the respective non-starved controls in the presence of 0.2% glucose, for 30 and 60 minutes, as described in the Methods section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Previous electrophoresis-based proteome studies of C. crescentus identified 81 cell cycle-regulated proteins [14], 39 stalk-specific proteins [15], and 86 membrane-associated proteins [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The levels of 513 proteins were found to change reproducibly in cells starved for carbon for 30 and/or 60 min (Table S2).

<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Of the 40 COG P proteins that are upregulated upon carbon starvation, 21 belong to the TonB-dependent receptor family, which are highly abundant in the C. crescentus genome, including those controlled by the CrfA small noncoding RNA described by Landt et. al. [11]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Among the proteins that change significantly, there was notable downregulation of three essential cell cycle regulators (CtrA, DnaA and GcrA), and two proteins (PopZ and ParA) that mediate chromosome segregation [13], [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The decrease in the levels of DnaA, an essential protein that serves both as an activator of replication initiation and global transcription factor [21], is consistent with the previously reported starvation-induced ClpP-mediated proteolysis of DnaA [22]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="534" pm="."><plain>In the presence of adequate nutrient levels, the swarmer-to-stalked-cell transition involves the loss of the polar flagellum, the biogenesis of a stalk in its place, and the concurrent initiation of chromosome replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="535" pm="."><plain>It has been shown however, that these processes can be uncoupled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="536" pm="."><plain>When the DnaA activator of DNA replication is depleted [21], or when CtrA inactivation is prevented [38], swarmer cells undergo polar morphological changes, but fail to initiate chromosome replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="537" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, swarmer cells carrying a deletion in the gene encoding the PleD response regulator replicate their chromosome in the absence of polar morphogenesis [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="538" pm="."><plain>We show here that wild type swarmer cells subjected to abrupt carbon depletion were capable of initiating, but not completing, stalk development (see Figure 4A), while the replication and segregation of the chromosomal origin was inhibited (see Figure 4B, [10]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="539" pm="."><plain>Because the incipient stalks could not be detected by light microscopy, it was previously postulated that carbon starvation inhibits swarmer differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="540" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in these experiments cell populations were starved for carbon prior to isolation of swarmer cells [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="541" pm="."><plain>However, electron microscope images (see Figure 4A) revealed the presence of incipient stalks under these conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="542" pm="."><plain>Thus, the point of commitment to initiate stalk morphogenesis appears to precede that of initiation of chromosomal replication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="543" pm="."><plain>In the population of swarmer cells obtained by the synchronization procedure, the younger cells that are most recently derived from cell division might block both processes, accounting for the 30% of cells that did not develop an incipient stalk by 8 hs of carbon starvation. </plain></SENT>
