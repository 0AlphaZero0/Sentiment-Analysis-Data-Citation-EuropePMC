Different species of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> are associated with varying parasite compatibility, affecting local transmission. It is thought that two species, <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> and <italic>B. sudanica</italic>, inhabit Lake Victoria; despite their biomedical importance, the taxonomy of these species has not been thoroughly examined. This study combined analysis of morphological and molecular variables; the results demonstrated that molecular groupings were not consistent with morphological divisions. Habitat significantly predicted morphotype, suggesting that the different Lake Victorian forms of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> are ecophentoypes of one species. The nomenclature should be revised accordingly; the names <italic>B. choanomphala choanomphala</italic> and <italic>B. c. sudanica</italic> are proposed. From a public health perspective, these findings can be utilised by policy-makers for better understanding of exposure risk, resulting in more effective and efficient control initiatives.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused by the parasitic trematode <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, and is a neglected tropical disease of global importance <xref rid="pone.0026563-Hotez1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The distribution and burden of the infection is determined to a large extent by the presence of the obligate intermediate hosts of the parasite, which are snails of the genus <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>. Although also present in Latin America and the Middle East, the vast public health burden of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> falls on Africa; within this context, Lake Victoria is a known regional hotspot.</p><p>Given their importance in determining the distribution and exposure risk of intestinal schistosomiasis, <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails (Basommatophora, Planorbidae) have long been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny. It was noted early on that different species of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> appeared to transmit <italic>S. mansoni</italic> more or less successfully <xref rid="pone.0026563-Files1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-DeWitt1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; of the 12 species of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> in Africa, none are known to be completely resistant to infection, unlike some of the New World species <xref rid="pone.0026563-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-Malek1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the African species have not been awarded the same level of research attention as the American <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> species, and there has long been confusion as to the status of various putative species and sub-species.</p><p>An attempt to rectify this taxonomic tangle was made in the late 1950s by Georg Mandahl-Barth, who used a combination of morphological characters to re-classify African <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>. Based on morphology, Mandahl-Barth proposed classifying the African <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> into four groups: the <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> group, the <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> group, the <italic>B. sudanica</italic> group and the <italic>B. alexandrina</italic> group, each with numerous sub-&#x02018;species&#x02019; <xref rid="pone.0026563-MandahlBarth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>More recently, molecular tools have been used to try to elucidate the taxonomy of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>. DeJong and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0026563-DeJong1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> created a molecular phylogeny that completely contradicted Mandahl-Barth's four species groups, by showing that <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>, <italic>B. sudanica</italic> and <italic>B. alexandrina</italic> were actually more closely related to each other than to the other species in their respective &#x02018;species groups&#x02019; as defined by Mandahl-Barth. This cluster of <italic>B. sudanica</italic>, <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>, <italic>B. alexandrina</italic> and <italic>B. smithi</italic> was termed the &#x02018;Nilotic species complex&#x02019;; more recent molecular work on East African <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> has supported this clade, although some inconsistencies have been observed when also considering morphology <xref rid="pone.0026563-Plam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-Jrgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In Ugandan Lake Victoria, snails identified, based on morphology, as <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> are considered the main transmitter of the parasite, as no <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-like snails have ever been found naturally infected in that portion of the lake. Indeed, early laboratory studies suggested they might be refractory to infection with <italic>S. mansoni</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0026563-Prentice1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, transmission by <italic>B. sudanica</italic> is common in the Kenyan and, to a lesser extent, Tanzanian portions of Lake Victoria <xref rid="pone.0026563-Magendantz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0026563-Steinauer1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, although much of this evidence is anecdotal rather than formally observed; many studies on <italic>in situ</italic> transmission do not attempt robust identification of the snails observed. Moreover, the relationship between the two species as found in the lake has never been investigated in detail, and certainly not since the advent of molecular tools.</p><p>The desire to identify accurately the species of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> in Lake Victoria is linked directly to the need for greater understanding of the transmission patterns of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> in the lake.

<italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> is also significantly different from all the other morphogroups for the height/width ratio, and from both <italic>B. sudanica</italic> types (the &#x02018;true&#x02019; form and the intermediate forms) in terms of depth 2/width ratio. Otherwise, it is the &#x02018;true&#x02019; <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>-types that were most often significantly different from the other morphotypes. <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> intermediates were not significantly different from the <italic>B. sudanica</italic> intermediates for any of the measurement ratios, and nor were &#x02018;true&#x02019; <italic>B. sudanica</italic> and the <italic>B. sudanica</italic> intermediates. The most striking result came in terms of testing for significance based on habitat: all three ratios were significantly different between snails from the lake habitats versus those from the marsh habitat. The stream habitat was also significantly different from the marsh habitat, when testing the height/width and the depth 2/width ratio.</p><p>The matrix correlation tests between the average pair-wise distances of the morphological measurements and the two different genetic markers were not significant. This means that the groupings seen in the genetic data cannot be significantly correlated to differences in the morphological characters that were analysed, or vice versa.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The combination of the molecular and morphological data suggests that the accepted view of <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> and <italic>B. sudanica</italic> as separate species in Lake Victoria needs to be revised, while the significance of habitat points to a strong environmental influence on phenotype and a reconsideration of the potential zones of transmission along the lakeshore.</p><p>The high levels of variation in both the mitochondrial genes tested were in marked contrast to the negligible variation seen in the ITS region. ITS digests have been used successfully for species identification with South American <italic>Biomphalaria</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0026563-Spatz1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-Vidigal1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>; in this case, the almost uniform nature of the banding patterns for the ITS digest lends weight to the hypothesis that the samples do not represent two distinct species, which was also supported by the genetic distance data.</p><p>The morphological measurements revealed some evidence of groupings that were consistent with the putative field identification as either a <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-or <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>-type snail, although the small number of measurements used should be taken into consideration. Even so, there were also overlaps in morphospace between the two groups, even from type specimens, as in the case of <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> var. <italic>basinulacatus</italic> in the shell measurements and aperture outline PCAs. Overlap of <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> in morphospace with other <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> types has been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0026563-Plam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, but generally <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-type shells are considered easy to distinguish from the rapidly-whorling forms. However, the overlap seen in the shell measurement and aperture outline PCAs between both <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-types and <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> types suggest that statistically the two forms are difficult to differentiate, and in fact intermediate forms may be found on a continuum between the extremes exemplified by the type specimens.</p><p>A very interesting finding was that many of the differences in the average measurements were significant between habitat types. Although causation is far from certain, this evidence could tentatively suggest that habitat might be a factor in driving the morphological plasticity seen in the dataset. Shell shape is known to be strongly environmentally determined in many snail species <xref rid="pone.0026563-Teso1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0026563-Dewitt1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> so it would not be difficult to imagine factors associated with habitat driving ecophenotypic variation in <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> in Lake Victoria.</p><p>Here, the majority of <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-type snails were found in marsh-like habitats, whereas <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>-type snails were located in the lake proper. Of course, many &#x02018;good&#x02019; species are confined to a particular habitat type, and so this finding is not that surprising; however, the genetic evidence showing complete cross-over between these morphotypes suggests that the <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> from Lake Victoria should be considered one, highly diverse species, both in molecular and morphological terms. The &#x02018;species&#x02019; as they appear from putative field identifications could in fact be adaptations, based on some inherent plasticity in morphology, to environmental cues. It has been hypothesized that this has occurred in Lake Albert, as well as elsewhere in Uganda, where snails putatively identified as <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic>, based on shell characters, were in fact molecularly part of the Nilotic species complex <xref rid="pone.0026563-Jrgensen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>; similarly a snail with a typically <italic>B. stanleyi</italic>&#x02013;like morphology from Lake Albert had a DNA sequence that clustered closely with <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0026563-Plam1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In this latter case, it was suggested that the rapidly increasing whorls of the <italic>B. stanleyi</italic> morphotype could be an adaptation to lacustrine conditions; <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>-type snails have a very similar form and as such the same process could be occurring in Lake Victoria.</p><p>The high levels of genetic distance observed between <italic>B. sudanica</italic> elsewhere in Africa as compared with the Lake Victorian samples analysed here has implications for the revision of the nomenclature for these <italic>Biomphalaria. B. sudanica</italic> was actually described in 1870 by von Martens, 9 years before he also described <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>. As such, based on the rules applied by the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iczn.org">www.iczn.org</ext-link>), &#x02018;<italic>B. sudanica&#x02019;</italic> should take precedence over &#x02018;<italic>B. choanomphala&#x02019;</italic>. However, given that <italic>B. sudanica</italic> elsewhere is likely a true species, based on the genetic distance observed between the Lake Victoria samples and those on Genbank, whereas <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> is considered endemic to Lake Victoria, we propose that &#x02018;<italic>B. choanomphala</italic>&#x02019; should take priority. The two different morphotypes, as identified by the main morphological groupings observed by the shell measurement and aperture analyses, should be denoted as variants. As such, <italic>B. choanomphala-</italic>type snails, and close intermediate forms, should be referred to as <italic>B. choanomphala choanomphala</italic> whereas <italic>B. sudanica</italic> and its intermediate forms should be described as <italic>B. c. sudanica</italic>.</p><p>If considered one species, then despite evidence to the contrary from some parts of Lake Victoria <xref rid="pone.0026563-Magendantz1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-Prentice2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, both variants of <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> should be considered equally capable of transmitting <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, until more detailed population-level compatibility experiments prove otherwise. Indeed, informal compatibility experiments were conducted in the field on some of these populations, whereby a local isolate of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia were used to infect snails from sites 5a and 5b (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026563-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026563-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Snails from both sites proved to be compatible with the parasite; after 19&#x02013;25 days, individuals from both site 5a and site 5b started shedding cercariae, which were able to infect laboratory mice, thus proving their viability. However, we believe that until this is shown more completely, it remains important to distinguish between the two morphotypes through their nomenclature, for purposes of experimental design.</p><p>If <italic>B. sudanica</italic> and <italic>B. choanomphala</italic> are two forms of the same species and both equally able to transmit <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, then there are clear implications for the control of intestinal schistosomiasis in humans. To date, many national control programmes have included educational messages alongside mass chemotherapy, in order to change water contact behaviours and reduce exposure to the disease <xref rid="pone.0026563-Stothard2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026563-Fenwick1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. On the whole, the message has focused on reduction of contact with freshly-collected lake water, for example through standing it for 24 hours prior to use, or, as a more long-term strategy, by installing water bores and pumps. However, if <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-type snails are also capable of transmitting, then the habitats that these forms frequent should be considered a high-risk zone for transmission. This includes marsh areas set back from the lake, which are often crossed while going to and from the lake, and where livestock are often grazed. Adding information about the risks of these marsh areas would assist in controlling exposure risk in this &#x02018;new&#x02019; transmission environment. Similarly, in some cases it may be possible and desirable to drain marsh areas, given that they can also be important habitats for mosquito larval development, and thus implicated in the transmission of other diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria. Moves such as this would be an immediate, and highly beneficial, public health effect of this research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Molecular data from two mitochondrial markers (COI and 16S) and one nuclear region (ITS) were amplified from snails from seven sites around Lake Victoria.

The genetic distance across the whole dataset was also evaluated and compared to that within other <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> species, from sequences retrieved from GenBank; mean distances were also calculated between the Lake Victoria dataset and other species, again to ascertain whether levels of genetic distance seen were comparable to intra- or interspecific variation.</p><p>Four separate methods for determining relationships between taxa were used to build branching trees of the mitochondrial data: distance (neighbour-joining), maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. The last 10% of trees were used for calculation of posterior probabilities on the Bayesian inference tree and node support was calculated by bootstrapping using the other three methods (1000 replicates for each).</p><p>In addition, two more neighbour-joining distance trees were created for each mitochondrial gene. These were used to see whether the resultant tree was more or less likely if monophyly of the morphogroups was enforced. The first tree was built with a constraint that all specimens which had been putatively identified as <italic>B. choanomphala</italic>-like be put together in a monophyletic group; the second one's constraint was that all <italic>B. sudanica</italic>-like snails would be monophyletic. The likelihood values of these trees could then be statistically compared to that of the unconstrained COI and 16S trees, to see if there was statistical evidence of either morphotype being a monophyletic grouping.</p><p>The alignments of sequences for both COI and 16S were used to create two minimum spanning distance networks, with a connection limit set to 95%. The abundance of each unique haplotype and the proportion of morphotypes (based on putative field identification) at each node was noted and included in the final network for each gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Morphological methods</title><p>Three separate sets of morphological measurements were taken to compare with the genetic findings. These included conchological measurements, aperture outline analysis and internal morphological measurements. All length measurements were log-transformed prior to further analysis.</p><p>Photos of each shell were taken using a camera attachment to a light microscope and the number of whorls counted on-screen, at high magnification. Shell height, width, depth below the umbilicus (hereafter called &#x02018;depth 1&#x02019;) and depth at the highest point (&#x02018;depth 2&#x02019;) were all measured using digital calipers, accurate to 0.01 mm. The outline of each aperture was marked out with 50 equidistant points were converted into phi functions to describe the shape of the curve. Using specimens that had been removed from their shells in the field and their bodies placed in Raillet's solution, further dissections could be made in order to compare internal anatomy. Samples were dissected under a light microscope to reveal the copulatory structures, and in particular, the penis sheath/preputium and the prostate gland. The lengths of the penis sheath and the preputium were noted using a camera lucida microscope attachment, and the prostate dissected further to count the number of diverticula.</p><p>In addition to the field collected snails from the sites described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0026563-g001">Figure 1</xref>, a number of type specimens from the Berlin Museum f&#x000fc;r Naturkunde were also measured and included in the analysis. These included the single &#x0201c;type&#x0201d; specimens for each species, as well as any holotypes or syntypes that were available (designated &#x0201c;subtypes&#x0201d; in the text). For comparative purposes, field-collected <italic>B. pfeifferi</italic> (from Zambia) and <italic>B. sudanica</italic> from Lake Albert were also included as putative outgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Principal component analysis, ANOVA and matrix correlations</title><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on all three morphological datasets in R <xref rid="pone.0026563-Ihaka1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. ANOVAs were run to test directly for significance between various measurements and the putative species identifications as well as the habitat type of each site. To control for size, ratios were calculated between shell measurements before use in the ANOVA. These were: height/width, depth1/depth2 and depth 2/width. Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test was used to test statistically between the means of the various groupings, also in R <xref rid="pone.0026563-Hayter1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>In order to look for correlation between the various different types of data and even the different types of measurement, distance matrices were constructed and then statistically tested for correlation. For each putative morphological group (&#x02018;<italic>B. choanomphala</italic>&#x02019;, <italic>&#x02018;B.choanomphala</italic>-intermediate&#x02019;, &#x02018;<italic>B. sudanica&#x02019;</italic> or &#x02018;<italic>B. sudanica</italic>-intermediate&#x02019;), the mean eigenvalue score for the first two principal components was calculated by averaging the PCA coordinates from all of the individuals within a morphogroup, and was done separately for each morphological analysis. Pair-wise, Euclidean distances between each of the means of the groups was then determined, creating a matrix that could be compared in a pair-wise fashion to the matrix of genetic distance data, using a Mantel r-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies from the relevant authorities, namely the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST), the Tanzania National Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH) and the Kenya Ministry of Science and Technology.
