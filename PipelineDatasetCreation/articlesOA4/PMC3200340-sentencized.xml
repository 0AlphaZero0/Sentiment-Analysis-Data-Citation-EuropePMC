</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Intestinal schistosomiasis is caused by the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, and is a neglected tropical disease of global importance [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The distribution and burden of the infection is determined to a large extent by the presence of the obligate intermediate hosts of the parasite, which are snails of the genus Biomphalaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Although also present in Latin America and the Middle East, the vast public health burden of S. mansoni falls on Africa; within this context, Lake Victoria is a known regional hotspot. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Given their importance in determining the distribution and exposure risk of intestinal schistosomiasis, Biomphalaria snails (Basommatophora, Planorbidae) have long been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It was noted early on that different species of Biomphalaria appeared to transmit S. mansoni more or less successfully [2], [3]; of the 12 species of Biomphalaria in Africa, none are known to be completely resistant to infection, unlike some of the New World species [4], [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, the African species have not been awarded the same level of research attention as the American Biomphalaria species, and there has long been confusion as to the status of various putative species and sub-species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>An attempt to rectify this taxonomic tangle was made in the late 1950s by Georg Mandahl-Barth, who used a combination of morphological characters to re-classify African Biomphalaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Based on morphology, Mandahl-Barth proposed classifying the African Biomphalaria into four groups: the B. pfeifferi group, the B. choanomphala group, the B. sudanica group and the B. alexandrina group, each with numerous sub-‘species’ [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>More recently, molecular tools have been used to try to elucidate the taxonomy of Biomphalaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>DeJong and colleagues [7] created a molecular phylogeny that completely contradicted Mandahl-Barth's four species groups, by showing that B. choanomphala, B. sudanica and B. alexandrina were actually more closely related to each other than to the other species in their respective ‘species groups’ as defined by Mandahl-Barth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>This cluster of B. sudanica, B. choanomphala, B. alexandrina and B. smithi was termed the ‘Nilotic species complex’; more recent molecular work on East African Biomphalaria has supported this clade, although some inconsistencies have been observed when also considering morphology [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In Ugandan Lake Victoria, snails identified, based on morphology, as B. choanomphala are considered the main transmitter of the parasite, as no B. sudanica-like snails have ever been found naturally infected in that portion of the lake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Indeed, early laboratory studies suggested they might be refractory to infection with S. mansoni [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, transmission by B. sudanica is common in the Kenyan and, to a lesser extent, Tanzanian portions of Lake Victoria [11]–[13], although much of this evidence is anecdotal rather than formally observed; many studies on in situ transmission do not attempt robust identification of the snails observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the relationship between the two species as found in the lake has never been investigated in detail, and certainly not since the advent of molecular tools. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The desire to identify accurately the species of Biomphalaria in Lake Victoria is linked directly to the need for greater understanding of the transmission patterns of S. mansoni in the lake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Intestinal schistosomiasis is rife in communities living by the lakeshore [14]–[16] and by understanding the dynamics of the snails responsible for transmission it will be possible to identify possible exposure hot-spots, and direct treatment and education interventions to these areas. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>However, the overlap seen in the shell measurement and aperture outline PCAs between both B. sudanica-types and B. choanomphala types suggest that statistically the two forms are difficult to differentiate, and in fact intermediate forms may be found on a continuum between the extremes exemplified by the type specimens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>A very interesting finding was that many of the differences in the average measurements were significant between habitat types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Although causation is far from certain, this evidence could tentatively suggest that habitat might be a factor in driving the morphological plasticity seen in the dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Shell shape is known to be strongly environmentally determined in many snail species [19]–[22] so it would not be difficult to imagine factors associated with habitat driving ecophenotypic variation in Biomphalaria in Lake Victoria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Here, the majority of B. sudanica-type snails were found in marsh-like habitats, whereas B. choanomphala-type snails were located in the lake proper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Of course, many ‘good’ species are confined to a particular habitat type, and so this finding is not that surprising; however, the genetic evidence showing complete cross-over between these morphotypes suggests that the Biomphalaria from Lake Victoria should be considered one, highly diverse species, both in molecular and morphological terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>The ‘species’ as they appear from putative field identifications could in fact be adaptations, based on some inherent plasticity in morphology, to environmental cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that this has occurred in Lake Albert, as well as elsewhere in Uganda, where snails putatively identified as B. pfeifferi, based on shell characters, were in fact molecularly part of the Nilotic species complex [9]; similarly a snail with a typically B. stanleyi–like morphology from Lake Albert had a DNA sequence that clustered closely with B. pfeifferi [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In this latter case, it was suggested that the rapidly increasing whorls of the B. stanleyi morphotype could be an adaptation to lacustrine conditions; B. choanomphala-type snails have a very similar form and as such the same process could be occurring in Lake Victoria. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>The high levels of genetic distance observed between B. sudanica elsewhere in Africa as compared with the Lake Victorian samples analysed here has implications for the revision of the nomenclature for these Biomphalaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>B. sudanica was actually described in 1870 by von Martens, 9 years before he also described B. choanomphala. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>As such, based on the rules applied by the International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iczn.org">www.iczn.org</ext-link>), ‘B. sudanica’ should take precedence over ‘B. choanomphala’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>However, given that B. sudanica elsewhere is likely a true species, based on the genetic distance observed between the Lake Victoria samples and those on Genbank, whereas B. choanomphala is considered endemic to Lake Victoria, we propose that ‘B. choanomphala’ should take priority. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>The two different morphotypes, as identified by the main morphological groupings observed by the shell measurement and aperture analyses, should be denoted as variants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>As such, B. choanomphala-type snails, and close intermediate forms, should be referred to as B. choanomphala choanomphala whereas B. sudanica and its intermediate forms should be described as B. c. sudanica. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>If considered one species, then despite evidence to the contrary from some parts of Lake Victoria [11], [23], both variants of Biomphalaria should be considered equally capable of transmitting S. mansoni, until more detailed population-level compatibility experiments prove otherwise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>Indeed, informal compatibility experiments were conducted in the field on some of these populations, whereby a local isolate of S. mansoni miracidia were used to infect snails from sites 5a and 5b (see Table 1 and Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Snails from both sites proved to be compatible with the parasite; after 19–25 days, individuals from both site 5a and site 5b started shedding cercariae, which were able to infect laboratory mice, thus proving their viability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>However, we believe that until this is shown more completely, it remains important to distinguish between the two morphotypes through their nomenclature, for purposes of experimental design. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>If B. sudanica and B. choanomphala are two forms of the same species and both equally able to transmit S. mansoni, then there are clear implications for the control of intestinal schistosomiasis in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>To date, many national control programmes have included educational messages alongside mass chemotherapy, in order to change water contact behaviours and reduce exposure to the disease [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>On the whole, the message has focused on reduction of contact with freshly-collected lake water, for example through standing it for 24 hours prior to use, or, as a more long-term strategy, by installing water bores and pumps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>However, if B. sudanica-type snails are also capable of transmitting, then the habitats that these forms frequent should be considered a high-risk zone for transmission. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>This includes marsh areas set back from the lake, which are often crossed while going to and from the lake, and where livestock are often grazed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>Adding information about the risks of these marsh areas would assist in controlling exposure risk in this ‘new’ transmission environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in some cases it may be possible and desirable to drain marsh areas, given that they can also be important habitats for mosquito larval development, and thus implicated in the transmission of other diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Moves such as this would be an immediate, and highly beneficial, public health effect of this research. </plain></SENT>
