In comparison, the fate of pathogens after the death of their host receives less attention. We studied <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) infection of an insect host, and show that NprR, a quorum sensor, is active after death of the insect and allows <italic>Bt</italic> to survive in the cadavers as vegetative cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NprR regulates at least 41 genes, including many encoding degradative enzymes or proteins involved in the synthesis of a nonribosomal peptide named kurstakin. These degradative enzymes are essential <italic>in vitro</italic> to degrade several substrates and are specifically expressed after host death suggesting that <italic>Bt</italic> has an active necrotrophic lifestyle in the cadaver. We show that kurstakin is essential for <italic>Bt</italic> survival during necrotrophic development. It is required for swarming mobility and biofilm formation, presumably through a pore forming activity. A <italic>nprR</italic> deficient mutant does not develop necrotrophically and does not sporulate efficiently in the cadaver. We report that necrotrophism is a highly regulated mechanism essential for the <italic>Bt</italic> infectious cycle, contributing to spore spreading.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>
<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) is a well known entomopathogenic bacterium successfully used as a biopesticide for fifty years. The insecticidal properties of <italic>Bt</italic> are mainly due to specific toxins forming a crystal inclusion associated with the spore. After ingestion by susceptible insect larvae, toxins could induce favorable conditions for spore germination. The bacteria multiply in the insect and coordinate their behavior using signaling molecules involved in quorum sensing. The activation of the quorum sensor PlcR leads to the production of virulence factors allowing the bacteria to kill the insect host. Here we show that, in the cadaver, <italic>Bt</italic> shifts from a virulent to a necrotrophic lifestyle during which a second quorum sensor (NprR) becomes functional. NprR activates genes encoding degradative enzymes (proteases, lipases and chitinases) and a lipopeptide (kurstakin) involved in swarming and biofilm formation. The kurstakin is also essential for the survival of <italic>Bt</italic> after insect death. This suggests that NprR allows the bacteria to survive and eventually to sporulate in the host cadaver, thus improving their ability to disseminate in the environment. Altogether these results show that the pathogenic and necrotrophic lifestyles of <italic>Bt</italic> are tightly controlled by two quorum-sensing systems acting sequentially during the infection process.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Saprophytism, probably one of the most common lifestyle for micro-organisms, involves living in dead or decaying organic matter. For most pathogens, saprophytism is limited to necrotrophism (the use of the host cadaver). This step of the infection process is essential for the proliferation and horizontal transmission of these microorganisms (transfer of infection within a single generation) <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, there have been very few studies addressing this major issue. The transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle implies substantial metabolic changes for microorganisms <xref rid="ppat.1002629-ToledoArana1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The death of the host is a critical event which compels the micro-organisms to cope with a new series of challenges: competition with the commensal organisms and opportunistic incomers, stress, and nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, necrotrophism is likely to be highly regulated.</p><p>The insect pathogen <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (<italic>Bt</italic>) is a suitable model for studying the time course of the infection process, including necrotrophism in the insect cadaver. <italic>Bt</italic> is an ubiquitous spore-forming bacterium belonging to the <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<italic>Bc</italic>) group <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Ivanova1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Its spores are found in a large variety of environments, such as soils, dead and living insects and plant phylloplane <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, <italic>Bt</italic> probably does not grow in soil and reports of natural epizootic episodes are very rare <xref rid="ppat.1002629-VilasBoas1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Unlike soil bacteria, such as <italic>Streptomyces spp</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>Bc</italic> group genomes contain a large number of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Ivanova1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is therefore likely that <italic>Bt</italic> multiplies in the host cadaver <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>Bt</italic> carries plasmids encoding specific insecticidal toxins responsible for their insecticidal properties <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Schnepf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. <italic>Bt</italic> spores and toxins are ingested by larvae, and the toxins bind to specific receptors on the midgut epithelial cells, inducing cell lysis and creating favorable conditions for the development of the bacteria <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Du1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The vegetative bacteria multiply in the insect hemocoel and cause septicemia <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Raymond1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Salamitou1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. <italic>Bt</italic> also harbors genes encoding exported virulence factors including enterotoxins, hemolysins, phospholipases and proteases <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Agaisse1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The transcription of most of these virulence genes in bacteria growing in a rich medium is activated at the onset of stationary phase by the quorum-sensing system PlcR-PapR <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Slamti1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Gohar1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

In sharp contrast, the expression of the PlcR-regulated genes is repressed when the bacteria enter sporulation <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Lereclus1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the stationary phase secretome of <italic>Bt</italic> and <italic>B. anthracis</italic> (<italic>Ba</italic>) growing in a sporulation medium is mainly composed of the metalloprotease NprA <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Chitlaru1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. NprA (also designated NprB and Npr599 in <italic>Ba</italic>) cleaves tissue components such as fibronectin, laminin and collagen, thus displaying characteristics of pathogenic factors <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Transcription of <italic>nprA</italic> is activated during the late stationary phase by the regulator NprR <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. NprR is a quorum sensor activated by its cognate signaling peptide, NprX. NprR-NprX functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system: the pro-signaling peptide NprX is exported from the cell, and after being processed to its active form is reimported, and binds to NprR allowing the recognition of its DNA target and the activation of <italic>nprA</italic> transcription <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The first stages of <italic>Bt</italic> infection are relatively well documented, but the fate of the bacteria after death of the host remains unclear.

We therefore investigated i) whether NprR was involved in the sporulation process of <italic>Bt</italic> in the insect cadaver, and ii) whether sporulation is responsible for the survival of the bacteria in the insect cadaver. We compared the sporulation efficiencies of the wt and &#x00394;RX strains in both LB and sporulation-specific medium (HCT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s006">Table S2</xref>). In HCT, the sporulation efficiencies of the two strains were similar. However, in LB medium, the total number of viable spores of the &#x00394;RX strain was half that for the wt strain (8.30&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>
<italic>vs</italic> 1.58&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup>), suggesting that NprR is involved in the sporulation of <italic>Bt</italic> in rich medium. Next, we monitored the counts of wt and &#x00394;RX strain spores in insect larvae over 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s006">Table S2</xref>). For the wt strain, heat-resistant spores were detected 24 h after injection and their number increased until 48 h. From 48 h to 96 h, the number of spores remained stable and represented one third of the total bacterial population. The large number of non sporulated bacteria 96 h after the death of the insect suggests that sporulation was not the main mechanism allowing <italic>Bt</italic> to survive. For the &#x00394;RX strain, less than one percent of the bacterial population was heat-resistant spores throughout the infection process. The decrease in the number of heat-resistant spores from 48 h to 72 h is likely due to the germination of the spores. We suspected that the low number of spores is not a cause but a consequence of the inability of the &#x00394;RX strain to survive in the insect cadaver. To test this idea, we tested the survival of a <italic>sigK</italic>-deficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2C</xref>): SigK is a sigma factor involved in the transcription of late sporulation genes in the mother cell, and <italic>sigK</italic>-deficient strains are not able to form viable spores <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Hilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Bravo1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The total population of the <italic>sigK</italic> strain in the insect cadaver was similar to the total population of the wt strain, indicating that NprR ensures the survival of <italic>Bt</italic> by a process independent of sporulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>NprR is a pleiotropic regulator involved in the necrotrophic development of <italic>Bt</italic> in the insect cadaver</title><p>The only gene described as being controlled by NprR was <italic>nprA</italic>. Therefore, we monitored the survival of a &#x00394;<italic>nprA</italic> strain in infected larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The survival of the wt and &#x00394;<italic>nprA</italic> strains was similar throughout the experiment, suggesting that other NprR-regulated genes are involved in bacterial survival. Microarray analysis was used to identify other NprR-regulated genes. Gene expression ratios between the wt and the &#x00394;RX strains were determined 3 h after the onset of stationary phase (t3), when <italic>nprA</italic> transcription increases sharply <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Perchat1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. For 107 genes, this expression ratio was greater than 2 (p&#x0003c;0.05) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-TABM-790</ext-link>), suggesting that NprR has a direct or indirect effect on their transcription. Thirty-nine genes, with a relative expression ratio greater than 4, and a significance value (p) smaller than 0.01, were considered for subsequent analysis. The genes matching probes for BC2622, a macrolide glycosyltransferase, and BC3725, an exochitinase, were also investigated due to their functional similarity to the genes fulfilling these criteria. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that these 41 genes were at least four times up- or downregulated. Fusions to <italic>lacZ</italic> were constructed for nine of these genes and used to confirm that they are differentially regulated in the &#x00394;RX mutant and wt strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The expression kinetics of these genes were similar, with a sharp increase of expression after the onset of stationary phase. The final list of NprR-regulated genes is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s007">Table S3</xref>. Of the 41 genes directly or indirectly regulated by NprR, 37 were down-regulated in the &#x00394;RX strain, suggesting that NprR primarily acts as a transcriptional activator. The subcellular localizations of the products of these genes were assessed: 46&#x00025; were cytoplasmic, 20&#x00025; were associated with the membrane and 34&#x00025; were extracellular or associated with the cell wall. The NprR-regulated genes can be distributed into four functional groups. The first group is composed of genes encoding proteins potentially involved in stress resistance: they include the genes for cytochrome P450 (BC2613), cysteine dioxygenase (BC2617), and Transporter Drug/Metabolite exporter family members (BC1063). The second group is a four-gene locus encoding the oligopeptide permease system Opp required for the import of small peptides into the cell.

Consequently, the amount of signaling peptide was insufficient to activate NprR-regulated genes in the wt, resulting in clearance of both populations.

We show here that another quorum sensor, NprR, is active after host death and is necessary for <italic>Bt</italic> to survive in the insect cadaver. NprR is a pleiotropic regulator directly or indirectly affecting the expression of at least 41 genes during the stationary phase. About 30&#x00025; of the NprR-regulated genes encode extracellular or cell wall-associated proteins involved in the degradation of proteins, lipids and chitin. We report that <italic>nprA</italic> and two other NprR-regulated genes encoding degradative enzymes were expressed after death of the host.

Insect cuticles are made of chitin filaments arranged within a protein matrix which constitutes a physical barrier to the outside environment. Degradative enzymes may degrade this barrier and facilitate spore and toxin release into the environment. Degradative enzymes may also participate in cell protection against competitors. For example, the endochitinase ChiCW was reported as having antifungal properties <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and InhA3 (BC2984) is a member of the Immune Inhibitor A metalloprotease family, which plays a key role in the resistance to the host immune defenses by degrading antimicrobial peptides <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Dalhammar1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Ramarao1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Guillemet1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.

This molecule acts as a signal triggering multicellularity: one subpopulation of bacterial cells produces surfactin and another responds to it by producing extracellular matrix. Here, we show that kurstakin may similarly induce potassium leakage across the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>Bt</italic>. In addition, bioassays in <italic>G. mellonella</italic> indicate that at least two bacterial subpopulations coexist after host death: one subpopulation enters into sporulation, while the other remains in a vegetative form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and expresses the NprR-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

A putative efflux system (BC1063), two macrolide glycosyl transferases (BC2066 and BC2622) and a N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase could be involved in resistance to antimicrobial molecules, and cytochrome P450 (BC2613) may be involved in resistance to reactive oxygen species. The membrane-associated proteins are mainly components of an oligopeptide permease system (Opp) involved in the uptake of PapR, the signaling peptide required for PlcR activation <xref rid="ppat.1002629-Gominet1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The operon encoding this Opp system is downregulated by NprR suggesting that NprR controls PlcR expression negatively through the Opp system. Interestingly, <italic>nprA</italic> expression was only slightly reduced in a <italic>oppB</italic> mutant strain suggesting that another oligopeptide permease system is involved for the uptake of NprX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002629.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Consequently, a down-regulation of the <italic>opp</italic> genes could not have a significant effect on the expression of the NprR-regulated genes. Possibly, the extracellular concentration of NprX is a signal triggering the transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle. During the early stage of infection, the PlcR regulon is expressed and the extracellular concentration of NprX might be low. Indeed, recent results indicate that <italic>nprX</italic> transcription starts in late stationary phase (TD, SP, DL, unpublished data). In view of these data, we hypothesize that after the host death, the extracellular concentration of NprX increases, leading to the expression of NprR-regulated genes and repression of the PlcR regulon <italic>via</italic> the Opp transporter. These various observations indicate that the necrotrophic lifestyle of <italic>Bt</italic> is a complex developmental stage, not limited to simple feeding on the host contents. They also imply that the transition from a pathogenic to a necrotrophic lifestyle is associated with significant metabolic changes.</p><p>It is becoming clear that the infectious cycle of <italic>Bt</italic> can be divided into four distinct and sequential phases starting with toxemia caused by the Cry proteins, followed by the action of PlcR in virulence, necrotrophism and the completion of the sporulation process involving NprR, and finally the dissemination of spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002629-g007">Figure 7</xref>).
