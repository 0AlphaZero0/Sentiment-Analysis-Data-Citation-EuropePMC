</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Linking DNA polymorphism to trait phenotypic variation is an increasingly important tool for plant breeding programs (Lande and Thompson 1990). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Historically, segregating populations of a particular cross have been used to identify marker-trait associations (e.g., Stuber et al. 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>More recently, association mapping has shown promise for trait mapping due to the increased access to abundant molecular markers in many crops (Stich et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Association mapping takes advantage of the fact that historical recombination within a population has decreased linkage disequilibrium (LD) to short chromosomal intervals, enabling potentially statistically strong and robust marker-trait associations to be detected (Jannink and Walsh 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In association mapping, existing allele variation within an entire population can be more efficiently represented because mapping is conducted directly in breeding populations (Hirschhorn and Daly 2005; Remington et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In general, the precision of locating a QTL is much higher in association panels compared to biparental mapping populations, provided sufficient markers are available to detect the QTL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>If LD extends over long distances, however, the biparental mapping approach is more powerful to detect the existence of a QTL, particularly if marker numbers are limited (Mackay and Powell 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Two major drawbacks exist in association mapping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>First, false positive associations between markers and traits can be obtained due to the presence of population structure (Aranzana et al. 2005; Lander and Schork 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>However, population structure can be assessed with marker information from genome-wide genetic markers (such as SSRs), and association tests can then be conditioned on the population structure to reduce the false positive rate (Aranzana et al. 2005; Pritchard et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Second, the extent of LD plays a practical role in determining the number of markers needed to detect associations between genotype and phenotype (Rafalski and Morgante 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Limited LD in the population means that associations will only be detected between alleles at loci close together, requiring many markers to saturate the genome (Hagenblad and Nordborg 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>When the limiting factor for association mapping is the absence of a sufficiently large number of markers evenly dispersed throughout the genome, an alternative strategy is to assay variation in candidate genes (Neale and Savolainen 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>For both cases, the design and use of association studies require knowledge of the LD structure in the genome (Oraguzie et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Alfalfa is one of the most important forage legumes in the world (Quiros and Bauchan 1988; Michaud et al. 1988), and has been proposed as a bioenergy crop (Delong et al. 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Alfalfa has potential to produce high yield but genetic improvement for yield is not as high as has been realized for the major grain crops (Hill et al. 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Digestion of forage for animal nutrition or for cellulosic bioethanol production requires the effective hydrolysis of cellulose and solubilization of hemicellulose in the presence of lignin (U.S. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>DOE 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Reducing lignin content can increase the efficiency of sugar release from cell wall complexes up to two fold (Chen and Dixon 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Therefore, improving biomass yield and modifying the plant’s cell wall composition are two breeding targets important for both forage and biofeedstock (Ragauskas et al. 2006) applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>If QTL associated with yield and cell wall components could be identified, they could be incorporated into modern cultivars enhancing the efficiency of alfalfa breeding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Cultivated alfalfa is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) domesticated from the Medicago sativa–falcata complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Autotetraploidy complicates genetic mapping, but diploid (2n = 2x = 16) relatives of alfalfa exist that share the same karyotype, have highly syntenic genetic linkage groups, and can be hybridized with tetraploid individuals (Diwan et al. 2000; McCoy and Bingham 1988; Quiros and Bauchan 1988). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The diploid members of the complex include M. sativa subsp. falcata, M. sativa subsp. caerulea, and their natural hybrid, M. sativa subsp. hemicycla (Quiros and Bauchan 1988; Havananda et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The genomewide extent of LD in the M. sativa–falcata complex has previously been estimated in one tetraploid breeding population using SSR markers (Li et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Within gene LD was estimated in a set of different tetraploid breeding populations using two regions of the alfalfa gene homologous to M. truncatulaCONSTANS-LIKE gene (Herrmann et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>However, both of these populations are expected to have had reduced recombination due to breeding efforts compared to a broad-based natural population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we assess both chromosome-wide estimates of LD in a population consisting of 374 unimproved diploid alfalfa genotypes from 120 accessions using 89 polymorphic SSR loci distributed throughout genome and within gene estimates of LD in sequences of four candidate genes of the lignin biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated SSR and candidate gene SNP marker polymorphisms for associations with 23 traits relevant to biomass accumulation and cell wall components. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>Sequence reads were assembled for each individual using Lasergene’s SeqMan program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) to produce seven contigs for each individual (Fig. 2).

<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Herrmann et al. (2010) used cultivated material in which LD could persist over longer distances due to bottlenecks produced by artificial selection (Ching et al. 2002; Liu and Burke 2006; Kolkman et al. 2007), where as we used broad-based wild germplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>The difference in the extent of LD between different genetic materials has previously been reported in other crops (Caldwell et al. 2006; Liu and Burke 2006). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>We identified one SSR marker, and three SNPs associated with biomass yield, stem proportions, regrowth, and stem thickness but no associations with cell wall composition traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Given the relative paucity of SSR markers we examined and the limited number of individuals (and few genes) in our candidate gene analysis, this lack of association is not surprising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>The CCoAoMT SNP in position of 111 associated with several traits is located in the first intron and although it is not in linkage disequilibrium with any SNPs in the first exon or downstream of this site, it may be linked to causative SNPs in the promoter region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The F5H exon 2 SNP associated with yield in 2008 is a synonymous change; however, LD does not decay within the region we sequenced, so this SNP may be linked functionally to an unsampled causative SNP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The nature of each of these associations needs to be investigated further and validated in additional alfalfa populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Successful candidate gene association mapping studies have generally focused on genes from single pathways (Myles et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>Despite evidence that the lignin biosynthetic genes CCoAoMT and F5H directly impact the lignin content of alfalfa (Guo et al. 2001; Chen and Dixon 2007), our candidate gene approach did not detect any associations with the cell wall characteristics measured, which were based on fiber analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Weak associations between lignin genes and both yield traits and cell wall components have been reported previously from maize inbred lines by Chen et al. (2010), who concluded that qualitative trait polymorphisms for yield and cell wall characteristics segregate independently of one another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The phenylpropanoid pathway, of which lignin is one of many products, has several components that have been linked to plant growth. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In summary, in this paper we attempt to estimate both genome-wide SSR and within gene SNP variation to determine the extent of LD in diploid alfalfa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In terms of the potential to use the candidate gene approach for allele mining for alfalfa improvement, we have shown that although our sample size was small, two significant SNPs in two candidate genes that are associated with biomass yield and other traits were detected. </plain></SENT>
