</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The care of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) should focus not only on glucose control but also on management of complications such as heart disease, dyslipidemia, obesity, and cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the prevalence of adult diabetes has been rising globally [1,2] and the economic and social burdens of diabetes threaten the world's health systems [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It has been demonstrated that metabolic surgery resolves T2DM in morbidly obese patients [5-7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In contrast, whether metabolic surgery is effective in nonmorbidly obese patients still remains to be solved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Asian people develop T2DM at a younger age with a lesser degree of obesity, and tend to have the complications and die earlier [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>As life expectancy is increased, the number of patients with gastric cancer and T2DM is increased as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It was noticed that gastric resection induce the resolution of T2DM in non-morbidly obese patients [10-12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Recently, we studied the outcome of T2DM after gastrectomy and conventional reconstruction in non obese gastric cancer patients [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The study was a large-series retrospective study including about 400 patients and only 15.1% were resolved from T2DM after operation, which were not satisfactory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This prompted us to develop a effective reconstruction method for diabetic control after gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients with non obese T2DM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>We grafted the bariatric type operation, long-limb Roux-en Y reconstruction into gastric cancer surgery. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Calorie restriction and/or weight loss are one of many effective ways to control T2DM in morbidly obese patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>However, calorie restriction and/or weight loss are not easy in non obese patients, and Asian people develop T2DM with a lesser degree of obesity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>The early recovery course and mismatched degree of T2DM improvement after gastric bypass compared with equivalent weight loss from other treatment modalities implicate weight-independent effects of bariatric surgery on glucose metabolism [6,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>In addition, some reported that non-morbidly obese patient with T2DM can be recovered after bariatric surgery [20-25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that surgery might induce remission even in non obese T2DM patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>We had studied the long-term results of gastrectomy and conventional reconstruction in non obese T2DM patients with gastric cancer [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>It was a very large scale study and the complete remission was only 27.3% even though in total gastrectomy and Roux-en Y esophagojejunostomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>There were some reports that demonstrate the effect of subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en Y gastrojejunostomy on T2DM in non obese patients, but the remission rate was still not high [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Before we started this study, we tried some modifications of Roux limb length after gastrectomy and were not able to control glucose homeostasis without medications in gastric cancer and T2DM patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested the safety and efficacy of Roux-en Y reconstruction with a 100-cm biliopancreatic limb and a 100-cm Roux limb after gastrectomy in T2DM gastric cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>The main difference with previous reports was the longer length of biliopancreatic and Roux limbs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Among 15 patients enrolled in this study, 9 patients received laparoscopic surgery with two anastomotic stricture or kinking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>We assumed that this complication was related with technical failure in the learning period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Rearrangement of the intestine and/or modification of the stomach might induce functional obstruction of the small bowel and metabolic problems such as vitamin and trace element deficiencies [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Longer length of a Roux limb has been suggested to be effective in super obese patients without significant complications [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that there was no Roux stasis syndrome, anemia and hypoalbuminemia after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Some patients complained of frequent diarrhea after eating fatty food, but normal diet was tolerable without malnutrition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>In addition, most patients maintained their weight within normal range after surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of antidiabetic effects after gastrointestinal surgery are not yet fully characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Except effects due to weight loss and calorie restriction, exclusion of the proximal small intestine from ingested nutrient, enhanced distal-intestinal nutrient delivery, impaired ghrelin secretion, modulations of intestinal nutrient sensing and regulation of insulin sensitivity, bile acid perturbations, changes in gut microbiota and other changes were proposed [19,28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Our study showed that all of patients who received total gastectomy and/or chemotherapy stop the anti-diabetic medication with normal glucose level and these might result from weight loss or calorie restriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>However, seven among ten patients who received subtotal gastrectomy without chemotherapy demonstrated normal glucose control after operation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>In this study, bypassed segments of the small bowel were longer than conventional Roux-en Y reconstruction after gastrectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>Also, nutrient stimulation of lower intestinal hormones (e.g., GLP-1) might be enhanced in the patients of this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>It was beyond the scope of this study to elucidate the mechanism by which T2DM was resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>However, insulin secretion was significantly improved after surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>We were afraid that the β cell function in non obese T2DM patients was decreased and such decrease might be irreversible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, animal experiments demonstrated that T2DM in lean T2DM rats can be improved by rearrangement of the gastrointestinal tract without significant weight loss [29,30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, these results are consistent with some human trials [20,21,24,25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Now, we suggest that even when weight is maintained within the normal range, T2DM is still reversible in non obese patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>In this study, the improvement of insulin sensitivity was not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>A long term follow-up study with increased enrolled patients is warranted to elucidate the improvement of insulin sensitivity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Taken together, we considered that long limb Roux-en Y reconstruction is feasible and has the potential to cure T2DM in gastric cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This was a pilot study and the duration of follow-up was short. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>To confirm the effectiveness of long limb Roux-en Y procedure, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed and our results will be helpful to design the RCT. </plain></SENT>
