<italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is the leading cause of health-care associated diarrhea worldwide. <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections begin when its spores transform into vegetative cells during a process called germination. In <italic>Clostridium</italic> sp., germination requires that the spore cortex, a thick, protective layer, be removed by the cortex hydrolase SleC. While previous studies have shown that SleC activity depends on a subtilisin-like protease, CspB, the mechanisms regulating CspB function have not been characterized. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the Csp family of proteases and identified its key functional regions. We determined that CspB carries a unique jellyroll domain required for stabilizing the protein both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in <italic>C. difficile</italic> and a prodomain required for proper folding of the protease. Unlike all other prokaryotic subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain remains bound to CspB and inhibits its protease activity until the germination signal is sensed. Our study provides new insight into how germination is regulated in <italic>C. difficile</italic> and may inform the development of inhibitors that can prevent germination and thus <italic>C. difficile</italic> transmission.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was partially funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_category.aspx?id=194">http://www.pewtrusts.org/our_work_category.aspx?id=194</ext-link>), start-up funds from Award Number P20RR021905 from the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences, and Award Number R00GM092934 from the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences.

Thus, spores are the primary vectors for transmission <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Deakin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the cause of recurrent infections, the latter of which occurs in &#x0223c;25% of cases and can lead to severe CDAD <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Leffler1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Maroo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In order to initiate an infection, <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores ingested from the environment must germinate into toxin-producing vegetative cells in the intestinal tract <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Carroll1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Rupnik1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Burns1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Similar to other spore-forming bacteria, <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores germinate specifically in response to small molecules known as germinants <xref rid="ppat.1003165-ParedesSabja1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Setlow2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

While germinants have been identified for a number of bacterial species, the molecular events that occur upon germinant sensing remain poorly characterized <xref rid="ppat.1003165-ParedesSabja1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Setlow2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Moir1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Shortly after germinant addition, cortex hydrolases become activated and degrade the spore cortex, a thick protective layer of modified peptidoglycan. Because the cortex maintains the spore in a dehydrated, metabolically dormant state, the removal of this physical constraint is essential for germination to proceed and metabolism to resume in the spore core <xref rid="ppat.1003165-ParedesSabja1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Setlow2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Moir1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Nevertheless, despite the importance of cortex hydrolysis, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate cortex hydrolase activity.</p><p>In the Clostridia, the primary cortex hydrolase appears to be SleC, since disruption of <italic>sleC</italic> in both <italic>C. difficile</italic>

We also present the first crystal structure of the conserved Csp family of proteases at 1.6 &#x000c5; resolution and define its key structural domains. These biochemical and mutational analyses reveal that, in contrast to previously characterized prokaryotic subtilases, wildtype CspB forms a stable complex with its prodomain. Similar to other subtilases <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Shinde2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the prodomain acts as both an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of CspB protease activity.

In order to determine whether CspBA is produced as a fusion protein, we raised antibodies against the CspB portion of CspBA and analyzed CspB production in both sporulating cells and purified spores by Western blotting.

One possibility is that a redundant protease cleaves SleC during germination of S461A mutant spores. Another possibility is that CspB activates a second protease that directly cleaves SleC. While this latter model is more complicated, it reflects how the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase PCSK9 indirectly regulates low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) levels. Rather than enzymatically degrading LDLR, PCSK9 binds and targets LDLR to the lysosome <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Seidah1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Seidah2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.

Combined with our functional analyses of CspB <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, the structure reveals that Csps are subtilisin-like proteases with two distinctive functional features: a central jellyroll domain and a retained prodomain.</p><p>The central &#x003b2;-barrel jellyroll domain of CspB interrupts the subtilase domain and wedges itself tightly between the subtilase domain and prodomain in three-dimensional space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This unique position is likely critical for CspB function, since the jellyroll domain markedly restrains the conformational mobility of CspB through extensive and specific interactions at the subtilase-jellyroll domain interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003165.s005">S5</xref>).

The jellyroll domain also facilitates CspB autoprocessing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicative of a role in helping CspB adopt the correct subtilase fold.

Unlike the majority of subtilisin-like proteases, the prodomain stays bound to the wildtype subtilase domain via a network of interactions that result in tighter prodomain binding relative to other subtilases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003165.s005">S5</xref>).

Despite the low level of sequence conservation, the position of prodomain autoprocessing is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and a small internal deletion of the prodomain disrupts autocleavage even though diverse residues are tolerated at the P1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, Csps exhibit less specificity in P1 substrate recognition than most subtilases <xref rid="ppat.1003165-Benjannet1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1003165-Takahashi1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.

Recent data suggests that CspC helps transduce the germination signal to CspB (J. Sorg, personal communication). In addition, it is unclear what fraction of pro-SleC must be proteolytically activated to induce successful spore germination. Approximately 5% of spores of the CspBA catalytic mutant S461A successfully germinate, which correlates with a small fraction of pro-SleC undergoing processing in the mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003165-g008">Figure 8</xref>).
