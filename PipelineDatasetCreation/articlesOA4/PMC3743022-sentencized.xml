<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The low efficiency and heterogeneity of most methods have hindered understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms promoting, and roadblocks preventing, efficient reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While several intermediate populations have been described1-7, it has proved difficult to characterize the rare, asynchronous transition from these intermediate stages to iPSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rapid expansion of a minor population of reprogrammed cells can also obscure investigation of relevant processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Understanding of the biological mechanisms essential for successful iPSC generation requires both accurate capture of cells undergoing the reprogramming process and identification of the associated global gene expression changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that reprogramming follows an orderly sequence of stage transitions marked by changes in cell surface markers CD44 and ICAM1, and a Nanog-GFP reporter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of these populations demonstrates two waves of pluripotency gene up-regulation, and unexpectedly, transient up-regulation of multiple epidermis-related genes, demonstrating that reprogramming is not simply the reversal of normal developmental processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This novel high-resolution analysis enables the construction of a detailed reprogramming route map, and this improved understanding of the reprogramming process will lead to novel reprogramming strategies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P2"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several reports have suggested that reprogramming progresses in a somewhat ordered manner3,5,6,8-10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In order to identify markers whose expression changed concurrent with pluripotency gene expression we performed time course microarray analysis using a piggyBac (PB) transposon-based secondary (2°) reprogramming system3,11 (Supplementary Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of a number of candidate cell surface markers, Cd44 and Icam1 demonstrated the most dynamic expression changes throughout 2° MEF reprogramming (Supplementary Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For further investigation we generated an efficient 2° reprogramming system in which doxycycline (dox) mediated induction of the reprogramming factors could be monitored via an mOrange reporter placed after the 2A-peptide-linked reprogramming cassette c-Myc-Klf4-Oct4-Sox2 (MKOS)12, and endogenous Nanog promoter activation could be followed by expression of EGFP13 (Supplementary Figures 3,4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Reprogramming cultures were supplemented with Vitamin C (VitC) and an Alk inhibitor (Alki) which enhance reprogramming efficiency10,14,15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In this 2° reprogramming system, Nanog-GFP+ cells appeared as early as day 6, and &gt;60% of mOrange+ transgene expressing cells were found to be Nanog-GFP+ by day 12 (Supplementary Figure 5a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most mOrange+ transgene expressing cells lost Thy1 and gained E-cadherin expression by day4 (Supplementary Figures 5b,c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>SSEA-1 expression barely changed after day 8, with a gradual gain of Nanog-GFP+ cells in both SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1− populations (Supplementary Figure 5d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Consistent with heterogeneous expression of SSEA1 in iPSCs/ESCs, it was not possible to accurately delineate the reprogramming process using SSEA-1 (Supplementary Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the appearance of CD44− and ICAM1+ cells at later time points closely correlated with Nanog-GFP expression (Supplementary Figures 5e,f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Double staining for CD44 and ICAM1 revealed that a distinct series of population changes occur during reprogramming (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Initially, MEFs displayed high CD44 and broad ICAM1 expression with the majority becoming ICAM1− by day 6, along with the appearance of a minor CD44− ICAM1− population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>By day 8, CD44− populations appeared enriched, and at day 12 almost all cells displayed an iPSC/ESC-like CD44− ICAM1+ profile, over 60% of which expressed Nanog-GFP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Consistent with an observation that Nanog expression is not necessarily a sign of completed reprogramming16, Nanog-GFP+ cells were observed even before cells obtained this iPSC/ESC-like phenotype (CD44− ICAM1+). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Both ICAM1+ and ICAM1− sorted MEF demonstrated similar FACS profile changes during reprogramming (Supplementary Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence for CD44 and ICAM1 revealed that reprogramming is not synchronized even within individual colonies (Supplementary Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Secondary reprogramming of non-polycistronic line 6c11,14 and primary reprogramming using MKOS and OSKM20 PB transposons resulted in similar ICAM1/CD44 profile changes indicating their sutability for use in other systems and contexts (Supplimentary Figure 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrated the asynchronous but stepwise manner of reprogramming and highlighted the potential usefulness of CD44 and ICAM1 to isolate reprogramming intermediate subpopulations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Next, we aimed to confirm that the observed CD44/ICAM1 profile changes reflected the transition of individual cells from one stage to the next, and not merely the loss of one major population and expansion of another minor population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>CD44+ ICAM1− (Gate1), CD44− ICAM1− (Gate2) and CD44− ICAM1+ (Gate3) populations, either Nanog-GFP+ (NG+) or Nanog-GFP− (NG−) were isolated by cell-sorting at day 10 of reprogramming and re-plated in reprogramming conditions (Figure 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>After 3 days both NG+ and NG− cells progressed in the order of gates 1→2→3 (Figure 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This progression correlated well with increased Nanog-GFP+ colony forming potential (cfp), with 3NG+ cells displaying similar clonogenicity to fully reprogrammed iPSCs (Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Of cells with the same CD44/ICAM1 profile, Nanog-GFP expression correlated with a higher cfp (e.g. 1NG− vs 1NG+). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>To more accurately examine the progression of the reprogramming process, cells from each gate were sorted and their CD44/ICAM1/Nanog-GFP expression was re-analysed after 24 hours (Figure 2d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Based on total cell numbers in each gate after 24 hours (Supplementary Figure 10), we generated a reprogramming route map representing differences in the efficiency of these stage transitions and in Nanog-GFP+ cfp (Figure 2e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained when each subpopulation was sorted at day8 (Supplementary Figure 11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that reaching a Nanog-GFP+ state is a rate limiting step – as few cells overcame this barrier in the 24 hour assay – and those that do so reprogram more efficiently than their Nanog-GFP− counterparts, consistent with the role of Nanog as an accelerator of reprogramming and the gateway to pluripotency17,18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>To elucidate global gene expression changes during these stage transitions, we carried out RNA-sequencing analysis using a highly multiplexed sample barcoding system19,20 (see Methods Online, Supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical clustering using the complete list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed four major branches; [MEFs], [1NG−/+ and 2NG−], [2NG−/+ and 3NG−/+], and [3NG+ sorted at day 15 (3NG+D15), iPSCs and ESCs] (Figure 3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>These clusters correlate well with similarities in cfp of the respective subpopulations (Figure 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>There was a prominent gene expression difference between 3NG+ and 3NG+D15, with the latter being more similar to iPSCs and ESCs (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figures 12a,c), possibly reflecting the observed difference in cfp in the absence of dox (Supplementary Figure 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>The DEGs between these two populations may be involved in the establishment of an exogenous factor independent self-renewal state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Principal component analysis clearly distinguished 2NG+ from 3NG− cells, consistent with the higher probability of the former to reach the 3NG+ state within 24 hours (Supplementary Figures 11c and 12b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>DEGs could be classified into five distinct expression pattern groups (A to E) (Figure 3a, Supplementary Tables 2,3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Group A contained readily down-regulated fibroblast-related genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Group D comprised factors gradually up-regulated toward iPSCs, where ESC genes were highly enriched (P≤0.000367) (Figure 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>However Group C, which contained genes up-regulated at early stages and maintained throughout reprogramming, also included some pluripotency related factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>To extend this finding, we examined the expression pattern of 22 pluripotency-related genes in our data set21,22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 8 pluripotency genes, including endogenous Oct4 (Pou5f1) were already up-regulated at the 1NG+/2NG− stages to the level found in 3NG+ cells (Figure 3b Early), while 14 pluripotency genes were more gradually up-regulated in the later stage reprogramming populations (Figure 3b Late, Supplementary Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This early and late pluripotency gene up-regulation was confirmed at the single cell level5 (Figure 3e), highlighting the high resolution of the CD44/ICAM1 sorting system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>We also identified two additional gene expression patterns displaying transient up-regulation (Group B) or down-regulation (Group E) exclusively in the intermediate stages of reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This finding indicates that reprogramming from MEFs to iPSCs is not simply the loss of MEF genes and gain of ESC genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Gene Ontology analysis revealed that genes related to ectoderm/epidermis development and keratinocyte differentiation were highly enriched in Group B (P≤0.000274) (Figures 3c,d, Supplementary Tables 3-5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>While Sfn and Krt17 were barely detectable by immunofluorscence in MEFs and iPSCs, transient up-regulation was observed in the intermediate stages of reprogramming (Supplementary Figure 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Single cell PCR confirmed co-expression of epidermis genes (Ehf, Ovol1) with early pluripotency genes in the 1NG−/+ stage (Figure 3e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our data, analysis of three published microarray data sets incorporating partially reprogrammed iPSCs (piPSCs)1, a time course experiment3 and a subpopulation analysis with Thy1, SSEA-1 and Oct4-GFP6 confirmed transient epidermal gene expression during reprogramming (Supplementary Figures 15-17, Supplementary Tables 6-8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Partially reprogrammed cells from B cells also displayed similar epidermis gene expression4, while Oct4, Sox2 two factor-reprogramming of MEFs did not23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this intermediate state could be a consequence of the use of Klf4 which is important for efficient reprogramming and demonstrates the reprogramming process is not simply reversion of normal differentiation (Summarized in Supplementary Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>It would be intriguing to investigate if similar transient gene expression changes can be seen in reprogramming of ectoderm or endoderm lineages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Down-regulation of these epidermis genes coincided with up-regulation of “late” pluripotency genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Future examination of this rapid switch in gene expression may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism of reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The integrative data analysis described above demonstrated this CD44/ICAM1/Nanog-GFP marker system, uniquely, could provide high-resolution information during late pluripotency gene up-regulation enabling discrimination of ‘reprogramming’ from ‘expansion of reprogrammed cells’ (Figure 3b, Supplementary Figures 16b, 17f,). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>This system also refines investigation of the kinetics of reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that VitC increases reprogramming efficiency by facilitating H3K9 demethylation7 and that reprogramming factors fail to bind trimethylated H3K9 rich regions in the initial stages of reprogramming24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>We carried out reprogramming in the absence of VitC and observed not only a decrease in the iPSC colony number, but also a marked delay in the transition from one stage of reprogramming to the next (Supplementary Figure 18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Similar analyses can be performed using our marker system to investigate the mechanism of action of other factors that alter reprogramming efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Isolation and analysis of subpopulations affected by these factors could reveal the downstream genes specifically involved in, and required for, successful reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Further studies using this high resolution analysis system have the potential to make a significant contribution towards revealing the molecular mechanisms of reprogramming. </plain></SENT>
