</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The vertebrate embryonic dorsal organizer, historically referred to as the Spemann organizer, breaks the symmetry of the blastula by defining its dorsal side and ultimately gives rise to axial mesoderm, which forms the notochord, the defining anatomical feature of the chordate lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In fish and frogs, induction of the organizer relies on a maternal Wnt signaling pathway that leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in nuclei on the prospective dorsal side of the embryo [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>A primary function of the organizer is to induce a region in the embryo that is competent to adopt dorsal fates, such as prechordal plate mesoderm and neural ectoderm, in the presence of widespread ventralizing BMP signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Proper partitioning of axial versus non-axial cell fates during gastrulation is essential to ensure proper embryonic patterning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>BMP signaling patterns tissues along the dorsoventral axis (DV), but does not act to partition axial versus non-axial fates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, in zebrafish bmp2b (swirl) ligand mutant embryos, loss of BMP signaling causes the expansion of dorsal neurectodermal and non-axial dorsal mesodermal cell fates at the expense of ventral cell fates without expanding the organizer itself [3], [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the absence of ventral cell fate specification, other mechanisms ensure that the organizer is confined dorsally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In zebrafish and Xenopus, several maternal and zygotic genes function to restrict the organizer to dorsal regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Three related homeodomain-containing transcriptional repressors, Vox, Vent, and Ved play a key role in repressing dorsal organizer gene expression ventrolaterally in zebrafish [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These repressors are expressed ventrally and dorsolaterally, and their deficiency causes dorsal organizer gene expression to expand around the ventrolateral margin during late blastula stages at the expense of ventrolateral tissues. Xenopus Vox and Vent have been shown to directly repress the expression of the organizer genes chordin (chd) and goosecoid (gsc) [12], [13] and depletion of Gsc has been reported to lead to a 25-fold increase in vent expression [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Similarly in zebrafish, Vox and Vent have been shown to bind to the gsc promoter and to physically associate with Gsc protein [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>These and other data [15], [16] illustrate the cross-regulatory interactions between opposing ventralizing and dorsalizing transcriptional repressors that are essential for proper embryonic patterning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Several additional genes are known to restrict organizer gene expression to dorsal regions and modulate the expression of vox, vent, and ved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of Runx2bt2, a maternal isoform of Runx2b, delays induction of vox and vent, and eliminates ved expression [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Embryos deficient in maternal Runx2bt2 exhibit an expansion of dorsal organizer gene expression at late blastula stages with a reciprocal loss of ventrolateral tissues [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Expression of vox, vent, and ved is maintained during late blastula and early gastrula stages by zygotic Wnt8a signaling [10], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>By mid gastrulation, expression of these ventralizing transcriptional repressors is maintained by BMP signaling [10], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Thus, a gene regulatory network involving Runx2bt2, Wnt8a and BMP signaling converges on vox, vent, and ved to maintain the specification of non-axial mesoderm. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The maternally supplied transcription factor pou5f3 (previously called pou5f1) also functions in restricting the organizer to the dorsal midline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Maternal-zygotic deficiency of pou5f3 (MZpou5f3) leads to severe dorsalization resulting from derepression of organizer genes ventrolaterally in the embryonic margin, and incomplete induction of the BMP pathway [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>MZpou5f3 mutants also exhibit aberrant morphogenesis and fail to form endoderm [20], [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Pou5f3 likely functions as a transcriptional activator of genes, including vox, that are required to repress dorsal organizer gene expression ventrolaterally [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Thus, Pou5f3 is another mediator of organizer gene repression operating in parallel to the Wnt8a pathway and partially through the BMP pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>One of the earliest organizer genes induced downstream of the maternal Wnt pathway in zebrafish is bozozok (boz), a direct transcriptional repressor of bmp2b, vox, vent, and ved expression [8], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. boz mutant embryos fail to form prechordal plate, notochord, forebrain, and ventral neural structures and display an increase of ventroposterior mesoderm [25]. boz mutant embryos can be rescued by suppressing Wnt8a signaling, indicating that Boz antagonizes zygotic wnt8a expression in the organizer to block non-axial fate development in the dorsal embryonic midline and allow axial development [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Boz stability is modulated by Lnx2b, a maternally supplied E3 ubiquitin ligase that can directly bind and ubiquitinate Boz [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Loss of Lnx2b causes expression of boz and other organizer genes to expand into lateral regions of the late blastula, illustrating the importance of proper turnover of Boz. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The transcriptional repressors Vox, Vent, and Ved are essential for partitioning the mesoderm into axial versus non-axial domains in response to positive regulation from Runx2bt2, Pou5f3, the Wnt8, and BMP pathways, and negative inputs from dorsalizing transcriptional repressors such as Boz and Gsc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>It is less clear how these pathways are molecularly integrated to regulate vox, vent, and ved expression and it is likely that additional maternally-provided factors function in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we performed a genetic screen for maternal-effect mutations to identify novel mediators of vertebrate embryonic patterning. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We isolated a novel recessive maternal-effect mutation p18ahub that causes a profound reduction in ventrolateral mesoderm with a reciprocal expansion in axial mesoderm, and frequently multiple independent axial-like domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>Consistent with radial expansion of the organizer, p18ahub mutant females produce embryos exhibiting ectopic dorsal forerunner cells, a unique population of non-involuting mesendodermal cells at the dorsal margin [33], [34], [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>We can rescue p18ahub dorsalized mutant embryos either by limiting Nodal signaling or restoring BMP signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>We determined through positional cloning that p18ahub is a mutation disrupting the integrator complex subunit 6 (ints6) gene, which encodes a highly conserved component of the Integrator Complex, a large multisubunit complex implicated in 3′ end processing of spliceosomal snRNAs [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Previously, ints6 was named deleted in cancer 1 (dice1) and investigated as a putative tumor suppressor gene in humans [37], [38], [39], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>Using a forward genetic approach, we have revealed a novel role for Ints6 in limiting the extent of dorsal organizer tissues during vertebrate embryogenesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Importantly, however, otx2 was not expanded posteriorly as in wnt8a mutants [18], suggesting that the Wnt8a pathway is intact in p18ahub embryos. </plain></SENT>
