</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The aerosphere is important as a conduit for global transport of bacteria and possibly as an ecological niche in itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Bacteria can be aerosolized from virtually any surface and typically reach atmospheric concentrations in excess of 1 × 104 cells/m3 above land and marine surfaces [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Aerosolized bacteria maintain viability during their atmospheric residence and may exist in the air as spores, vegetative cells, or metabolically active and dividing cells [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Bacterial residence times can be several days, facilitating transport over great distances, before their removal from the atmosphere by precipitation or direct deposition onto surfaces [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Understanding the extent to which an environment may be impacted by the input of foreign organisms, and identifying the sources of these inputs, is important for understanding ecosystem dynamics and for monitoring ecological change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the contribution of bioaerosol transport to the microbial ecology of isolated systems such as the Antarctic continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Antarctica is considered to be largely decoupled from systems of global atmospheric transport, due to its geographic isolation and barriers to the mixing of air masses caused by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Aerosols over Antarctica are predicted to have longer residence times in the atmosphere than those over most temperate environments [5], suggesting that long-range transport of bacteria over the continent is likely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Few analyses of airborne bacteria over Antarctica have been undertaken, with contemporary reports restricted to analyses of microorganisms in the air above Halley V Research Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf [7] and Rothera Point on the Antarctic Peninsula [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Aeolian transport is reported to be an important means of local redistribution of organic material and biomass in deserts globally [9] and including the cold polar deserts of Antarctica's ice-free ecosystems [10–14]; however, there have been no descriptions of bacterial diversity in these aerosols. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Victoria Land, Antarctica, are the largest ice-free area on the continent [15, 16], and deposition of organisms into Dry Valley soils has the potential to profoundly impact ecosystem structure and function [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It has recently been suggested that the low bacterial numbers present in Dry Valley soils may enhance the ability of invasive colonists compared to those in soil communities of higher biomass [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Many of the same selective pressures faced by organisms in the Dry Valleys including desiccation, high UV radiation, low temperature, and oligotrophic conditions [16] are faced by organisms during atmospheric transport [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>As such, many bacteria entering Antarctic soils from the atmosphere may be well adapted to survive in their new environment [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of colonization may be increased by the effects of climate change, as increased temperature and water availability may favor growth of foreign organisms in Antarctic soils [6, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Atmospheric processes may, therefore, have a particularly important role in shaping microbial communities in Dry Valley soils. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In this study, the diversity of airborne bacteria was assessed on the floor and ridge of Miers Valley, a location with extensive landscape-scale ecological research data on the surface ecology [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The objective was to set up a baseline dataset for airborne inputs of bacteria and assess how they may influence Dry Valley soils, since soil biodiversity is known to vary with elevation in this system [16, 22]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>The soils and rocks of Antarctica's Dry Valleys support unique microbial communities that are able to tolerate the harsh environmental conditions [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that the aerosol immediately above this edaphic niche supports a bacterial diversity that includes a very low frequency of OTUs related to local soil colonists and instead is dominated by OTUs that suggest that the extensive local active volcanology, together with strong selective pressure from regional transport above the Antarctic plateau, may be the dominant factors determining airborne bacterial dispersal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation between aerosolized ‘communities’ and local edaphic communities in our study is an enigma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>It is recognized that dust transport is a major mechanism for microbial dispersal in deserts worldwide [9], and studies of microbial signatures in Antarctic soils indicate this may also be the case in the Dry Valleys, at least on a local scale [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Yet during a large part of the Austral summer, our evidence suggests that local edaphic bacteria form a negligible part of the dust-free airborne biota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>We propose that this may be due to microbes associated with mineral soil (dust) particles that were frozen solid to the surface and/or too heavy to have been collected by our pumping apparatus, and therefore dust-associated microbes were under-represented in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>We may therefore have detected only bacteria being transported as very fine particulates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Soil microbial communities also exhibit relatively low biomass [11, 48] and may be dispersed during occasional stochastic events rather than in a continuous manner, and this may contribute to relatively stochastic demography between such desert locations [49, 50]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>At the phylum level, the signatures observed in the Miers Valley aerosols were largely similar to those reported in aerosols over other terrestrial environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Studies of aerosols from Texas [35], Colorado [51], Hong Kong [39], and the Canadian High Arctic [52] report similar representation of major phyla. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>This evidence supports suggestions that bacteria from these groups may have characteristics that enhance their ability to be aerosolized and survive harsh conditions in the atmosphere [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>That the same bacteria that are important globally in aerosols are important in Antarctic aerosols suggests there may be common controls to bacteria during high atmospheric transport, and this may be independent of geographic location. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>At the OTU0.03 level, there was also evidence that Miers bio-aerosols were similar to those outside Antarctica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The most abundant OTU0.03 grouping to the Proteobacteria was also observed in air from a high elevation site in Colorado, USA [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>Several sequences of lower abundance in the Miers library were also recorded from aerosols over tropical terrestrial and marine environments [39], thus suggesting that some taxa are globally distributed in the atmosphere. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Aerosols over Miers Valley showed much higher diversity than those reported from other parts of the continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>This result is at least partially attributable to the use of high-throughput sequencing in the current study (thus resolution power in our study was several orders of magnitude greater than in earlier studies), but may also in part reflect landscape differences between the two study sites influencing aerosol compositions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Pearce and colleagues [7] proposed that the 31 clones and 12 partial sequences reported in aerosols over Halley Station represented a baseline of biodiversity for aerosols over the continent, due to limited impact from local biological sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Our observation of seven of the taxa described in the Halley Station libraries among the 202 OTUs seen in aerosols over Miers Valley is in agreement with this concept and may indicate that there are some bacterial taxa that can be predictably observed in aerosols over the entire continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>The difference in bacterial assemblages observed between the two studies demonstrates a degree of temporal and/or spatial variation in aerosol compositions over Antarctica. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>There was little evidence that local soils, lakes, glaciers, or the Ross Sea had a marked influence on bacterial aerosol compositions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>The air sample libraries were found to be highly dissimilar to the reference soil sample library at both the phylum and OTU0.03 level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In stark contrast to the Miers Valley aerosols, work by Tiao and colleagues [17] indicated that the Miers soils were dominated by sequences grouping to Actinobacteria (37.3 %) and Bacteroidetes (12.6 %), while those grouping to Firmicutes (&lt;1 %) and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria 1.6 %, Betaproteobacteria &lt;1 %, and Gammaproteobacteria &lt; 1 %) made up small proportions of the library. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>All of the phyla observed in the air samples were observed in the soils, but many in the soil samples including the Deinococcus–Thermus, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia were not detected in either air sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Sequences from only 13 OTUs0.03 in the Miers aerosol libraries were also observed in the soil library, and none of the dominant signatures in the aerosol libraries were represented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>This indicates strong selective pressure in Dry Valleys soils towards community assembly that greatly enhances abundance of ‘rare’ phylotypes from the incoming airborne (rather than dust-borne) inoculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>We further postulate that dispersal is a largely regional process and occurs via stochastic dust storm events, whilst a more passive low-level but continuous aerosol input from air movements harbours a largely non-invasive aerosolized microbial input. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the level of biomass in Dry Valley soils surrounding the sample sites was too low to have a detectable influence on the composition of bacterial aerosols, although cyanobacteria that form high biomass microbial mats around lakes and hypoliths in quartz-bearing soils were undetected and so this appears unlikely. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Of the bacteria detected, none were confidently considered to be of marine origin from the nearby Ross Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the analysis of back trajectories for wind, which showed weather arriving predominantly from the interior of the continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Pearce and colleagues [7] also noted limited marine influence on aerosols at Halley Station in peninsular Antarctica, with only three bacterial sequences of marine origin and no discernable variation in bacterial aerosol compositions when the distance to open water was reduced from 400 to 15 km during seasonal break up of the sea-ice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>Hughes and colleagues [8] also reported that only three of the sequences detected in aerosols over Rothera Point were of marine origin, despite close proximity to the open ocean and the marine influence on much of the air arriving at the station. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Based on the climatic trends over the sampling period, it is, perhaps, not surprising that little marine influence was observed in the Miers Valley aerosols. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>The substantial number of sequences in both libraries that appear to be from thermophilic bacteria was unexpected, but may be explained by influences from the many areas of geothermal activity in the Ross Sea region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>Potential sources of thermophilic organisms include Mount Erebus 100 km northeast of the Miers Valley, and Mount Melbourne and Mount Rittman approximately 400 and 500 km north of the Miers Valley, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>These sites host diverse and abundant thermophilic microbial communities [53–55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>Bacteria may be aerosolized from these sites in steam that rises from the fumaroles, similar to the mechanism of dispersal described in other geothermal systems [56, 57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>Considering the close proximity of the Dry Valleys to these ecosystems, relative to other significant stocks of microbial biomass, it is reasonable to suggest that these volcanoes, particularly Mt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>Erebus, may have an important influence on the composition of bacterial aerosols in the region. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>We postulate that at least some aerosolized bacteria arrived via inter-continental dispersal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Vincent [58] cites numerous lines of evidence for the frequent transfer of biological material to Antarctica by atmospheric processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="156" pm="."><plain>Bacteria have been shown to survive long-distance transport in desert dust blown between Africa and the Caribbean [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="157" pm="."><plain>Many of the bacteria observed in the Miers aerosols may be long lived in the atmosphere, particularly the spore-forming taxa grouping to the phylum Firmicutes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="158" pm="."><plain>The high proportion of Firmicutes observed in these libraries could be the result of selection for spore-forming bacteria during long-range transport, as the Paenibacillus, Geobacillus/Anoxybacillus, and Thermaerobacter found to dominate the Miers aerosols can all be considered to be cosmopolitan in distribution [42, 60] and may be highly mobile as spores. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="159" pm="."><plain>We conclude, however, that the majority of the bacteria observed in the aerosols originated in Antarctica, rather than from off the continent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="160" pm="."><plain>Antarctica has been hypothesized to have one of the lowest rates of microbial exchange with other continents and marine environments, with an estimated 90 % of the aerosols deposited in Antarctic environments predicted to have originated from on the continent [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="161" pm="."><plain>The dust that arrives in Antarctica is predicted to be predominantly from Australia and Patagonia, with the Ross Sea region most heavily influenced by the Australian fraction [61], and there is little reason to expect these aerosols to be dominated by thermophiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>That all of the dominant members are thermophilic suggests that there is a common nearby source, as a mechanism for the selection in favour of thermophilic bacteria in the cold atmosphere is difficult to conceive. </plain></SENT>
