</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ticks encounter and harbour many foreign microbes during their lifetime. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The tick innate immune system has probably contributed significantly to their success as hosts and vectors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The tick immune system is characterized as having both cell-mediated and humoral defence components (Kopáček et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cell-mediated defence involves phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign microbes that infiltrate the hemocoel (Eggenberger et al., 1990; Ceraul et al., 2002) The humoral arm of the defence response is driven by soluble antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are presumably secreted from the haemocytes and fat body into the hemocoel or from the midgut epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AMPs can attack invading microbes through opsonization, agglutination, and/or lysing (Kopáček et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The tick midgut is the first point of contact for rickettsiae imbibed with a bloodmeal from an infected mammal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, imbibes a rickettsia-infected blood meal, genes encoding a number of AMPs and bacteriostatic factors are activated for transcription and translation, including defensin and D. variabilis kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (Ceraul et al., 2007, 2011, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Defensins are a ubiquitous class of AMPs that are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, virus and protozoans (Dugan et al., 2008; Smith &amp; Nemerow, 2008; Kopáček et al., 2010; Tanaka et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Tick defensins are 4–6.5 kDa cationic and anionic peptides with a secondary structure comprising α-helical and β-sheet structures that form a tertiary structure by way of three disulphide bonds (Kopáček et al., 2010; Wang &amp; Zhu, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Tick defensins also posses a γ-core within the C-terminus (Wang &amp; Zhu, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The γ-core is a feature common to defensins regardless of species and is responsible for their antimicrobial activities (Yount &amp; Yeaman, 2004; Wang &amp; Zhu, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The cationic charge, amphipathicity and γ-core have been shown to mediate attraction, attachment and membrane insertion that facilitate the toroidal pore, barrel-stave or carpet mechanisms of pore-forming action by AMPs such as defensin (Yount &amp; Yeaman, 2004; Brogden, 2005; Wang &amp; Zhu, 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Ticks are second only to dipterans in their importance as vectors of pathogens in humans and are the number one vector of pathogens of veterinary importance (Parola et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Some of the most detrimental human tick-borne pathogens are members of the spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFG). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>SFG rickettsiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that replicate in the cytoplasm and nucleus of host cells and are transmitted by ticks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Although experimental studies suggest that there are some lethal effects associated with infection in D. variabilis by the aetiological agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rickettsia rickettsia, it is successfully acquired, maintained and transmitted both horizontally and vertically in nature (Niebylski et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that even if ticks suffer long-term morbidity as a result of infection, they can control rickettsial infections long enough to transmit the pathogens, thereby perpetuating the zoonotic cycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Previous studies show that challenge of D. variabilis with SFG R. montanensis results in activation of defensin-1 and -2 and lysozyme (Ceraul et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that defensin-2 is functionally active against R. montanensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Experiments demonstrate that D. variabilis defensin-2 associates with and causes cytoplasmic leakage of R. montanensis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that defensin-2 function is one factor that limits R. montanensis infection of the tick. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Although cationic charge is one property that mediates the association between the bacterium and defensin (Ganz, 2003; Brogden, 2005), defensin-2, a weak anionic peptide (pI = 5.14; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/compute_pi/pi_tool">http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/compute_pi/pi_tool</ext-link>) associates with rickettsia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The present study does not explore the mechanism underlying defensin-2 association with rickettsia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>Our findings present the possibility that defensin-2 interacts with ligands alternative to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or that the LPS structure of R. montanensis is different from reported Gram-negative bacteria with respect to charge and facilitates the interaction with a weak anionic protein; however, charge does not appear to be the sole factor dictating the functional capacity of AMPs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>In designing experiments for the present study, we considered the effects that extended extracellular periods of time have on the viability of an obligate intracellular bacterium; however, it is feasible that anionic peptides function at slower rates and that greater loss in rickettsial viability will be attained when exposed to defensin-2 for a time period exceeding 30 min. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>After the initial attraction and attachment, AMPs are theorized to assume their folded secondary structure (Matsuzaki, 1999; Marcellini et al., 2009; Rahman et al., 2009; Manzo et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>A transmembrane pore is thought to form through three mechanisms and appears to be peptide concentration-dependent. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the carpet mechanism works through peptide-mediated formation of micelles and that the torodial pore model is a function of peptide-induced membrane bending followed by pore formation (Brogden, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>Clues about the mechanism driving pore formation by defensin-2 (anionic) may come from data for the anionic peptide DCL-1 (net charge of-2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Recent data suggest that DCL-1 folds into an α-helical structure in the presence of bacterial membranes, self-associates in a time-dependent manner, and may form pores through the toroidal pore mechanism (Paulmann et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>Endosymbionts and commensal microflora may be maintained at low levels in specific tissues to avoid detrimental physiological effects to the host (Login et al., 2011; Paredes et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, peptidoglycan recognition protein-LB, is responsible for controlling midgut immune activation and participates in activation of the systemic response after an oral challenge with the Gram-negative bacterium Erwinia carotovora carotovar-15 (Paredes et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>Considering this, midgut infection with rickettsia may prime hemocoelic immune effectors for an impending rickettsial invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>In doing so, AMPs such as defensin-2 will limit transmigration of rickettsiae to the hemocoel, ovaries and salivary glands, resulting in less infection, which could have implications for transovarial or horizontal maintenance. </plain></SENT>
