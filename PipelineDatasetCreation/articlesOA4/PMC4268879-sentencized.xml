</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Soybean is one of the most important commodities in the world, and drought is one of the most relevant environmental factors contributing to yield losses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Long-term drought stress is a major problem, but in the short term, it also decreases crop production even when other conditions are favorable and may have serious economic and social consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In Brazil, the occurrence of prolonged drought during the soybean growing season has become increasingly common in recent years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This situation may become even more dramatic in light of current environmental change predictions, which point to global warming and the consequent occurrence of drought stress [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Molecular biology tools for the identification and transfer of genes responsible for drought tolerance have been applied to combat drought in soybean [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Different types of genetically modified plants have been developed to overcome water deficit, including the over expression of protective proteins. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Osmotins (osmotin-like proteins or OLPs) are members of the Pathogenesis-related protein 5 (PR-5) family [2], which are produced in plants under different abiotic and biotic stresses [3-6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>These proteins were identified in several plant species, including strawberry, Fragaria ananassa [6], Arabidopsis thaliana [7] and soybean, Glycine max [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have been performed to determine the physiological role of osmotin in stress tolerance, but the mechanism of its action remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that tobacco osmotin overexpression in different plant species confers tolerance to abiotic stresses, especially salinity and drought. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This response was observed in transgenic plants of tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum [10], wheat, Triticum aestivum [11], cotton, Gossypium hirsutum [12], tomato, Solanum lycopersicum [13], and soybean [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Tobacco osmotin can act in osmotolerance by facilitating the compartmentalization of solutes [10] or metabolic/structural alterations during osmotic adjustment [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The genus Solanum has a broad set of genes, including the PR-5 protein family, with the potential to confer resistance to pathogens [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Two PR5-like genes were isolated from the genome of black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L. var. americanum), a solanaceous weed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The predicted products of both genes, named SnOLP (neutral) and SnOSML (basic), showed a high homology with tobacco osmotin [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>As have been shown that the expression of tobacco osmotin enhances salinity tolerance in transgenic soybean [14], our hypothesis was that drought tolerance could be achieved in soybean plants transformed with SnOLP due to crosstalk between these two abiotic stresses [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of the SnOLP protein in developing transgenic soybean with enhanced drought tolerance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to report that the SnOLP gene under the control of the UBQ3 promoter (UBQ3-P) from A. thaliana was transferred into the soybean genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our results showed an improvement of physiological responses when transgenic plants were subjected to water deficit. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>The reduction in the photosynthetic rate is usually due to low stomatal conductance (gs), which reduces transpiration rate and internal CO2 concentration, leading to a decrease in plant development [29] and inhibition of photosynthesis [30]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>In fact, there are reports demonstrating that transgenic plants carrying genes coding for osmoprotectants under a constitutive promoter may present morphological changes as well as growth rate and seed grain yield reduction [32,33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, there is no sufficient basis to assume a negative association between osmotic adjustment and grain yield potential, especially considering the study carried out by Richardson and McCree [34], which demonstrated that the metabolic cost of storing photosynthate and using it for osmotic adjustment in sorghum was lower than the cost of converting it into shoot biomass. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Under watered conditions, 100-grain weight was similar for WT and transgenic plants (B1 and B3 lines) (p &gt; 0.05) (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>However, under water stress, 100-grain weight decreased approximately 12% for WT plants, while approximately 1.1% (B1) and 3.7% (B3) for transgenic plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Moreover, plants from B1 and B3 lines exposed to water shortage showed higher 100-grain weights than WT plants (p &lt; 0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>The higher 100-grain weight observed for transgenic plants compared to WT plants may be explained by the effect of drought stress on net CO2 assimilation rate (Pn). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 4B, Pn in transgenic plants was significantly higher than in WT plants under water shortage. </plain></SENT>
