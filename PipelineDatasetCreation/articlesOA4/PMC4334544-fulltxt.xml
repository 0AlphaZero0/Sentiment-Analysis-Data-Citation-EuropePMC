<article-title>Extensive Copy-Number Variation of Young Genes across Stickleback Populations</article-title>
</related-article><abstract><p>The patterns of genomic divergence during ecological speciation are shaped by a combination of evolutionary forces. Processes such as genetic drift, local reduction of gene flow around genes causing reproductive isolation, hitchhiking around selected variants, variation in recombination and mutation rates are all factors that can contribute to the heterogeneity of genomic divergence. On the basis of 60 fully sequenced three-spined stickleback genomes, we explore these different mechanisms explaining the heterogeneity of genomic divergence across five parapatric lake and river population pairs varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. We find that divergent regions of the genome are mostly specific for each population pair, while their size and abundance are not correlated with the extent of genome-wide population differentiation. In each pair-wise comparison, an analysis of allele frequency spectra reveals that 25&#x02013;55% of the divergent regions are consistent with a local restriction of gene flow. Another large proportion of divergent regions (38&#x02013;75%) appears to be mainly shaped by hitchhiking effects around positively selected variants. We provide empirical evidence that alternative mechanisms determining the evolution of genomic patterns of divergence are not mutually exclusive, but rather act in concert to shape the genome during population differentiation, a first necessary step towards ecological speciation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Authors Summary</title><p>A variety of evolutionary forces influence the genomic landscape of divergence during ecological speciation. Here we characterize the evolution of genomic divergence patterns based on 60 fully sequenced three-spined stickleback genomes, contrasting lake and river populations that differ in parasite abundance. Our comparison of the size and abundance of divergent regions in the genomes across a continuum of population differentiation suggests that selection and the hitchhiking effect on neutral sites mainly contributes to the observed heterogeneous patterns of genomic divergence. Additional divergent regions of the genome can be explained by a local reduction of gene flow. Our description of genomic divergence patterns across a continuum of population differentiation combined with an analysis of molecular signatures of evolution highlights how adaptation shapes the differentiation of sticklebacks in freshwater habitats.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>MM received funding from the Max Planck innovation funds for this project.

Typically, the average genome-wide divergence is low, interspersed with regions of exceptional differentiation. However, studies describing divergence patterns across the genome have found regions of exceptional differentiation to be either numerous and small [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] or few and large [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the latter sometimes referred to as &#x02018;genomic islands&#x02019;. A variety of explanations have been proposed for the observed heterogeneity in genomic divergence, including stochastic processes such as genetic drift, but also deterministic mechanisms such as locus-specific reduction of gene flow in the vicinity of genes causing reproductive isolation, hitchhiking around selected variants, or variation in recombination and mutation rates [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Generally, genetic drift, population expansion, migration, and other demographic events affect the whole genome, whereas natural selection modified by local environmental differences impact only those regions of the genome that affect the respective phenotypes and fitness.</p><p>It is not known whether or not genomic patterns such as the variation of divergence and recombination along the genome tend to follow a predictable evolutionary trajectory as populations proceed along a speciation continuum [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We investigated the early phase of divergence using lake-river stickleback population pairs varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. If divergence patterns are driven by locus-specific effects of gene flow and divergent selection, the extent of divergence is expected to be more localized than widespread, in line with the &#x0201c;island view&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These regions might hold &#x0201c;speciation genes&#x0201d; maintaining reproductive isolation between species including genes underlying a fitness reduction in hybrids [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, &#x0201c;divergence hitchhiking&#x0201d;, the accumulative effect of selectively advantageous loci, predicts a positive correlation between genomic divergence and island size progression [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An alternative explanation posits that the lack of differentiation across most of the genome is due to shared ancestral polymorphism rather than ongoing gene flow [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], whereas regions of high differentiation represent regions influenced by selection at linked sites [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such a hitchhiking pattern may be caused by both advantageous (positive selection) and deleterious alleles (background selection). Therefore, if adaptation alone (assuming some degree of geographic separation) shapes the genomic landscape, population genetic processes unrelated to the extent of overall genomic differentiation govern divergence patterns. Disentangling such alternative scenarios is a crucial yet challenging step in understanding the genomics of divergence, especially in parapatry where the current and historic extent of migration and gene flow contribute to the overall genomic patterns.</p><p>We tested predictions inherent to the different scenarios explaining genomic patterns of divergence using whole-genome sequencing data of replicated population pairs of three-spined sticklebacks varying in their degree of genetic differentiation. Five population pairs were sampled from connected lakes and rivers from the United States (Us), Canada (Ca), Norway (No), and from two sites in Germany (G1 and G2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g001">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s008">S1 Table</xref>). As ice sheets covered these regions during the last glaciation, these populations represent recent colonization events (~12 000 years ago). Both lake and river populations are derived from marine ancestors that became landlocked during de-glaciation, and in which ecotype differentiation between watersheds has occurred repeatedly. Some phenotypic traits such as feeding morphology [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], brain development [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and parasite resistance [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] seemingly differentiated in parallel with habitat (i.e. lake and river) suggestive of local adaptation. Furthermore, experimental studies have shown evidence for local adaptation to lake and river habitats mediated by parasites [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, contrasting the differentiation between populations from distinct ecosystems permits us to study the onset of divergence, which might eventually lead to complete reproductive isolation (i.e. speciation). Here, we scan genomic divergence patterns and evaluate differences and commonalities across a wide geographic sampling of parapatric population pairs to uncover the relative importance and interaction of evolutionary factors like drift, selection, and recombination during adaptive divergence.</p><fig id="pgen.1004966.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004966.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>A Geographic map showing sampling locations including a neighbour-joining tree illustrating the genetic differentiation between sampled populations.</title><p>Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> between parapatric lake-river populations is given on the tree.

From previous work on three-spined sticklebacks, lakes and rivers in Northern Germany are known to harbour distinct parasite communities [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the relatively low sample size for individual locations in this study (n = 12&#x02013;17), this ecological difference between lakes and rivers is here confirmed on a broader geographic scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g001">Fig. 1</xref>). From each of the ten sampled populations, six stickleback genomes were sequenced using a combination of paired-end and mate-pair libraries on the Illumina HiSeq platform to an average genomic coverage of 26-fold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s009">S2 Table</xref>). Instead of sequencing many individuals with low coverage, a small number of genomes per population was chosen to be sequenced to high coverage. This approach takes advantage of the greater resolution of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs; evaluated in greater detail in a companion paper [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) plus increased genotype accuracy within each individual to decipher the divergence mechanisms acting towards an apparent repeated differentiation between lake and river fish. Besides evaluating allele frequencies, the high individual sequence coverage permits us to infer haplotypes and examine recombination patterns. After stringent quality filtering, we accessed 297,437,667 bp from the 20 autosomes (380,547,835 bp). SNP density varied from 3 to 10 SNPs per kilobase (kb) within each population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s010">S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s011">S4</xref> Tables). For each of the five parapatric comparisons, pairwise genome-wide averages of divergence (F<sub>ST</sub>) ranged from 0.10 to 0.28, disclosing a varying degree of differentiation in the ascending order of Us, G2, No, G1, and Ca (<xref rid="pgen.1004966.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The parapatric pairs emerge as repeated independent differentiation events (neighbor joining tree, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) except for the German populations, despite belonging to different draining systems (North Sea versus Baltic Sea). Due to low land levels and historically varying water levels, water bodies and connections across Northern Germany have most likely fluctuated over time. Thus the two lake and river population pairs in Germany (G1 and G2) might have been originally connected. Because of this, G1 and G2 share some postglacial history, common ancestral variation, and divergence while currently the two water systems are physically separated. Specifically, studies on the German system have proposed parasite communities as a promising candidate mediating divergent selection, pointing out their role in local adaptation [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a further global perspective of this hypothesis, we find a signal of isolation-by-adaptation (partial mantel test: r = 0.622, P = 0.0007) shown by a significant association of genome-wide F<sub>ST</sub> and parasite community (jaccard distance of parasite sums across individuals, counts were 4<sup>th</sup> square root transformed) while correcting for geographic distance (geodetic distance between GPS coordinates of each sampling location). As we detected isolation-by-adaptation at a spatial scale beyond which gene flow occurs, this signal might be most likely caused by a loose linkage between locally adapted loci and the genome-wide neutral regions [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This result suggests a role of parasites for the local adaptation of freshwater stickleback populations.</p><table-wrap id="pgen.1004966.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004966.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary statistics characterizing divergent regions of exceptional differentiation across five lake-river comparisons.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pgen.1004966.t001g" xlink:href="pgen.1004966.t001"/><table frame="box" rules="all" border="0"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="top" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The shape of the distribution of F<sub>ST</sub> values across the genome qualitatively matches a skewed Poisson distribution, suggestive of divergence with gene flow (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The pronounced right tail of the distributions aided the identification of outlier windows, which are significantly different from the genome-wide average. Outlier windows were detected for each population pair as the top 1% of the empirical distribution in addition to being significantly differentiated compared to a random permutation of markers across windows, applying a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01. Using the exact same approach comparing marine and freshwater populations, regions known to be under strong divergent selection such as <italic>Eda</italic> and <italic>Atp1a1</italic> were detected as outliers demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the applied methods (details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec003">Methods</xref>). Across all five parapatric lake-river comparisons, we identified a total of 1,530 extreme 10 kb outlier windows, in which 47 are shared between at least two of the five population pairs, a proportion that is slightly more than expected by chance (10,000 permutations of random sampling gave on average 28 overlaps, one-tailed P = 0.0006), but none of the windows were shared across all five population pairs. Although we found a weak positive correlation of F<sub>ST</sub> along the genome between the five lake and river ecotype pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>), there is a negative correlation of F<sub>ST</sub> among the 1,530 outlier windows (Pearson correlation ranging from r = -0.2531 to -0.1064, all P&#x0003c;10<sup>-4</sup>). These results indicate that outlier windows in one population pair are often windows of low F<sub>ST</sub> in the other population pairs. Hence, outlier windows are not the same across the different population pairs. Annotations for all genes overlapping common outlier windows can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s012">S5 Table</xref>. None of these outlier windows overlapped with those detected in a previous lake and river comparison of different stickleback populations on the Haida Gwaii archipelago [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus outliers of exceptional differentiation appear to be locally specific for lake-river ecotypes on a wide geographic scale as well as on a narrow scale [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is in contrast to earlier comparisons between marine and freshwater sticklebacks where few loci are repeatedly found under divergent selection on a global scale [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our results are in line with the notion that the repeated differentiation between derived freshwater stickleback populations occurs as a response to different ecological pressures specific to their local environment [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This might reflect locally specific parasite communities, aside from the general trend of an increase in parasite diversity in lakes compared to rivers. However, genomic diversification seem to be an inevitable consequence following the dispersal across habitats, reinforcing the concept that local adaptation is a major contributor to the evolution of species.</p><fig id="pgen.1004966.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004966.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of the divergence across the genome in five parapatric lake-river pairs.</title><p>Panels are ordered by increasing overall divergence (Us, G2, No, G1, Ca).

Divergence hitchhiking predicts a trend towards an increase in size of divergent regions with overall population differentiation [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Conversely, if size was largely determined by the strength and duration of selection, the size of divergent regions would be independent of overall population differentiation. To test these predictions in our dataset, we exploited our comprehensive sequencing resolution to identify precise borders and dimensions of regions of exceptional differentiation. Amongst the 1,530 outlier windows, adjacent outlier windows were combined into 794 continuous outlier &#x0201c;regions&#x0201d; of exceptional differentiation estimated to the nearest 1 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s013">S6 Table</xref>). The size of a region of exceptional differentiation was determined utilizing barrier strength (<italic>b</italic>, ref [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) to contrast local divergence to the genome-wide average. We found a high degree of size heterogeneity among divergent regions within and across population pairs, with no evidence that the size of these regions increases with higher levels of genome-wide differentiation (<xref rid="pgen.1004966.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s003">S3 Fig.</xref>). This also holds true when recombination rates are taken into account (see below). Therefore, the genomic pattern of divergence observed across a continuum of population differentiation suggests that selection at linked sites drives the observed pattern rather than the interplay of gene flow and divergent selection, consistent with the perspective of geographically specific local adaptation. However, additional factors such as soft sweeps resulting from adaptation based on standing genetic variation might also contribute to the observed patterns, further complicating interpretations.</p><p>To further explore if the observed divergence patterns are indeed facilitated by selection and not induced by drift alone, we investigated fine-scale linkage patterns and their effects on genomic heterogeneity across a populations. For each population, we estimated the realized population-scaled recombination rates (&#x003c1;/&#x00398;) along the genome. Both a local reduction of gene flow mediated by divergent selection and selection with the hitchhiking of linked neutral sites are predicted to produce a negative correlation between F<sub>ST</sub> and recombination rate [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], however this association would be unlikely mediated by drift alone. In addition, divergence hitchhiking predicts that over time, linkage will extend along the genome and eventually encompass large tracts of the genome [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In our study, realized recombination rates in regions of exceptional differentiation were often significantly reduced compared to genome-wide estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g003">Fig. 3</xref>). We found that genome-wide recombination rates tended to decrease with increasing overall differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g003">Fig. 3</xref>). However, realized recombination rates in divergent regions are not significantly correlated with genome-wide differentiation, adding to the growing lack of empirical evidence for divergence hitchhiking [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These results suggest that either actual recombination rates coincide regions of the genome, which become divergent, or selection drives local reductions in realized recombination rates. The coalescent-based population recombination rates (4N<sub>e</sub>r) estimated in this study are simultaneously affected by the variation in genomic structure within and across populations, which may influence actual recombination rates, as well as by selection. Hence, selection might have locally reduced realized recombination rates in certain genomic regions or actual recombination has been reduced due to the intrinsic genomic structural variations thereby promoting genomic divergence. Previous studies evaluating large-scale map-based recombination patterns in sticklebacks have also found a correlation between recombination and divergence, suggesting that genome structure, via its influence on recombination, is important in understanding patterns of genomic differentiation [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, the low correlation in divergence (F<sub>ST</sub>) between different population pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g002">Fig. 2</xref>) suggests that local factors specific to each population pair drive genomic differentiation, and that population specific selection reduces realized recombination, particularly if genomic structure is conserved across populations. However, it is possible that genome structure is not so strongly conserved across these geographically distant pairs. Structural variations such as inversions and CNVs have been shown to be abundant within stickleback populations [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A companion paper [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] highlights the prevalence of CNVs among and between the populations studied here, in which CNVs tend to also be population specific. These findings indicate that genome structure might be more variable than expected, and therefore might hold potential for promoting genomic differentiation in a population specific manner. We cannot here distinguish between selection-induced influences on realized recombination rates, and actual variation in recombination rates due to differences in genome structure and resultant effects on patterns of genomic differentiation. Further understanding of genome structure&#x02019;s influence on recombination rates, and its variability within and across populations, will be crucial for disentangling the combined influences of selection and recombination on patterns of genomic variation.</p><fig id="pgen.1004966.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1004966.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Boxplot illustrating the variation of realized population-scale recombination rates (&#x003c1;/&#x00398;) across the genome in five lake-river population pairs.</title><p>Population pairs are ordered by increasing genomic divergence (left to right), with rivers plotted first followed by lakes.

For this reason, measurements of absolute divergence such as D<sub>xy</sub> have been suggested as a complement to more reliably identified regions of locally reduced gene flow [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, absolute divergence measurements are unreliable statistics for nascent populations and in non-equilibrium situations during population differentiation. Hence, we aim to disentangle different mechanisms shaping regions of exceptional differentiation by assessing selective sweep signatures in one or both populations of each parapatric pair. Utilizing the base pair resolution of our whole genome sequence data, we evaluated allele frequency spectra to differentiate between molecular signatures of selection among individual regions of exceptional differentiation. In divergent regions differentiated due to a local restriction of gene flow mediated by selection, the spectrum is not expected to be affected locally and should reveal a signature of neutral evolution [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The opposite is true for regions resulting from selection with hitchhiking at linked sites, which causes a characteristic skew of the spectrum. An excess of rare alleles is expected in a population experiencing a selective sweep [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or in both populations in the case of background selection [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

The minority of divergent regions is consistent with background selection (12%, T<sub>D</sub> reduced in both populations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), whereas adaptation seems to shape most of the divergent regions (48%), consistent with the influential role of selection. Divergent regions with signals of positive selection (T<sub>D</sub> reduced in one of the two populations) should harbor those genes responsible for local adaptation. Genes in divergent regions with a signature of positive selection in lakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) were overrepresented with functions involved in structural molecule activity (18 out of 260 annotated genes, P = 0.0018), while genes in divergent regions with signals of positive selection in rivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) were overrepresented with functions involved in G-protein coupled receptor activity (15 out of 105, P = 0.0038), antiporter activity (6 out of 36, P = 0.0280), and drug transmembrane transporter activity (4 out of 8, P = 0.0367), suggesting functions in environmental response. Divergent regions with neutral T<sub>D</sub> patterns (T<sub>D</sub> in both populations similar to genome-wide average, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) potentially harbor genes restricting gene flow. Despite the prominent occurrence of neutral T<sub>D</sub> patterns among divergent regions (35%), we found no functional overrepresentation of genes within those regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s013">S6 Table</xref>). This indicates that a variety of different genes and functions might be involved in reproductive isolation, but the current state of gene annotations does not allow drawing compelling conclusions. Overall, the variety of molecular signatures of selection found in divergent regions suggests that different evolutionary processes shape regions of exceptional differentiation. We acknowledge that our approach of strictly categorizing regions based on thresholds simplifies a complex situation, in which various factors most likely interact to shape genomic divergence. However, our analysis suggests that different processes have different impacts across the genome, with selection being a probably major contributor. Therefore, the effects of a local reduction of gene flow and local adaptation are mutually compatible and probably act in concert to shape the genomic landscape of divergence between differentiating parapatric stickleback populations.</p></sec><sec id="sec002e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We presented multiple lines of evidence for the role of adaptation shaping the genomic divergence patterns between lake-river populations of three-spined sticklebacks. Aside from adaptive processes, stochastic variation in coalescent times and variable mutation rates could further contribute to the observed heterogeneity of genomic divergence [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In particular, demographic history such as colonization events (population range expansions) might lead to a substantial variation in allele frequencies across the genome, possibly mimicking the patterns of adaptive hitchhiking [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we have chosen the genome-wide average as proxy of the underlying demographic history and the effect of random drift on these populations, as detailed demographic information is scarce. Today, fish migration from the sampled rivers flowing into lake habitats is possible while migration in the opposite direction is likely constrained by physical barriers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s008">S1 Table</xref>). However, as freshwater systems have been subject to recurrent water-level changes during de-glaciation, the spatial context at different stages of population divergence might have fluctuated over the years affecting demographic history of the populations. Due to pronounced local differences and variable genomic patterns across the sampled continuum of genetic population differentiation we conclude that the main mode of contemporary divergence between parapatric three-spined sticklebacks is associated with population-specific local adaptation. This is potentially partially mediated by differences in the parasite, as we also found a corresponding signature of isolation by adaptation. Furthermore, our fine-scale examinations of molecular evolution suggest that some heterogeneity of genomic divergence is also the result of locus-specific differences in gene flow mediated by divergent selection. Our study has taken an important step towards deciphering the underlying mechanisms responsible for the genomic patterns during speciation, one of the fundamental enigmas in evolutionary biology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003a"><title>Sampling and data processing</title><p>Three-spined stickleback fish were caught from five pairs of lakes and rivers in North America and Northern Europe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s008">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1004966.g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Population genetics estimators were averaged across the genome (20 autosomes) in non-overlapping windows to ensure statistical independence of windows. We used window sizes of 10 kb and 100 kb and confirmed that results are qualitatively the same. Diversity estimates have been corrected for the number of sites for which genotypes are available.</p></sec><sec id="sec003d"><title>Divergent regions of exceptional differentiation</title><p>Outlier windows were determined by combining an empirical approach with a permutation approach. First, windows above the top 1% of the empirical distribution were identified as putative outlier windows. Second, we applied a permutation approach in which loci across the genome were permuted 1,000,000 times and window estimates of F<sub>ST</sub> were tested against permutations holding the same amount of variable sites. Putative outlier windows from this permutation approach were identified after adjusting for a FDR of 0.01. Our final set of outlier windows consisted of those windows that were significant outliers in both approaches. All statistical procedures and visualizations were implemented in R [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Outlier window positions were compared across the five replicated lake-river comparisons. To evaluate how many overlapping outlier windows were expected by chance, windows were permutated 10,000 times utilizing bedtools [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>To approximate the size of regions of exceptional differentiation more in detail, adjacent outlier windows were combined to form larger contiguous divergent regions of extreme differentiation. In each resulting candidate region, the locus of maximal divergence was determined as a starting point, in which outward steps of 1 kb windows were binned to estimate barrier strength (<italic>b</italic>, ref [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Margins of divergent regions showing extreme differentiation were determined when <italic>b</italic> dropped below 1 (genome-wide average) in two consecutive 1 kb bins. This resulted in divergent regions of exceptional differentiation with distinct sizes estimated to the nearest 1 kb. Divergent regions with sequence coverage (sequence information accessible, see details above) spanning less than 50% of their length were excluded from subsequent analyses. Average sizes of about 50 kb are independent of the initial window size used but specific values reported here are based on the 10 kb window size approach (<xref rid="pgen.1004966.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec003e"><title>Effect of sample size on power</title><p>We acknowledge that estimates of F<sub>ST</sub> based on allele frequencies can vary depending on samples size [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To reduce variation of estimates between populations we kept the samples size constant at 12 alleles per populations. Additionally, our analysis did not rely on per site estimates but instead on averages of F<sub>ST</sub> over larger regions (see above). We evaluated the effect of sample size on our power to describe genomic patterns, detect outlier windows, and define divergent regions in the three following ways. (i) We tested the accuracy of our F<sub>ST</sub> estimates at individual loci by comparing them to estimates based on a larger sample size. The 183 loci used for validating the genotypes (see above) were also used to genotype a larger population sample (n = 26&#x02013;59 per population) to validate allele frequencies and resulting F<sub>ST</sub> estimates. For all population pairs, the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates based on the sequencing approach with 6 individuals per population (12 alleles) had a significant positive correlation with the F<sub>ST</sub> estimates from the Golden Gate assay using at least 26 individuals (Pearson correlation, r = 0.85, P&#x0003c; 10<sup>-16</sup>, df = 241, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s004">S4 Fig.</xref>). (ii) We tested the consistency of window F<sub>ST</sub> estimates across the whole range of potential F<sub>ST</sub> values by jack-knifing samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s005">S5 Fig.</xref>). On average, jack-knifed values (comparing 10 alleles per population) had 95% confidence intervals of 0.039 up to a maximum of 0.175. Windows with high F<sub>ST</sub> values (&#x0003e;0.75) had even narrower confidence intervals (average of 0.027 and maximum of 0.088). These results support the notion that pronounced differences (&#x0201c;near-&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;post-fixation&#x0201d;) can be more reliably detected using our sample sizes than more settled differences (&#x0201c;pre-fixation&#x0201d; regime). (iii) We tested our ability to detect known candidate genes, which highly differentiate between marine and freshwater populations. For this we utilized previous sequencing data available for a marine population from Denmark [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our genome scan based on F<sub>ST</sub> estimates averaged across 10 kb windows reliably detected windows overlapping <italic>ATP1a1</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], a well known candidate gene for physiological adaptation to osmotic differences on linkage group I, in all 6 pairwise European marine-freshwater comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s006">S6 Fig.</xref>). <italic>Eda</italic>, the major gene (linkage group IV) underlying the reduction of lateral plate number frequently observed in freshwater populations [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], was detected in 5 out of the 6 pairwise European marine-freshwater comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1004966.s007">S7 Fig.</xref>). As expected G1_L, a lake population showing phenotypic variation at this trait did not show significant differentiation in the <italic>Eda</italic> region, in which two of the six sequenced individuals were fully plated and carried the same haplotype as the fully plated marine fish. This is in line with a simulation demonstrating that sampling 12 haplotypes yields between 67&#x02013;95% power compared to a gold standard, while notably, sampling fewer individuals has the greatest impact in the &#x0201c;pre-fixation&#x0201d; regime (a beneficial allele is starting to rise in one population) compared to &#x0201c;near-fixation&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;post-fixation&#x0201d; regimes (a beneficial allele is nearly or completely fixed in one population) [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003f"><title>Molecular signature of selection in divergent regions</title><p>To assess the molecular signature of selection in regions of exceptional differentiation, shifts in the allele frequency spectrum were evaluated utilizing T<sub>D</sub>. T<sub>D</sub> in these regions was compared to the genome-wide average of each respective population. A 5% threshold was applied to classify divergent regions into four mutually exclusive categories: background selection if T<sub>D</sub> dropped below the threshold in both parapatric populations, adaptation in lake or river if T<sub>D</sub> dropped below the threshold only in the respective population, and reduced gene flow if T<sub>D</sub> appeared neutral (not below the threshold). Comparing the utilization of population specific thresholds for each pairwise comparison with the utilization of the same overall averaged threshold for all populations resulted in minor differences in absolute numbers of regions in different categories. Furthermore, these differences did not affect qualitative changes with respect to the functional annotation of different categories, nor the proportion of different categories across the five parapatric population pairs.</p></sec><sec id="sec003g"><title>Recombination rates</title><p>Direct measures of fine-scale population recombination rates (&#x003c1; = 4N<sub>e</sub>r) were obtained with LDhat [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] from patterns of genetic variation for each population separately. We filtered highly localized breakdowns of linkage disequilibrium (values of &#x003c1; above 100 between adjacent SNPs), as those are most likely artifacts, possibly due to local misassembly of the reference genome or clusters of erroneous SNPs [<xref rid="pgen.1004966.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
