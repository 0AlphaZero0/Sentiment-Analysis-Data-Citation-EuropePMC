</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex human traits and diseases in the last years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, these variants explain only a small proportion of the estimated heritability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The failure to explain a substantial proportion of the heritability of complex phenotypes is often described as the "missing heritability" problem [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Some of the missing heritability may lie with very rare variants of large effect yet to be detected [3] but heritable complex diseases and traits are also widely believed to have an underlying polygenic architecture [4,5] characterized by a large number of not so rare variants with effects too small to be captured by standard statistical approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have shown that the genotype information in GWASs can be used to explain more of the heritability of common complex traits than revealed by standard analytical methods [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>New statistical approaches have been developed to improve SNP discovery and uncover more polygenic effects without increasing the sample size [7-9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These new methods exploit the notion that some SNP categories are more likely to have a true effect than others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Schork et al. [7] showed that SNPs in some genomic regions (e.g. 5’UTR, 3’UTR, exons or introns) are ”enriched” of significant associations as compared to the baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>It is a plausible assumption that other genomic categories too could be enriched of such associations with complex human phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotides long) that regulate gene expression by inhibiting protein translation or by degrading the mRNA transcript [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A single miRNA may regulate hundreds of functional targets within one cell type simultaneously, providing the cell with an intricate mechanism for fine-tuning the regulation of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Over 1,500 human miRNAs are reported in miRBase version 19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mirbase.org">http://mirbase.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Like protein-coding genes, miRNAs are transcribed mainly by polymerase II as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) in the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, in contrast to protein-coding genes, they are subsequently cleaved to produce stem loop structured precursor molecules (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha along with other factors [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 [12], where the RNase III enzyme Dicer further processes them into mature, short miRNAs that are subsequently incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>MiRNAs are able to impact a variety of cellular pathways and functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that miRNAs are critical to development, apoptosis, cell proliferation, immunity, and patterning of the nervous system [13,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Deregulation of miRNAs leads to a variety of human diseases [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggest that around 30% to 50% of all human genes are regulated by miRNAs [11,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as has emerged from GWAS data [17], more than 90% of disease-associated SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome, for example in promoter regions, enhancers, silencers, or even in non-coding RNA genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>It is therefore reasonable to assume that a number of such non-coding variants may affect miRNA transcription or be involved in the disruption or the creation of miRNA binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Variants in miRNA primary transcripts can affect the expression of miRNAs by altering miRNA processing inside the nucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Variants in mature miRNAs or miRNA binding sites can generate gain and loss of function, leading to alterations of the genetic pathways in which those miRNAs are involved [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>We therefore expect SNPs located in miRNA transcription regions and miRNA binding sites to be more likely to show significant associations with complex human phenotypes compared to baseline SNPs (“enrichment of miRNA vs. baseline SNPs”). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In order to test this hypothesis, we applied the genomic annotation-informed enrichment method first employed by Schork et al. [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We first calculated the relative enrichment of miRNA tagging SNPs using the summary statistics GWAS data of 15 complex human phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>We then leveraged the enrichment in a conditional False Discovery Rate (condFDR) framework to assess the improvement in the detection of individual miRNA-related SNPs associated with these phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>We found that SNPs tagging miRNA sites and binding sites were more likely to be associated with the phenotypes compared to baseline SNPs (i.e. intergenic SNPs), though less compared for instance to 5’UTR SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>A similar enrichment pattern was shown across the majority of human phenotypes investigated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The use of tag SNPs in GWAS limits the discovery of functional variants within a ”tagged” linkage block, potentially overseeing the effect of other variants in only partial linkage disequilibrium (LD) with their tag SNP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>In the current study the LD between SNPs was incorporated as part of a strategy devised to obtain a stronger and more consistent differentiation of enrichment among several annotation categories [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>In our enrichment analysis an LD-weighted scoring algorithm allows the quantification of the properties of multi-locus LD structure implicitly captured by each tag SNP. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>For each GWAS tag SNP a pairwise correlation coefficient approximation to LD (r2) was calculated for all 1KGP SNPs within a 1,000,000 base pairs (1Mb) distance that passed quality control (see above). </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title><text><SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Intergenic SNPs </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>Intergenic SNPs were defined as having LD-weighted annotations scores for each of the other categories equal to zero and being in LD with no SNPs in the 1KGP reference panel located within 100,000 base pairs of a protein coding gene, within a non-coding RNA, within a transcription factor binding site or within a miRNA binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>Those singled out in this way are expected to form a collection of non-genic SNPs not belonging to any (annotated) functional elements within the genome (including through LD) and therefore represent a collection of likely null associations [7]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The empirical null distribution in GWAS is affected by global variance inflation due to population stratification and cryptic relatedness [15] and deflation due to the over-correction caused by the application of standard genomic control methods to polygenic traits [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>We applied a control method leveraging only intergenic SNPs that are likely depleted of true associations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The following procedure was carried out for each phenotype: after conversion of p-values into z-scores, the genomic inflation factor [15], λGC, was estimated as the median squared z-score across intergenic SNPs divided by the expected median of a chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom (the .95 quantile was used for CPD in place of the median). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>We used intergenic SNPs to estimate inflation because their relative depletion of associations suggests they provide a robust estimate of true null SNPs that is uncontaminated by polygenic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Using annotation categories in this fashion is important given concerns posed by recent GWAS [8] about the over-correction of test statistics using standard genomic control. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>The main finding of the current study is that SNPs in miRNA-related regions show a significant and persistent pattern of association enrichment in a variety of complex human phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>This supports the thesis that miRNAs play an important role in the etiology of these phenotypes, and further illustrates the polygenic architecture of complex human phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>The traditional statistical approach to GWASs has thus far only explained a small proportion of the observed heritability of complex human traits and disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>However, previous studies have suggested that higher proportions of polygenic effects are to some extent actually detectable in existing GWAS data [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The statistical framework adopted here is based on the reasonable assumption that SNPs in different genomic regions are not equally likely to affect the phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>Rather, as has been shown before, SNPs within certain functional regions of the genome [7] or SNPs with possible pleiotropic effects are more prone to show association. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>A large share of miRNA transcription regions and, by their very nature, all miRNA target regions are clustered in or around genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>This exposes the SNPs held within such regions to correlation with SNPs in other genic categories (e.g., 3’UTR, 5’UTR, exons, introns). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>This correlation is further exasperated by the LD-weighting procedure applied to account for indirect effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>And indeed, controlling for this correlation does reduce the significance of miRNA enrichment, which however for the most part holds, suggesting it contains a residual pure miRNA component [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Further, the replication analysis shows clearly that SNPs tagging miRNA are more likely to be replicated, which is a very compelling argument in favour of true discoveries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>The replication results emboldened us to use the LD-weighted miRNA annotations, combined with an established method for computing conditional False Discovery Rates, to improve the discovery of SNPs in GWAS. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>The statistical framework employed here has elsewhere been exploited to identify specific SNP associations, which are otherwise undetected by traditional GWAS analyses [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>The current findings suggest that leveraging information about miRNA affiliation leads to an increased number of identified gene loci, as shown for all phenotypes in Table 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>The increase is not due merely to an effective lowering of the significance threshold, since the condFDR method also re-ranks the SNPs, privileging those with higher prior likelihood of association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Indeed, for Crohn’s disease (Figure 3) we show that miRNA SNPs identified with the condFDR method have a higher probability of replicating in independent samples (replication rate). </plain></SENT>
