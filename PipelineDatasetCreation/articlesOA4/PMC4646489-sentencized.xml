</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The biological phenotype of each type of cancer is defined by genomic and epigenomic alterations that exist in cancer cells, some of which are regarded as “driver” mutations based on their importance in the tumorigenesis of each cancer type [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>One tumor-type-specific driver mutation is a fusion oncogene produced by chromosomal translocations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and specificity of unique fusion genes is high in a number of soft tissue sarcomas (STSs), and this is useful for molecular diagnoses and also serves as a tool for identifying therapeutic targets [3,4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>However, in some cases, identical fusion genes have been detected in completely different tumor types, i.e., EWSR1-ATF1 in clear cell sarcoma (CCS) and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma) [5,6], and ETV6-NTRK3 in congenital fibrosarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia [7,8], suggesting that the cellular context of the cell-of-origin of tumors plays an important role in the function of each fusion protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>This issue is also important when suitable therapeutic targets are being searched for among the downstream genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, most STSs are origin-unknown tumors; therefore, the cellular context of the cell-of-origin of tumors has not yet been investigated in detail. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an origin-unknown STS with a unique fusion gene generated by a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which has been detected in more than 95% of tumors [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This translocation results in the fusion of the SS18 (also known as SYT) gene on chromosome 18 to the SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 gene on the X chromosome, thereby creating the SS18-SSX fusion gene [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported that the SS18-SSX fusion protein functioned as an oncoprotein and played a critical role in the development of SS [12,13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>SS18-SSX consists of the domain for Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins in a part of SS18 and that for polycomb-group (PcG) proteins in a part of SSX; therefore, SS18-SSX may function as a transcriptional regulator even though it has no apparent DNA-binding domain [14–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that SS18-SSX is involved in chromatin remodeling through associations with TrxG and PcG complexes [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We previously analyzed the gene expression profiles of SSs along with other types of sarcomas using a genome-wide microarray and found that SS shared an expression profile with the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) [20], the cell-of-origin of which is a Schwann cell, a derivative of neural crest cells (NCCs) [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, proteome analyses of STS revealed that SSs were clustered with MPNST and also with CCS [22], which is another NCC-derived tumor [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Although these findings are not conclusive for the neural crest origin of SS, and other cellular lineages may be candidates for its origin, since this is the first study to investigate the effects of the cellular context, we selected the neural crest lineage for further analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The expression of direct-downstream genes may serve as a useful marker for monitoring the function of SS18-SSX in various types of cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Our genome-wide microarray analysis also identified the Frizzled homologue 10 (FZD10) gene, which is a member of the Frizzled family and encodes a putative Wnt receptor, as a gene specifically up-regulated in SS [20]. FZD10 was previously shown to be expressed at very high levels in nearly all SS tumors and cell lines, but was absent in most normal organs, except for the placenta, or in some cancers arising in other tissues [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Additionally, knockdown experiments using siRNA showed that FZD10 was significantly involved in the tumor growth of SS [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that FZD10 is a direct target of SS18-SSX and a suitable indicator for monitoring the function of SS18-SSX in the expression of its target genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>We herein investigated the role of the cellular context in the function of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) containing the drug-inducible SS18-SSX2 gene [25], we performed serial expression analyses of SS18-SSX2 at various differentiation stages from PSCs to NCC-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and showed the cellular context-dependent effects of SS18-SSX on the regulation of its target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrated the importance of the cellular context for the function of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying SS development, particularly concerning the involvement of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Although the SS18-SSX fusion protein has no apparent DNA-binding domain, it has been suggested to play a role in chromatin remodeling through an association with TrxG and/or PcG complexes [12,17,18,34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Su et al. revealed that SS18-SSX2 bridged ATF2 and TLE1, which is a member of the TLE family of proteins with co-repressor activity, and generated a suppressive complex on ATF2 target genes [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Kadoch and Crabtree proposed a model for transcriptional activation, in which SS18-SSX disrupts the normal architecture of the BAF complex by replacing SS18 and eliminating BAF47 from the complex, thereby reversing the polycomb-mediated repression of the SOX2 gene [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>In both mechanisms, SS18-SSX requires partners to exert its function, which may differ in each gene and also in each cell type. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function experiments using SS cell lines and gain-of-function approaches using normal cells identified several target genes of SS18-SSX, such as IGF2 and EGR1, and showed the important role of SS18-SSX in cell growth and focal adhesion [35–40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>However, the gene set identified in these in vitro experiments did not necessarily match those found by the expression profiles of SS tumors [13,41,42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>These findings implied that the contexts of cells used in previous experiments were not fully appropriate for understanding the function of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we herein investigated the impact of the cellular context on the function of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Based on our and others’ previous studies, we selected cells in the neural crest lineage as tentative target cells of SS18-SSX, and induced SS18-SSX2 at the PSC, NCC, and NCC-derived MSC stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>As a result, the expression of FZD10, a direct target of SS18-SSX2, was detected in hPSCs and hPSC-NCCs, but not in hPSC-MSCs with the induction of SS18-SSX2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SS18-SSX2 had cell type-dependent effects on cell viability, which was consistent with previous findings showing growth-suppressive effects in certain cell types. Nagai et al. reported differences in the transforming activity of SS18-SSX1 between 3Y1 rat fibroblasts and NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts [12], which may be related to the up-regulation of p21 by SS18-SSX1 in the latter, but not in the former cells [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>We observed a similar cell type-related induction of the FZD10 gene by SS18-SSX2, and, importantly, this stage-specific induction correlated with the stage- specific change in histone modifications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>SS18-SSX2 changed the histone marks of the FZD10 locus into an active state by reducing H3K27me3, and increasing H3K4me3 and H3Ac in hESCs and hNCCs, but not in hNCC-derived MSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>In other words, the cellular context had a prominent impact on the function of SS18-SSX as an epigenetic modifier. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>The responsible factors of the cellular context for determining the effects of oncogenic events currently remain unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In the case of the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene, the context of the target cells of CCS determined the expression of the MITF gene, which is the key transcription factor for the melanocytic phenotype of CCS [6,44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Although we have not yet elucidated the underlying mechanism in SS, the presence of BAF47 appeared to be an important factor for determining the effects of SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we demonstrated that SS18-SSX2 decreased the expression level of the BAF47 protein in hESCs and hESC-NCCs, which is consistent with previous findings [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>However, the endogenous expression of BAF47 was markedly lower in hESC-MSCs than in hESCs or hESC-NCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>BAF47 is a member of the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and its expression was previously shown to be reduced in SS tissues [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Mammalian BAF complexes are considered to be combinationally assembled from several subunits during development and acquire specific functions in biological processes, including the maintenance of pluripotency and neuronal differentiation [46,47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the content of the BAF complex associated with the FZD10 gene may vary in cell stages, which may cause the cellular context-dependent regulation of this gene by SS18-SSX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Precise biochemical analyses of the members of the complex associated with the promoter of FZD10 in each cell type will provide more concrete evidence for this cellular context specificity, and we are currently investigating this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Although recent studies have advocated several possible cellular origins of SS, including multipotent stem cells and precursors of a muscle lineage, the cell-of-origin of SS still remains controversial [13,48–50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that the induction of SS18-SSX2 altered the global gene expression of hNCCs to be closer to those of SS cell lines; therefore, hNCC may serve as the origin of SS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>Although we employed the neural crest lineage in this study, our inducible system is applicable to other lineages in order to identify the cells-of-origin of SS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>In addition, the cellular context-specific function of fusion proteins represents an important issue in the search for target molecules for the treatment of SS, and our inducible system will be a powerful tool for investigating this issue. </plain></SENT>
