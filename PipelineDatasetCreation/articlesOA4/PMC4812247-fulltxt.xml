Despite lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity, scaffold proteins such as Gab2, play a pivotal role in IL-2-triggered signal transduction integrating, diversifying and amplifying the signal by serving as a platform for the assembly of effectors proteins. Traditionally, Gab2-mediated protein recruitment was believed to solely depend on cytokine-induced phosphotyrosine moieties. At present, phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues is also emerging as a key mediator of Gab2-dependent signal regulation. Despite its relevance, IL-2-triggered regulation on Gab2 phosphorylation is yet poorly understood. Combining antibody- and TiO<sub>2</sub>-based enrichment of the scaffold protein with SILAC quantitative mass spectrometry we disclose the prominent regulation IL-2 exerts on Gab2 serine/threonine phosphorylation by showing that at least 18 serines and 1 threonine, including previously non-reported ones, become phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation. Additionally, we decipher the interactome of the docking protein in resting and cytokine-treated T-lymphocytes and besides well-known Gab2 interactors we discover three novel cytokine-inducible Gab2-binding proteins. Thus, our data provide novel insights and a wealth of candidates for future studies that will shed light into the role of Gab2 in IL-2-initiated signal transduction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that promotes differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes into effector and memory T-cells respectively, augments the cytolytic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and natural killer cells (NK-cells), triggers activation-induced cell death (AICD) and stimulates proliferation of different immune cell types<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Indeed, due to its capacity to promote T-cell growth, IL-2 has clinically emerged as the most widely used cytokine in adoptive immunotherapy for cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Despite its effectiveness, IL-2 treatment is often accompanied by undesired side effects that must be overcome in order to ensure safer therapies. Hence, the characterization of the molecular events underlying IL-2-dependent responses constitutes a key way into the development of more accurate treatments.</p><p>Binding of IL-2 to its transmembrane receptor (IL-2R) results in the rapid activation of highly interconnected and carefully orchestrated signaling pathways that ultimately converge into the nucleus eventually elaborating the desired cellular output<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. The initial step in IL-2 signaling involves activation of JAK tyrosine kinases which phosphorylate the receptor, thus creating anchoring sites for signal relay molecules bearing phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains that are subsequently phosphorylated as well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Hence, the binding of the cytokine to the cell surface promotes the formation of large intracellular molecular complexes that allow a fast and amplified propagation of the signal. Among the recruited proteins, several of them constitute enzymes or transcription factors whose activity is indeed regulated by site-specific modifications<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Additionally, some of the molecular characters associated to the activated receptors represent scaffold or docking proteins with no inherent enzymatic or transcriptional activity, but importantly serving as physical platforms facilitating the assembly of the signalling hubs. Scaffold molecules thereby enable the localization of other effector proteins at specific cellular compartments, protect them from inactivation and integrate positive and negative feedback mechanisms, ultimately allowing the modulation of the signal transduction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>Among the scaffold proteins involved in the signaling transduction triggered by IL-2 stands the human Grb2-associate binder (Gab) family, which is comprised by three members (Gab1&#x02013;3). Upon stimulation Gab proteins become phosphorylated and act as molecular bridges between growth factor- or cytokine-activated receptor complexes and downstream signaling molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In fact, among others we have demonstrated that docking proteins Gab2 and Gab3 become tyrosine phosphorylated and hence, participate in the signaling networks initiated by IL-2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Upon stimulation, phosphotyrosine moieties mediate the interaction with diverse signaling molecules, such as, PTPN11, p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, PLC&#x003b3;, Shc and CrkL which leads to the activation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Indeed, Gab2 overexpression has been shown to promote the alteration of these signaling branches, importantly contributing to the development of distinct cancers including breast and ovarian cancer, leukemia and melanoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>At present, serine and threonine phosphorylations of Gabs are emerging as key regulatory mechanism that can determine the fate of the signal. Lynch and co-workers first demonstrated that AKT-mediated phosphorylation on Gab2 S159 contributes to the attenuation of heregulin (HRG)-activated signaling pathways by uncoupling Gab2 from ErbB receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Similarly, growth factor-triggered phosphorylation on Gab2 S210 and T391 has been shown to mediate negative feedback regulation by recruiting 14&#x02013;3&#x02013;3 proteins that disrupt Gab2/Grb2 interaction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. The biological significance of such finding became clear with the recent discovery that Gab1 T387, corresponding to Gab2 T391, is mutated (T387N) in breast cancer which results in EGF-independent proliferation of mammary epithelial cells as a consequence of impaired signal attenuation mechanism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Consequently, the biological relevance of Gab2 phosphorylation occurring not only on tyrosines but also on serine and threonine residues is indisputable.</p><p>Biochemical analyses have already suggested that Gab2 is highly phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in response to IL-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. However, the precise effect that IL-2 exerts on the distinct site-specific phosphorylable residues on the scaffold proteins remains elusive. Here, we present the largest phosphoproteomic study depicting Gab2 phosphorylations in resting and IL-2-treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes. We identify 29 distinct phosphorylations on human Gab2 including 3 novel phosphorylated serine residues (pS146, pS147 and pS459) that have never been reported before. More importantly, we provide robust quantification data regarding 24 phosphorylation sites and provide evidence indicating that IL-2 triggers at least the phosphorylation of 18 serines and 1 threonine. Additionally, considering that the role of Gab2 consists on serving as a molecular platform to recruit distinct signaling proteins, we dissected the Gab2 interactome in resting and cytokine-treated T-lymphocytes by taking advantage of Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) quantitative mass spectrometry (Q-MS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Besides detecting already reported cytokine-dependent and &#x02013; independent Gab2 interactors, we discovered 3 previously unknown cytokine-inducible Gab2-binding proteins which were further validated by Western blotting. Collectively, the data provided here considerably expand the current knowledge of the IL-2-dependent regulation of Gab2 which may originate a plethora of future investigations shedding new light into the role of the scaffold proteins in the signaling networks initiated by IL-2.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Kit225 T-lymphocytes express Gab2 and Gab3 but not Gab1</title><p>Our previous studies deciphering the tyrosine-phosphoproteome of IL-2 pathways demonstrated that Gab2 and Gab3 participate in the signal transduction initiated by the cytokine in Kit225 T-lymphocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Gab1, in turn, has never been identified in those experiments, which does not necessarily imply that is not expressed in Kit225 T-cells. For that reason, in order to determine which Gab family members are expressed in this CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell line, mRNA levels of each gene-product were measured by real time quantitative PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>, mRNA levels of Gab2 and Gab3 were high in Kit225 T-cells, whereas Gab1 gene expression was nearly undetectable. On the contrary, HeLa cells expressed high levels of Gab1 but low or almost undetectable amounts of Gab2 and Gab3, which is in agreement with recently published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In line with that, Western blot analyses revealed that expression of Gab1 and Gab2 is restricted to HeLa and Kit225 T-cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Antibody-based detection of Gab3 was not successful but our previous mass spectrometry-based works have repeatedly demonstrated that Gab3 is also expressed in Kit225 T-lymphocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Altogether, our data indicate that Gab2 and Gab3 are the only Gab family members predominantly expressed in Kit225 T-cells and hence, participating in IL-2 signal transduction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics/proteomics approach to characterize IL-2-triggered regulation of Gab2</title><p>Gab2 and Gab3 family members share moderate sequence homology (33.4% identity) but they conserve the same modular structure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Therefore, it seems plausible that IL-2-triggered regulation of both scaffold proteins does not differ so much. Nonetheless, Gab2 is larger than Gab3 and contains more protein binding regions which may explain why Gab2-deficient mice show more defects that Gab3-deficient ones<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. For that reason, we decided to focus our investigation on studying in detail IL-2-mediated modulation of Gab2 as the representative Gab family member expressed in Kit225 T-cells.</p><p>To depict Gab2 site-specific phosphorylation events and unveil the cytokine-dependent and &#x02013;independent interactors of the scaffold protein we followed the experimental design outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>. Two populations of Kit225 T-cells were cultured in &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; media and were kept unstimulated (Ctr) or were stimulated for 5&#x02009;minutes with IL-2, respectively. After cell lysis, samples were equally mixed, subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against Gab2 and eluted immune complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion. Part of the sample was desalted and directly analyzed by LC-MS/MS aiming to detect Gab2-interacting partners whereas the remaining part was enriched in phosphopeptides using TiO<sub>2</sub> beads prior to MS analysis. In addition to detect site-specific phosphorylations and putative Gab2 interactors, the use of SILAC allows discerning between IL-2-dependent and -independent phosphorylation events as well as constitutive and IL-2-inducible Gab2 interactors. A phosphopeptide bearing a site-specific phosphorylation that is not affected by IL-2 stimulation will be similarly enriched in resting and cytokine-treated cells, thus it will display a SILAC IL-2/Ctr ratio of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, left MS spectra). Likewise, peptides derived from a protein that is constitutively associated with the scaffold protein will also show a SILAC ratio of 1. On the contrary, if IL-2 induces phosphorylation on a specific residue or promotes an interaction between Gab2 and a signaling protein, the corresponding phosphopeptide and peptides respectively, will be more abundant in the cytokine-treated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>, right MS spectra).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Depicting Gab2 phosphorylation in resting and IL-2-treated T-lymphocytes</title><p>Following the approach described above, we confidently identified 29 amino acids on Gab2 that are phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> including 22 phosphorylated serines (pS), 5 phosphorylated threonines (pT) and 2 phosphorylated tyrosines (pY). Interestingly, 6 of these Gab2 pS (pS133, pS148, pS149, pS223, pS281, pS422) are conserved in the Gab family member Gab3 (corresponding to pS132, pS141, pS142, pS209, pS242, pS362, respectively) that is also expressed in Kit225 T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the phosphorylated Gab2 residues S141, T319 and T391 align with distinct but still phosphorylable Gab3 residues (T134, S273 and S344, respectively). In fact, we have already demonstrated that Gab3 S344 and S362 are phosphorylated in IL-2-treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Altogether, it seems plausible that the putative and confirmed Gab3 phosphosites mentioned above are subjected to similar regulation as Gab2 in Kit225 T-cells upon cytokine treatment.</p><p>It is worth highlighting that this is the first study demonstrating that Gab2 S147 and S459 can be phosphorylated in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes. Moreover, this study provides unprecedented evidence indicating that human Gab2 S146 can also be phosphorylated, a residue that was already reported to be modified in mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The precise assignment of those phosphorylation sites was verified by manual annotation of their corresponding fragmentation spectra. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>, the presence of the 984.58<sup>+1</sup> ion (y9** in SpSPAELpS<sup>146</sup>SpSSQHLLR) and the absence of the 1093.4534<sup>+1</sup> ion (y8 in SpSPAELSpS<sup>147</sup>pSSQHLLR) supports the unambiguous identification of the phosphorylation of S146 residue in Gab2. Similarly, the presence of the 915.51<sup>+1</sup> and 846.488<sup>+1</sup> ions (y8* and y7 in SpSPAELSpS<sup>147</sup>SSQHLLR) and the absence of the ion 915.51<sup>+1</sup> (y7 in SpSPAELSSpS<sup>148</sup>SQHLLR or SpSPAELSSSpS<sup>149</sup>QHLLR) allows to assign the position of the phosphosite to S147 of Gab2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). Regarding the Gab2 phosphopeptide comprising amino acid residues 443&#x02013;467, the discriminating ions y8 and y9* indicate that among the six phosphorylable residues within the Gab2 phosphopeptide 443&#x02013;467, only S459 is phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p><p>Gab2 is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 and accordingly we found that Y476 and Y643 become phosphorylated in cytokine-treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). More interestingly, the study presented here identified a large number of Gab2 pS/pT residues that are differentially regulated in response to IL-2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Our SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomic screen shows that phosphorylations on Gab2 S210, T287, T385 and T391 are not affected (0.5&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;IL-2/Ctr ratio&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2, in both replicas) by cytokine stimulation. On the contrary, we provide evidence indicating that 18 serines and 1 threonine (T319) distributed along the central 400 amino acid-region of Gab2 (aa 141&#x02013;543) become phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes treated with IL-2. It should be noted that Gab2 pS147, pS149 and pS281 do not display a SILAC ratio in both replicas but still according to peak intensity data collected, the three phosphosites are induced in response to IL-2 treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>, the three phosphosites are barely detectable in the light-labeled peak of the SILAC pair corresponding to resting T-cells (no intensity value). On the contrary, all of them were detected in the heavy-labeled SILAC condition corresponding to cytokine-treated T-lymphocytes and thus display a signal intensity which indicates that the three residues are phosphorylated upon IL-2 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A&#x02013;C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, results presented here represent the largest dataset of IL-2-dependent and-independent Gab2 phosphorylations reported to date. Hence, our study adds to a growing body of literature that points towards phosphorylations occurring on serine and threonine residues as key players in the signaling pathways modulated by Gab2. Future investigation will be necessary to clarify the role of each site-specific phosphorylation in the signal transduction initiated by IL-2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Dissecting the interactome of Gab2 in IL-2-treated T-lymphocytes</title><p>Phosphorylations on Gab2 serve as docking sites for downstream molecules that participate in the distinct signaling branches activated upon engagement of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor. In order to identify the proteins that are recruited to Gab2 in response to IL-2 stimulation, we combined immunoprecipitation of the endogenous scaffold protein with SILAC-based quantitative mass spectrometry as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>.</p><p>We quantified 709 and 714 proteins in the first and second replica performed respectively, of which 646 were commonly quantified in the two experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Comparison of the SILAC ratios obtained for those proteins showed strong correlation between the two biological replicas with Pearson coefficient of 0.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>). The majority of the proteins were found equally enriched in resting and IL-2-treated T-lymphocytes. These dataset embrace constitutive Gab2-binding proteins as well as unspecific interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref>). It should be noted that among IL-2-independent Gab2-interacting proteins we detected the adaptor protein Grb2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The constitutive association between the two proteins was further validated by Gab2 immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). These results indicate that the scaffold protein Gab2 and the adaptor protein Grb2 form a stable complex in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes, which is line with previously published data<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.</p><p>More interestingly, our interactome analysis revealed 9 proteins that were significantly enriched in Gab2-containing immune complexes upon cytokine stimulation (IL-2/Ctr &#x0003e;1.5; Significance B p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) indicating that their association with Gab2 depends on IL-2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The 9 inducible Gab2-interacting proteins detected displayed consistent SILAC ratio in the two biological replicas performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 and p85 PI3-kinase regulatory subunits alpha and beta (PIK3R1 and PIK3R2, respectively) were the IL-2-inducible Gab2 interactors showing the highest SILAC ratio. We validated these results by Western blot analyses which agree with previous studies showing that PTPN11 and p85 PI3-kinase interact with the tyrosine phosphorylated version of Gab2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. Additionally, all catalytic subunits comprising the Class I<sub>A</sub> of PI3K family were also found to be enriched in IL-2 treated conditions (PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CD). More interestingly, for the first time this study provides evidence that DLAT (a subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) and transcription factors ARID3A and ARID3B associate with Gab2 in response to IL-2 stimulation. We could further confirm by immunoblotting that the three novel Gab2 interactors discovered in this study, named DLAT, ARID3A and ARID3B, indeed interact with Gab2 scaffold protein in IL-2-stimulated Kit225 T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p>The biological information extracted from the SILAC ratios obtained in the Gab2 immunoprecipitation experiments is unquestionable as they allow recognizing the specific cytokine-dependent interactors of the scaffold protein from a dataset composed by hundreds of proteins. Nonetheless, protein SILAC ratios do not provide information on the relative abundance of the proteins within the complex. This however can be extracted from the peptide intensity information in the dataset since it is assumed that the signal response of the three most abundant peptides can provide good approximation of the amount of protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Accordingly, we calculated the relative abundance of each IL-2-dependent Gab2 interactor detected in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Our data indicate that the most prominent proteins associating with Gab2 are PTPN11 and PIK3R1, indeed the two well-documented interactors of the scaffold protein. Strikingly, the binding level of ARID3B, the newly identified interactor of Gab2, was also found to be among the highest. The catalytic subunits of PI3-kinase family were detected lower in abundance as well as the novel interactors ARID3A and DLAT.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>IL-2-triggered signaling pathways are strictly fine-tuned by tyrosine phosphorylation events that trigger and modulate a wide range of processes such as protein-protein interaction, protein localization and enzymatic activity of distinct signaling molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>.

Grb2 is a small adaptor protein composed by a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that allows association with phosphorylated tyrosine resides, flanked by two SH3 domains that recognize proline-rich motifs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Depending on the cellular system Grb2/Gab2 complex has been found to be either constitutive or inducible. Whereas IL-3 stimulation of the murine pro-B-cell line Ba/F3 results in a significantly enhanced interaction between Grb2 and Gab2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>, both proteins are identically associated in murine myeloid FDC-P1 cells treated or not with the colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. We provide substantial evidence indicating that the adaptor protein Grb2 is constitutively associated with Gab2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> Kit225 T-lymphocytes. Consequently, as the binding does not depend on tyrosine phosphorylation, it could be postulated that Grb2 SH3 domain and Gab2 proline-rich domains are involved in the formation of Grb2/Gab2 complex in Kit225 T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Noticeably, our previous study demonstrated that Grb2 can be recruited to cytokine-induced pY375 on IL-2R&#x003b3; (manuscript in preparation). Thus, it seem plausible that upon IL-2 stimulation Grb2 and its constitutive interactor Gab2 are recruited to the activated receptor complex through the SH2 domains of Grb2.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that Grb2/Gab2 interaction can be disrupted as a consequence of Gab2 S210 and T391 phosphorylation and subsequent 14-3-3 protein recruitment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. We show that Gab2 pS210 and pT391 are not robustly induced in response to cytokine stimulation. In accordance, our Gab2 interactome study demonstrates that 14-3-3 beta/alpha, which displayed a SILAC ratio of 1.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), is not recruited to Gab2 in IL-2-treated T-lymphocytes. Moreover, we observe that Grb2/Gab2 interaction remains unaffected upon cytokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). Overall, the integration of the quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses indicate that this negative feedback mechanism is still not activated in Kit225 T-lymphocytes treated with IL-2 for 5&#x02009;minutes.</p><p>Once assembled within the activated receptor complex, Gab2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in order to recruit downstream signaling molecules. Accordingly, our combinatorial Q-MS screen depicted several IL-2-triggered tyrosine phosphorylations in addition to numerous IL-2-inducible Gab2-interacting proteins. We demonstrate here that Gab2 Y476 and Y643 become phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> upon 5&#x02009;minutes treatment with IL-2 and provide substantial evidence indicating that the endogenous p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase and tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 associate with the scaffold protein in response to cytokine stimulation of T-lymphocytes. This is well in line with previous studies indicating that among others Gab2 pY476 and pY643 are involved in recruiting the p85 subunit of the PI3-kinase and the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Additionally, it has been reported that Gab2 pS210 inhibits the recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11 in response to growth factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. As mentioned above, our study unveiled that Gab2 pS210 is not subjected to IL-2-mediated regulation after 5&#x02009;minutes stimulation with the cytokine. These data suggest that the mechanisms disrupting the interaction between Gab2 and PTPN11 are not activated at early stages of IL-2 signal transduction.</p><p>Our investigation also resulted in the detection of three catalytic subunits of the Class IA PI3K family (PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CD) as cytokine-induced Gab2-binding proteins. In an attempt to determine whether they are direct or indirect interactors of the scaffold protein we calculated their relative abundance within the complex. In comparison to the well-known direct Gab2 interaction partners PTPN11 and p85 PI3-kinase that were found to be the most prominent interactors of the scaffold protein upon IL-2 stimulation, the relative abundance of the three catalytic PI3K subunits was very low. Hence, we postulate that whereas PTPN11 and p85 associate directly with tyrosine phosphorylated Gab2, the catalytic PI3K subunits detected in this study are recruited to the scaffold protein indirectly via the p85 regulatory subunit.</p><p>The formation of Gab2/PTPN11 and Gab2/PI3K complexes leads to the activation of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling branches, respectively. Both pathways are essential to assure IL-2-induced proliferation of Kit225 T-lymphocytes as we demonstrated in our previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. MAPK and AKT serine/threonine kinases are the two core representatives of RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways and both are known to phosphorylate a plethora of substrates. In addition to targeting downstream signaling molecules, both kinases also phosphorylate upstream effectors creating negative feedback mechanisms that are fundamental for the adequate orchestration of signal transduction. Arnaud and colleagues demonstrated that pre-treatment of T-cells with MEK and PI3K inhibitor decreased the characteristic shift of Gab2 in response to IL-2 suggesting that both signaling branches are involved in phosphorylating the scaffold protein Gab2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. In fact, the study presented here uncovers the enormous impact IL-2 exerts on the serine/threonine phosphorylation status of Gab2. We found numerous site-specific Gab2 phosphorylations, including previously non-reported ones, that were induced in response to IL-2 stimulation in T-lymphocytes.</p><p>Recently, Eulenfeld and co-workers have shown that MAPK-dependent phosphorylation on S551 in Gab1 is crucial for the recruitment of the scaffold protein to the plasma membrane and initiate a positive-feedback loop that results in enhanced MAPK activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. This specific Gab1 residue is conserved in Gab2 and corresponds to S543. Strikingly, our SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics screen shows that Gab2 pS543 is induced <italic>in vivo</italic> in Kit225 T-lymphocytes. Thus, it is likely that Gab2 pS543 is also involved in the membrane recruitment of Gab2 which allows the scaffold protein being in close proximity with signaling effectors that assure the propagation of signal transduction.</p><p>More importantly, this study reveals large number of Gab2 serine/threonine phosphorylations, including three novel phosphorylated serines, that are modulated upon IL-2 stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>). In addition, we also discovered and further validated that DLAT, ARID3A and ARID3B associate with Gab2 in response to cytokine stimulation in Kit225 T-cells. The overall regulation of Gab2-mediated signal transduction is determined by the crosstalk of phosphosites that ultimately orchestrate the protein recruitment/release balance. Consequently, this study provides a wealth of candidates for future hypothesis-driven mechanism-focused studies that may gain insights into the regulation and role of Gab2 in the signal propagation initiated by IL-2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture and stimulation</title><p>The IL-2-dependent human T-cell line Kit225<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate and 16&#x02009;U/ml of recombinant human IL-2 (kindly provided by AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIH, USA) at a density of 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
