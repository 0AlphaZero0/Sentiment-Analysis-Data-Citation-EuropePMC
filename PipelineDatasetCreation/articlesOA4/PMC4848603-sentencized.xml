</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infects the genital mucosa and establishes latency with life-long infection in sensory dorsal root ganglia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Frequent viral reactivation of HSV-2 induces recurrent genital disease or, more often, asymptomatic shedding of the virus [1,2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>HSV-2 infection constitutes a considerable burden of disease and a recent global estimate on HSV-2 infection concluded that 417 million people aged 15–49 years were infected 2012 giving a world-wide prevalence of 11.3%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 19.2 million individuals were newly-infected in 2012 [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In new-born and in immunocompromised patients, the HSV-2 infection can elicit severe and often fatal central nervous system infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, HSV-2 infection significantly increases the risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A prophylactic vaccine would be the best means to decrease HSV-2-related morbidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, no vaccine is approved and clinical trials using the glycoprotein B (gB) and/or glycoprotein D (gD) have failed to protect against HSV-2 infection or disease [6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>New vaccine candidates are therefore warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The envelope glycoprotein G of HSV-2 (gG-2) is cleaved during processing into two proteins; an O-glycosylated mature portion of gG-2 (mgG-2) with a transmembraneous region (TMR), and a protein lacking a TMR, which is rapidly secreted to the culture medium (sgG-2), [8,9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The two proteins have no significant amino acid sequence identity (&lt;25%), [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Both proteins elicit exclusively type-specific antibody [12,13,14,15] and CD4+ T cell-responses [16,17] in humans and mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The mgG-2 protein has been used for several years as a type-specific antigen for HSV-2 specific serodiagnosis [14,15,18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The function of mgG-2 in genital HSV-2 infection is elusive, but mgG-2 has been proposed to facilitate extracellular release of virions in vitro [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>More data are available regarding the function of sgG-2 in HSV-2 infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>An sgG-2 derived 15-mer synthetic peptide was shown in vitro to be a chemoattractant for monocytes and neutrophils. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>This response inhibited natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and accelerated the apoptotic cell death in NK cell-enriched lymphocyte populations [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Viejo-Borbolla et al. showed that sgG-2 binds with high affinity to several CC and CXC chemokines and that the interaction of sgG-2 is involved the glycosaminoglycan-binding region of the chemokines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Notably, this interaction increased chemotaxis of leukocytes both in vitro and in vivo [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Recently, the same group presented data that the interaction of sgG-2 with glycosaminoglycans induce lipid raft clustering with incorporation of CXCR4 receptors with the result of increased chemotaxis and signaling [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, sgG-2 was shown to increase nerve-growth factor dependent axonal growth of free nerve endings, a mechanism which may facilitate the genital infection of HSV-2 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>These effects indicate novel interactions of sgG-2 with both the immune and the nervous system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>The sgG-2 protein is unique among the HSV proteins as a corresponding sgG-2 sequence is lacking in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Although positional glycoprotein G (gG) orthologs, located in US4 gene, have been described within the genomes of most mammalian alphaherpesviruses, secreted gG proteins have not been evaluated as vaccine candidates in animals or in pre-clinical studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate whether vaccination with sgG-2 can induce protective immunity in mice against genital HSV-2 infection. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>It is well known that CpG as adjuvant induces a type 1 helper (Th1) biased CD4+ T cell response with production of for example interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ and a shift towards IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3 antibodies. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="162" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="163" pm="."><plain>We show that vaccination with native sgG-2 combined with CpG and alum given intra-muscularly induced complete protection from death with minimal genital and systemic disease after intra-vaginal challenge with a fully virulent HSV-2 strain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="164" pm="."><plain>No or low protective immunity was observed for mice vaccinated with sgG-2 alone, with CpG and alum alone, and with the OBP protein of HSV-1 combined with CpG and alum, indicating that the protection was obtained by the intramuscular administrations of sgG-2 together with selected adjuvants CpG and alum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="165" pm="."><plain>Initially we compared the intramuscular immunizations with the subcutaneous + intranasal immunizations showing that the intramuscular protocol was significantly better. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="166" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in our earlier report, using mgG-2 as vaccine antigen, the intramuscular administration induced significantly higher survival rate, lower disease scores and higher IgG1, IgG2b and IgG2c antibody levels [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="167" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms behind these differences are to our knowledge unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="168" pm="."><plain>As the intramuscular protocol is certainly the best choice for continuing the pre-clinical studies, the immune responses for sgG-2 + adjuvant i.m. immunized mice were compared with PBS immunized controls. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="169" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that CD4+ T cell proliferation is essential in order to induce protection against genital HSV-2 in vaccinated mice [32,33,34,35,36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="170" pm="."><plain>In this study, protective immunity was possibly, although not proven, dependent on the CD4+ T cell responses and production of IFN-γ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="171" pm="."><plain>The importance of IFN-γ for survival and reduction of local vaginal replication of HSV-2 was shown earlier using the mgG-2 as immunizing antigen in IFN-γ gene knockout mice [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="172" pm="."><plain>To more precisely identify the role of CD4+ T cells in protection after vaccination with sgG-2, further experiments are necessary, including, for example, transfer or depletion of T cells or using genetic modified mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="173" pm="."><plain>The induction of neutralizing antibodies is often considered as an important end-point after vaccination against different viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="174" pm="."><plain>In the clinical prophylactic vaccine study using gD-2 as antigen no protection against HSV-2 infection or disease was presented [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="175" pm="."><plain>However, the observed protection against HSV-1 induced disease and infection correlated to antibodies and not to cellular immune responses [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="176" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for these unexpected findings might be that the neutralization activity was significantly higher against HSV-1 than to HSV-2 [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="177" pm="."><plain>The sgG-2 + adjuvant i.m. immunized mice elicited robust IgG1, IgG2b and IgG2c levels of antibodies (Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="178" pm="."><plain>sgG-2 is rapidly secreted after infection and lacks a TMR, implying that the protein is not incorporated into the envelope of the virions or in virus infected cell membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="179" pm="."><plain>As the virion is not available as target, it was expected that the anti-sgG-2 antibodies did not exhibit neutralizing activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="180" pm="."><plain>However, it is well-known that antibodies can be protective without neutralizing activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>It has been described in HSV-2 vaccine studies that such antibodies can function via other mechanisms like antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-mediated cytolysis [28,40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="182" pm="."><plain>A prerequisite for these effects is the binding to virus-infected cell membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="183" pm="."><plain>Thus, anti-sgG-2 antibodies are qualitatively different from such non-neutralizing antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Given that sgG-2 is secreted and not membrane bound anti-sgG-2 antibodies would need to act by a mechanism separated from antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cytolysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>As sgG-2 binds heparin [25], several chemokines [22], and stimulates axonal growth in the free nerve endings by binding and modulating the nerve growth factor function [24] there are several in vivo biological activities which potentially may be blocked by anti-sgG-2 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>The role of anti-sgG-2 antibodies in protection in the genital mouse model can further be evaluated by passive transfer of immune serum, by vaccination of B-cell knockout mice, and by examination of local tissue specific immune responses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>The complete protection from death for mice i.m. immunized with sgG-2 + adjuvant was associated with no or low amounts of HSV-2 DNA in nervous tissue where a majority of vaccinated mice were negative for HSV-2 DNA in DRG or in the spinal cord (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>The severely impaired capacity of HSV-2 to spread from the primary infection of the vagina in vaccinated mice was also supported by the fact that HSV-2 DNA in serum of almost all animals was undetectable at day six or day 21 post challenge (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>We have now, including results from an earlier report using mgG-2 as antigen [28], evaluated both the sgG-2 and the mgG-2 proteins, coded by US4 gene of HSV-2, as vaccine candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>Although the proteins have not been compared head by head both vaccine candidates induced complete protection from death, low disease scores and similar antibody and CD4+ T cell responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>An interesting study should be to investigate whether a combination of the two vaccine candidates can act synergistically and further reduce viral load in the genital tract and in DRG and the spinal cord. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>A relevant question is whether variability of the US4 gene among clinical isolates from different regions worldwide may influence the effect of a human vaccine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In an earlier report we DNA sequenced the US4, US7 and US8 genes for 47 clinical genital isolates from Tanzania, Norway and Sweden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>Although the genetic variability was higher among African isolates the overall similarity was 99.6% between the two most distant HSV-2 isolates [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Thus, a sgG-2 vaccine based on the HSV-2 strain 333 sequence may have a good chance to induce protection in diverse populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>After the failure of using viral protein gD-2 in the clinical trials, the subunit vaccine strategy has been somewhat discredited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>In this perspective it was both surprising and promising that glycoprotein E of varicella-zoster virus was shown to be highly effective as a therapeutic vaccine preventing reactivation and herpes zoster [42]. </plain></SENT>
