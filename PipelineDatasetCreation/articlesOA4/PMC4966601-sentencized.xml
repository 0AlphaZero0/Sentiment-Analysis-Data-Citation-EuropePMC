</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Families residing in urban areas often face incompatible demands between work and family responsibilities, which can interfere with family communication and gatherings that are essential to the well-being of family members [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a series of intervention studies under the umbrella of the FAMILY Project, including Happy Family Kitchen (HFK I) and Happy Family Kitchen II (HFK II), have been conducted to develop, implement, and evaluate a community-based positive psychology family intervention for improving family communication and family well-being in Hong Kong. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These interventions were developed for families on the basis of positive psychology concepts applied to a cooking and dining setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Based on use of a longitudinal methodology, results from HFK I provided initial support for the intervention program in improving family communication and family well-being [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Data derived from a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in HFK II provided further support with greater improvements in family health and family happiness in the intervention group than in the control group [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Extending our previous work, in the present paper we report findings on the individual-level outcomes of HFK II to examine the effectiveness of a positive psychology family intervention on subjective happiness and mental and physical quality of life. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Research done in the West has consistently provided evidence for the effectiveness of positive psychology interventions in terms of subjective well-being, such as life satisfaction, resilience, hope, and positive affect, and in reducing negative affect and pessimism [6–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the positive effect of positive psychology interventions extends to mental health: depressive symptoms have been alleviated in patients with depression as well as in individuals in the general population [9–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>These interventions have typically involved some form of individual-based exercises to improve individual-level outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The exercises can include imagining the best overall possible future (optimism), recalling positive events for which one is thankful (gratitude), and writing about the happy moments of life (joy) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Family relationships are highly valued in the Chinese collectivist culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In particular, family goals such as maintaining harmonious family relationships are valued over individual desires [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Family contact, quality, and functioning are important for the subjective well-being of the Chinese [15–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>As we have previously reported the salutary effects of positive psychology family interventions on family well-being [5], a major contribution of the present paper is to evaluate the effect on individual-level outcomes, including subjective happiness as a measure of subjective well-being and the mental and physical components of health-related quality of life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, no similar studies have used a large-scale cRCT to examine the effectiveness of a community-based positive psychology family intervention on subjective happiness and mental and physical quality of life. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Although there is an abundance of positive psychology research from the West on subjective well-being and, to a lesser extent, mental health, very few of these studies have specifically examined physical health as an intervention outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>A positive emotion regulation intervention was able to enhance not only subjective well-being and mental health but also physical health, such as reduced headache, stomachache, sleep problems, and cramps [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Another study showed that writing about positive experiences reduced the number of clinic visits for illness [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>A comprehensive review of the literature found that the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance physical health among ill populations through positive cognitions and attitudes, such as optimism and gratitude, was encouraging though not definitive [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Only one relevant study with a Chinese sample showed that a positive psychology stress management training program was effective for improving both psychological and physical symptoms of organizational stress in Hong Kong [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Although there has been minimal study of positive psychology interventions for promoting physical health, related psychosocial interventions have provided evidence for improving physical functioning and the immune system and for alleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses [21–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a meta-analysis of findings derived from 150 experimental, ambulatory, and longitudinal studies demonstrated that subjective well-being has a positive effect on physical health, including short-term outcomes (e.g., immune system response and pain tolerance), long-term outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular functioning and respiratory functioning), and disease and symptom control (e.g., respiratory control and disease progression) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Therefore, physical health might be one of the life domains that can be influenced by interventions aimed at promoting subjective well-being. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the evidence suggests that our intervention might be effective for enhancing the physical quality of life, even though it is psychosocially oriented. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>In the design of the intervention, feasibility, practicality, acceptability, and sustainability were taken into consideration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>Because the intervention was applied to a community setting, cooking and dining were chosen to provide a platform for family-based activities so that the intervention was feasible even for people with busy working lives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>This was the most practical in Hong Kong because it is common for Chinese people to cook and dine with family members [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>To enhance the intervention’s acceptability to busy families, it was brief, with only one core session and one booster session, thus minimizing the burden placed on the service recipients and maximizing the retention rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>For sustainability, the brief nature of the intervention minimized program implementation costs, and the use of community venues, including social service units and schools, ensured that a large scope of community beneficiaries could be covered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>To date, these intervention attributes are uncommon in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>To foster positive communication among families in Hong Kong, five positive psychology themes, namely joy, gratitude, flow, savoring, and listening, were chosen for the intervention framework [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>The “joy” theme was focused on discovering the short-term pleasures and long-term gratifications of positive family interactions [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The intervention involved sharing and reminiscing about happy experiences with family members and creating more enjoyable moments by cooking and dining together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>The “gratitude” theme emphasized the importance of thanking and appreciating family members for their contribution and support [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>The participants were encouraged to appreciate and express gratitude to their family members for contributing to family meals and other household chores. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>The aim of the “flow” theme was to engage family members in engrossing and enjoyable activities that could facilitate interaction, cooperation, and the identification of character strengths [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the participants were encouraged to prepare a family meal together, to stay focused during the activity, and to observe and identify each other’s strengths, such as curiosity, generosity, and teamwork. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>The “savoring” theme emphasized the importance of cherishing the enjoyable moments of family gatherings [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>In particular, slowing down the pace of eating, savoring the food prepared by family members, and treasuring the good times during family meals were encouraged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>The “listening” theme involved understanding and addressing the emotional needs of family members [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>Participants were encouraged to actively listen to their family members when they spoke, to observe their nonverbal expressions, and to show interest in and acceptance of their emotions and concerns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>cRCT was adopted in the present study to examine the effects of a positive psychology family intervention on subjective happiness and mental and physical quality of life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>The rationale for using a cluster design included the community-based nature of the intervention, the reduced risk of experimental contamination, and the efficacy of participant recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) cluster trials checklist shows this in more detail (Additional file 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that, at the individual participant level, participants in the intervention arm would show improvements in subjective happiness and mental and physical quality of life compared with the tea gathering control group (hypothesis 1 [H1]), as measured over time at baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention, and that, after the core session, the booster intervention arm would show more improvements than the no-booster intervention arm in subjective happiness and mental and physical quality of life at 12 weeks postintervention (hypothesis 2 [H2]). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>The HFK II project [5] was implemented in two districts in Hong Kong, namely Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing, from May 2012 to June 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria at the individual participant level were as follows: (1) residents, service users, or students in the Tsuen Wan or Kwai Tsing district; (2) attend the program sessions with one or more family members; (3) at least one family member is aged 18 years or older and the accompanying family member(s) is aged 6 years or older; and (4) able to communicate in Chinese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The inclusion criteria at the cluster level were as follows: (1) social service organizations and schools in the Tsuen Wan or Kwai Tsing district, (2) social service workers and teachers from each participating social service organization and school attend a train-the-trainer workshop and implement subsequent community programs, and (3) participating social service workers and teachers must be able to communicate in Chinese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Participants were recruited from local social service units, primary and secondary schools, and the government’s social welfare department. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>A sample size of at least 1920 participants was required for this study to detect small effect sizes of .20 with a statistical power of .80, an α of .05, and an attrition rate of 50 % [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>In total, 2513 individuals were invited, and 2070 eligible participants from 973 families participated in the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>All potential participants were recruited by the participating service organizations and schools through various means, including (1) phone invitations; (2) promotional materials such as posters, banners, leaflets, and publications; (3) promotion through e-mails and websites; (4) face-to-face invitations; (5) social service workers’ and teachers’ referrals; (6) outreach recruitment on the streets; and (7) home visits. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Social service workers and teachers were given sufficient knowledge and skills in a train-the-trainer workshop, which was delivered by professional academics and psychologists, to design and implement the community programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>The workshop, conducted between May and September 2012, covered the five themes of positive psychology, the program design, and the program evaluation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>A training kit was distributed to each trainee as a practical guide for planning the community programs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>As defined by the HFK II protocol, the cRCT was used to randomly allocate 31 participating service units and schools (the clusters) in the Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing districts into three groups by using computer-generated random numbers (allocation ratio of 1:1:1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>An independent statistician who had no contact with the service units, schools, or participants performed the randomization and allocation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The participants were not informed about the other interventions that were available in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>For group A (intervention arm 1, consisting of 11 clusters), the service units and schools delivered a core session of at least 2 h, followed by a booster session of at least 1 h 4 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>For group B (intervention arm 2, consisting of 10 clusters), the service units and schools also delivered a core session of at least 2 h, followed by a tea gathering session 4 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>For group C (wait list control consisting of ten clusters), the service units and schools delivered a tea gathering session at the beginning and 4 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>The core session involved group activities in one of five positive psychology themes, as described in the Background section above; the booster session was focused on consolidating the knowledge and skills obtained from the core session; and the tea gathering session covered topics unrelated to the intervention, such as arts and crafts workshops [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>The group activities were delivered to an average of 31 families together per group, with the activities focused on the family as a unit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The context of the group activities was determined by the social service workers and teachers to fit the needs of their programs and specific service recipients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>The majority of the group activities were held indoors, such as in social service centers and schools (88.4 %), and the others were held outdoors, such as at campsites and parks (11.6 %). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Questionnaires on individual participant-level outcomes were administered at preintervention (baseline assessment), immediate postintervention (immediately after the core session for groups A and B only), 4 weeks after the baseline assessment (before the booster session in group A, before the tea gathering in group B, and before the second tea gathering in group C), and 12 weeks after the baseline assessment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>However, immediate postintervention assessment was used only to assess the primary outcomes of family communication and family well-being as well as the participants’ evaluations of the core session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Subjective happiness and health-related quality of life reported in this paper were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention to minimize the burden of multiple lengthy questionnaires during the core session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the intervention program was intended to promote longer-term effects at 4 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention rather than immediately after the core session. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="181" pm="."><plain>With the involvement of family members in the intervention program and the emphasis on family communication and family activities, the present study reveals that the positive psychology intervention can also enhance subjective well-being in a collectivistic community. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="184" pm="."><plain>Our positive psychology family intervention was also found to have a selective influence on individual-level outcomes, with improvements in subjective well-being but not health-related quality of life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="185" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the currently available techniques in positive psychology may not be effective for improving health status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with some of the research findings reported in the literature, which provide evidence for the positive effect of positive psychology interventions on mental health [9–12] and physical health [13, 18, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>However, the literature on positive psychology interventions is not consistent regarding their effects on health outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>In a replication study of Seligman and colleagues’ work, it was found that positive psychology exercises, which included writing about three good things in life and using signature strengths in a new way, did not produce greater reductions in depression over time compared with the control group, although a positive result for happiness was found [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a cross-sectional study on character strengths, which were adapted in the theme-based interventions in the present study, revealed that the use of strengths is positively predictive of subjective well-being, but it did not predict the mental or physical components of health-related quality of life [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="190" pm="."><plain>A possible reason may be that health-related quality of life is more stable over time than subjective well-being is, especially among healthy individuals, and is therefore less responsive to positive psychology interventions and positive behaviors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation may be that the target behaviors of these interventions were more relevant to subjective well-being. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>Future studies that modify the positive psychology intervention by tailoring to behavioral changes in physical exercise and healthy diet may improve the physical quality of life as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>In particular, positive psychology concepts can be used to promote healthy behaviors such as discovering the joy of physical exercise or savoring a healthy dish. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>However, it is noteworthy that within-group improvement in mental quality of life was observed in the intervention group at 4 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that the effect sizes were simply too small to be detected in the between-group comparison. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>Increasing the intensity and duration of the intervention may produce more observable increases in mental quality of life over time compared with the control group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the null result of the booster session suggests that even a single core session program would be sufficient for enhancing subjective happiness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Prior research has consistently demonstrated positive responses to positive psychology interventions over a wide range of specific and nonspecific well-being outcomes [51], but their effect sizes could be overestimated, partly because of favorable responses from participants to avoid the embarrassment of having no improvement or to show appreciation for the service providers’ efforts. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>Future intervention research should consider simple and brief tools that can increase cooperation and reduce the burden, and hence improve the acceptability and validity, especially for participants with busy lives or those from low socioeconomic backgrounds [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Second, physical quality of life was assessed using a self-report scale. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Although this assessment approach can be administered in large samples and reduces implementation time and cost, the results might be influenced by response and recall bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>Objective or direct methods may provide a more accurate approach to assessing physical health [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Third, the small effect size of the intervention may have been due to the brief and preventive nature of the intervention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>This type of intervention offered to universal samples has frequently yielded smaller effect sizes than have secondary or tertiary interventions in which there have been typically more room for improvement on the outcomes [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The public health approach suggests that even small effects spread over large portions of the population are valuable [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Fourth, the findings might be influenced by the incomplete assessment of the total sample that consented to take part in the community programs, because of failure to meet the inclusion criteria or refusal to provide data for research purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Although we should have considered rejecting their participation in the community programs, it was not ethical to do so in the contexts of social service units and schools. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Fifth, the reduction in sample size due to the exclusion of younger participants aged 6–11 years could have undermined the statistical power. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, numerous intervention studies have used smaller samples than that in the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Finally, sample size calculation was conducted at an individual-participant level because the data on variance within and between clusters for the calculation of intra-cluster correlation were not available during the planning stage of the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>This could have reduced the statistical power of the study. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Applying a positive psychology framework to a community-based family intervention is rare in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>With the involvement of academic researchers and community practitioners, the findings of this large-scale cRCT provided encouraging, although nondefinitive, evidence to support a brief intervention for improving subjective well-being in the community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>The use of cooking and dining as a platform for family activities is culturally relevant for Chinese as well as other populations that emphasize shared cooking and dining practices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the findings of this study can be generalized to other collectivistic communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Modifications to the intervention by targeting not only subjective well-being but also health-related quality of life are warranted. </plain></SENT>
