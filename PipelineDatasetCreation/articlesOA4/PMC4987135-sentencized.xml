</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) fire at several locations organized as a grid of equilateral triangles (Hafting et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The repetitive nature of the firing fields suggests that grid cells are an important metric element of a neuronal system involved in spatial navigation (Hafting et al., 2005; McNaughton et al., 2006; Burgess et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>To keep track of the animal’s position during locomotion, grid cells appear to rely on self-motion cues (Hafting et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Indeed, computational models suggest that grid cells integrate heading direction and traveled distance (Fuhs, 2006; McNaughton et al., 2006; Burgess et al., 2007; Burak and Fiete, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The directional component likely depends on inputs from head-direction cells found in several subcortical and cortical areas, including the MEC (Taube et al., 1990; Valerio and Taube, 2012; Winter et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Traveled distance, on the other hand, could be estimated from the firing rate of speed cells located in the MEC (Kropff et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>As expected from an internal speedometer, the increase of the firing rate of speed cells as a function of running velocity is preserved across different environments (Kropff et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Without corrections based on external inputs, intrinsic noise in neuronal networks causes an accumulation of error in the internal estimation of position (Burgess et al., 2007; Burak and Fiete, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>A mechanism is therefore needed to prevent the position estimate from rapidly deviating from the actual location of the animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>External landmarks, including the borders of the enclosure, serve this purpose (Knierim et al., 1995; Skaggs et al., 1995; Evans et al., 2015; Hardcastle et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The influence of landmarks on grid cell activity is illustrated by cue control experiments in which the rotation of a single polarizing visual landmark causes an equivalent reorientation of the grid pattern (Hafting et al., 2005), and by the reduced spatial selectivity of grid cells in darkness (Hafting et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Moreover, compression of a familiar rectangular environment along one axis can lead to a contraction of the grid pattern in the same axis (Barry et al., 2007; Stensola et al., 2012) and grid orientation aligns to the environment borders with a small but constant offset (Krupic et al., 2015; Stensola et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Finally, there is also evidence that the color and odor of an enclosure can affect the positioning of the grid fields but not the grid orientation or the firing rate of the neurons (Marozzi et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Thus, visual landmarks within an environment prevent error accumulation in grid cell networks and anchor the grid fields to the environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Whether visual landmarks influence the activity of MEC neurons beyond anchoring the firing fields of grid cells is not known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>On one hand, the role of visual information could be limited to ensuring long-term stability of the MEC spatial representations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, the firing rate of MEC neurons would be context-invariant and remain unchanged by manipulations of visual landmarks (Fyhn et al., 2007; Kropff et al., 2015; Marozzi et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, visual information could have a broader impact on the MEC network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>For example, the firing rate and speed code of MEC neurons could be affected by visual inputs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition, nonmetric contextual information, which is independent from the shape and orientation of an enclosure, could be encoded in the firing activity of MEC neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We set out to test these two alternative views by recording the activity of MEC neurons in mice running in environments where access to visual landmarks was manipulated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>Our study aimed at establishing the contribution of visual landmarks to the firing of spatially selective neurons in the MEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>The principal results indicate that visual information 1) prevents a rapid destabilization of the grid cell firing pattern, 2) changes the speed code of MEC neurons, and 3) modulates the firing rate of neurons of all principal MEC cell types. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>We found that during dark trials the periodic pattern of grid cells rapidly became unstable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>This instability was greater than previously reported (Hafting et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our analysis indicates that instability in the grid pattern was detectable within the first few seconds in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Several factors could contribute to this grid instability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>First, the circular arena had no wall in the current experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This eliminates a potential source of uncontrolled olfactory or tactile cues that the animal can use to anchor its spatial representation in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Second, two polarizing LED panels were used during the recording sessions and repeatedly caused reorientations of the MEC spatial representations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>The spatial relationships between the grid pattern and uncontrolled external cues were therefore not stable over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>This might have reduced the contribution of uncontrolled external cues to the anchoring of MEC spatial representations during dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Third, it has also been suggested that border cells reset cumulative error in the grid cell network when an animal encounters a boundary (Hardcastle et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Thus, the altered spatial representation by border cells in darkness might have contributed to grid cell instability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that in environments deprived of salient landmarks, error in the estimation of position by grid cells accumulates faster than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>A population of MEC neurons encodes the running speed of the animal (Kropff et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>It is thought that this speed code in the MEC remains unchanged across different contexts (Kropff et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Our findings, instead, point to an important contribution of visual cues, and perhaps optic flow, to the speed code, as most speed-modulated neurons had a lower firing rate in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Speed-modulated neurons included high firing rate interneurons but also a significant proportion of grid cells and other spatially selective neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin were more likely to have high speed scores compared to other MEC neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The analysis of functional connections onto these GABAergic neurons indicated that cells pre-synaptic to speed cells decreased their firing rate during dark trials, providing a simple explanation for the reduction in firing rate of GABAergic speed cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>As speed-modulated neurons have been observed in several brain regions (McNaughton et al., 1983; Saleem et al., 2013; Bender et al., 2015; Fuhrmann et al., 2015), it will be important to establish which pathways are required for the speed modulation of MEC neurons and whether these afferent speed signals are also modulated by visual landmarks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>We found that a significant proportion of MEC neurons changed their firing rate when visual landmarks were eliminated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that the level of activity in the MEC network during navigation is not constant but varies depending on the visual cues present in an environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Although cells of all functionally defined cell types responded to light, border cells appear especially sensitive to manipulation of visual inputs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>An important cortical afferent carrying visual information to the MEC originates in the postrhinal cortex (Burwell and Amaral, 1998a, 1998b) and has a depolarizing effect on principal neurons of the MEC (Koganezawa et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that this projection is more active when visual landmarks are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>This could explain why the firing rate of MEC neurons was generally lower in darkness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>We found that approximately half of the recorded grid cells changed their firing rate during 1D navigation depending on nonmetric contextual cues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that the rate code of grid cells in 1D environments is context specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>It has recently been proposed that grid cells in rats trained to perform a conditional discrimination task can encode object information (Keene et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="289" pm="."><plain>Our findings complement this study by showing that changes in firing rate caused by contextual information do not strictly depend on the behavioral demands of the task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Indeed, on the linear track the mice did not have to change their behavior following contextual changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of contextual information in the rate code of grid cells might take place continuously during 1D navigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>The rate change of MEC neurons associated with distinct contexts on the linear track is in agreement with Ca2+ activity changes observed in MEC Reelin+ cells following exploration of different enclosures (Kitamura et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>The results of the current study reveal the functional cell types of the context-specific neurons. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms behind the rate changes of grid cells during 1D navigation or memory tasks are still not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that the location of the grid fields remains stable but that visual inputs onto grid cells alter their in-field firing rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Such rate changes within stable fields have already been observed in hippocampal place cells during 2D navigation (Leutgeb et al., 2005) or during different memory tasks (Lipton et al., 2007; Ferbinteanu et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2012; Ainge et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="297" pm="."><plain>An alternative hypothesis is that the rate changes reflect a shift in the location of the grid firing fields caused by the nonmetric contextual cues (Marozzi et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="298" pm="."><plain>If one considers 1D firing maps on the track as slices through the 2D map of the neurons (Yoon et al., 2016), the 1D maps of grid cells in two contexts on the linear track could be considered as slices with different phases or orientations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="299" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the contextual cues affect the periodicity of the underlying 2D grid lattice (Krupic et al., 2015; Stensola et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="300" pm="."><plain>Both hypotheses remain plausible at this time, but the high correlations between the linear firing rate maps in the two contexts indicate that the change of field location was minimal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="301" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the precise mechanisms, the outcome is that the rate code of grid cells along 1D paths is context dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="302" pm="."><plain>Since navigation in the real world is often confined to preexisting paths, the firing rate of grid cells in these conditions provides information not only about the position of the animal but also about the visual cues encountered along the path. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study presents interesting and important data demonstrating that firing of grid and other spatial cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is dependent on visual landmark information. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study uses elegant experimental designs to reveal striking effects of visual stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are exciting first because grid firing has previously been assumed to be stable in the dark – the experiments provide compelling evidence this is not the case – and second as they will very likely stimulate new directions of investigation into mechanisms responsible for grid firing patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reviewers found much merit with the study but also had a large number of specific concerns that can be addressed with additional analyses and explanation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19" pm="?"><plain>Do the results differ at all if only recording sites within the MEC are kept? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>5) Including grid cells with grid score &gt; 0.5 during l1 and l2 trials will artificially inflate the decrease in grid score during dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The authors should exclude these cells unless they also passed threshold during both baseline periods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>6) The thresholds used to identify grid cells appear to be fairly conservative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Regardless, the authors should perform a shuffling analysis showing the expected null distribution of grid, information, CM, DM, and polarity scores in their dataset to justify their choice of thresholds for all classes. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>11) In the statistical analysis neurons are treated as being independent from one another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>This is unlikely to be justified for neurons recorded from the same animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>When comparing light versus dark a more correct approach would be to use linear mixed effect models with animal identity and session included as random effects. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We have now used the spike distance metric (SDM) developed by Hardcastle and coworkers to estimate the rate of error accumulation in the firing activity of grid cells during dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SDM increases rapidly at the beginning of dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results are now shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We have expanded the section on the firing of grid cells in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An analysis of the firing rate associations between pairs of grid cells (correlation of instantaneous firing rate vectors) during light and dark trials was added. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The firing associations were highly correlated between l1 and d1 trials (r = 0.926). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the firing associations of grid cells are largely conserved despite the loss in spatial stability in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>This result is now part of Figure 2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The analysis of spike-triggered firing rate maps demonstrates that the modulation of firing by traveled distance in grid cells is impaired but above chance levels in darkness over periods shorter than 10 s. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the phase drift during a 10 s time window is sufficient to affect distance coding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We have now added a figure in the manuscript showing that the head-direction preference of head direction cells is strongly reduced during dark trials (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that the grid pattern might still be present but drifts rapidly in phase and orientation in darkness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21" pm="?"><plain>2) How much this result is influenced by the regular alternation of the cue location? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Is it possible that this reduces the stability of the grid network by regularly introducing large error signals? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>This is a very interesting question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The instability in darkness was much larger than that observed in Hafting et al. (2005, Nature) or than that in a previous experiment from our group (Allen et al., 2015, Journal of Neuroscience). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Many factors are possibly involved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>For example, the circular arena in the current experiment had no wall. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>This likely removed a potential source of polarizing cues from the environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In addition, using two light cues located at 90 or 180 degrees to each other can have at least 2 effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>As pointed out by the reviewer, it might generate large error signals when the light is switched back on after a dark trial and this might affect how the animal anchors its internal representation to the external world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A second consequence of having 2 lights is that uncontrolled cues left on the arena by the animal do not have a stable position within the internal representation of the animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these local cues normally contribute to the spatial stability of the grid network in darkness and that using two different lights reduces their contribution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>The laboratory of Tom Wills and Francesca Cacucci presented a poster at the iNav 2016 meeting in Austria in which they reported that grid cells periodicity in mice was disrupted in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Their recording protocol did not involve any cue rotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the reduction of grid periodicity in darkness is not only due to the use of 2 alternating lights. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>3) Different parts of the MEC differ in terms of their anatomical inputs from visual regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Did the influence of visual cues vary with tetrode depth, or grid scale? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>We have tested this by calculating the correlation between grid spacing and the magnitude of the firing rate change between light and dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>The correlation was not significant (n = 132 grid cells, r = 0.073, p = 0.407). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the tetrodes were targeted to the most dorsal part of the MEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>It remains possible that the effect of visual landmarks on the firing of grid cells varies with tetrode depth but that recordings from more ventral regions are required to observe the effect. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>We did not include the correlation analysis in the manuscript because of this potential caveat. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Do the results differ at all if only recording sites within the MEC are kept? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>We have added source data files that contain the histological results of 12 mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>The brain of one mouse trained on the circular arena could not be recovered at the end of the experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>All brain sections containing tetrode tracks are shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>In addition, we added two tables indicating the tetrode locations in each mouse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>As the four tetrodes implanted in each hemisphere were often very close to each other, we prefer not to assign the recorded signals to specific tetrode tips. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Only tetrodes implanted in a hemisphere in which all tetrode tips were in the MEC were labeled as “MEC tetrodes”. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>We now report that the differences in grid score, information score, speed score, borderness (DM), map polarity, head-direction vector length, and firing rate between l1 and d1 trials are still observed when considering only neurons recorded on MEC tetrodes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>5) Including grid cells with grid score &gt; 0.5 during l1 and l2 trials will artificially inflate the decrease in grid score during dark trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>The authors should exclude these cells unless they also passed threshold during both baseline periods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>We agree with the reviewer that using the data from l1 trials artificially inflated the decrease in grid score during d1 trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>This has been corrected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>While developing the original manuscript, we initially used only the two baseline periods to identify grid cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>However, in some recording sessions the coverage of the circular arena was incomplete during the 10-min baseline periods and prevented grid cells from reaching the detection threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>We therefore looked for alternative strategies to classify neurons that displayed clear grid periodicity in their l1 and l2 maps as grid cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59" pm="."><plain>In the revised manuscript, grid cells are defined as neurons with a significant grid score during either the two baseline periods or during one baseline period and l2 trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Because we only use the data from l1 and d1 trials to assess the effect of visual landmarks, our detection procedure should not affect the magnitude of the differences observed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>If the reviewers think that using only both baseline periods would be more appropriate, we could modify the procedure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62" pm="."><plain>This would not affect the conclusions of the manuscript but would significantly reduce the number of neurons classified as grid cells and clear grid cells would be falsely classified as irregular spatially selective cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63" pm="."><plain>6) The thresholds used to identify grid cells appear to be fairly conservative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64" pm="."><plain>Regardless, the authors should perform a shuffling analysis showing the expected null distribution of grid, information, CM, DM, and polarity scores in their dataset to justify their choice of thresholds for all classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>We have performed a shuffling procedure to obtain null distributions for all our spatial measures during the baselines and trials (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The 95th percentiles are used to identify the different cell classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>To be member of a functional cell class, a neuron had to reach the thresholds for the class during either the two baseline periods or during one baseline period and l2 trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68" pm="."><plain>Below are the new definitions of the different cell classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>Grid cell: grid score &gt; 95th percentile </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Border cell: border score &gt; 95th percentile </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Irregular spatially selective cell: information score &gt; 95th percentile (not classified as a grid or border cell) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Head-direction cell: head-direction vector length &gt; 95th percentile, head-direction tuning curve peak &gt; 5 Hz. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Speed cell: speed score &gt; 95th percentile. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="74" pm="."><plain>7) What were the criteria for deciding the tetrodes were in MEC to start recording? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="75" pm="."><plain>The work of Fyhn et al. (2008, Hippocampus) shows that the power of theta oscillations increases significantly when a tetrode reaches the MEC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>In our experiment, the tetrodes were lowered over a few days while the unfiltered electrophysiological signals were monitored on an oscilloscope. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="77" pm="."><plain>Recording started when large theta oscillations were observed on most tetrodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78" pm="."><plain>Typically, the spikes of neurons were also strongly modulated by theta oscillations. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>8) How were the lights controlled during experiments? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>An open-source microcontroller (Arduino Uno) controlled the lights via a 4-channel relay module. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>The identity of l1 and l2 and the order of presentation were determined with the random function of the Arduino software. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>The initialization of the random sequence was different for each session. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>This information was added to the Materials and methods section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>9) How were food rewards delivered during experiments? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>The food rewards (AIN-76A Rodent 378 tablets 5 mg, TestDiet) were delivered with pellet dispensers (CT-ENV-203-5, MedAssociates) located on the roof of the recording enclosure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>Food delivery was triggered by an Arduino Uno with inter-delivery intervals ranging from 20 to 40 s. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>This information is now reported in the Materials and methods section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>10) When identifying putative excitatory connections, were all pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons used, across both hemispheres, or just those on the same tetrode? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>All possible pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons were considered, but putative connections were only detected between neurons recorded on the same tetrode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>Below are the numbers of pairs considered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>Total number of pairs considered: 10880 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>Within tetrode pairs: 3292 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Between tetrode pairs: 7588 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Within hemisphere pairs: 7328 </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Total number of connected pairs: 61 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Within tetrode connected pairs: 61 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Between tetrode connected pairs: 0 </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>11) In the statistical analysis neurons are treated as being independent from one another. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>This is unlikely to be justified for neurons recorded from the same animal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>When comparing light versus dark a more correct approach would be to use linear mixed effect models with animal identity and session included as random effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>The raw data do look pretty convincing but this would help remove any nagging doubts. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>We have considered using linear mixed effect models to account for the dependence of some data points in our experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>For example, we built a model to predict grid scores based on the factors condition (l1 vs d1), animal and session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>The factors animal and session were included as random effects, while condition was treated as a fixed effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>The factor condition was significant (p &lt; 10-16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, the variance in the residuals of l1 and d1 trials was significantly different (Levene's test for homogeneity of variance: df = 1, F = 113.11, p &lt; 10-16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the model did not fulfill the assumption of homoscedasticity which is required for linear models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we would prefer not using linear mixed effect models in the manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>To address the reviewers' concern regarding the dependence of the data points, we confirmed that the main conclusions of the manuscript remained unchanged when using a single data point per mouse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>For example, when using the median grid score per mouse as a statistical unit, we observed a significant difference between l1 and d1 trials (Figure 2C, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, n = 6 mice, p = 0.031). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>There was only one occasion where the p value did not reach significance level (comparison of map polarity in light and dark trials for border cells, p = 0.11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>If the reviewers think that it would be more appropriate to use linear mixed effect models, we will include them upon request. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>As they have much more statistical power than using mice as statistical units, we do not expect changes in the conclusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>On a somewhat related note, it wasn't clear whether data recorded from the same animal in multiple sessions might be from the same neuron(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="?"><plain>Could this be the case? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>How is this avoided? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>It is possible that on some occasions the data from successive days contain the same neuron twice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>We tried to minimize this possibility by lowering our tetrodes by approximately 25-50 μm between recording sessions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis performed using mice as statistical units should ensure these duplicates do not affect the conclusions drawn in the manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="124" pm="?"><plain>12) Do the firing rate changes between light and dark trials differ for putative interneurons compared to principal cells? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>In Figure 6B, cells 1 and 2 have high firing rates suggesting they might be interneurons, but it’s not clear if interneurons are included in Figure 6D. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>All neurons were included in Figure 6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>We have included an example of a high firing rate neuron in the figure and modified the figure legend to make this clear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>The proportion of neurons with significant rate changes between l1 and d1 trials was similar in the two populations (putative interneurons: 0.617, putative principal cells: 0.549). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>This finding is now reported in the Results section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="130" pm="?"><plain>13) Was head direction firing affected by visual landmarks? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The MEC contains many neurons with activity modulated by head direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Head direction was measured, but I could not find effects of visual modulation on head direction firing reported in the main text, although firing rate changes of head direction cells are in a couple of the figures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="133" pm="."><plain>Head direction selectivity of neurons was severely reduced in darkness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="134" pm="."><plain>A new figure (Figure 6) now presents this finding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>14) What fraction of speed cells was modulated by head direction? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>We now report the number of speed-modulated cells in the different functional cell classes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>Grid cells: 67 out of 139 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>Irregular spatially selective cells: 54 out of 226 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>Border cells: 11 out of 63 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="140" pm="."><plain>Head-direction cells: 30 out of 85 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="141" pm="."><plain>30 out of 304 speed-modulated cells were modulated by head direction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="142" pm="."><plain>What information do the cross-correlations reveal about post-synaptic targets of speed cells? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="143" pm="."><plain>Putative excitatory connections detected from the crosscorrelations usually involve a low firing rate pre-synaptic cell and a high firing post-synaptic interneuron. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="144" pm="."><plain>If we take into consideration connected pairs in which the pre-synaptic neuron was a speed cell, the mean firing rate of the post-synaptic neurons was 19.80 Hz (n = 17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="145" pm="."><plain>Out of the 17 post-synaptic neurons to speed-modulated cells, 12 were speed-modulated cells, 13 had a mean firing rate above 10 Hz and 3 were grid cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="146" pm="."><plain>We decided not to include this information in the manuscript because it is based on a relatively small sample (n = 17). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="147" pm="."><plain>Do any post-synaptic neurons show reductions in firing rate as one would expect if speed cells are inhibitory? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="148" pm="."><plain>Inhibition cannot be unequivocally identified from the crosscorrelations because its effect is likely to last several milliseconds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="149" pm="."><plain>This makes it very difficult to disentangle synaptic inhibition from the effect of network oscillations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="150" pm="."><plain>For example, consider the crosscorrelation between two theta-modulated cells, where the preferred theta phase of cell A comes 30 degrees after cell B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="151" pm="."><plain>The crosscorrelation between cell A and cell B will have fewer spikes after time 0, even if there is no synaptic inhibition of cell B by cell A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="152" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we did not attempt to quantify inhibition from the crosscorrelations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="153" pm="."><plain>In the manuscript, several speed-modulated cells are spatially selective neurons with relatively low firing rate (i.e., grid cells and irregular spatially selective cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="154" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in the analysis of putative excitatory connections, some speed-modulated cells were found to be pre-synaptic neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="155" pm="."><plain>This indicates that speed-modulated cells can also be excitatory cells. </plain></SENT>
