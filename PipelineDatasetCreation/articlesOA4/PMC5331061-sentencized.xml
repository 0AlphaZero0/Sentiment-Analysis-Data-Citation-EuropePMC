<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Treatment remains a challenge for pediatric endocrinologists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The daily production rate of cortisol is approximately 8 mg/m2/day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Because of enterohepatic circulation, a hydrocortisone (HC) replacement dose of at least 10–12 mg/m2/day is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, a dose of at least 15 mg/m2/day is mostly needed to reach ACTH suppression in children with CAH. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Recent data support the recommendation that the daily HC dose should not exceed 17 mg/m2 to optimize pubertal growth (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Over the last three decades, a trend toward increased final height (FH) was observed (3), possibly due to a progressive reduction of total daily dose of glucocorticoids used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In CAH, the onset of puberty and pubertal development is expected to be normal if glucocorticoid (and mineralocorticoid) supplementation is maintained at adequate levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Menarche and menstrual cycle are very sensitive parameters, which are surely partly dependent on specific hormonal control of CAH, and also show very wide constitutional variability. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>As partly depicted in Table 2, the average HC doses in our patients were rather in the lower range of HC dose reported in large cohorts in the literature (2, 11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The average HC dose patient 1 received from birth to 2 years, was 20 mg/m2, calculated including the dose of approximately 30 mg/m2 in the first 2 months of life (given in another center), which was promptly reduced to a mean dose of 16.2 mg/m2, given twice a day from the sixth month of life on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>The average HC dose in patient 2 from birth to 2 years was 17.9 mg/m2, also calculated from birth on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>The few specific data for that period of life in the literature show mostly quite more than 20 mg/m2/day (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>The very early growth deceleration during the first years of life observed in both patients was followed by completely normal growth velocity during childhood beyond the first 2 years of life (+0.2 SD in patient 1 and −0.1 SD in patient 2), which further supports the notion of constitutional delay. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Of note, a significant correlation was found between HC dose and growth velocity SD during childhood and adolescence (r2 = 0.27, p = 0.034 in patient 1; r2 = 0.52, p = 0.0023 in patient 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Such correlation may be interpreted differently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Either as a good match between dose adjustment and growth velocity or it may reflect a constant overtreatment, which prevented catch up growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>However, the latter interpretation is not compatible with the good pubertal growth spurt observed in both patients (Table 1) (2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Other important arguments against a glucocorticoid overtreatment are the low-to-normal blood pressure and the normal BMI observed in both siblings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>FC dose could be maintained in our patients at ≤0.1 mg/day, which was surely convenient for blood pressure in the long term (9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>The origin of the slightly altered body proportions in both girls with rather short legs remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>Even though both parents showed normal body proportions, familiarity cannot be excluded since both grandmothers and paternal grandaunts were of rather short stature (150–155 cm). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, body proportions of these relatives could not be investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, in the complete absence of any clinical signs of iatrogenic glucocorticoid excess, HC overtreatment seems an unlikely cause for this observation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, selective sensitivity of long bones to the effect of glucocorticoids in the first years of life cannot be definitely excluded. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>During childhood, both siblings developed recurrent episodes of SW. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The underlying homozygous mutation c.290-13A&gt;G (I2 splice) in the 21-hydroxylase gene was previously described to result either in SW–CAH (78.6%) or in a simple virilizing form (approximately 20%) (13, 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Apparently, our patient seems to belong to the group with the SW form. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Polycystic ovary syndrome is more common in females with CAH (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>In this regard, the chronically anovulatory cycle pattern observed in patient 1 may suggest PCOS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>In fact, no other clinical and laboratory signs for such disease were detected, and adherence to CAH treatment was very good. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Given the mother’s history of anovulatory cycles over years, the cycle abnormalities observed in patient 1 may be rather due to familial factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>In the second sibling, masculinization could be completely prevented by early prenatal dexamethasone treatment of the mother. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the degree of the 21-hydroxylase defect seems to be as severe as in the older sister given the fact that the younger sister developed signs of SW at the sixth day of life and suffered several times from adrenal crises during intercurrent illnesses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>No apparent side effects of the prenatal dexamethasone treatment were present neither in the patient nor in the mother, as was previously reported for other cases of prenatal treatment in the literature (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>In particular, the school performance of both siblings is similar and high. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, two siblings with the same genetic form of SW-21-hydroxylase deficiency and excellent compliance to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation showed different growth and menstrual cycle patterns, suggesting that constitutional elements strongly influence the outcome, in addition to the disease-specific factors and its related treatment. </plain></SENT>
