</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often require multiple therapies to achieve glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and metformin or sulfonylurea (i.e., dual therapy) results in substantial and additive glucose-lowering effects in patients with T2DM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin (Vipidia®) is the latest DPP-4 inhibitor to be licensed in the UK and the fifth agent of its class to be licensed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin is licensed for the treatment of T2DM in combination with other glucose-lowering agents including insulin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of alogliptin as monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with T2DM have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Nauck et al. [2] assessed the efficacy of adding alogliptin to metformin therapy in patients with T2DM and inadequate glycemic control, for 26 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>The addition of alogliptin produced a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c (−0.60%) at the SmPC recommended dose of 25 mg once daily (qd) when compared to placebo (P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Rapid and significant fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reduction from baseline was also perceived as early as week 1 and continued through the length of trial to week 26 for alogliptin 25 mg qd versus placebo [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Pratley et al. [3] evaluated combination therapy of alogliptin added to glyburide (a sulfonylurea, SU) in 500 patients with T2DM inadequate controlled on SU monotherapy and showed significant HbA1c reductions of alogliptin 25 mg (−0.53%) compared with placebo (+0.01%; P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Reductions were seen as early as 4 weeks and continued through the 26-week period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>More patients in the alogliptin 25 mg group achieved HbA1c reductions &gt;0.5% (26.3% with placebo and 50.5% with 25 mg of alogliptin; P &lt; 0.001). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors also exert clinically relevant glucose-lowering effects as oral triple therapy with a good tolerability profile when added to metformin plus SU as shown in randomized clinical trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily (qd) significantly improved glycemic control and β-cell function in patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control with glimepiride plus metformin therapy [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Similarly adding linagliptin 5 mg qd [5], vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily (bid) [6], and saxagliptin 5 mg qd [7] to metformin in combination with SU significantly improved glycemic control in T2DM patients and all were well tolerated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Adding alogliptin 25 mg qd to a metformin–pioglitazone regimen provided superior glycemic control and potentially improved β-cell function versus uptitrating pioglitazone in T2DM patients, with no clinically important differences in safety [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>There has been no study specifically evaluating alogliptin in triple therapy when added to metformin and SU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>The EXAMINE trial was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of alogliptin versus placebo with respect to a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in high-risk patients with T2DM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>A total of 5380 patients were randomized to either alogliptin (N = 2701) or placebo (N = 2679) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>A substantial population in EXAMINE entered on dual therapy with metformin and SU with alogliptin or placebo added to this dual therapy (N = 1398; alogliptin = 693, placebo = 705) and were followed for up to 40 months (median 18 months) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>A post hoc analysis of this subgroup data has been performed [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>For all patients on metformin + SU at baseline, characteristics were similar for the alogliptin and placebo groups (mean HbA1c, 8.14%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>By the end of the study period, the least square (LS) mean difference for change from baseline of HbA1c was −0.52% (P &lt; 0.001) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The alogliptin and placebo groups did not differ in the percentage of patients with at least one adverse event (75.2% alogliptin and 79.6% placebo) or serious adverse events (28.3% alogliptin and 32.1% placebo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the incidence of any report of hypoglycemia (8.8% alogliptin and 6.7% placebo, P = 0.161) or serious hypoglycemia (1.30% alogliptin and 0.43% placebo, P = 0.088) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that triple therapy with alogliptin, metformin, and SU was effective and well tolerated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Head-to-head comparisons between the DPP-4 inhibitors are uncommon, and only one trial comparing the efficacy of saxagliptin 5 mg qd and sitagliptin 100 mg qd added to metformin in T2DM patients (i.e., dual therapy) has been published to date and demonstrated non-inferiority in the primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>The safety profile was similar for the two DPP-4 inhibitors, with modest weight loss and almost no increase in the incidence of reported or documented hypoglycemic episodes [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>There currently exists no comparative trial evidence assessing the relative efficacy and safety of alogliptin as a third-line treatment option added to dual therapy with metformin and SU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>Several network meta-analyses (NMA) have been performed of different classes of drug treatment for T2DM in triple therapy (following failure with metformin + SU) including DPP-4 inhibitors, although none have compared the relative efficacy of each DPP-4 treatment or included alogliptin within the DPP-4 inhibitor class [12–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>This is because of a previous lack of available published triple therapy data for alogliptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>However, the recent availability of new triple therapy subgroup analysis of the alogliptin EXAMINE trial has enabled an NMA of the relative efficacy and safety of alogliptin versus comparator DPP-4 inhibitors added to metformin and SU to be performed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>Hence, the objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and NMA using Bayesian methods of the relative efficacy and safety of alogliptin 25 mg qd added to metformin and SU dual therapy, compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors added to metformin and SU dual therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The analysis has been performed using a clinical decision-focused approach and so covers those individual comparators that are most likely to be displaced by the introduction of a new DPP-4 agent, alogliptin, for use in triple therapy, which are the current alternative DPP-4 inhibitors used in clinical practice in the UK (i.e., linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin), rather than including other classes of anti-T2DM therapies less likely to be displaced by alogliptin in clinical practice such as GLP-1, SGLT-2, or TZD agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>From a methods perspective this approach minimizes noise and heterogeneity in the network by focusing on the comparator evidence of direct relevance to clinical decision-making in a UK context. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>Hence, the SLR covered triple therapy studies for alogliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors (linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin), used in triple therapy (i.e., in combination with metformin and sulfonylurea) in the treatment of patients with T2DM in UK clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>The SLR was conducted in accordance with guidance recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [16] as well as the methodological principles recommended by the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination [17], and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="66" pm="."><plain>The PICOS framework allows for all possible combinations of search terms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67" pm="."><plain>Key inclusion criteria were as follows: RCTs reporting adult patients (≥18 years) with T2DM treated with alogliptin + metformin + SU or a DPP-4 + metformin + SU triple therapy only; RCTs reporting one or more of the following outcomes: mean change from baseline in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, BMI, the occurrence of at least one hypoglycemic event, and treatment discontinuation due to any adverse event; RCTs that contained the SmPC recommended daily dose of alogliptin and the other DPP-4 inhibitors of interest: alogliptin 25 mg qd, saxagliptin and linagliptin 5 mg qd, sitagliptin 100 mg qd, and vildagliptin 50 mg bid; RCTs that include comparisons between the DPP-4 agents of interest and placebo + metformin + SU, or form head-to-head trials versus other DPP-4 agents. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69" pm="."><plain>This time period was sufficiently long to include all studies that reported outcomes at 24 weeks, as well as the alogliptin EXAMINE study which reported efficacy assessment at 6 months (26 weeks) [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>The study selection consisted of two stages: a first-pass screening of titles and abstracts according to the PICOS criteria, followed by a second-pass screening of full-text articles according to the inclusion criteria for consideration in the NMA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>Both stages were conducted by two reviewers with a third reviewer checking the selection of full-text articles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>Any disagreements regarding the inclusion/exclusion of articles were discussed until a consensus was reached. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Full-text articles were obtained, and the reference lists of these studies and systematic reviews were also hand searched to check and identify any further publications likely to be of relevance. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="79" pm="."><plain>The primary efficacy outcome considered was HbA1c change from baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>In addition, body weight change from baseline and change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline were included, along with two safety outcomes: incidence of hypoglycemia, and discontinuations due to adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81" pm="."><plain>According to recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (ADA), World Health Organization (WHO), and American College of Endocrinologists (ACE), HbA1c level is considered the “gold standard” in assessment of metabolic control and the specific level of HbA1c constitutes the target at which treatment of both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus should be aimed [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>All three organizations also underline the importance of normalizing FPG, and the relationship this endpoint has with HbA1c to improve glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83" pm="."><plain>In addition, the relationship between weight loss and glycemic improvement has been seen in several observational studies as well [21–23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>Mean values and associated measures of variability [standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), confidence intervals (CIs), and P values] were extracted for all endpoints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85" pm="."><plain>Where studies did not explicitly report standard errors for continuous endpoints these were imputed according to the recommendations detailed in the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Within the study by Lukashevich et al. [6], an image depicting the adjusted mean change (and s.e.) of HbA1c for the trial treatments and their difference was scanned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>This was then inputted into the software package Engauge Digitizer V6.2 which extracted the standard errors (prudent as the only available information related to effect variability was “P &lt; 0.001” for the difference between treatments). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89" pm="."><plain>A Bayesian NMA combining both indirect and direct evidence synthesis was conducted to enable individual pairwise treatment comparisons between the DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>The Bayesian framework used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods implementing the guidelines laid down in the Evidence Synthesis Technical Support Document Series produced by the NICE Decision Support Unit [25–28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="91" pm="."><plain>For each outcome, the protocol-driven intention was that both fixed and random effects models were to be run with model goodness of fit statistics used to choose between them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92" pm="."><plain>However random effects models require trials that repeat pairwise comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>For the main analysis set only two trials repeated the same comparison (involving sitagliptin versus placebo). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>Hence, there was insufficient data to estimate the between-study contrast variance within the random effects model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>Therefore, fixed effects modelling was used for pairwise comparisons, and random effects modelling was also used for comparisons between alogliptin and the comparator DPP-4 inhibitors grouped as a category. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>In order to retain the advantages of random effects modelling for pairwise comparisons (including alogliptin vs. each comparator DPP-4 inhibitor), a “quasi-random” effects modelling approach was used, based on inputs from the grouped DPP-4 inhibitor comparisons (utilizing five different prior distributions). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>The various implications of the different models attempted on the perceived efficacy of alogliptin versus other DPP-4 inhibitors could then be assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>If there was a qualitative difference in this perceived efficacy between different models, then deviance information criteria (DIC) could be used to judge amongst them. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Lower DIC scores indicate better fit with differences greater than 5 points providing confidence that the difference could not be due to chance [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Total residual deviance was also calculated: a high total residual deviance relative to data points (total number of trial arms) indicates poor fit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Such a measure is an important adjunct to DIC which can only make comparisons between models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>In addition to the Bayesian analyses, fixed and random effect frequentist meta-analysis models were undertaken grouping all DPP-4 inhibitors (including alogliptin) against placebo (both sets in combination with metformin + SU). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>The base case (main analysis set) involved all the studies where data was presented for the full analysis set (FAS)/intention to treat (ITT) set, thereby excluding PP studies and studies where it was unclear which data set was presented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Within the Bayesian NMAs treatment effects were assessed as follows: for continuous variables, analysis was performed on the estimated difference between treatments in mean change from baseline to study end, together with 95% confidence/credible intervals. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The current NICE guidelines (NG28) for the management of T2DM in adults recommend: “triple therapy with metformin, a DPP-4 inhibitor and a sulfonylurea as an option if dual therapy with metformin and another oral drug (including SU) has not continued to control HbA1c to below the person’s individually agreed threshold” [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>There is no comparative data on the efficacy and safety of alogliptin against other DPP-4 inhibitors in triple therapy added to metformin and sulfonylurea, and until recently no data was available to investigate the clinical effectiveness of alogliptin in a triple therapy context having previously received metformin and sulfonylurea alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>However, data has now become available for alogliptin in this patient population from a large subgroup of the EXAMINE study [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The EXAMINE study provides efficacy and safety evidence for alogliptin triple therapy against dual therapy with metformin and sulfonylurea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Using data from the EXAMINE subgroup, the current study reported in this paper presents the methods and results of a decision-focused SLR and NMA to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of alogliptin 25 mg in triple therapy compared with the other DPP-4 inhibitors currently used in UK clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>The NMA of DPP-4 inhibitors within triple therapy (with metformin + SU) has indicated that there is no evidence of a difference for alogliptin compared to other DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and linagliptin) in terms of key efficacy and safety outcomes: HbA1c mean change from baseline, mean change in body weight from baseline, number of patients experiencing hypoglycemic events, and number of patients experiencing adverse events leading to study discontinuation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>This similarity of the efficacy and safety of the DPP-4 inhibitors used in triple therapy has been established by multiple complementary analysis methods including simple frequentist forest plots, Bayesian NMA analysis at the individual DPP-4 treatment level, and Bayesian NMA analysis of alogliptin versus all other DPP-4 inhibitors grouped. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>A range of sensitivity analyses and meta regression covariate adjustment techniques for the primary outcome of HbA1c change from baseline are also all supportive of a finding of comparable efficacy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>A simple non-technical illustration of this is provided in Fig. 2 which shows that shows that the EXAMINE trial [10] falls in the middle when visually comparing the confidence (error) bars for each of the six trials included (all comparisons against placebo), and that the greatest difference in the results involves the same treatment, sitagliptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Therefore, any differences between DPP-4 treatments in terms of HbA1c efficacy appear less than the variability within the same treatment comparison between separate trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>The comparable efficacy of the DPP-4 inhibitors, along with other anti-diabetes treatments (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and the TZDs) in triple therapy have previously been reported, and the NMA performed here has further confirmed the expectation of no significant differences in key outcomes such as change in HbA1c in a clinical trial setting when comparing alogliptin with other DPP-4 inhibitors [12–14, 36–40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>For example, the mean change (%) in HbA1c for the grouped DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo was −0.64 and −0.65 for fixed effects and random effects models, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Previous published meta-analyses of treatments for T2DM in triple therapy (following failure with metformin + SU) have reported similar results for mean change in HbA1c: −0.68; [14] −0.62 [12], and −0.69 [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>The most recent NMA from Lee et al. [15], which is the first study to estimate and compare the effectiveness of all triple therapy combinations that have been studied in randomized trials, not limited to those that included both metformin and SU, in terms of HbA1c and the associated effect on body weight and hypoglycemia, showed the mean change (%) in HbA1c for the grouped DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo was 0.56 which is a clinically relevant reduction [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec16"><title><text><SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>Strengths and Limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>A strength of this study was the use of a decision-focused approach ensuring that the systematic search and the selected studies for the NMA relate directly to the populations of interest and the drug comparators of interest that alogliptin is intended to displace in clinical practice in the UK (i.e., other DPP-4 inhibitors). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>The comparisons presented for alogliptin 25 mg are for each comparator DPP-4 inhibitor at its recommended daily dose to enhance the clinical relevance of the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>The systematic search and subsequent statistical analysis were conducted according to a protocol specified in advance, using transparent, reproducible methods to identify evidence, perform data abstraction, and conduct the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Necessary analytical deviations from the protocol (impossible to conduct specified random effect models at the individual DPP-4 treatment level) were handled in a transparent way: for example, quasi-random effects models were created and used as fully outlined in the methods section and technical appendix. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>The range of analyses performed for each endpoint is another key strength. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>Specifically, not only was alogliptin compared to each individual DPP-4 comparator but these other comparators were individually compared against each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>Visual comparisons from forest plots across all pairwise comparisons were crucial here to provide a context to assess the alogliptin results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Even if all treatments are equivalent, random chance (stochastic uncertainty) will lead to non-identical estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>By showing all pairwise contrasts it is possible to assess whether alogliptin comparisons have a similar or different trend to the rest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>The analyses combining the other DPP-4 inhibitors into one group to compare against alogliptin rests on an assumption of comparable efficacy and safety between the DPP-4inhibitors, which is borne out by the results of the individual comparisons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this grouped analysis was handled in a credible way—imposing various different priors for the between-study standard deviation and assessing if this had any effect at all on the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>The HbA1c non-inferiority probability analysis recognizes the importance of clinically meaningful differences in HbA1c and also demonstrates that there is a very high probability that alogliptin is non-inferior in efficacy to other DPP-4 inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Final assessments concerning non-inferiority on an endpoint were only made after looking across the totality of results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>A further strength of the study was the introduction of “partial pooling” techniques for the purpose of addressing multiple testing concerns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>Having many statistical comparisons performed across a range of sensitivity analysis leads to an expectation of a number of statistically significant results for non-inferior treatments: 1 in every 20 expected for independent tests over non-inferior treatments at standard 0.05 P values (95% confidence/credible intervals). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>Standard techniques to adjust for multiple comparisons, such as Bonferroni, often increase confidence intervals to unrealistic extents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>One method to deal with multiple testing concerns in many instances is actually to make no direct adjustment but simply show all comparisons together and judge visually whether any obvious pattern involving a treatment emerges. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Hence, the one borderline (unadjusted for multiple testing) statistically significant difference involving alogliptin against another DPP-4 inhibitor that arose in one sensitivity analysis (Fig. 6 fixed effect sitagliptin comparison) is not thought to be credible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>A hierarchical “partial pooling” approach to this fixed effect model was implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>This assumed that each individual DPP-4 treatment effect could be different from the rest but they all arose from the same underlying normal distribution (whose mean and variance priors were uninformative). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Such an assumption is plausible for treatments within a class and for which there is no biological reason to expect a particular named treatment to do better than any other before the results are known—the conditions that arose in the NMA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>The implementation adopted was a form of random effects model but importantly it did not allow for between-trial heterogeneity for the same treatment effect and so is equivalent to the fixed effect model in this regard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>Confidence intervals are not increased with this approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>Instead, estimates are pulled towards the common effect—with a greater pull given to the more extreme effects recorded with higher uncertainty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 6, this shifted the estimate to statistical insignificance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>There are inherent limitations with the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the data for alogliptin is from a post hoc subgroup analysis from the EXAMINE trial, an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes study, so patients enrolled were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and acute coronary syndrome, and therefore could be considered “high risk”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>In contrast the cardiovascular status of patients in the comparator DPP-4 inhibitor studies is limited with only one other study [32] reporting data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>As expected, there were fewer patients with hypertension (51.2% vs. 83.6%) compared to patients enrolled in the EXAMINE trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Similarly, baseline renal function was recorded for patients in the EXAMINE trial (GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2), and was comparable compared to the two comparator DPP-4 inhibitor studies (Lukashevich et al. [29.6% vs. 34.8%] [6] and Owens et al. [5] [29.6% vs. 31.6%]) where this was recorded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The study did not have as its primary objective to evaluate the effects of alogliptin on glycemic control [9] and so was not powered to investigate the relative efficacy of MET + SU + alogliptin vs. MET + SU alone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Patients were also permitted to have changes in glycemic therapies according to local standard of care including changes in the metformin, SU, or existing dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Thus background therapy at baseline was intended to be indicative of “real-world” treatment, so doses of metformin and type/dose of SU were neither standardized nor controlled [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>In addition, not all patients who entered on metformin stayed on metformin and SU throughout the study follow-up, although a large proportion did (84.9%) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to the DPP-4 inhibitor comparator studies, whereby all patients were intended to be on the maximum tolerated and stable dose of MET + SU. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Further, whilst all patients in the DPP-4 inhibitor comparator studies were defined as having failed on MET + SU (i.e., baseline HbA1c &gt;7% or 7.5%, depending on study), there was no formal definition of failure in the EXAMINE study and the inclusion criterion was HbA1c &gt;6.5–11% [9] (although the range for patients studied in the post hoc subgroup was 4.9–11%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Overall, the proportion of patients in the EXAMINE subgroup who had HbA1c &gt;7.5% and &gt;7% was 64.9% and 81.3%, respectively; hence a large proportion matched the patient population in the other DPP-4 studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>So whilst the NMA performed can only directly address the question of the relative efficacy of alogliptin added to MET + SU compared to patients receiving MET + SU alone, on the basis of the similarity of patient characteristics for EXAMINE versus other studies it could be considered sufficient to use this data and NMA as representative to address the question of the relative efficacy of alogliptin to MET + SU in patients who have failed on MET + SU (i.e., have inadequate glycemic control). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>This is relevant for HTA in countries such as the UK where this is the specific decision problem faced for new drug therapies in triple therapy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Despite the differences in study design and patient inclusion criteria, the baseline characteristics of patients in the metformin + SU dual therapy subgroup of EXAMINE were comparable with patients in the other studies (e.g., baseline mean HbA1c of 8.15%, and mean duration of diabetes of 8.5 years; see Table S3 in the supplementary material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Hence, it is unlikely that these differences impact on the findings of comparable efficacy and safety between alogliptin and the other DPP-4 inhibitors in triple therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>Baseline HbA1c and duration of T2DM are patient disease characteristics known to potentially impact the efficacy of glucose-lowering treatments [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>In a recent meta-regression analysis by Esposito et al. which aimed to predict the HbA1c response to DPP-4 inhibitors including alogliptin, results showed that a greater absolute reduction of baseline HbA1c is seen in patients with higher baseline HbA1c and lower fasting glucose level [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with previous reports for other non-insulin glucose-lowering agents, including SGLT-2 inhibitors [41, 43], sulfonylureas, metformin, and TZDs [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>As the selected studies in the NMA had similar mean HbA1c at baseline, the result of comparable efficacy in the reduction of HbA1c from baseline between alogliptin and the other DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and vildagliptin) was as expected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>As a result of the limited availability of triple therapy studies of a DPP-4 inhibitor in combination with metformin + SU, studies were restricted to 24-week follow-up only, whereas dual therapy studies of a DPP-4 inhibitor in combination with either metformin or SU, of which there are many more, include studies with a longer follow-up of 52 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations of the data, this post hoc analysis does provide clinical evidence for the triple use of alogliptin in combination with metformin + SU over a reasonable time period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Because the NMA is a decision-focused approach that concentrates on a comparison of alternative DPP-4 inhibitors in triple therapy, the studies selected are more homogeneous than other broader NMAs in triple therapy that have previously been reported [13, 14, 39], and a relatively narrow network will reduce heterogeneity and noise that might be seen with larger networks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>The lack of studies preventing running NMA random effects models at the individual DPP-4 treatment level has to be acknowledged as a limitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="283" pm="."><plain>However, the formulation of the quasi-random effects models as a replacement, together with the strength of results from all the combined analyses, provides reassurance that such omission is not a major concern. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="284" pm="."><plain>Two features are worth pointing out concerning these comparisons:The lower end definition of 0.3% has been set as a clinically meaningful difference. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="285" pm="."><plain>The upper end of 0.4% would actually show alogliptin in a more favorable light (i.e., easier to achieve alogliptin non-inferiority). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="286" pm="."><plain>Hence, in this context the estimates could be considered conservative.Within random effect models as the between-trial study contrast variance estimates increase, then no matter what the true difference is between the treatments, the proportion of non-inferiority will fall (if the true estimate is indeed high). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="287" pm="."><plain>This is a result of higher between-trial variances dominating true differences. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="288" pm="."><plain>The aim of performing a decision-focused NMA was to potentially reduce between-study heterogeneity and uncertainty as well as to narrow credible intervals without any major loss of precision—an approach that is suitable for HTA-based decision-making in the UK, based on feedback received from UK HTA bodies—the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and All Wales Medicines Strategy Group (AWMSG) [45, 46]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="290" pm="."><plain>Triple therapy with a DPP-4 inhibitor in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea is one of the current recommendations from NICE if patients with T2DM have inadequate glycemic control on dual therapy with metformin and an SU [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="291" pm="."><plain>This systematic review and extensive analysis of DPP-4 treatments within T2DM triple therapy settings (combined with metformin + SU) provides evidence of comparability between alogliptin and other DPP-4 inhibitors in terms of key efficacy and safety outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="292" pm="."><plain>In addition, this study has used a number of techniques that may well be considered novel to traditional NMA methods—quasi-random effects models (when random effects models cannot be run) and “partial pooling methods” (seeking to address multiple testing issues) have been implemented in this study that could be of use in future NMA research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="293" pm="."><plain>Local health service decision-makers will need to consider the available evidence on efficacy and safety, as well as cost and individual patient factors, when developing guidance and making formulary decisions about the use of alogliptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="294" pm="."><plain>Alogliptin has the lowest acquisition cost of all the DPP-4 inhibitors used in UK clinical practice [47]; hence, it could be considered to have relative cost-effectiveness based on the finding of comparable efficacy and safety from this NMA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="295" pm="."><plain>The current NMA should help local decision-makers have a clearer understanding of the drug’s place in therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="296" pm="."><plain>Further RCT evidence from additional clinical studies investigating alogliptin added to metformin plus a sulfonylurea and further active comparator studies comparing alogliptin with other DPP-4 inhibitors would be useful to further strengthen the evidence base for alogliptin in triple therapy. </plain></SENT>
