<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To discover genes that become epigenetically deregulated during neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, we took the novel approach of comparing neuroblastomas to neural crest precursor cells, using genome‐wide DNA methylation analysis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrating on hypermethylated genes to identify candidate tumor suppressor loci, we found the cell engulfment and adhesion factor gene MEGF10 to be epigenetically repressed by DNA hypermethylation or by H3K27/K9 methylation in neuroblastoma cell lines. MEGF10 showed significantly down‐regulated expression in neuroblastoma tumor samples; furthermore patients with the lowest‐expressing tumors had reduced relapse‐free survival. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Neuroblastoma, one of the commonest solid tumors of childhood, is an embryonal malignancy that arises via defective differentiation of neural crest cells that give rise to the sympathetic nervous system 1, 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Neuroblastoma patients have a poor outcome compared to many other childhood cancer sufferers 2, mostly attributable to older children who present with metastatic disease 2, 3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Compared to other cancers, neuroblastomas demonstrate relatively few mutations 4, 5, 6, although copy‐number changes are common, for example, loss of chromosomes 1p and 11q and gain of 17q 2, 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Oncogene activation occurs by MYCN amplification in high‐risk neuroblastomas 7 and by ALK mutation in familial neuroblastoma and in about 10% of sporadic cases 8, 9, 10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Tumor suppressor genes found infrequently mutated in neuroblastoma include PHOX2B and NF1 11, 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Genomic sequencing of neuroblastomas has identified additional mutated genes such as the chromatin remodeling genes ATRX, ARID1A, and ARID1B, components of the RAC‐RHO pathway 4, 5, 6 and rearrangements activating the TERT gene 13, 14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Relapsed neuroblastomas demonstrate increased numbers of mutations during disease progression 15, 16. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The lack of identified driver genetic mutations in many cases of neuroblastoma 1 underlines the need to evaluate alternative mechanisms of pathogenesis, including epigenetic aberrations such as DNA methylation 17, which constitute some of the earliest changes in carcinogenesis 18. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic deregulation has been shown to play an important role in neuroblastoma pathogenesis, silencing neuroblastoma suppressor genes by aberrant promoter DNA hypermethylation, for example, RASSF1A, CASP8, and DCR2 19, 20, 21, 22, or by aberrant histone methylation, for example, CASZ1, CLU, RUNX3, NGFR 23, and p14ARF 24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>DNA hypermethylation of both individual genes and multiple CpG islands has been associated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma 20, 21, 25, 26, 27. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Despite previous gene‐specific analyses of DNA methylation (as discussed above) and more recent genome‐wide analyses 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, it remains unclear which epigenetic alterations are critical for neuroblastoma pathogenesis and what functional roles are played by the affected genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>To address this question, we have taken a novel epigenomic approach, using genome‐wide DNA methylation analysis to compare neuroblastoma cells to their putative normal precursors, human neural crest cells (hNCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>We have identified a series of genes that are differentially methylated in neuroblastoma cells compared to normal human neural crest cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>One of these genes is MEGF10, for which we demonstrate growth‐repressive properties predicted for a tumor suppressor gene. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="186" pm="."><plain>This epigenomic study detected neuroblastoma‐specific DNA methylation changes by taking the novel approach of comparing malignant neuroblastoma cell lines with cultured normal neural crest cells (hNCC), their putative precursors 1, 2 (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="187" pm="."><plain>Many neuroblastomas are thought to develop from the sympathoadrenal lineage, which contributes to the sympathetic ganglia and medullary region of the adrenal gland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="188" pm="."><plain>However, neuroblastomas can occur at any position along the sympathetic axis, suggesting that they can also develop from earlier neural crest derivatives 51. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="189" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have used neural crest cells in our experiments, as these probably represent the earliest available common precursor for all neuroblastomas. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="191" pm="."><plain>The methylation levels of all probes from the array (Figure 1A), together with the annotated genes identified as methylated (Figure 1B and C), clearly showed that neural crest cells and neuroblastoma cells were related, reflecting their common developmental origins 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="192" pm="."><plain>However, there were a large number of neuroblastoma‐specific methylated genes (Figure 1B), demonstrating that deregulated epigenetic modifications play an important role in neuroblastoma pathogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="193" pm="."><plain>Of the differentially methylated genes, 72% underwent hypomethylation and 28% showed increased methylation levels compared to hNCC (Table S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="194" pm="."><plain>In MYCN amplified BE(2)‐C and IMR32 cells, the transcriptional activation power of MYCN, together with induced chromatin changes leading to higher gene activation levels 52, 53, could explain the increased hypomethylation, although another mechanism must be involved in the MYCN non‐amplified cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="195" pm="."><plain>Two recent genome‐wide DNA methylation studies also reported a preponderance of DNA hypomethylation in neuroblastoma 32, 33, suggesting that epigenetic gene activation may be more common than repression in neuroblastoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="196" pm="."><plain>In this article, we concentrated on hypermethylated genes, in order to identify epigenetically repressed tumor suppressors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="mc22591-sec-0021"><title><text><SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>Characterization of the Hypermethylated Genes in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>Our methylation results are not directly comparable with other studies, because we have made the novel comparison of cultured neural crest cells with neuroblastoma cell lines, whereas most other studies have made comparisons between different neuroblastoma subtypes (e.g., low‐ vs. high‐risk). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>However, some of the hypermethylated genes that we have identified have also been reported in other genome‐wide studies of DNA methylation in neuroblastoma; specifically ADRA1A 33, CHAT 33, FAS 31, HOXD3 29, 32, 33, RAB38 33, RNF220 33, SLC17A6 33, and TBX4 33, 54. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>In addition, others have found hypermethylation at the HOXA cluster 28 and at the PCDH clusters 31, 32, 33, 34, 55, where we found HOXA11 and PCDHA9 hypermethylated (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>The shared hypermethylated genes in the four neuroblastoma cell lines were enriched in high‐CpG promoters and PRC‐marked genes (Figure 1D), as expected from previous reports 42, 43, 44, 45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>This suggests that many of the hypermethylated genes are normally unmethylated but PRC‐marked in stem cells and undergo “instructive” methylation 56 to irreversibly repress genes that drive differentiation during development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>Gene ontology analysis showed that the hypermethylated hits that we detected were enriched in genes involved in developmental processes (Table S7), which are presumably targets that need to be silenced in neuroblastoma in order to facilitate the developmental arrest that is thought to be the primary cause of childhood cancers 57. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>We carried out the genome‐wide DNA methylation analysis using neuroblastoma cell lines, which we compared to cultured neural crest cells, so that we compared cultured cells in all cases, rather than cultured cells versus primary tissue, to reduce differences in DNA methylation caused solely by cell culture 58. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used publicly available expression data from primary tumors and associated patient survival data to filter the DNA hypermethylated genes, in order to identify candidate genes for further study that had in vivo relevance. MEGF10 satisfied all our expression and survival criteria (Figure 1D), making it the obvious candidate for detailed analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="mc22591-sec-0022"><title><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic Deregulation of MEGF10 in Neuroblastoma </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>All neuroblastoma cell lines, except the S‐type GIMEN and BCH‐N‐DW, had some degree of DNA hypermethylation of MEGF10 and very low or absent expression (Figure 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between MEGF10 DNA methylation and expression (Figure 3C) and MEGF10 could be reactivated by treating hypermethylated cells with the DNA demethylating agent aza‐deoxycytidine (Figures 3D and 4A), suggesting that DNA methylation plays a mechanistic role in the control of MEGF10 expression in the majority of neuroblastoma cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>In the SHIN cell line, where MEGF10 expression was repressed but there was little DNA methylation (Figure 3C), we demonstrated that MEGF10 was transcriptionally silenced by repressive histone modifications (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="210" pm="."><plain>MEGF10 expression was consistently down‐regulated in neuroblastoma tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, as shown by our own results and by those in publicly available datasets (Figure 2A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="211" pm="."><plain>Thus our genome‐wide epigenetic analysis, based on studying cultured cells, has correctly identified MEGF10 as a repressed gene with direct relevance to neuroblastoma in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>Genome‐wide mutation analyses of neuroblastomas have not identified genetic abnormalities in MEGF10 4, 5, 6 and there was only infrequent (4/46; 7%) hypermethylation of MEGF10 in tumor tissue (Figure 3A and E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>It therefore seems likely that MEGF10 expression is silenced in most neuroblastomas by epigenetic mechanisms other than DNA methylation, such as repressive histone modifications H3K27me3 and/or H3K9me2, as we have shown in the SHIN cell line (Figure 4), and as has been reported for other neuroblastoma tumor suppressor genes 23, 24, 55. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, analysis of publicly available DNA methylation data (GSE39626; 32) gave similar results to those reported in this paper, with 2/25 (9%) of neuroblastomas having MEGF10 DNA hypermethylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>Both of those MEGF10‐hypermethylated tumors were high‐risk 32 and in our data all the hypermethylated tumors were stages 3 or 4, and showed decreased overall survival (Figure 3F), suggesting that MEGF10 DNA hypermethylation occurs predominantly in an aggressive subset of neuroblastomas. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>Most neuroblastoma cell lines are derived from high‐risk tumors 59 and we found the majority of cell lines to be DNA hypermethylated at MEGF10 (Fgure 3A–C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It therefore possible that many neuroblastoma cell lines derive from a subpopulation of cells within high‐risk tumors that is hypermethylated at MEGF10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, DNA hypermethylation of MEGF10 in neuroblastoma cell lines may represent a long‐term stable epigenetic mark that serves to “lock” the silenced state in a gene that is normally repressed in neuroblastoma tumors by histone modifications 60. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>MEGF10 encodes a transmembrane protein with multiple epidermal growth factor‐like domains and was initially thought to be mainly involved in the engulfment of apoptotic cells 61, 62. MEGF10 is strongly expressed in the neural tube during early development, then in the spinal cord, CNS and developing muscle, with inherited mutations causing infantile mypoathies 63. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>MEGF10 also mediates cell–cell adhesion 64 and regulates retinal neuron patterning via homophilic interactions 65, showing that the gene plays a role in cellular interactions as well as in apoptotic engulfment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Our siRNA knock‐down experiments (Figures 2F and S7) demonstrated that reduced expression of MEGF10 led to increased proliferation, suggesting that MEGF10 plays a growth regulatory role in neuroblastoma, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Publicly available clinical data showed an association between reduced MEGF10 expression and decreased relapse‐free survival in neuroblastoma (Figure 2C), implying that the in vitro growth regulatory effects may reflect clinically relevant biological behavior. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>This effect was most pronounced in MYCN non‐amplified tumors (Figure 2C), suggesting that in the context of MYCN amplification, reduced MEGF10 expression does not have a significant effect on neuroblastoma survival, presumably because the multiple biological pathways related to neuroblastoma aggressiveness that are targeted by MYCN predominate 66. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, altered expression of MEGF10 has now been reported in several cancers 67, 68, 69, with prognostic significance in ovarian cancer 68 and glioblastoma 69. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>MEGF10 is tyrosine phosphorylated and its phosphorylation can be modulated by FGF 70, suggesting a role in cellular signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Functionally, MEGF10 is implicated in Schwann cell plasticity 71 and importantly, in the stemness of neuroblastoma cells 72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Our epigenetic studies have shown that MEGF10 expression is frequently down‐regulated in neuroblastomas and that it modulates neuroblastoma growth properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that MEGF10 plays an important role in neuroblastoma biology and investigation of the mechanisms regulating MEGF10 and its involvement in cellular signaling pathways may identify new therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma, as well as prognostic markers. </plain></SENT>
