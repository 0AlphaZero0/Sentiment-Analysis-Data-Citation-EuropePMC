</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There will be an estimated 224,390 new cases of lung cancer, and an estimated 158,080 lung cancer deaths in 2016. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite many advances in treatment, the 5-year overall survival for advanced lung cancer is still dismal [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Immunotherapy has redefined standard-of-care treatment in the second line, and more recently in the first-line settings, but long-term survival data is still too immature to determine its overall impact in the prognosis of lung cancer [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>For many years, lung cancer had been thought not immunogenic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>However, elevated levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), B7-H3, and B7-H4 on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been shown in NSCLC [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the immune system plays a much larger role in the control of lung cancer than previously thought. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The adaptive immune system prevents and controls tumor growth in part through T cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Cancer cells release tumor antigen which is recognized as foreign by antigen presenting cells (APCs) or dendritic cells (DCs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Once APCs verify the tumor antigen as foreign via their interaction with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the APCs signal for the proliferation of various T cell subtypes that also recognize the tumor antigen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Many of these lymphocytes become CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that infiltrate the tumor as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), but some become regulatory or suppressor T cells (Tregs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The normal function of Tregs is to induce several signaling checkpoints that hamper this process of T cell activation in order to prevent a toxic, autoimmune, positive feedback loop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, the tumor microenvironment takes advantage of these checkpoint signals in an effort to prevent an anti-tumor T cell response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Examples of these inhibitory signals that have FDA-approved agents targeting them include the CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Antibodies targeting CTLA-4 were initially approved for checkpoint blockade in melanoma but were unfortunately ineffective in NSCLC [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Preclinical studies demonstrated that PD-L1 expression correlates with TILs and immunogenicity in NSCLC, which suggested that NSCLC may respond to anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 therapy [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, early safety data studies demonstrated promising efficacy of PD-1 inhibition in NSCLC [6], and antibodies targeting PD-1 have shown remarkable activity in lung cancer as well as melanoma [7] (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Multiple receptor-ligand interactions determine T cell response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Binding of the TCR to the APC MHC II receptor presenting antigen leads to antigen specific T cell proliferation and activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Conversely, LAG-3 binding to the APC MHC can interfere with this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, PD-1 on T cells binding to PD-L1 on APCs, tumor cells, or Tregs can also dampen this response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Nivolumab and pembrolizumab inhibit PD-1, while atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab inhibit PD-L1 leading to T cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>B7-1 or B7-2 binding to CD28 also leads to T cell activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>However, if CTLA-4 binds to B7-1 or B7-2 instead, this response is halted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Ipilimumab and tremelimumab inhibit CTLA-4 allowing for T cell activation </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Checkpoint inhibitors, specifically PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapy, have been approved in the treatment of certain subgroups of patients with advanced NSCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Landmark trials have shown greater overall survival and higher responses to checkpoint inhibition in NSCLC compared to standard-of-care first line and second line chemotherapy along with greater durability of response in a subset of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>However, still many patients do not respond to these agents. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of lung cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown improved efficacy and longer duration of response compared to standard-of-care chemotherapy (docetaxel). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>Treatment with nivolumab provided benefit in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 status while the efficacy of nivolumab is more pronounced in the PD-L1 positive, nonsquamous population compared to the PD-L1 negative, nonsquamous population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Pembrolizumab shows benefit in conjunction with its companion diagnostic for PD-L1 positive patients regardless of histology [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Atezolizumab is a PD-L1 inhibitor but has shown similar efficacy as its predecessors and benefit over standard-of-care chemotherapy in the pretreated setting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Given the promising findings in the pretreated setting, checkpoint blockade therapy is being evaluated in the first-line setting also. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>The phase III study of nivolumab did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS while the study of pembrolizumab did. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>This is possibly because of the more stringent PD-L1 expression cutoff in the pembrolizumab trial (50%) compared to the nivolumab trial (5%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>This has led to the FDA approval of pembrolizumab in the first-line setting for tumors with &gt;50% PD-L1 positivity and established a new standard of care. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Anti-PD-L1 agents are also being tested as monotherapy as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>While ipilimumab alone has not shown significant benefit, combination with nivolumab is still undergoing evaluation in the treatment-naïve setting but is promising based on the preliminary data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy with pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and chemotherapy is still early, and finding the best histology and PD-L1 expression population will be beneficial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these agents are now being examined in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings where they may lead to a significant increase in lung cancer survival. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>The benefit of checkpoint inhibition does not appear to be limited to NSCLC as promising results have been observed in extensive stage SCLC with nivolumab monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Additional studies with anti PD-1/PD-L1 will define the true potential of these agents in SCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Trials for checkpoint blockade in malignant mesothelioma are ongoing but include therapies such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab, avelumab, and durvalumab mostly in the pretreated setting. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>Newer combinations are also being evaluated such as pembrolizumab plus ipilimumab in the pretreated NSCLC population or durvalumab plus tremelimumab in the treatment-naïve population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>IDO inhibition with indoximod will be evaluated in various treatment settings alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>Pembrolizumab will be evaluation in the stage III setting with chemoradiation along with azacitadine, a PIK3-gamma inhibitor and an HDAC inhibitor in the pretreated, advanced population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>Nivolumab will be evaluated in combination with a whole-cell vaccine, and durvalumab will be evaluated in combination with a phosphatidylserine inhibitor in the pretreated, advanced population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The future for these agents as monotherapy and in combination with novel agents appears bright in lung cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="?"><plain>However, there are many unanswered questions in regard to the proper use of the agents including the duration of use for these agents [59], which biomarker(s) will be predictive for response or toxicity, what leads to acquired resistance to these agent,s and which combinations will be the most effective in overcoming and preventing resistance? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="280" pm="."><plain>Over the next several years, it is likely that significant progress will be made in addressing many of these questions. </plain></SENT>
