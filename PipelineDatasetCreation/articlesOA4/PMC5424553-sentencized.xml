</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The anaerobic protozoa Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia collectively infect over one billion people each year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Both are pathogens of the intestinal tract of humans; the first causes were dysentery, liver abscess, and invade other organs; the second causes were intestinal malabsorption, bloating, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and severe diarrhea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>These enteric parasitic infections are a health problem in the world, particularly in developing countries where there are poor sanitary conditions.[1234] In Mexico, amoebiasis is an endemic disease, with incidence rates that vary among the geographic regions of the country. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>In the last 7 years, it has been a serious health problem, and it was the 10th cause of morbidity among all age groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>In the case of giardiasis, it currently accounts for an estimated nine millions of sick each year, and it is the leading cause of intestinal parasitosis of medical importance in children.[5678] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Treatments with antiprotozoal drugs as metronidazole, tinidazole, iodoquinol, diloxanide furoate, and paromomycin fail at a rate of ~20%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In the case of metronidazole, it is the drug of choice currently used in Mexico for the treatment of infections caused by G. lamblia and E. histolytica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>It is effective; however, it is mutagenic in bacteria and carcinogenic in rodents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>In addition, this drug has several other side effects including gastrointestinal disturbance, especially nausea and vomiting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, infrequent adverse effects include headache and stomatitis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In long-term systemic treatment, patients experience dry mouth, metallic taste, headache, and vertigo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is associated with the development of leukopenia, neutropenia, and central nervous system toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>In addition, clinical and laboratory-generated resistant strains of both protozoa have been reported.[491011] Clearly, there are needs for alternative antiamoebic and antigiardial agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In this sense, many plants species are used in Mexican traditional medicine for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery; these plants should be analyzed to determine their efficacy and thus their potential as sources of new antiprotozoal drugs. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Don (Malvaceae) is an erect perennial plant of 0.5–2 m of height, densely stellate-pubescent throughout with grayish or slightly yellowish hairs; the gray-green leaf blades are lanceolate to lance-oblong, cuneate at base, margin usually finely and regularly crenate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The leafy inflorescence bears have several flowers each one with five wedge-shaped mauve or lavender petals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>It is widely distributed in the USA and Mexico; it grows in desert and plateau habitat. S. angustifolia is commonly known as “Copper Globemallow” in the USA, while in Mexico, it is locally called “Hierba del negro and Vara de San José.” In Mexican traditional medicine, the leaves from S. angustifolia are used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatism, inflamed skin, and arthritis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>In addition, they are used for the treatment of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dysentery.[1213] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Previous pharmacological investigations reported the utility for the treatment in hand osteoarthritis and anti-inflammatory properties of this plant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Scopoletin, tomentin, and sphaeralcic acid were thought to be responsible for anti-inflammatory properties of S. angustifolia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In addition, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, α- and β-amyrins, and transcinnamic acid have been isolated of this plant.[1415161718] On the other hand, intraperitoneal administration of the dichloromethane extract in rodents did not indicate severe systematic toxicity, adverse effects, hematological or biochemical alterations.[16] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Despite the traditional medicinal use of S. angustifolia, no data are available with respect to its usefulness in gastrointestinal disorders caused by protozoa such as diarrhea and dysentery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of the ethanol extract, fractions, and pure compounds obtained from the aerial parts of S. angustifolia using in vitro antiprotozoal activity and computational experiments, so as to assess some of the possible mechanisms involved in the traditional use. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Tiliroside 2 is a flavonoid isolated from several medicinal plants with important in vivo and in vitro antiprotozoal activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>In this sense, it has been speculated that antidiarrheic properties of medicinal plants are a consequence of their inhibitory actions on protozoa.[2930] In addition, tiliroside which was obtained in a large amount may be a prodrug of kaempferol considering that flavonoid glycosides are hydrolyzed by intestinal bacteria, cell-free extract from the small intestine, or gastrointestinal fluid.[31323334] In this context, kaempferol is a flavonoid with significant in vitro and in vivo antiprotozoal activity; then, it may contribute to the observed antiprotozoal activity of the aerial parts of S. angustifolia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>The antiprotozoal activity of tiliroside is in agreement with the results published by the author's group and confirms that it flavonoid glycoside may be a leading compound in the development of novel antiamoebic and antigiardial drugs.[2930] </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>In relation with the molecular docking experiments, they are based on the fact that genome studies have recently contributed to the discovery of a new array of virulence determinants in pathogenic protozoa as E. histolytica, as well as identification of novel drug candidates.[242535] However, no data are available that explain its potential binding mode at molecular level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>In this regard, in silico approaches has been applied to search the possible interaction between the potential targets and molecules obtained from natural products as flavonoids yielding new pharmacological horizons.[363738] In the present study, results obtained from in vitro and in silico experiments yield important findings of the possible inhibition activity of tiliroside over two enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway of anaerobic protozoa. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In specific, tiliroside [Figure 1] docked over PFOR, it showed interactions with 14 amino acids residues (Ala 117 [at 2.99 Å], Ala 118 [at 2.16 Å], Leu 121 [at 3.10 Å], Phe 665 [at 2.74 Å], Leu 667 [at 3.55 Å], Gly 845 [at 2.10 Å], Ala 845 [at 4.10 Å], Met 851 [at 4.17 Å], Pro 852 [at 2.89 Å], Tyr 853 [at 3.94 Å], Trp 864 [at 3.28 Å], Gly 865 [at 3.29 Å], Asn 866 [at 3.91 Å], and Tyr 875 [at 3.90 Å]) in a region different that metronidazole; the interactions were established downstream of the iron-sulfur cluster forming mainly H-bond interactions according to its chemical nature [Figure 2, lower right panel]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>In the case of interaction of tiliroside over G/FBPA, it showed a similar behavior in which tiliroside interacted with ten amino acids residues (Pro 2 [at 3.10 Å], Leu 3 [at 2.54 Å], Lys 63 [at 4.27 Å], Cys 66 [at 3.15 Å], Glu 67 [at 3.43 Å], Leu 70 [at 3.86 Å], Glu 71 [at 1.83 Å], Ile 80 [at 4.55 Å], and Leu 97 [at 4.25 Å]) in a place different [Figure 3, upper right panel] that the inhibitor metronidazole [Figure 3, lower right panel]; its interactions were with seven amino acids residues (His 178 [at 2.92 Å], Gly 211 [at 2.91 Å], Ser 213 [at 2.06 Å], Asn 253 [at 3.22 Å], Val 254 [at 5.37 Å], Asp 255 [at 3.25 Å], and Ser 256 [at 4.36 Å]), and Zn 2+ (at 2.23 Å) atom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that tiliroside exhibited high affinities on both glycolytic enzymes with lowest free binding energy from −9.92 kcal/mol for PFOR and from −7.17 for G/FBPA kcal/mol like to metronidazole (−5.09 and −10.04 kcal/mol, respectively). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="135" pm="."><plain>Results of the present work along with the in vivo and in vitro antiprotozoal properties previously describes to tiliroside[2930] could suggest that part of the mechanism by which S. angustifolia inhibits diarrhea and dysentery involves antigiardial and antiamoebic effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="136" pm="."><plain>In this context, the antidiarrheic properties reputed for S. angustifolia in Mexican traditional medicine may be due to the presence of flavonoids: tiliroside and apigenin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="137" pm="."><plain>In addition, in agreement with docking analysis, the antiprotozoal activity of tiliroside on anaerobic protozoa as E. histolytica and G. lamblia may be through of inhibition of glycolytic enzymes PFOR and G/FBPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="138" pm="."><plain>In addition, although tiliroside was less active than metronidazole, it may be of interest to medicinal chemists who are interested in developing new antiprotozoal agents, considering that tiliroside interacted in a region different that metronidazole in the enzymes PFOR and G/FBPA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="139" pm="."><plain>To confirm the results obtained in computational experiments on the interaction between tiliroside and glycolytic enzymes, proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis is in process.[41] </plain></SENT>
