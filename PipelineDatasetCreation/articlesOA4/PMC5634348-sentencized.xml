</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Neonatal cerebral hypoxia‐ischemia (H‐I) is an often devastating condition constituting a significant cause of newborn death, and chronic neurological and neurodevelopmental disability in children.1 Despite its relatively high incidence among newborns with cerebral injury, limited therapies are available for its prevention and treatment.2, 3 Furthermore, unlike the aging adult brain, neuronal death in the immature CNS is not only a pathological cellular event of brain injury but also a biological process required for early normal brain development.4 Therefore, understanding the cellular mechanisms that actively modulate neuronal survival in the neonatal brain may help better understand the cellular pathways that regulate the cell fate of developing neurons as well as provide potential new approaches for the treatment of H‐I in newborns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The mammalian family of NAD+ metabolizing enzymes, nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs), may play an important role in the regulation of neuronal survival during brain development, and their neuroprotective actions could offer new targets against the effects of neonatal H‐I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>NMNATs are potent inhibitors of axonal degeneration in the peripheral nervous system, they consist of three structurally distinct isoforms differentially expressed in all tissues, including brain, and each localized to different cellular compartments.5, 6, 7, 8 Although the neuroprotective actions of NMNATs in the mammalian brain remain largely unexplored, recent evidence suggests that NMNATs are also strongly protective against axonal and neuronal CNS degeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>For example, increases in the expression of NMNAT1 and NMNAT3 decrease mouse retinal ganglion cell degeneration following ischemia,9, 10 and overexpression of cytoplasmic NMNAT1 protects the term‐equivalent neonatal mouse brain against the degenerative effects of cerebral H‐I via inhibition of glutamate‐dependent excitotoxic cell injury.11 In contrast, depletion of NMNAT2, the NMNAT isoform most abundant in the brain, restricts the outgrowth of retinal and cortical fibers in vitro.12 Interestingly, mutations in NMNAT1 have been recently identified as a cause of Leber congenital amaurosis, a degenerative disease of the young human retina,13 and genome‐wide and linkage analysis have demonstrated an association between NMNAT3 and late‐onset Alzheimer's disease.14 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The above observations suggest that all three NMNAT isoforms are likely important for the survival of both, peripheral axons and CNS neurons and their processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the neuroprotective role of each of these proteins following neonatal H‐I remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used NMNAT3‐overexpressing mice and AAV8 vectors to manipulate NMNAT3 endogenous and exogenous expression in order to examine whether NMNAT3 protects the immature brain from the degenerative effects of neonatal cerebral injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>We find that alterations in the expression of neuronal NMNAT3 in vivo and in vitro significantly modify the survival of healthy and injured immature neurons possibly via inhibition of glutamate‐dependent excitotoxic degeneration involving the calpastatin/caspase/calpain‐mediated death pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NMNAT3 is important for the survival of developing healthy and injured neurons following neonatal H‐I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Investigating the neuroprotective actions of NMNAT3 in the ischemic immature brain may offer new putative cellular targets for the prevention and treatment of perinatal brain injury, and may also provide new insights into the cellular mechanisms that modulate cell death in the healthy and injured developing brain. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>In this study, we asked whether NMNAT3 protects the immature mouse brain from the effects of cerebral hypoxia‐ischemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>We find that increases in cerebral NMNAT3 decrease total hippocampal and cortical injury following neonatal H‐I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>This effect is associated with a decrease in calpain and caspase‐3 activity and a decrease in the injury‐mediated degradation of calpastatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>In addition, decreases in baseline endogenous NMNAT3 mRNA in vitro increased neuronal degeneration and enhanced glutamate‐dependent excitotoxicity, an injury mechanism thought to be important in the pathogenesis of perinatal cerebral injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>The neurotoxic effect observed from NMNAT3 knockdown in vitro and its near complete reversal by exogenous upregulation of NMNAT3 further supports the notion that NMNAT3 is important for maintaining the viability of developing neurons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the neuroprotective actions of a natively found non‐nuclear NMNAT in the neonatal injured brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>These observations also strengthen the increasing body of literature demonstrating the importance of NMNATs in promoting neuronal and axonal survival not only of the peripheral but also of the central nervous system. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="acn3450-sec-0026"><title><text><SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective role of NMNAT3 in injured developing neurons </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>The result demonstrating that NMNAT3 overexpression decreased hippocampal and cortical degeneration following neonatal H‐I is supported by previous observations showing similar neuroprotective effects in other neural tissues and species.9, 15, 29, 30, 31 In vivo increases in rodent NMNAT3 prevented the degeneration of injured axons of central olfactory receptor neurons in the Drosophila brain and of retinal ganglion neurons of the rat eye.9, 29, 30 Similarly, NMNAT3 overexpression conferred strong neuroprotection against axonal degeneration of the mouse injured sciatic nerve in vivo and of damaged DRG axons in vitro.15, 30, 31 Furthermore, our observation that NMNAT3 reduced cerebral tissue loss in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex suggests that the extent of the neuroprotective actions of NMNATs may be dependent on their anatomical and cellular expression as well as mode of injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>Indeed, immunohistochemical localization of cerebral NMNAT3 appeared to be primarily present in neuronal cell bodies of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 1), and previous research has shown that overexpression of cytoplasmic NMNAT1 following neonatal cerebral H‐I resulted in a more global protective effect similar to the one found with NMNAT3 in this study.11 In addition, we find that endogenous NMNAT3 levels are increased during the first 72 h following neonatal H‐I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>This effect is congruent with previous observations demonstrating that NMNATs are inducible under conditions of anoxic cellular stress.21, 32 Drosophila brain NMNAT levels are upregulated following hypoxia via a mechanism involving the activation of hypoxia‐inducible factor alpha (HIFα) and heat shock factor.21 Interestingly, NMNAT1 and HIFα peripheral blood mRNA levels are also increased in people living at high altitudes suggesting that the expression of HIFα and NMNATs is also adaptive to low oxygen conditions in humans.33, 34 Moreover, HIFα is a transcription factor importantly involved in the regulation of neuronal survival of injured neurons following neonatal H‐I and it is also actively upregulated in response to repeated neonatal cerebral hypoxia.35 Therefore, increases in the endogenous expression of NMNAT3 in response to neonatal cerebral hypoxia and ischemia may represent an internal mechanism by which the immature neuron attempts to protect itself from the degenerative effects brought on by excessive metabolic stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by the observation that NMNAT3 upregulation in the fly brain is capable of enhancing the life span of flies in response to oxidative stress.21 Similarly, NMNAT3 overexpression reduced the degeneration of DRG axons after exposure to exogenous toxic oxidants such as rotenone and hydrogen peroxide,30 and increases in Drosophila NMNAT prevented hypoxia‐induced degeneration of neuronal dendrites.20, 36 In this study, we also find that NMNAT3‐overexpressing mice have lower mortality during the acute phase of H‐I compared to their littermate controls (Fig. 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>The decreased mortality during and/or immediately following hypoxia‐ischemia in the NMNAT3‐overexpressing mice was an unexpected and interesting finding that likely needs future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>In addition to their aforementioned role in oxidative stress, NMNAT targeted to mitochondria have been shown to facilitate mitochondrial calcium buffering capacity.37 Mitochondrial dysfunction is well known to affect neuronal excitability through its role in calcium buffering, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, and redox homeostasis.38 It is thus possible that chronic increases in NMNAT3 expression, such as those seen in NMNAT3 transgenic mice, may contribute to an amelioration in neuronal excitability during excessive neuronal stress and may in turn decrease the risk for death during the acute phase of H‐I. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>Our results showing significant increases in cortical and hippocampal neurodegeneration after NMNAT3 mRNA downregulation and its subsequent rescue by exogenous human NMNAT3 (Figs. 7, 8) further support the aforementioned increasing scientific evidence that endogenous NMNATs are likely important for maintaining neuronal survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="233" pm="."><plain>These findings are rather surprising given the relatively low expression of NMNAT3 in the immature brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="234" pm="."><plain>Our observation also contrasts previous research demonstrating that injection of NMNAT2 but not NMNAT3 siRNA to superior cervical ganglion neurons caused neurite degeneration when examined 72 h posttransfection.39 These differences may be attributed to the timing of observation, type of neuron, and duration of siRNA exposure, given that neuronal degeneration and processes fragmentation in our cultures were not observed until 6 days postinfection, and viral‐mediated transduction of shRNA produces a more wide spread and long‐lasting level of siRNA expression when compared to direct siRNA injection.40 Although we cannot conclusively exclude the possibility that neuronal exposure and infection with our shNMNAT3 viral vector negatively affect other survival genes, we did not observe changes in the endogenous expression of NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 (Fig. 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="235" pm="."><plain>Additionally, exposure to the control shScramble vector did not affect neuronal survival (Figs. 7, 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="236" pm="."><plain>Of note, NMNAT3 knockout mice appear viable,41 although it is not yet known whether these mice have abnormalities in neuronal development or survival under basal or injurious conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="237" pm="."><plain>Lastly, increases in endogenous NMNAT3 24 h following H‐I were primarily observed in the hypoxic side of the pup brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="238" pm="."><plain>Although NMNAT3 protein levels were relatively increased in the ischemic hippocampus, we did not observe a corresponding elevation in NMNAT3 mRNA in this region (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="239" pm="."><plain>In our injury model, the hippocampus undergoes the most severe injury and it is possible that the mechanism of NMNAT3 induction is partially overwhelmed and/or delayed by the extent of injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="240" pm="."><plain>This may be the reason why the highest increases in mRNA and NMNAT3 Western blot immunoreactivity were observed in the hypoxic‐only tissues or the ischemic cerebral cortex, a brain region that undergoes a relatively lesser degree of injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="241" pm="."><plain>Future studies should aim at characterizing further the differential expression and cellular compartmentalization of NMNATs in the developing brain while further exploring the mechanisms responsible for NMNAT induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="242" pm="."><plain>The above likely will provide a better understanding of the regional, environmental, and internal cellular triggers that modulate neuronal NMNAT expression and NMNAT‐mediated neuronal survival. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="243" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our observations indicate that endogenous and exogenous NMNAT3 is neuroprotective against the effects of neonatal brain injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="244" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, studying the mechanisms and cellular triggers that modulate the endogenous expression of NMNATs is of translational importance as exploring biological strategies targeted at increasing the levels of these proteins in brain may prove beneficial against disease conditions of compromised neuronal health. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="acn3450-sec-0027"><title><text><SENT sid="245" pm="."><plain>Role of mitochondria in NMNAT3‐mediated neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="246" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have demonstrated that NMNAT3 is likely the primary NMNAT isoform present in mitochondria,6, 7, 9, 15, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46and our observations and those of previous reports suggest that NMNAT3 in NMNAT3‐Tg mice is also primarily localized to this organelle.15, 31 Mitochondria play an essential role in neuronal survival following cerebral injury and recent findings suggest that mitochondria are important cellular compartments involved in the neuroprotective actions of NMNATs.37, 47 For example, and as mentioned above, NMNAT targeted to the mitochondria enhanced mitochondrial calcium buffering, and reduced axotomy‐induced calcium elevation and Wallerian degeneration of mouse Drosophila axons.37 Furthermore, genetic elimination of axonal mitochondria in Drosophila prevented NMNAT's ability to reduce Wallerian degeneration of injured neuronal fibers.47 In contrast, increases in NMNAT3 expression enhanced the ATP synthetic activity of mitochondria and reduced axonal degeneration following mouse sciatic nerve injury.15 Therefore, NMNAT3 is likely important in maintaining neuronal integrity during disease conditions that alter mitochondria‐associated ATP metabolism and calcium homeostasis such as during and after neonatal H‐I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="247" pm="."><plain>If NMNAT3 protects neurons against neonatal hypoxic‐ischemic neurodegeneration via a pathway that involves alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitochondrial‐mediated calcium buffering, one is expected to find NMNAT3‐mediated decreases in the function of death‐promoting cellular substrates activated as a result of this organelle's dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="248" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, we find that NMNAT3 overexpression following neonatal H‐I decreased the activity of calpain and caspase‐3 (Fig. 4), two proteases that are well known to be triggered by the cellular events that lead to the permeabilization and altered function of mitochondria in ischemic neurons.48, 49 Furthermore, we also observed that NMNAT3 upregulation was associated with a significant decrease in the degradation of calpastatin (Fig. 5), a calcium‐sensitive protease known to inhibit the activity of both calpains and caspase‐3.23, 24, 25, 26, 27 It is thus tempting to suggest that the biological mechanism by which NMNAT3 protects neurons against the effects of neonatal H‐I involves an increase in the capacity of mitochondria to buffer the rapid increases in intracellular calcium as a result of ischemia‐induced glutamate‐dependent excitotoxicity, thereby preventing calpastatin degradation and the subsequent activation of calpain and caspase‐3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>This is supported by our in vitro observation showing a substantial increase in cortical and hippocampal neuronal degeneration upon NMNAT3 mRNA depletion 24 h following glutamate receptor agonist administration (Figs. 7A, 8A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Therefore, future research efforts may aim at characterizing the specific signaling mechanisms that link NMNATs and calcium‐activated death‐modulating proteins such as calpastatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Notably, although our observations agree with previously published work indicating that NMNATs are important enzymes for the regulation of neuronal degeneration, our experiments do not directly assess the specific sequence of biochemical events that lead to NMNAT3‐mediated neuroprotection following neonatal hypoxia‐ischemia, an important subject that needs future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Yet, published observations suggest that the calpastatin‐calpain pathway is a likely common downstream cellular mechanism involved in NMNAT‐mediated neurodegeneration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>For example, injured axons of dorsal root ganglia neurons transfected with mutant cytoplasmic NMNAT1 prevented axotomy‐induced calpastatin degradation, while knockdown of calpastatin accelerated the degeneration of injured neuronal fibers.15 More recent evidence indicates that NMNAT2 inhibits the depletion of ATP triggered by the activation of sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin‐1 receptor motif‐containing protein‐1 (SARM1) following axotomy, a prodegenerative NADase involved in axonal degeneration.50, 51 Interestingly, calpain inhibition or calpastatin overexpression did not prevent the energy depletion observed after axotomy.52 Taken together these observations suggest that NMNATs functions upstream to the cellular cascade that triggers the depletion of ATP and subsequent activation of the calpain‐calpastatin degenerative cascade following axotomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="254" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot conclude that this same mechanism occurs in injured immature brain neurons in response to increases in NMNAT3, the above findings and the observation that similar results have been noted in developing injured retinal ganglion neurons28 suggest that NMNATs may involve common death signaling pathways in both, the peripheral and central nervous system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>Yet, the various NMNAT isoforms may individually differ in the cellular mechanisms that they employ to protect the injured brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>For example, in this work we found that NMNAT3 overexpression following H‐I decreased caspase‐3 activation, whereas this apoptotic enzyme appeared not to be affected following HI in neonatal mice expressing high levels of cytoplasmic NMNAT1.11 These differences further contribute to newer evidence showing that the neuroprotective effects of NMNATs are not exclusively related to their NAD+ synthetic activity.53 For example, recent studies show that NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 decreased axon degeneration by preventing the SARM1‐dependent depletion of NAD+.50, 54 Interestingly, increases in the expression of NMNAT prevented SARM1‐dependent NAD+ depletion without increasing NAD+ production.54 In addition, NMNATs have been recently shown to have chaperon function in animal models of taupathies.40, 55 The above findings suggest that NMNATs have a broader and more complex neuroprotective function and therefore, targeting the mechanisms that affect the endogenous expression of these proteins may offer novel and more wide spread neurotherapeutic approaches. </plain></SENT>
