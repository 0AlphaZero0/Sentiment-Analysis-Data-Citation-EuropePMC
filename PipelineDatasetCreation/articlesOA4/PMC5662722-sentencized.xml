</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are negative-sense, single-stranded, and segmented RNA viruses, whose natural reservoir is wild aquatic bird. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Currently, H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs co-circulate amongst human worldwide seasonally, which cause more than 5 million cases of severe illness and about 500 thousand deaths every year1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In theory, avian IAVs are not capable of infecting human because of the host-range restriction2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, the emergence of human infections with avian H5N1 and H7N9 IAVs in these years demonstrates a potential pandemic threat3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, it is still unclear how IAVs adapted in different hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Previous researches have found that the HA protein plays a crucial role in the host adaptation because it binds to sialic acid receptors of host cells and mediates membrane fusion and viral entry2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In general, the HA proteins from human-adapted IAVs tend to bind a2,6-linked sialic acid linkages while those from avian-adapted IAVs prefer a2,3-linked sialic acid linkages5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In addition, other viral proteins, such as polymerase subunits, have also been reported as a determinant of host range of IAVs2,6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, computational or experimental researches have been carried out to identify singular or combinatorial host specific signatures of IAVs7–10, some of which were likely to facilitate the host adaptation process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>However, the analysis of mutations generally focused on amino acid changes instead of structural variations of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The hydrogen bond (H-bond) is one of the most important noncovalent interactions in biology which plays a significant role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structures and molecular interactions11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have identified several mutations with H-bond variations in the process of host adaptation of IAVs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Xu et al. showed that the dual mutations E190D and G225D at the HA receptor binding sites switched the receptor specificity from avian-type to human-type in 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) because of the formation of H-bond interactions between the glycan and HA12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mutation H110Y which is located at the trimer interface forms a H-bond with the 413N of the adjacent monomer in order to stabilize the trimeric HA protein of H5 subtype13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The NA of H5N1 and pH1N1 with H274Y mutation significantly weakened the binding affinity for the anti-viral drug oseltamivir, which resulted from the loss of H-bond interactions between the oseltamivir and two residues of NA (178W and 152R)14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Moreover, co-mutations V344M and I354L in the PB2 subunit of pH1N1 enhanced binding affinity by creating additional H-bond contacts between PB2 cap binding domain and the pre-mRNA cap analogue m7GTP15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, these researches, as stated, were specific to a few influenza subtypes and only covered a few of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Here, the H-bond variations of host specific and group specific sites in viral proteins were systematically evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>The combinations of mutations and H-bond changes at these sites significantly varied among pH1N1, human-infecting H5N1 and H7N9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In addition, the wave specific sites of the fifth H7N9 wave and their corresponding effects on H-bonds were also investigated. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Sixty host specific sites were identified in the eight internal proteins (M1, M2, NS1, NS2, NP, PA, PB1, and PB2) of avian and human IAVs (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Over half of them (32/60) were in the viral RNA polymerase, including 13 sites in NP, 3 sites in M1, 6 sites in M2, and 6 sites in NS1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>The H-bond variations of these host specific sites were evaluated through the differences of H-bond contacts with their neighboring residues between before and after a mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of all the sites was calculated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Sites with RSA value above 25% were defined as exposed sites (located on the surface of protein). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 1, 27 host specific sites contained H-bond loss or formation causing mutations including 10 sites in PA, 10 sites in PB2, 4 sites in NP, 2 sites in M1, and 1 site in NS1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>There is no significant difference between the distributions of the H-bond variation sites and non H-bond variations sites on the three dimensional structures (the ratio of exposed sites: 77.8% in H-bond variation sites VS 63.6% in non H-bond variation sites, the two-tailed Fisher’s exact p-value is 0.27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>As shown in Table 2, the number of sites at which mutations only gave rise to one kind of effect on H-bonds was 13 for H-bond loss and 10 for H-bond formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The mutations at the other four sites could result in both H-bond loss and formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>For the convenience, all the H-bonds were written in the format of ‘HB(donor residue, acceptor residue, donor atom–H…acceptor atom)’. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="197" pm="."><plain>There is a sufficient preponderance of observed mutations in isolates of the fifth wave when compared with those in wave1–3 at the eight characteristic sites (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="198" pm="."><plain>The mutations were acquired in the several strains of wave 4 (Fig. 4a), but we were not sure whether their frequencies were similar to those in wave 5 due to lack of enough sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>The dual mutations, R340K and A588V in PB2, appeared in most of the isolations of wave 5 (Fig. 4a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="200" pm="."><plain>The substitution from Arg to Lys at position 340 could disrupt the H-bond interactions with 358E and 342E in the cap binding domain of PB2 (Fig. 4f and g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="201" pm="."><plain>In fact, both Arg and Lys were basic amino acids with similar chemical properties, whereas their differences of side-chain conformations at PB2 340 were clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="202" pm="."><plain>Because all the H-bond calculations were based on homology modeling using CISRR in our study, these H-bond variations need further validation in accurate crystal structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>The mutation from Lys to Asn reduced polymerase activity of A/Hamburg/NY1580/09 strain32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="204" pm="."><plain>The residue 588V, located in the PB2 627-domain near the polymorphic 590 and 591 residues, had been reported that it is important for H7N9 and H10N8 virus replication and virulence21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="205" pm="."><plain>The dual mutations R340K and A588V in PB2 might be a feature of the fifth wave of H7N9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="206" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study gave a systematic assessment of intra-molecular H-bond interactions at host specific or group specific sites between avian and human IAVs, which is helpful for us to understand human adaptation of IAVs from a new perspective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="207" pm="."><plain>Of course, the H-bond interaction is just one kind of the noncovalent interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The effect of mutations may be multi-functional and they tend to function together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="209" pm="."><plain>Therefore, more efforts need to be put into the study of the variations of structural features to get a comprehensive understanding of how these mutations work. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="212" pm="."><plain>We retrieved all full-length sequences for ten proteins (HA, NA, NS1, NS2, M1, M2, NP, PA, PB1, and PB2) of IAVs isolations between 1918 and June 2017 from the GISAID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/frontend">http://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/frontend</ext-link>) and the Influenza Virus Database in NCBI33. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="213" pm="."><plain>Sequences from these two databases were merged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="214" pm="."><plain>For human IAVs, we mainly considered epidemic seasonal H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="215" pm="."><plain>The human H2N2 contained less than 50 non-redundant sequences in each protein (Table S3) and this subtype was not considered in our statistical analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="216" pm="."><plain>As reported in previous researches, the internal protein of human H1N1 and H3N2 have evolved independently25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="217" pm="."><plain>It’s necessary to compare these two subtypes separately. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="218" pm="."><plain>Our investigation was focused on H-bond variations between avian and human IAVs and how these features changed after avian IAVs overcome host barriers to establish sustained infections in human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="219" pm="."><plain>The effect of IAV reassortments should be excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="220" pm="."><plain>Thus, the pandemic strains (1918 H1N1pdm, 1957–1958 H2N2pdm, 1968 H3N2pdm, and 2009 H1N1pdm) were removed from human dataset as they were reassortants17,34–36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="221" pm="."><plain>For avian IAVs, all subtypes of IAVs were considered except suspicious subtype H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 which also circulated amongst human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="222" pm="."><plain>Besides, those strains annotated as mixed subtypes or lab strains were also excluded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="223" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we did additional sequence cleaning for NS segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="224" pm="."><plain>NS gene could be grouped into two major variants known as allele A and B and human NS basically belonged to allele A37,38. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="225" pm="."><plain>So it was reasonable to remove allele B sequences before comparison of NS segment between avian and human. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="226" pm="."><plain>Sequence identities between allele A and B were about 70%, whereas those within each allele were above 90%39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="227" pm="."><plain>We eliminated allele B sequences according to identities, in which case the NS of A/tern/South Africa/1961 (allele A; accession: CY014988) and A/redhead duck/ALB/74/1977 (allele B; accession: CY004739) were chosen as references. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Reassortants at a given period such as 2009 pandemic H1N1 appear to be highly similar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>We collapsed identical sequences for each protein with identity threshold equal to 1 using cd-hit40. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>This step is necessary and important for reduce the proportion of potential unknown reassortants in our dataset, although the frequency of IAV reassortments was low and few inter-subtype reassortants have actually established sustained infections in human41,42. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="231" pm="."><plain>Finally, we got a non-redundant dataset that comprised human IAVs (human-host H1N1 and H3N2) and avian IAVs (avian-host subtypes excluding H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2) (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="232" pm="."><plain>It is widely known that the HA protein can be divided into two groups: group 1 HA (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, H18) and group 2 HA(H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, H15)43. </plain></SENT>
