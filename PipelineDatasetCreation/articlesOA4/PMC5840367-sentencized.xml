</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is characterized by thickened and calcified valvular cusps causing left ventricular outflow obstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This progressive disease is usually graded as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the valve area and pressure gradient across the valve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Severe AS is a notable cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting approximately 5% of those over 70 years of age1‚Äì3, and the estimated 5-year survival in symptomatic severe AS ranges from 15 to 50% unless outflow obstruction is relieved by aortic valve replacement3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the disease remains poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, several of the associated clinical risk factors of calcified aortic valve are shared by atherosclerotic disease, and immunohistochemical studies show that calcified aortic valve lesions have many characteristic features of atherosclerosis, including initial endothelial damage, oxidized lipid deposition, chronic inflammation, and calcification4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common congenital cardiac malformation, when the aortic valve has two leaflets instead of three, accelerates the development of AS by decades4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>While the prevalence of BAV is 0.5‚Äì2% in the population, BAV is found in up to half of those with severe AS5. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the genetics of AS, although a recent genome-wide association (GWA) study reported the association of rs10455872 in the LPA gene, encoding apolipoprotein(a) of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), with calcification of the aortic valve, and with AS6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum levels of Lp(a) have also been associated with increased risk of AS7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These findings are in keeping with a common pathogenic feature of AS and atherosclerosis8,9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Another genetic study recently showed that a rare p.Arg721Trp MYH6 missense variant, which was previously shown to associate with sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation10,11, also associates with coarctation of the aorta, BAV, and with AS12. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a large GWA study of AS including 2,457 cases and 349,342 controls, with follow-up in up to 4,850 AS cases and 451,731 controls. </plain></SENT>
