</text></title><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an established treatment for medically inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Morbidity is low when SABR is employed for tumors that are peripherally located, and risk-adapted schemes can be employed when the lesion is near critical mediastinal structures at increased risk for treatment-related toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of such risk has been the subject of debate and the optimal SABR dose-fractionation regimen for central tumors is an active area of research [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In the landmark Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group (RTOG) 0236 trial that demonstrated the efficacy of SABR for peripheral lung tumors; a 2 cm ‘no-fly zone’ around the proximal bronchial tree was coined as an area of trial exclusion [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the RTOG 0813 dose escalation trial was initiated to investigate the safety of 5-fraction regimens of SABR for central lung tumors, assessing the increase of total doses of 50 to 60 Gy [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Though the highest dose level in this trial was achieved, there have been published reports of fatal toxicity after treatment with 45–50 Gy in 5 fractions [5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>A more fractionated regimen of 60 Gy in 8 for central lung tumors was investigated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) in the phase II trial, LungTech; however, efficacy and toxicity data are not yet reported [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Notably, tumors directly abutting or invading the proximal bronchial tree – defined herein as ‘ultra-central’ lung tumors – were not specifically addressed in the RTOG 0813 or LungTech trials and represent what is likely to be a higher-risk subgroup. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Ultra-central lung tumors are a relatively uncommon clinical scenario and reports evaluating SABR outcomes in this context are limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>One study found that 30–40 Gy over 5 fractions resulted in 1-year local control rate of 63% of hilar tumors; even with this moderate dose, a SABR-related death due to bronchial fistula was noted [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>A similar investigation of 35–40 Gy for lung tumors abutting or invading the mainstem bronchus revealed 70% local control at 1 year, but with no reports of treatment-related death and 1 report of grade 4 atelectasis [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Likewise, a retrospective study identified 7 NSCLC patients treated with 50 Gy in 4–5 fractions who all achieved local tumor control at 2 years, without any grade 2 or higher toxicities [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these results, Haseltine et al. estimated a 22% rate of fatal complications attributable to a 45–50 Gy in 5 fraction SABR regimen when tumors abut the proximal bronchial tree [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Finally, a large cohort (n = 47), ranging from stage IA-IIIA and with or without nodal disease, was reported by Tekatli et al. where the actuarial incidence of treatment-related death was 16.3% at 12 months for patients who received 60 Gy in 12 fractions [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Considering these findings, concern remains over the balance between local control and toxicity in treating ultra-central lung tumors and there is no consensus regarding the most appropriate SABR or hypofractionated RT scheme. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>In the absence of robust evidence for the ideal dose-fractionation regimen, radiobiological modeling can be a helpful tool to evaluate the risks and benefits of different treatment plans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Herein, we employ published radiobiological models to evaluate the likelihood of toxicity and estimate local control for SABR dose-fractionation regimens that are commonly used in the treatment of ultra-central lung tumors. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>Consideration of the competing risks for local tumor failure and acute treatment toxicity is required when using hypofractionated radiotherapy or SABR to treat ultra-central lung tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>This planning study suggests that SABR for ultra-central tumors is feasible, and a risk-adapted approach of 60 Gy in 8 fractions prioritizing OAR tolerance over PTV coverage may provide an acceptable balance between tumor control and toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>Although PTV coverage was compromised in this regimen, TCP was reasonable and risk to the proximal bronchial tree was negligible; however, given that proximal bronchial tree injury is correlated with high doses to small volumes (1-3 cm3), it should be emphasized that favorable toxicity heavily relies on good image-guidance to ensure the high-dose gradient adequately spares this structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, if treatment set up is difficult, or tumors are large and multiple OARs are a concern, a conservative approach of 60 Gy in 15 fractions prioritizing PTV coverage is reasonable, acknowledging this provides safe doses to OAR at the cost of low TCP compared to other regimens., </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par43"><text><SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>There are a few important limitations to this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>First, only three dose-fractionation regimens were compared and there are other potential dose fractionation schemes which may be appropriate in this setting; however, the three regimens selected for this study are commonly used in practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Secondly, the small sample size in this exploratory study precludes rigorous statistical analysis and a larger confirmatory study is needed; still, given the paucity of data for this clinical situation, we believe this study provides useful information for physicians treating ultra-central lung tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>In addition, while careful consideration was given to select models that were relevant to our cohort and the practice at our institution, interpreting results from model-based predictions should be done cautiously as these estimates are derived from outcome data at other centers and can be sensitive to host factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>The model-based predictions presented here are meant to give an estimate for tumor control and toxicity; further prospective clinical research is needed to better assess the true therapeutic ratio of different dose fractionation schemes for ultra-central lung tumors and inform clinical decision-making. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par44"><text><SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>To prospectively address this clinical issue, the Canadian Pulmonary Radiotherapy Group (CAPRI) has launched the Stereotactic body radiotherapy for ultra-central non-small cell lung cancer: A safety and efficacy trial (SUNSET trial, NCT03306680). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="118" pm="."><plain>SUNSET is a multi-centre phase 1 dose escalation study using the continuous re-assessment method, to determine the maximally tolerated SABR dose associated with 30% or lower rate of grade ≥ 3 toxicity within 2 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>This trial will investigate a dose of 60 Gy starting in 8 fractions and escalate to 5 fractions (with de-escalation down to 15 fractions, if necessary). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="120" pm="."><plain>Our modeling results suggest only 4 of the 10 patients included in our study would meet the SUNSET outcome objectives at level 1 (60 Gy in 8 fractions). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="121" pm="."><plain>Additional data from the EORTC LungTech phase II trial of SABR (60 Gy in 8 fractions) for central early stage lung cancer are also awaited (NCT01795521). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>Until the efficacy and toxicity analysis from these trials are complete, the best dose-fractionation regimen for ultra-central tumors remains unclear. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>In balancing the competing concerns over acute toxicity and local control when treating an ultra-central tumor with SABR, we propose a regimen of 60 Gy in 8 fractions, compromising PTV coverage to respect OAR dose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, 60 Gy in 15 fractions represents a conservative and safe approach with the caveat of lower tumor control. </plain></SENT>
