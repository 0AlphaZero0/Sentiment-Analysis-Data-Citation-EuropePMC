</text></title><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Bread wheat has a large complex allohexaploid genome that is 17GB in size and made up from three progenitor genomes (AABBDD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>This size makes whole genome resequencing costly [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a number of reduced representation sequencing approaches exist that make re-sequencing cost effective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>These include approaches such as: Restriction site Associated DNA sequencing or RAD-seq [2], involving digesting DNA with restriction enzymes and sequencing a tag for each resulting fragment; transcriptome sequencing, where we sequence cDNA generated from mRNA [3]; sequence capture, the capture and sequencing of DNA fragments by the hybridization of genomic DNA with synthesized probes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available, it is possible to design capture probe sets for tiling evenly across the genome and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs and CNVs to the genome [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation also provides a source of natural variability contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The most common form of DNA methylation is 5-methylcytosine, an epigenetic mark found throughout the genome of most eukaryotic organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cytosine methylation has been implicated with orchestrating the structure and function of the genome, regulating chromatin and gene expression and it is found in plants in the context of CG, CHG and CHH [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It is thought that cytosine methylation may be important for plants, providing a mechanism for rapidly adapting to environmental change. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Bisulphite treatment deaminates unmethylated cytosines resulting in conversion from a cytosine to a uracil residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Therefore, bisulphite treatment in combination with sequencing can identify methylated cytosine residues, an approach termed methyl-seq [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Previously, we used methyl-seq in combination with sequence capture to survey the epigenome in hexaploid bread wheat [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>An important question now is to understand how methylation varies across a globally diverse collection of wheat germplasm adapted to specific local agricultural niches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>However, to apply methyl-seq to this kind of dataset you ideally require both DNA sequence data and bisulphite treated sequence data for each wheat accession otherwise C-T SNPS will be incorrectly classified as unmethylated cytosine sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a new wheat capture probe set that is tiled across the hexaploid bread wheat genome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>This capture probe set is evenly tiled across the genome and enriches typically over 4× the probe design space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="96" pm="."><plain>It can be effectively utilised to survey and observe genome wide trends in wheat from a genotypic or epigenetic perspective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it can successfully enrich DNA from a diverse wheat accession from the Watkins landrace diversity collection despite it being designed based on the reference variety Chinese Spring. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="98" pm="."><plain>Using this probe set, we present a method, based on Agilent SureSelect Methyl-Seq, that will use a single capture assay as a starting point that is sequentially split and used for both DNA sequencing and methyl-seq. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>This method is applicable to any organism of interest and therefore has a much wider usage potential than the use on wheat that we demonstrate here as an example. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="100" pm="."><plain>Understanding variation across populations is a common scientific question and we want to understand how methylation changes across a globally diverse collection of wheat germplasm using methyl-seq therefore we will require both DNA sequence data and bisulphite treated sequence data for each wheat accession otherwise CG-TA SNPS will be incorrectly classified as unmethylated cytosine sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, looking at a diverse landrace from the Watkins collection, this problem had the potential to affect 11.3% of sites, therefore this issue is of high priority to address. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="102" pm="."><plain>Moreover, correction of the reference sequence using A/T➔C/G SNPs could increase the cytosine set for analysis by 1/5th yielding further benefit to analyses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="103" pm="."><plain>With a single Agilent SureSelect capture reaction costing in excess of £500 (probe set plus capture reagents based on purchasing a set of 16), by utilising a single capture for both genotype and epigenetic analysis, we can cut these considerable costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>These savings are in addition to the reduction in staff labour costs associated with performing a lower number of capture reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="105" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is an additional benefit to performing only one capture reaction to generate genotype and epigenetic information if the DNA quantity that is available for an individual sample is restricted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="106" pm="."><plain>Methyl-seq protocols from Agilent’s companies such as NimbleGen use an approach where bisulphite conversion is carried out pre-capture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Since bisulphite conversion severely diminishes DNA concentration, this allows users to maximize input into expensive capture reactions by treating as much DNA as possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="108" pm="."><plain>However, this necessitates the development of a fully converted and fully non-converted probe for each region of DNA that is more amenable to mammalian systems where methylation has largely been previously profiled and only symmetrical CpG methylation is present typically in so-called highly methylated islands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>In many accessions of wheat, and in other plants, the methylation profile is mainly unknown, methylation can exist in both symmetrical and non-symmetrical forms (CpG, CHG and CHH), partial methylation in a region is common and methylation is not always in islands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>This makes the design of probes for treatment-pre-capture difficult and incorrectly designed probes could introduce unwanted bias into captures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="111" pm="."><plain>Here we treat post-capture, this allows the same probes to be used for genotyping and methyl-seq analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="112" pm="."><plain>Our split after capture protocol has been carefully developed to deal with the low DNA concentrations associated with bisulfite treatment post-capture. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>When using approaches where bisulphite conversion is carried out pre-capture, software has been developed to allow sample genotyping directly from bisulphite treated sequencing data and although this would reduce costs, removing the need for both DNA sequence and bisulphite treated sequence data, this method depends heavily on having sequence information for both DNA strands in the effort to discriminate C-T SNPs and in plants, has all the previously described problems with conversion-pre-capture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="114" pm="."><plain>Here, we profile methylation in only one strand of DNA, and as such this requirement for both strands would double the probe capture space and increase sequencing and probe costs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="115" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, due to the high complexity of genotyping directly from the bisulphite treated sequencing data, such methodologies are highly error prone with reported false positive/false negative SNP calling rates ranging from 15% to upwards of 50% [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="116" pm="."><plain>We, therefore present a gold standard methodology to ensure highly accurate SNP calls and following on from this high-quality methylation calls. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="123" pm="."><plain>Probes were designed to capture a subset of wheat genes totaling 36 Mb; 12 Mb from each of the three sub-genomes of wheat (Additional file 2: Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="124" pm="."><plain>The design space was a subset of the 110 Mb of assembled wheat genic sequence previously used for a NimbleGen (Roche) exome capture probe set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="125" pm="."><plain>The 110 Mb was derived from the gene-rich regions of hexaploid bread wheat that had been processed to remove repetitive sequence, remove chloroplast and mitochondrial sequence, collapse redundant sequence and collapse homoeologous genes into one representative sequence [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="126" pm="."><plain>Initially, 120 bp sequences were tiled across the 110 Mb of genic sequence at 40 bp intervals resulting in 2.3 million potential probe sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>These probes were then annotated with the following information: (i) % alignment to the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) reference sequence (positional information and gene annotations were also recorded); (ii) number of homoeologous and varietal SNPs (utilising IWGSC, CerealsDB and the wheat ancestral genomes), to allow discrimination between the wheat sub-genomes and to capture diversity, respectively; and (iii) average depth of coverage of the region obtained in previous sequence capture experiments using NimbleGen probes [4, 13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="128" pm="."><plain>These annotations were used to rank the probes and the ‘best’ 100,000 were selected for the capture probe set. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="129" pm="."><plain>In addition to the genome wide tiling, for genes identified as associated with drought tolerance (Additional file 3: Table S1) [15–18] and the NB-ARC conserved domains of nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) disease resistance genes [19], 120-mer probes were tiled end-to-end across these key sequences to ensure that they were enriched effectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="130" pm="."><plain>Finally, a bias for even tiling of probes across the chromosomes was implemented, i.e. where possible there was one of the 100,000 probes per assembled contig that was thought to represent a gene with additional bias for available surrounding sequence to facilitate effective mapping. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="131" pm="."><plain>The 120 bp RNA capture probe or ‘bait’ sequences were uploaded to Agilent eArray (online custom microarray design tool) to allow submission for manufacture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="132" pm="."><plain>Bait ‘boosting’ was selected to permit excess unused design space (less than 1 Mb in this case) to be filled with repeat sequences of baits predicted to perform less efficiently i.e. those with an above average GC content are ‘boosted’ to ultimately gain even depth of sequence coverage across the target region. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="228" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the wheat ancestral genomes were aligned to the 82.5 Mb reference to identify homoeologous SNPs directly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="229" pm="."><plain>Secondly, non-bisulphite treated Chinese Spring sequencing reads were aligned to the IWGSC reference sequence to determine a genome of origin (only perfect and unique hits to one or two genomes were used). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="230" pm="."><plain>These genome assigned reads were then aligned to our single 82.5 Mb reference sequence, which is representative of the 3 sub-genomes, allowing the discrimination of homoeologous SNP positions. </plain></SENT>
