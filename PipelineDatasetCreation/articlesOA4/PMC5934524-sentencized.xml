</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the world [1] and is expected to climb to third place by 2030. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Smoking is the main risk factor [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that in Italy approximately 2.6 million people have COPD [3], with a resulting significant economic burden [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>COPD is a preventable and treatable chronic respiratory disease [5], whose high burden is related to delayed diagnoses [6, 7], low adherence to therapy [8] and difficulties in quitting smoking [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The primary symptom of COPD is dyspnoea, or breathlessness, which is associated with poor quality of life and difficulty in performing even the simplest activities [10–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Studies suggest that COPD is often perceived by patients “not as a disease, but as a health problem” related to their lifestyle [13], often causing shame and isolation [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Although a definitive cure for COPD does not yet exist, the disease can be adequately controlled through therapy, especially if diagnosed at an early stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, adherence to treatment and changes in health behaviours (e.g. smoking) are extremely inadequate, with rates of &lt;50% in Europe and USA, which have detrimental effects on patients' quality of life and on progression of the disease [15–18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Previous research, conducted by the ISTUD Foundation (Milan, Italy; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.istud.it">www.istud.it</ext-link>), showed that positive doctor–patient relationships and good communication can improve patient compliance, with a beneficial impact on quality of life [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>This research, which applied the narrative medicine approach, indicated the beneficial impact of this kind of education; therefore, we decided to develop a specific educational project. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title><text><SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Parallel charts: a narrative medicine tool used to think over the doctor–patient relationship </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Narrative medicine is a patient-centred approach that leads to an understanding of how patients live with their disease through deeply empathic listening to their needs and emotions [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The parallel chart is a narrative medicine tool where professionals can freely express their feelings towards patients [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In other words, the parallel chart is a physician's narrative which allows them to think over the patient's story in detail, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their relationship, while being able to decide if and with whom to share this narration [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Although many US and European medical schools offer narrative medicine courses in their learning programmes (e.g. “Impact of Early Implementation of Narrative Medicine Techniques on Patient Centered Attitudes of Medical Students”; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier NCT03041571), very little data is available on narrative medicine teaching and learning, and on its impact on clinical practice [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The educational projects driven by the ISTUD Foundation are based on Kolb's theory of adult experiential learning and this approach was adapted to this educational project in order to foster learning [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The aim of this educational project was to teach pulmonologists to carefully listen to their patients and to make them exercise the narrative medicine approach through writing parallel charts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The second objective was to understand the factors that influence the relationships between pulmonologists and patients with COPD, and how to foster positive relationships. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>From November 2016 to March 2017, 79 Italian pulmonologists participated in the project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>The educational resources and the method of analysis were agreed upon by the Steering Committee of the project board, composed of pulmonologists and experts in narrative medicine research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Each physician was invited to attend a webinar on narrative medicine or to watch the recorded video of the lesson. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>After the lesson, each pulmonologist was given the assignment to experiment with reflective writing of at least five parallel charts in order to familiarise themselves with the practice of narrative medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>All the pulmonologists received a weekly newsletter with research materials (e.g. articles and video on narrative medicine) and examples of parallel charts, which took around 10 min to read, and each month they received the online journal Chronicles of Narrative Medicine (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medicinanarrativa.eu">www.medicinanarrativa.eu</ext-link>) with news and thoughts written by the ISTUD Foundation, readable in 30 min. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This newsletter represented the “concrete experience” stage described in Kolb's learning cycle [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Before taking part in the project, each pulmonologist signed a consent form describing the objectives and methods, and ensuring the total anonymity of the stories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>The project was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In order to help the clinicians to overcome writer's block, the parallel chart included prompts that followed a semistructured narrative plot, representing a chronological series of events [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>The parallel chart plot was designed and revised by the Steering Committee [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Clinicians had the choice to write the parallel chart with or without the prompts; however, to be eligible for the study, the personalised chart had to deal with a relationship of the physician with a COPD patient whom the pulmonologist had prescribed a change of therapy or a new therapy 3–6 months before the end of the project and a patient that they had seen at least twice during the project. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Pulmonologists wrote the parallel chart after at least two visits and could choose to write it immediately after the visit or later, in the privacy of their own homes, which offered more time for an introspective reflection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>There was no maximum or minimum length required for the narratives. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Narratives were collected through the SurveyGizmo online survey platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.surveygizmo.com">www.surveygizmo.com</ext-link>); at the end of the survey period, raw and anonymous data were downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>All data were self-reported and submitted anonymously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>In particular, anonymity was guaranteed by an automatic coding system that assigned a code to each participant in order to enter the platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>No patient-sensitive data were reported and parallel charts were collected as part of the educational practice in narrative medicine. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>The narratives, written in the local language (Italian), were analysed using the grounded theory approach for the qualitative interpretation of texts [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>To reduce interpretation bias, analyses were conducted via triple-blind reading, by three independent researchers [28]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Narratives were also analysed through specific semantic evaluation software (NVivo version 10; QSR International, Doncaster, Australia) that assesses recurrent words and common synonyms to obtain clusters that were not previously predictable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>In addition to the grounded theory approach, a thematic analysis was carried out in accordance with Kleinman's and Bury's classification [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>From the parallel charts, three types of doctor–patient relationships were identified: 1) the easy relationship, where there is immediate sympathy between the patient and the pulmonologist; 2) the difficult relationship, where the physician feels discomfort in relating to the patient; and 3) the evolving relationship, which starts as difficult but changes to positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>The analyses of the narratives were reported both with the frequencies and extracts from the parallel charts translated into English. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>According to the perceptions of the pulmonologists, the majority of difficult patients experienced the proposed therapy negatively, while &gt;30% of the other patients experienced it even as a liberation, the beginning of a new life (table 6). </plain></SENT>
