In addition, because we postulated that one of possible advantages of VR system may be a reduction on the intervention time by the therapists while maintaining a similar amount of arm movements during occupational therapy, we measured the amount of hemiparetic upper limb movements during real and sham VR by using an accelerometer, and the amount of time intervened by the therapists during real VR, to investigate whether our VR system has the potential to be used as a group therapy tool in the inpatient stroke rehabilitation setting.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods and materials</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects were recruited from May 2014 to November 2016. Subjects were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had acute (&#x0003c;3 months), first-ever ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, with unilateral upper extremity weakness, and who could perform the reaching activity with their hemiparetic arm. Subjects were excluded from the study if they were younger than 20 years of age or older than 80 years of age; uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., active infection, pulmonary embolism, unstable angina), were unable to follow verbal commands due to cognitive impairment or aphasia, were unable to participate Kinect-based VR due to any reason (e.g., visual impairment, hemispatial neglect, apraxia), or could not provide written informed consent. All subjects received detailed information about the study and provided their written consent. This research protocol was approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital institutional review board and was conducted in accordance with the regulatory standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki: Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, 2000). The trial was registered with the National Institute of Health ClinicalTrials.gov protocol registration system (registration number: NCT02066116). Planned sample size was 40 but we decided to interrupt the study because for another clinical trial to see the effect of intervention for upper limb recovery in stroke patients was being conducted simultaneously, which made further enrollment in our trial difficult, and because of the pilot nature of our initial plan, we decided that the number of enrollments was sufficient at the time of termination.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Experimental design</title><p>A double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial was performed. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either real or sham VR. Randomization sequence was generated by a computer and concealed using opaque envelopes. This procedure was done by the investigator (NJP) who was not involved in the selection, intervention, and assessment of patients. Both subjects and assessors were blinded to group allocation. Both the real and sham VR groups participated in a daily 30-minute occupational therapy session targeting the hemiparetic upper limb recovery based on the adaptive task practice (shaping)<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> for 10 consecutive weekdays (5 days per week). The real VR group received an additional 30&#x0200a;minutes daily VR using our developed Kinect-based VR system and sham VR group received additional 30&#x0200a;minutes daily of sham therapy using RehaCom (Hasomed Inc., Magdeburg, Germany), which is used mainly for cognitive training but requires some upper extremity motion during the therapy.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> All participants received conventional rehabilitation service according to their other impairments such as gait training, swallowing training, and speech therapy during admission. Assessment was performed before the VR, immediately, and 1 month after the last session of VR by 1 occupational therapist blinded to the group allocation. Subjects were not informed of the group assignment and were not allowed to discuss the VR they received with other patients or occupational therapists.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Kinect-based VR system</title><p>We developed three types of programs: &#x0201c;Push Museum,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Apple Run,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Fruit Market.&#x0201d; These programs were made using the Unity three-dimensional (3D) game engine (Unity Technology Inc., San Francisco, CA). Push Museum uses the Microsoft Kinect Sensor (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) and its software development kit (SDK). Apple Run and Fruit Market use Apple Primesense Carmine 1.09 sensor (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) and Nimble SDK (Occulus VR, LLC, Irvine, CA) for the hand tracking. Our system could induce arm motions important during rehabilitation (reaching, wrist extension, hand grasping, and releasing) according to the subject's functional status (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Introduction of games and its training site.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e11173-g001"/></fig><p>Camera 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is positioned 0.7 to 1&#x0200a;m from the desk to track the fine motor information tracked by the Nimble SDK, which is transmitted to the Apple Run and Fruit Market via the internal network. In Apple Run, the wrist angle is measured and used for the Avatar control. The wrist angle uses the roll, pitch, and yaw angles between the Wrist to palm center vector and the fixed coordinate system. The pitch angle is used for the vertical action game and the yaw angle is used for the horizontal action game. In Fruit Market, a linear discriminant classifier<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> is applied to distinguish between grasping and non-grasping. Camera 2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) is fixed to the desk and the user must be located at least 1&#x0200a;m from the camera. Of the full body joint information obtained from the Microsoft Kinect SDK, upper data from the shoulder center to the hand are used for Push Museum. The in-game position of the push controller is the converted position of the hand point in the shoulder center coordinate system, calculated as:&#x000a0;<disp-formula id="MU1"><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e11173-g002.jpg" position="float"/></disp-formula></p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Hardware installation (side view).

Before starting the VR session, a 3-axis accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X; Actigraph Corporation, Pensacola, FL) was attached to the wrist in the hemiparetic side using a strap. VR was implemented by the designated occupational therapists. For the real VR session, therapists selected the appropriate gaming contents and difficulty level according to the subject's upper limb function and set up to start the selected VR. Therapists tried to minimize the therapeutic handling technique during VR. The allowed interventions during VR was to explain the game rules again, adjust the Kinect angle and the distance from Kinect to subjects, fix the unpredictable system errors, change the gaming contents and difficulty level during the session and monitor the safety. For the sham VR session, the similar strategy as for real VR was applied and subjects were instructed to use the hemeparetic upper limb. Therefore, most of the activities in the hemiparetic upper limb were reaching to the button and pushing the selected button during the cognitive task. If pushing the button was difficult, therapists were allowed to help subjects.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Functional outcome measurements</title><p>The subjects were functionally assessed at baseline and immediately and 1-month after the last session of VR. The primary outcome was Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) immediately after the last session of VR. The FMA for upper limb function comprised 33 items, with score ranging from 0 to 66, with higher scores indicating better function.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> FMA assessed 1-month after VR was used as one of the secondary outcomes.</p><p>Other functional measurements as secondary outcomes were Brunnstrom stage for arm and hand, Box and Block test (BBT) in the hemiparetic arm, and Korean version of modified Barthel index (K-MBI). Brunnstrom stages comprised of 6 grades ranging from 1 (flaccid) to 6 (near normal), representing the motor recovery after stroke.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The BBT evaluates the patients&#x02019; abilities to grasp and carry items. BBT was performed according to the previously published instructions. Subjects were instructed to move as many blocks as possible from one compartment to the opposite compartment for 60&#x0200a;seconds.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The total number of blocks moved was scored. K-MBI evaluates the basic activities of daily living with the score from 0 (totally dependent) to 100 (independent).<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Accelerometer data</title><p>Accelerometer data using ActiGraph from the hemiparetic upper limb were obtained during the VR session to measure the degree of activity during the therapy session. The acceleration was recorded along 3 axes with 30&#x0200a;Hz frequency. The data were downloaded using ActiLife 6 software (Actigraph Corporation, Pensacola, FL) with band-pass filtered data between frequencies of 0.25 and 2.5&#x0200a;Hz, using a proprietary process to remove acceleration due to gravity, down-sample data to 1&#x0200a;Hz samples, and convert acceleration into activity counts. Total activity counts (TAC) during each VR session, which was a composite vector magnitude <inline-graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e11173-i001.jpg"/> from 3 axes, were calculated. TAC calculated in the last VR session was used for the statistical analysis. Upper limb activity measurements using a wrist-worn accelerometer in stroke patients has demonstrated good validity and reliability.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup></p><p>For the control data of TAC for comparison, we used the data from longitudinal observational study (from April 2015 to August 2015) to monitor the activity using a accelerometer in stroke patients during inpatient rehabilitation, which was also approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Institutional Review Board. Data from a total of 12 patients during 30&#x0200a;minutes occupational therapy for the upper limb recovery were used and TACs in the hemiparetic upper limb were calculated.</p></sec><sec><label>2.7</label><title>Direct intervention time during VR by therapists</title><p>Occupational therapists recorded their time to guide subjects during VR with stop watch.

An uncorrected 2-tailed <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05 was considered statistically significant. To compare the baseline characteristics and TAC between 3 groups (sham VR, real VR, and control), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Sheffe test (with a significant <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05) was used as a post-hoc test when ANOVA showed significant differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.05).</p><p>Both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were used in analyzing primary and secondary outcomes. For the per-protocol analysis, patients who did not complete the entire study protocol (e.g., follow-up loss) were excluded from the analysis. In comparison, intention-to-treat analysis included every subject who was randomized and missing data at the follow-up assessment was imputed by using the last observation carried forward approach.</p><p>To analyze the differences of functional outcomes between sham and real VR group immediately and 1 month after the last VR session, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to control the variance in the baseline scores. The baseline score was the covariate, group was the independent variable, and post-test or follow-up scores were the dependent variable.

The compliance for both real and sham VR groups was good. The reason for drop-out during the VR session, early discharge, was not directly related with the VR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>VR for upper limb recovery after stroke has been investigated by using commercial gaming system (e.g., Nintento wii [Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan]) or specifically developed system.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Although a recent meta-analysis indicated that VR is significantly effective on the upper limb recovery after stoke, the quality and sample size of each included study were low and the results of individual studies were heterogeneous.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Recent randomized controlled studies with large sample size involving patients with subacute stroke showed no significant beneficial effect of non-immersive VR on upper limb recovery compared with the control group (active control or no therapy),<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> similar with our results. The negative results of VR in this study could have been caused by the following possible limitations. First, although our system was specifically developed to induce task-oriented repetitive motions according to the patient's ability, the induced motion itself might be less relevant or challenging. The motion in the real world and virtual world can be different and transfer of virtual training to the real world may not be possible in some conditions.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Our Kinect-based system can induce the repetitive arm and wrist motion effectively, but the hand motion which requires more fine motor activity and sensory feedback may be related with less relevant tasks compared with the real task.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In addition, although our system provided the various difficulty levels during the rehabilitation, the challenge level may not be sufficient to induce the continuous active participation and neural plasticity.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Lastly, we used the sham VR group as an active control to blind the subjects, because previous studies using VR had not tried double-blind design. The low and non-significant consistency between the real group allocation and the subject's guess demonstrates that subject blinding was successful. Although we expected the sham VR group to show less task-relevant activity and low dose, the combination of repetitive reaching and pushing the button during sham VR can also induced sufficient motion and some plastic changes, which might neutralize the results.</p><p>In spite of limitation of this study, the results demonstrate the perspectives of low-cost VR use in subacute rehabilitation. In this study, the direct intervention time by the therapist was 3.7&#x0200a;minutes on average during the 30-minute treatment session. The real VR group showed more activity in the hemiparetic upper limb than the sham VR group, and similar activity compared with the conventional occupational therapy group during the same duration of the rehabilitation sessions (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This means that it will be more feasible to apply this system as an adjuvant additional rehabilitation modality in the rehabilitation setting, which may be a tool for group therapy with supervision of 1 therapist or non-therapist such as a nurse or self-exercise between the therapy sessions or during weekend, to induce more repetitive movements, more recovery, and favorable outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> The many portions of direct intervention time composed of selecting appropriate program according to the patient's recovery. If the automated algorithm can be adopted to this system, the direct intervention time could decrease and the supervision of more patients by one therapist using this system could be available.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> In addition, our developed system can be easily used if the personal computer and depth-sensing camera is prepared. Various depth-sensing cameras have been developed and the cost is decreasing,<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> therefore the cost for setting this depth-sensing camera will also decrease, which may guarantee easier accessibility. In addition, the future development of depth sensing camera in terms of closer distance detection (e.g., Intel's Real sense)<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> or higher definition with many references<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> can be applied to simplify our camera-based rehabilitation system.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The low-cost Kinect-based upper limb rehabilitation system we developed was not more efficacious compared with the active sham VR control in this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with subacute stroke patients. However, the compliance in VR was good and our VR system induced more arm motion than control and similar activity compared with the conventional therapy. This characteristic of our system suggests the usability as an adjuvant additional therapy during inpatient stroke rehabilitation.</p><p>More advances in our current pilot version VR system with more detailed difficulty levels, task-relevant design, are numerous pleasurable gaming options could induce more active participation and transfer to the real environments. Automated adoption system or more user friendly interface to select the appropriate rehabilitation program or difficulty level can reduce the direct intervention time by a therapist and increase the usability by patients or non-experts themselves. Further clinical trials with this low-cost VR system have to be more pragmatic, focusing on the feasibility as a group or self-therapy in the inpatient or home setting and a cost-effectiveness analysis has to be included.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Sungmin Cho, Ji-Young Lee, Nam-Jong Paik.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Seo Hyun Park, Ji-Young Lee, SuYeon Kwon.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Won-Seok Kim.</p><p><bold>Funding acquisition:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Nam-Jong Paik.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Sungmin Cho, Seo Hyun Park, Ji-Young Lee, SuYeon Kwon, Nam-Jong Paik.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Ji-Young Lee.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Seo Hyun Park, Nam-Jong Paik.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Sungmin Cho, Ji-Young Lee, SuYeon Kwon.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Sungmin Cho.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Nam-Jong Paik.</p><p><bold>Visualization:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Sungmin Cho, SuYeon Kwon.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Won-Seok Kim, Sungmin Cho.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review and editing:</bold> Seo Hyun Park, Ji-Young Lee, SuYeon Kwon, Nam-Jong Paik.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-97-e11173-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e804" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BBT = box and block test, B-stage = Brunnstrom stage, FMA = Fugl-Meyer assessment, K-MBI = Korean version of modified Barthel index, TAC = total activity count, UE = upper extremity, VR = virtual rehabilitation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Trial registration: Clinical Trials NCT02066116.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was supported by a grant from the SNUBH Research Fund (Grant No: 14-2014-034) and by the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (MSIP), Korea and Microsoft Research, under ICT/SW Creative research program supervised by the National ICT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA) (NIPA-2014-[H0510-14-1014]).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The authors of this work have nothing to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>ES</given-names></name><name><surname>Coshall</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dundas</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
