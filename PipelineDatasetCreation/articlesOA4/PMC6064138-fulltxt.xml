Cell migration and invasion abilities were measured by Transwell assay. A cell adhesion assay was used to measure the ability of cell adhesion to gelatin. The focal adhesion was visualized through immunofluorescence. Phosphorylated FAK and other proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Gene expression profiling was used to screen differently expressed genes, and gene ontology enrichment was performed using DAVID software. The gene mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. The activity of the THBS1-promoter was evaluated by dual luciferase assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to verify whether YAP could bind to the THBS1-promoter region. The prediction of potential protein-interaction was performed with the String program. The ChIP sequence data of TEAD was obtained from the ENCODE database and analysed via the ChIP-seek tool. The gene expression dataset (GSE30480) of purified tumour cells from primary breast tumour tissues and metastatic lymph nodes was used in the gene set enrichment analysis. Prognostic analysis of the TCGA dataset was performed by the SurvExpress program. Gene expression correlation of the TCGA dataset was analysed via R2: Genomics Analysis and Visualization Platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Our study provides evidence that YAP acts as a promoter of focal adhesion and tumour invasiveness via regulating FAK phosphorylation in breast cancer.

In breast cancer patients, metastasis at distant sites, rather than primary tumour, is the major obstacle of treatment and the main cause of cancer lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Metastasis is a long, sequential process, in which the interaction between cancer cells and the tumour extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cell-ECM crosstalk plays a key role in regulating tumour cell motility and invasiveness through numerous cellular biomechanics, such as focal adhesion, membrane remodelling, actin protrusion, actomyosin contraction, and cell motility signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among these, focal adhesion has been revealed to be a crucial determinant of cell migration and plays an important role in promoting tumour cell invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Focal adhesion (FA) is a subcellular structure which provides strong adhesion to the ECM and acts as a scaffold for many signalling pathways involving integrin or the mechanical force exerted on cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed the dynamic cycle of &#x0201c;FA assembly&#x02013;cytoskeleton remodelling&#x02013;FA disassembly&#x0201d;, which allows cells to achieve motility, and the dysregulation of FA is considered to be an essential step in tumour invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many components of FA are tyrosine kinases and their substrates, of which focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) has been demonstrated to be a major participant in FA dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. After integrin engagement, FAK is recruited and phosphorylated at Tyr397 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; the phosphorylated FAK leads to the recruitment of other signalling molecules and promotes the assembly of FA complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In addition, there is also evidence showing that FAK is necessary in FA disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As a key regulator of FA, FAK plays an oncogenic role in a wide range of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Increased FAK expression and activity are often correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous research has proven the correlation between FAK activation and metastasis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Disrupting FAK could slow metastasis formation of mammary tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; thus, it has been selected as a potential therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancers (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). Although the significance of focal adhesion and FAK in breast malignancy metastasis has been widely reported, it is still unclear how FA is regulated in tumour progression.</p><p id="Par31">Over the past decade, Hippo signalling has been proven to be a master regulator network in many aspects of tumour biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Yes-associated protein (YAP) acts as the main effector of the Hippo pathway and triggers downstream biological effects through inducing target gene transcription via interacting with related transcription factors, especially TEA domain family members (TEADs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. YAP has been considered to be an oncogene in breast cancer, and its dysregulation often leads to tumour aggressiveness and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Recent studies have uncovered the critical role of YAP in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This evidence indicates a potential relationship between Hippo signalling and tumour metastasis; however, the concrete mechanism still remains to be explored.</p><p id="Par32">This current study focuses on the role of YAP in FA regulation and tumour metastasis in breast cancer. In this research, we have revealed the potential relationship between YAP activation and tumour metastasis in clinical breast tumour specimens. Through in vitro experiments we have observed that YAP could significantly promote FA formation and FAK activation in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have validated that the YAP-TEAD interaction is essential for these biological effects. Using gene expression profiling and the ENCODE database, we have identified Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), a previously reported FAK stimulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], as a direct transcriptional target of Hippo signalling. We have further demonstrated that YAP/TEAD could increase THBS1 expression to promote FAK phosphorylation and FA formation, leading to the activation of tumour cell migration and invasiveness. Collectively, our findings revealed a novel function of Hippo signalling in inducing FAK activation and focal adhesion formation to promote breast cancer aggressiveness and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p id="Par33">A human breast cancer tissue microarray of 104 cases of paired primary lesion/lymphatic metastasis (US Biomax, Cat. #BR20837a) was used to evaluate the expression of YAP in primary and metastatic tissue.

Meanwhile, knockdown of endogenous YAP significantly inhibited both YAP target genes (CTGF and CYR61) and THBS1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5k</xref>). We further verified that the YAP-S127A mutant could upregulate THBS1 protein levels in MCF7 cells via Western blot assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5l</xref>).

Our findings show that YAP could induce FAK activation in breast cancer cell lines in a TEAD-dependent manner, thus resulting in an increase of focal adhesion and tumour invasion.

In breast cancer, YAP is often reported as an oncogene, and its hyper-activation often leads to various tumour-promoting effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Previous studies have reported the association between YAP and breast cancer cell aggressiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the overexpression of YAP has been shown to be a trigger of epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and actin dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As the main effector of the Hippo pathway, activation of YAP is controlled by Hippo signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hippo signalling is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of tissue growth and cell fate and is mainly regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and cellular tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Recent studies have revealed numerous upstream signalling mechanisms involved in the Hippo pathway, including cell polarity, mechanotransduction and G protein-coupled receptor signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As a key component of cell-ECM crosstalk, focal adhesions have been demonstrated to play an important role in cellular mechanotransduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and act as a link between integrin and Hippo signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] in tumours. In the conventional viewpoint, FAK activation and focal adhesion appear to be an upstream signalling mechanism that triggers Hippo-off and induces YAP activation signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, a recent study has unveiled that YAP could directly control the RhoA GTPase pathway to induce FA assembly in AD-MSC and CAL51 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable that YAP could promote tumour metastasis in an FA-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par62">In our current study, we observed that YAP induces focal adhesions in breast cancer cells. Through gene expression screening and bioinformatics analysis, we discovered a new signalling axis, YAP/THBS1/FAK, in Hippo-mediated cell adhesion and invasion. THBS1 was the first member to be identified in the thrombospondins family and is a main player in the tumour microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. THBS1 was demonstrated decades ago to be a cell adhesion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Thereafter, numerous studies have proven that THBS1 regulates cell adhesion in different cell types, regardless of species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that THBS1 could modulate FAK phosphorylation to regulate focal adhesion dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Due to its essential role in tumour progression, THBS1 represents a perspective therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, very little is known about its upstream regulation. Our current results reveal a novel mechanism where YAP induces FAK phosphorylation via activating THBS1 transcription in a TEAD-dependent manner.
