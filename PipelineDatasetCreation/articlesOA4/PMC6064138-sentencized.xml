</text></title><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Although great achievements have been made in the areas of screening, diagnosis and therapy, breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In breast cancer patients, metastasis at distant sites, rather than primary tumour, is the major obstacle of treatment and the main cause of cancer lethality [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Metastasis is a long, sequential process, in which the interaction between cancer cells and the tumour extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Cell-ECM crosstalk plays a key role in regulating tumour cell motility and invasiveness through numerous cellular biomechanics, such as focal adhesion, membrane remodelling, actin protrusion, actomyosin contraction, and cell motility signalling pathways [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Among these, focal adhesion has been revealed to be a crucial determinant of cell migration and plays an important role in promoting tumour cell invasion [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Focal adhesion (FA) is a subcellular structure which provides strong adhesion to the ECM and acts as a scaffold for many signalling pathways involving integrin or the mechanical force exerted on cells [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed the dynamic cycle of “FA assembly–cytoskeleton remodelling–FA disassembly”, which allows cells to achieve motility, and the dysregulation of FA is considered to be an essential step in tumour invasion [5, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>Many components of FA are tyrosine kinases and their substrates, of which focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as PTK2) has been demonstrated to be a major participant in FA dynamics [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>After integrin engagement, FAK is recruited and phosphorylated at Tyr397 [9]; the phosphorylated FAK leads to the recruitment of other signalling molecules and promotes the assembly of FA complexes [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>In addition, there is also evidence showing that FAK is necessary in FA disassembly [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>As a key regulator of FA, FAK plays an oncogenic role in a wide range of human cancers [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Increased FAK expression and activity are often correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42" pm="."><plain>Previous research has proven the correlation between FAK activation and metastasis in breast cancer [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43" pm="."><plain>Disrupting FAK could slow metastasis formation of mammary tumours [16, 17]; thus, it has been selected as a potential therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancers (reviewed in [18]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44" pm="."><plain>Although the significance of focal adhesion and FAK in breast malignancy metastasis has been widely reported, it is still unclear how FA is regulated in tumour progression. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="45" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, Hippo signalling has been proven to be a master regulator network in many aspects of tumour biology [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46" pm="."><plain>Yes-associated protein (YAP) acts as the main effector of the Hippo pathway and triggers downstream biological effects through inducing target gene transcription via interacting with related transcription factors, especially TEA domain family members (TEADs) [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>YAP has been considered to be an oncogene in breast cancer, and its dysregulation often leads to tumour aggressiveness and metastasis [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have uncovered the critical role of YAP in the regulation of actin dynamics and cell motility [24, 25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>This evidence indicates a potential relationship between Hippo signalling and tumour metastasis; however, the concrete mechanism still remains to be explored. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="50" pm="."><plain>This current study focuses on the role of YAP in FA regulation and tumour metastasis in breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>In this research, we have revealed the potential relationship between YAP activation and tumour metastasis in clinical breast tumour specimens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52" pm="."><plain>Through in vitro experiments we have observed that YAP could significantly promote FA formation and FAK activation in breast cancer cell lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have validated that the YAP-TEAD interaction is essential for these biological effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="54" pm="."><plain>Using gene expression profiling and the ENCODE database, we have identified Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), a previously reported FAK stimulator [26–28], as a direct transcriptional target of Hippo signalling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55" pm="."><plain>We have further demonstrated that YAP/TEAD could increase THBS1 expression to promote FAK phosphorylation and FA formation, leading to the activation of tumour cell migration and invasiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our findings revealed a novel function of Hippo signalling in inducing FAK activation and focal adhesion formation to promote breast cancer aggressiveness and metastasis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="414" pm="."><plain>Due to its essential role in tumour progression, THBS1 represents a perspective therapeutic target in cancer treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="415" pm="."><plain>However, very little is known about its upstream regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="416" pm="."><plain>Our current results reveal a novel mechanism where YAP induces FAK phosphorylation via activating THBS1 transcription in a TEAD-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="417" pm="."><plain>These findings reveal a new crosstalk mechanism between the Hippo pathway and THBS1-FAK signalling and provide a new interpretation of YAP-regulated tumour aggressiveness in breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par63"><text><SENT sid="418" pm="."><plain>Numerous reports have shown that the FAK gene is amplified in a large fraction of breast cancer specimens; meanwhile, increased FAK expression and activity frequently correlates with metastatic disease and poor prognosis (reviewed in [15]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="419" pm="."><plain>FAK has been demonstrated to play an important role in the progression of tumour aggressiveness; thus, it has been selected as a potential target for cancer therapeutics [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="420" pm="."><plain>Several FAK inhibitors (GSK2256098, VS-4718, VS-6062, defactinib, and BI853520) have been entered into clinical trials, and some have achieved promising clinical activities in patients with selected solid cancers [18, 55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="421" pm="."><plain>Although inhibition of FAK has shown effectiveness in the control of cancer, little is known regarding the predictive response biomarkers of FAK-targeting agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="422" pm="."><plain>In our research, we have shown a correlation between Hippo signalling and FAK activation; therefore, YAP overexpression may act as a potential biomarker of FAK inhibitor treatment in breast cancer. </plain></SENT>
