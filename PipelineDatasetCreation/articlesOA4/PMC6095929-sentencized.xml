</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bacteriophages (viruses that specifically infect bacteria) are the most abundant biological entities on the Earth with an estimate of ten phage particles to every bacterium and a total of 1031 phage particles1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phages have been shown to be key drivers of microbial population dynamics, as well as affecting food chains2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In nature, this can affect biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, drive host diversification and cause the ultimate collapse of trophic structures2,3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The advent of powerful tools such as high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) now allows these phage communities to be studied as a whole (metagenomic), removing the traditional requirement to be able to culture the bacterial hosts in the laboratory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Culture-independent methods have become even more important as we have discovered that the vast majority of bacteria have not been, or currently cannot be, cultured under standard laboratory conditions4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Since 2008, NGS has been directed at gaining a better understanding of the interactions between humans and their associated microbial communities5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One portion of the microbial community that has not received as much attention with respect to its influence on these communities are the bacteriophages6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Metavirome studies on the oral cavity, gut and vagina have been performed and links to disease states in these body sites have been found, however these studies have not been extended to the skin7–17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Some skin metagenomic studies have investigated the portion of their data that reflects the viral diversity in their samples18,19, however it is only recently that the presence of phages, and their possible influence on healthy skin microbial populations, has been specifically investigated20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The skin virome is also thought to become one of the new areas for exploration using metagenomic techniques as only these can capture the genetic variations whether in bacteria or viruses, that may play a role in infection, immune evasion or widening of host tropism21. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The few skin metavirome studies conducted have looked at the overall picture of which phages are present on the skin and tried to establish global patterns of skin-phage lifestyles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Skin metagenome and metavirome studies have indicated that the skin virome is highly site specific and shows marked intra- and interpersonal variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>They have not assessed the presence or absence of individual phages nor has the genomic detail associated with the identified phages been investigated which could potentially uncover the role they play in skin health. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a knowledge gap remains with respect to how these phages shape skin microbial communities and could be the cause of, or treatment for, certain skin diseases through their effects on the microbial population22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The link between microbial dysbiosis and disease states has been well established for the gut and it is expected that similar links will be found for the skin microbial population23,24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>A specific example of why it would be important to better understand these interactions, is that it has been demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus strains devoid of prophages ɸNM1-4 are either incapable of infection or have altered virulence patterns and that phages ɸ80α and ɸJB can mediate transfer of methicillin-resistance encoding plasmids between S. aureus strains25,26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Phage therapies have been investigated in mouse models for the treatment of Staphylococcus skin infections with some success27, and it is widely thought that this is a potential avenue for the treatment of a variety of bacterial infections. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The modular nature of bacteriophage genomes and the limited robustness of existing databases limit the understanding of phage genome architecture and can lead to annotation as “multiple hits” instead of a single species during taxonomic assignment during metagenomic data analysis20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Adding new phage genomic information, especially complete phage genomes, to these databases will help with future studies of these skin microbial populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Most of the published studies have been performed on American, European and Asian skin types19,20,28, whereas our study represents the first that investigates phages on skin from African inhabitants (participants were predominantly of African and mixed ancestry). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Here, we took a semi culture-independent approach to better understand the potential composition of phage communities on skin from six South African male study participants, sampling the scalp, axilla and forearm, which are representative of the three main ecosystems of the skin (sebaceous, moist and dry respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>We looked at the phage genome architectures of some of the phages that infect bacteria from the skin which may have clinical relevance and how they differ from those currently known. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>This study describes an enriched human skin metavirome that shows similar phage signatures to the only other dataset dedicated to studying human skin virus populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>A caveat of our analysis is that as it is an enriched metavirome, and therefore is by no means a complete representation of the skin virome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>It does not reflect which phages are present on the skin at a particular point in time but gives insight into which phages are present in skin-associated bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Our study does highlight one of the limitations associated with current metavirome analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>We show two examples of hybrid phages (Stb20-like and Ab31-like) which, as smaller contigs in a metavirome study, could be assigned different taxonomies based on sequence similarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>This begs the question as to how many such fragments are present in current metavirome datasets artificially increasing the diversity of phages present when using reference based taxonomic assignments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>The solution, where whole phage genomes can be reconstructed, may be to compare contigs across metagenomic datasets and first assign all contigs with similar (identical) sequence to one taxonomic affiliation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>A long k-mer based analysis such as that used by the crAss program can be useful to develop a better understanding of the variability between individuals and body sites or metaviromes of any study site73. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>Despite most studies indicating that the microbial composition is unique per person and per body site, the identification of several phages from our dataset in those generated in geographically distant locations seems to support the notion that although the microbiomes are overall unique, there are clearly shared bacteria and viruses as noted previously72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>The question is whether these are identical or more distantly related. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>This can only be answered with the recovery of full length genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of the phiPSA1-like and Ab31-like phages described here seems to show that highly similar, if not identical, phages may be in operation on the skin of people who live in close geographical proximity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>This should be expected in urban settings where the exchange of skin microbes may be a frequent occurrence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>If identical or nearly identical phages are found to be universally present on healthy skin, but not on “diseased” skin, they could be explored as biomarkers for detecting imbalances in skin microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>If we consider our BLASTn results as a better predictor of the viral host for the various contigs described here, then many of them infect species, the genomes of which are adequately represented on the NCBInr database, from where the CRISPR database derives. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that for the majority of phages identified here, there are currently no CRISPR systems targeting them, and would indicate that there is no limitation for these to spread from one body site to another due to CRISPR-based exclusion and points to other reasons for the exclusion of certain phages from a particular body site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Recent studies which highlight the nuanced behavior of phages even in well studied systems such as that of phage T4 and λ, shows the need to explore phage-host interactions at the molecular level to gain a more complete understanding of these interactions74–78. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>It is possible that phages hold the key to understanding bacterial community imbalances and resultant disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>These phages undoubtedly have an impact on their host population through lysis events or altered metabolism during lysogeny. </plain></SENT>
