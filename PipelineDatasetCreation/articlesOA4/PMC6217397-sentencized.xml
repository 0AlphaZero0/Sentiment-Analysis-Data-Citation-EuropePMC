<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>In over half of MDS patients, the malignant clone carries a mutation in one of four genes (U2AF1, SRSF2, SF3B1, or ZRSR2) encoding factors critical for correct splicing of premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Mutations in these âsplicing factor genesâ are presumed to be causative events in MDS because of their frequency, their recurrence at a few positions in coding sequences, their high allelic ratios, and their association with clinical outcomes (4â7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Still, despite intensive studies, the mechanisms by which such mutations contribute to the initiation or maintenance of neoplasias have not been identified. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>We have been studying the most common mutation observed in U2AF1, the gene encoding an RNA-binding protein that helps direct the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (U2 snRNP) to the 3â² splice-acceptor site in pre-mRNA (8â10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>This mutation replaces serine at position 34 of U2AF1 with phenylalanine (S34F) (4, 6), yielding a neomorphic splicing factor that changes splicing patterns for many RNAs and does not preserve enough normal splicing to permit cell survival in the absence of a WT allele (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In addition, U2AF1(S34F) is present at high allelic frequencies (nearly 50%) in MDS (6), seems to predispose MDS patients to secondary AML (6, 12), and is also found, albeit at lower frequencies, in a variety of other neoplastic diseases, including solid tumors (13â15). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>Progress toward understanding the oncogenic effects of U2AF1(S34F) has been impeded by a lack of appropriate biological models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Here we describe our development of genetically engineered mouse models in which U2af1(S34F) is assembled at the endogenous U2af1 locus by the action of the Cre recombinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>By activating Cre in the hematopoietic compartment of these mice to produce U2af1(S34F), the mice develop impairments of blood cells with MDS-like features accompanied by abnormal splicing patterns resembling those previously observed in human cells expressing this mutant splicing factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In an effort to model U2AF1(S34F)-associated leukemia, we deprived the U2af1 mutant mice of a hematopoietic transcription factor, Runx1, often commutated in human MDS and leukemias (16, 17), and treated them with a chemical mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Under those circumstances, clones of AML developed in 3 of 16 mice but not in mice lacking any of the three factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>Although AML did not occur often enough to conclude that the mutant splicing factor is required for leukemogenesis in this model, whole-exome sequencing (WES) of AML cells revealed somatic mutations in genes often mutated in human AML. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>In summary, we report knock-in mouse lines with conditional U2af1(S34F) alleles, demonstrate the effects of mutant U2af1 on mouse hematopoiesis, and identify additional mutations that may cooperate with U2af1(S34F) and Runx1 deficiency during leukemogenesis. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="249" pm="."><plain>For example, human and mouse U2AF1 proteins are nearly (more than 99%) identical, and the S34F mutations probably have similar effects on the two homologous proteins, recognizing highly similar 3â² splice sites in mouse and human transcriptomes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="250" pm="."><plain>Despite the similar effects of S34F mutations on sequence recognition and genes of altered splicing, the mouse mRNAs altered by U2af1(S34F) are not necessarily the homologs of the human mRNAs altered by U2AF1(S34F) (Fig. 1 B and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="251" pm="."><plain>Similar observations have been made previously in transgenic mice expressing U2AF1(S34F) (27) and in mice expressing other mutant splicing factors (31â34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="252" pm="."><plain>Despite many differences (roughly 20% of genes with mRNAs significantly affected by the S34F mutation in mouse and human cells are homologs), a few of the genes with altered mRNAs in both species are often mutated in human MDS and AML or are partners in gene fusions in myeloid disorders (PICALM, GNAS, KDM6A, and BCOR) (35â38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="253" pm="."><plain>Another gene (RAC1) plays an important role in HSCs (39, 40), and another (H2AFY) encodes isoforms reported to affect erythroid and granulomonocytic differentiation (41). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>We also note similarities and differences in the hematopoietic phenotypes in our mice and the phenotypes in a previously reported transgenic mouse model (27), in which U2AF1(S34F) is driven by a tetracycline-responsive element in the Col1a1 locus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>Cytopenia is a common feature of both models, but we observed cytopenia in all leukocyte lineages, whereas in the transgenic model, the affected cell populations are restricted to monocytes and B cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Both models manifest defective HSC function, since they compete poorly with cotransplanted normal HSCs in irradiated recipients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>However, we observed decreased numbers of LSK and HSC cells in our mice, while the number of LSK cells was increased in the transgenic model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our mice developed mild macrocytic anemia and low-grade myelodysplasia, which were not present in the transgenic model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Factors contributing to these differences might include the levels of expression of the mutant proteins (mutant and WT proteins are at equal levels in our model, but amounts may differ in the transgenic model) and the methods for inducing the mutant protein [transient treatment with poly (IC) to activate the Mx1-Cre transgene in our mice as opposed to the addition of doxycycline to activate the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) transcriptional regulator in the transgenic model]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Mice engineered to produce mutant splicing factors other than mutant U2AF1 (31â34) display similar features, including cytopenia and a competitive disadvantage of mutant-containing HSCs in repopulation assays (reviewed in refs. 42 and 43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>Therefore, different mutant splicing factors may elicit effects on hematopoiesis that are both common to splicing factor mutations and specific for certain factors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the hematopoietic phenotypes produced by different mutant splicing factors, none of the mouse models (including ours) recapitulates all aspects of human MDS. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>Similarly, expression of an MDS-associated SRSF2 mutant in human induced pluripotent stem cells did not affect the production of hematopoietic progenitor cells and only mildly affected hematopoiesis (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a much more drastic phenotype was produced by deletion of chromosome 7q, another common but much more extensive genetic alteration in MDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>These observations are consistent with findings that mutant U2AF1 is often associated with other genetic alterations, such as deletion of chromosome 20q and mutations in ASXL1, DNMT3A, TET2, and RUNX1 in human MDS (4, 6, 7, 12, 16, 17, 45). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Beyond MDS, the same mutations in U2AF1 or other splicing factor genes are found in apparently healthy individuals with so-called âclonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potentialâ (CHIP) (46). </plain></SENT>
