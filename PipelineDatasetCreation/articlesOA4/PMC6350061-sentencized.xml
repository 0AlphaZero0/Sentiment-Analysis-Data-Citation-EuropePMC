</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Neural crest cells (NCCs) are vertebrate-specific, transient, multipotent migratory stem cells that give rise to a wide range of cell and tissue types throughout the body [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that corneal endothelium [2], gingivae [3,4], oral mucosal progenitor cells [5], and part of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [6] are derived from NCCs and exhibit immunosuppressive properties in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, corneal endothelial cells also express PD-L1 (B7-H1) and TGF-β, which inhibit T cell proliferation and induce regulatory T cells [7,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Gingivae express the Fas ligand, which then induces T cell apoptosis [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Oral mucosal progenitor cells can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte cultures [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have illustrated the ability of human MSCs to inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro and promote the expansion of regulatory T cells [9–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Moreover, MSC infusion has been shown to be an effective treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation [14,15] and is now being used in clinics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSCs also have immunosuppressive properties and can prolong pancreatic islet survival after islet transplantation in streptozocin-induced diabetic mice [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Thus, NCC-derived differentiated cells/tissues exhibit immunosuppressive properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have described NCC induction protocols from human iPSCs [17–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>NCCs derived from iPSCs (iPSC-NCCs) were reported to have a potential use in wound healing of diabetic neuropathy [21] and tendon repair [22] in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>However, there are yet to be any studies that have investigated the interaction of NCCs with specific immune cell subtypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>It was reported that iPSC-NCCs were effective in treating congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease) [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Human iPSC-NCCs have been shown to migrate and differentiate into functional neurons in aganglionic human gut tissue in vitro [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Human iPSC-NCCs restore mature ganglia and neurons in human intestinal organoid-derived tissue-engineered small intestine [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Li et al. suggested that iPSC-NCCs may be an attractive tool that can be used for studying the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders, as they represent a potentially ideal cell source for enteric neural transplantation treatments [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The multipotency of the NCCs suggests a promising role for iPSC-NCCs as a source for cell-based therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>When the iPSC-NCCs are clinically applied, it is important to investigate their immunological properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the immunological properties of iPSC-NCCs in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>After successfully inducing NCCs from human iPSCs in accordance with a previous method with some modifications [25,26], we used the iPSC-NCCs as effectors and immune cells as targets in vitro to evaluate the immunosuppression by NCCs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="316" pm="."><plain>While purification of primary NCCs is possible, obtaining a sufficient quantity for use in experiments can be very difficult. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="317" pm="."><plain>Although Stemple et al. succeeded in isolating primary NCCs from a rat embryo [33], the amount of NCCs that can be collected from an embryo is limited as the neural crest is an embryonic transient tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="318" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the collection of human primary NCCs is ethically impossible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="319" pm="."><plain>However, as the protocol used in our current study was able to efficiently produce a large amount of induced NCCs, this made it possible to use NCCs in our present experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="320" pm="."><plain>As we were able to obtain sufficient cell quantities, we were able to successfully examine the immunological properties using human iPSC-NCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="321" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as iPSC-NCCs have poor immunogenicity, this means that they can potentially be used for T cell suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="322" pm="."><plain>However, to achieve this suppression, TGF-β produced by NCCs is an important factor in achieving these immunosuppressive properties. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="323" pm="."><plain>The neural crest plays an important role in the development of the whole human body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="324" pm="."><plain>Thus, developmental disorders associated with the neural crest, which are referred to as neurocristopathy, can affect the entire body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="325" pm="."><plain>Neurocristopathy disorders include Hirschsprung's disease, CHARGE syndrome, and Treacher-Collins syndrome, among others. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="326" pm="."><plain>Eye related complications such as ocular coloboma and heterochromia iridis are often known to arise from such diseases [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="327" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these complications include not only the above congenital diseases but also degenerative diseases of neural crest-derived tissues such as keratoconus, Fuchs dystrophy, and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="328" pm="."><plain>Thus, NCCs induced from neurocristopathy-specific iPSCs might be an attractive tool for studying the pathogenesis of neurocristopathies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="329" pm="."><plain>Okuno et al. reported that iPSC-NCCs from CHARGE syndrome patients exhibited defective migratory activity [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="330" pm="."><plain>In addition, iPSC-NCCs can also be used for various applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="331" pm="."><plain>For example, the generation of sufficient iPSC-NCC numbers can be used to perform drug screening assays. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="332" pm="."><plain>Moreover, iPSC-NCCs can be utilized as a cell source for improving pathological neurocristopathy conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="333" pm="."><plain>Li et al. and Schlieve et al. also recently reported that iPSC-NCCs differentiated into neurons in human or engineered gut tissues [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="334" pm="."><plain>As a result, the transplantation of iPSC-NCCs might make it possible to restore the bowel movements of Hirschsprung's disease patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="335" pm="."><plain>The simplicity and high reproducibility of the NCC induction protocols can potentially reveal molecular functions and mechanisms of neural crest originated disorders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="336" pm="."><plain>If so, this could provide an important insight for novel cell-based medicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="337" pm="."><plain>In our current study, we succeeded in inducing NCCs and were able to examine the immunological properties of the iPSC-NCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="338" pm="."><plain>Study results demonstrated that while iPSC-NCCs had a lower expression of HLA class I, they had no expression of HLA class II or positive costimulatory molecules (eg, CD80/CD86) against T cells, thereby indicating that iPSC-NCCs exhibit poor immunogenicity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="339" pm="."><plain>The MLR test in this study demonstrated that iPSCs failed to inhibit PBMC proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="340" pm="."><plain>Lu et al. previously reported that in contrast to human skin fibroblasts, which significantly induced allogeneic T cell activation and proliferation, human iPSCs had low or negligible immunogenicity, were able to induce IL-10-secreting regulatory T cell, and failed to induce T cell activation and proliferation [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="341" pm="."><plain>In contrast, iPSC-NCCs globally inhibited PBMC proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="342" pm="."><plain>Since a low level of HLA molecules theoretically increases the susceptibility to attacks by NK cells, this is an important pathway for defending against pathologic microorganisms under normal conditions [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="343" pm="."><plain>The MLR test, however, revealed that iPSC-NCCs did not activate NK cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="344" pm="."><plain>When PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 agonistic antibodies, iPSC-NCCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation in cocultures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="345" pm="."><plain>Moreover, iPSC-NCCs inhibited IFN-γ expressing CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="346" pm="."><plain>Thus, not only do iPSC-NCCs suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation but also they inhibit helper T cell function ( = suppression of Th1 cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="347" pm="."><plain>As per our MLR results (Fig. 3), iPSC-NCCs can also inhibit the IFN-γ secretion from potential producers (CD8+ T cells, CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages, and CD56+ NK/NKT cells), as well as CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="348" pm="."><plain>Our transwell culture results suggested that cell-to-cell contact was critical in order for iPSC-NCCs to inhibit T cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="349" pm="."><plain>And perhaps more importantly, the iPSC-NCCs constitutively expressed membrane-bound TGF-β2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="350" pm="."><plain>In addition, SB431542 (human TGF-β RI kinase inhibitor VI) prevented the T cell suppression mediated by iPSC-NCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="351" pm="."><plain>This finding demonstrated that iPSC-NCCs suppressed T cell activation through membrane-bound TGF-β. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="352" pm="."><plain>In fact, TGF-β is a powerful mediator of inflammatory immune cell suppression [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="353" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, it has been assumed that iPSC-NCCs are able to suppress T cell activation by delivering membrane-bound TGF-β to the migrating T cells that are targeted through the TGF-β–TGF-β receptor interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="354" pm="."><plain>NCCs have immunological properties, which are similar to the corneal endothelial cells, and are derived from the neural crest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="355" pm="."><plain>Since neural crest derivatives may already have developmentally acquired immunological properties during the neural crest stage, when the differentiation advances from the neural crest, it is then possible that more progressive immunological properties can be gained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="356" pm="."><plain>Zhao et al. succeeded in inducing corneal endothelial cells from human iPSCs through NCCs [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="357" pm="."><plain>In future studies, we hope to establish iPSC-derived corneal endothelial cells, after which, we will then compare the immunological properties between the NCCs and the corneal endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="358" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we successfully induced NCCs from human iPSCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="359" pm="."><plain>Using iPSC-NCCs, this makes it possible to determine the molecular functions of NCCs and the pathogenesis of neurocristopathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="360" pm="."><plain>iPSC-NCCs are hypoimmunogenic cells that can potentially suppress immune cells, including T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="361" pm="."><plain>TGF-β produced by NCCs plays an important role in T cell suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="362" pm="."><plain>iPSC-NCCs have been reported to have a potential for wound healing [21,22] and enteric neural transplantation treatment [23,24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="363" pm="."><plain>The current results may help lead to the development of a new treatment of neurocristopathies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="364" pm="."><plain>In addition, if iPSC-NCCs are clinically used in humans, it is likely that they will cause less or no inflammation and exhibit optimum wound healing, as they exhibit a low immunogenicity and have the potential for inflammatory immune cell suppression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="365" pm="."><plain>We believe that the current study findings could contribute to realization of the use of iPSC-NCCs in cell-based medicine. </plain></SENT>
