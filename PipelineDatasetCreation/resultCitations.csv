PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	ENA	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1). 
PMC2154357	1K4C	Methods	PDBe	All values are reported in Table I together with previous results on KcsA (Bernèche and Roux, 2001; Noskov et al., 2004). 	We estimate that the accuracy and overall significance of the calculated free energies is roughly on the order of 1 kcal/mol, based on the difference between the computations with 1K4C (Noskov et al., 2004) and 1BL8 (Bernèche and Roux, 2001) and the comparison between the CHARMM PARAM27 and AMBER force fields. 	For the simulations with the AMBER force field, the systems were reequilibriated for 1.5 ns before starting the free energy computations. The hydration number of K+ and Na+ in the various binding sites were computed from the average of 800 ps of MD for each configuration; statistical error was estimated by comparing block averages.

PMC2216687	Q9XVV3	Results	UniProt	We first explored this concept for PPI pairs from different species and have observed evidence of this conservation of function between the PPI pairs. 	For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28]. 	Both PPI pairs contain a common domain interaction pattern, (PF00105)-(PF02518, PF00183), where ‘-’ denotes interaction and the parentheses denote modular domains. PF00105 is described by Pfam [29] as the zinc finger, C4 type domain, and PF02518 and PF00183 refer to HATPase_c and HSP90 domains, respectively.

PMC2216687	P01023	Discussion	UniProt	Moreover, the CSIDOP may provide additional functional terms to existing proteins. 	For example, the Alpha-2-macroglobulin precursor [Swiss-Prot: P01023], was predicted by CSIDOP to be involved in protease inhibitor activity (GO:0030414), which is not among the current list of functions annotated in GO. 	Consistent with this prediction, alpha-2-macroglobulin is found to be a major human plasma protease inhibitor capable of inhibiting most endopeptidases tested [33]. Another example is the PRS7 [Swiss-Prot: P35998] gene in human, which is currently annotated in GO to participate in protein binding (GO:0005515), with no other listed terms.

PMC2216687	Q14181	Discussion	UniProt	Orthologous proteins are generally believed to have similar functions, and the orthologs can be obtained from Inparanoid [31]. 	For example, the H. sapiens gene POLA2, DNA polymerase subunit alpha B [Swiss-Prot: Q14181], was predicted by CSIDOP to exhibit alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Orthologs of POLA2 found by Inparanoid include: POL12 [ORF: YBL035C; SGD:S000000131] in S. cerevisiae, POLA2 [RGD:621817] in R. norvegicus, and CG5923 [FlyBase: FBgn0005696] in D. melanogaster. All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 
PMC2216687	O75995	Results	UniProt	All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Furthermore, the CSIDOP method detected three molecular function terms for the human protein SLY, SH3 protein expressed in lymphocytes homolog [Swiss-Prot: O75995], while no information was found anywhere else. 	The three functions identified were DNA binding (GO:0003677), chromatin binding (GO:0003682), and zinc ion binding (GO:0008270). The SLY protein contains a COR1 chromatin-binding domain, and it was suggested in [38] that SLY may be targeted to the gonosomes in spermatids and may regulate gonosomal chromatin conformation and expression.

PMC2216687	Q8WWL7	Discussion	UniProt	The SLY protein contains a COR1 chromatin-binding domain, and it was suggested in [38] that SLY may be targeted to the gonosomes in spermatids and may regulate gonosomal chromatin conformation and expression. 	Another protein CCNB3 [Swiss-Prot: Q8WWL7] in the human genome was predicted by the CSIDOP method to be involved in cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulator activity (GO:0016538) and protein binding (GO:0005515).

PMC2602789	1GDT	Introduction	PDBe	The 1–2 dimer is present in a structure of γδ resolvase bound to site I DNA (11; Figure 2A), but the 2–3′ interaction has not yet been observed in X-ray structures of complexes containing DNA. Figure 2.Resolvase structures and activating mutations. 	(A) Crystal structure of a wild-type γδ resolvase dimer bound to site I [1GDT; (11)]. 	On the right, residues relevant to the experiments presented here are shown in spacefill on the orange resolvase subunit (in the same orientation); S10 in green; R2 and E56 in blue; G101, E102, M103 and K105 in cyan; A117, R121 and E124 in magenta. The hydroxyl group of S10 is the catalytic nucleophile in recombination. 
PMC2602789	1ZR4	Discussion	PDBe	The γδ resolvase residues E102 and K105 correspond to D102 and Q105, respectively, in Tn3 resolvase. 	(B) Crystal structure of a synaptic tetramer of γδ resolvase with two cleaved site Is [1ZR4; (16)], and on the right the orange resolvase subunit in the same orientation, showing residues in spacefill as in (A), except that the following residues are mutant; A2, K56, S101, Y102, I103, Q124. 	The images were created with PyMol. Resolvase variants with ‘activating’ mutations promote recombination at site I in the absence of the accessory binding sites of res (12,13).

PMC2677866	1CW0	Methods	PDBe	Structural models 	Similarity of the Vsr-like homing endonuclease to known structures was found using the Phyre server (34), and a structure model was created with the Rosetta structure prediction program suite using the K*Sync alignment method (35), with PDB structure 1CW0 as a template. 	For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	Conserved motifs of the HINT protein-splicing family are boxed and labeled, and active-site residues are marked with an asterisk. 	The sequence alignment was refined based on structural modeling with the cyanobacterial DnaE split-intein as a template (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	Sequences are named after their protein host.

(B) Structure based alignment of DnaE-2 locus Vsr-like putative homing endonuclease with E.coli Vsr repair endonuclease (Vsr; PDB code 1CW0). 	Residues that were modeled in similar positions and backbone conformations after sequence threading and energy minimization are shown in upper case; unaligned sequence regions are shown in grey lowercase. Identical residues are highlighted in red. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17). 
PMC2677866	NZ_ABDA01000203.1	Results	RefSeq	In another case, Vsr-like ORFs are present in two group I introns of recA genes. 	One of these introns is found in a gene fragment from a whole genome shotgun sequencing project of Bacillus cereus (NCBI accession NZ_ABDA01000203.1). 	The fragment includes part of a recA 5′ region and a group I intron with a complete Vsr-like ORF. This region is 94% identical to a B. anthracis recA gene with an active group I intron (45) and identical recA loci from several other sequenced Bacilli (data not shown).

Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31–0.96).

In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31–0.96). 	Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14–7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03–10.18, respectively).

The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P<0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events.

PMC2928273	rs1799724	Results	RefSNP	Inflammation-related SNPs and Risk of Pneumonitis 	A different set of inflammation-related SNPs was found to be significantly associated with risk of developing pneumonitis following radiation therapy and remained so at an FDR of 10% ( Table 4 ). Only one of the 12 SNPs identified were also associated with esophagitis risk – TNF:rs1799724. 	Patients homozygous for this variant exhibited a 5.96-fold increased risk (95% CI:1.33–18.57) of pneumonitis.

PMC2928273	rs1801275	Results	RefSNP	Joint Analysis of Pneumonitis Risk Alleles 	In combined analysis, the significant SNPs together with an additional borderline significant variant – IL4R: rs1801275 (P = 0.053) – showed an increase in pneumonitis risk as the number of unfavorable genotypes increased ( Table 3 ). The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013). 	This risk was dramatically increased for the group of patients with four or more unfavorable genotypes (P<0.0001). These high risk individuals also had a shorter duration between start of treatment and development of pneumonitis of only 5.33 months compared to over 12 months for those with 0 to 2 unfavorable genotypes ( Figure 1B ). 
PMC2928273	rs1800872	Results	RefSNP	Therefore, we determined if any of the variants identified as toxicity risk factors were also associated with survival over three years. 	We found that patients with at least one variant allele of IL10:rs1800872 had a 1.74-fold increased risk of esophagitis, but a 40% decreased risk of dying when compared to patients with wild-type genotypes (HR:0.62, 95% CI:0.40–0.97).  Figure 2A  illustrates the time to esophagitis for patients with IL10:rs1800872 genotypes. 	Although not significant, patients with wild-type genotypes had median time to event of greater than 12 months contrasted with only 1.8 months for those with at least one variant of rs1800872. For survival ( Figure 2B ), there was a non-significant survival advantage of nearly four months for carriers with a median survival time of 16.1 months compared to only 12.4 months for patients with wild-type genotypes.

PMC2928273	rs1800795		RefSNP	Furthermore, the cumulative effect of these SNPs was dose-dependent with individuals carrying multiple unfavorable alleles having a corresponding increase in risk. 	Nine genetic variants were identified as significantly associated with esophagitis risk, and of those, six were in proinflammatory genes ( Table 2 ). We found that rs1800795 in IL6 resulted in a 2.16-fold increase in esophagitis. 	This polymorphism is located within the 5′-untranslated region of IL6 and has been functionally studied with conflicting results of the effect on gene expression and response to stimulation [18], [19]. However, a recent meta-analysis of over 5,500 patients was not able to demonstrate a relationship between this variant and IL6 serum levels [20].

Gao et al. demonstrated that IL16:rs11556218 was significantly associated with colorectal and gastric cancer, but did not observe a correlation between IL16 serum levels measured in these patients and rs11556218 [21]. 	PTGS2:rs20417 was also associated with increased risk of esophagitis.

PMC2928273	rs1799724	Discussion	RefSNP	TNF-α signaling is an important modulator of the inflammatory response. 	The TNF:rs1799724 variant is located within the promoter region of the gene and thought to influence gene expression by creating an OCT-1 transcription factor binding site [34]. 	The effect of this differential binding on TNF-α signaling is not clear. Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40].

For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. 	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. 
PMC2928273	rs1799983	Discussion	RefSNP	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. 	This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. 	Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant results in production of a variant allozyme with reduced enzyme activity [43] resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide production [44]. These observations support our findings of decreased pneumonitis due to decreased inflammatory signaling.

The NMR structure of retrocyclin-2 was determined in the presence of SDS micelles. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted from this structure for clarity. 
PMC2978374	3AII	Methods	PDBe	After the manual investigation and modification by O (27) and Coot (28), the built model was refined against the synchrotron dataset using reflections to 1.65 angstrom resolution by CNS (29) and phenix.refine (30). 	The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 3AII).

PMC3044699	106210	Introduction	OMIM	Introduction 	Aniridia (AN; OMIM 106210) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. 	The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1]. 
PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	OMIM	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18]. 
PMC3044699	NM_001604.3	Methods	RefSeq	For direct sequencing, PCR products were purified (Shenneng Bocai PCR purification kit; Shenneng, Shanghai, China). 	An automatic fluorescence DNA sequencer (ABI, Prism 373A; Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA), used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, sequenced the purified PCR products in both forward and reverse directions. DNAssit, version 1.0 compared nucleotide sequences with the published DNA sequence of PAX6 (GenBank NM_001604.3). 	Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA analysis) MLPA was performed with SALSA MLPA Kits P219 (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

(c) The interface structure of the antibody-VEGF is depicted based on the G6-Fab-VEGF complex structure (2FJG), where the 30 CDR interface residues are shown in stick model and the VEGF homodimer structure (V and W chains) shown in sphere model. 	The distribution of the color-coded CDR residues shows the position-dependence of the amino acid preferences towards VEGF-binding.

PMC3310866	3AUV	Results	PDBe	Since the phage display systems in Figure 1 are based on the scFv and the sc-dsFv scaffolds, it is important to verify that both the scFv and the sc-dsFv structures are similar to the variable domain structure in G6-Fab even in the absence of the two Fab constant domains in the scFv or the sc-dsFv structures. 	High-resolution sc-dsFv structure with the sequence identical to the parent G6-Fab variable domains (except for the two interface cysteines in the sc-dsFv shown in Figure 2) has been elucidated with x-ray crystallography as shown in Figure 2 (PDB code 3AUV); the refinement data are shown in Table S3. 	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details.

The structural differences of the engineered interface disulfide bond unique to the sc-dsFv structure are also highlighted in Figure 2. Although the G6-derived scFv structure has not been determined with experimental method, the consistency of the sc-dsFv structure with the G6-Fab structure as shown in Figure 2 and the consistency of the sequence patterns for the scFv and sc-dsFv variants binding to VEGF (comparison of Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) indicate that the scFv-VEGF interactions can be modeled based on the G6 Fab-VEGF complex structure as well.

Although protein-protein core interfaces anchored by hot spots [29], [30], [31] and the hydration-mediated interactions in the peripheral protein-protein interface regions [18], [21], [22], [23], [24] have been well-established qualitatively, the results shown in Figure 1 nevertheless provide rich information on the amino acid preferences for the positions in each of the interface regions.

Only one clear solution was found and the R-work and R-free values of the initial 30 rounds of Refmac5 refinement [39] were 0.2581 and 0.3003, respectively.

To build the sidechain of the residue at position j, the amino acid type i adopting a rotameric structure k from the penultimate rotamer library [44] was locally optimized with the “Clear Geometry” function in Discovery Studio (version 2.5, Accelrys) while the rest of the antibody-antigen complex remained fixed. The sidechain conformations clashing with the rest of the protein complex structure were removed from further consideration. 
PMC3310866	2FJF	Methods	PDBe	The calculation of the structural propensity Zji for amino acid i in position j has been described in details in a previous paper [46]. 	Briefly, local structures in PDB similar to the CDR structures flanking with two stem β-structures in the unbound antibody structure (2FJF) were collected with PrISM using the threshold of PSD<0.1[47]; these local structures were multiple-aligned based on structural similarity with PrISM [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Zji was calculated with the structure-based multiple sequence alignments as the following [46]:(3)where Cji is the number of the amino acid i that appears in the position j of the multiple sequence alignment; pi is the background probability for amino acid i in proteins; M is the number of rows in the sequence profile; the term (B+M-Σk = 1,20Cjk) is the Bayesian prediction pseudo-count, where B = M0.5 is adequate in the calculation. 	Predicted amino acid preference in binary form δpWji for amino acid type i at position j was determined by the logistic regression model:(4)δpWji = 1 when pWji≥ti; otherwise δpWji = 0, where The Xji in Equation (4) is the upper bound of the atomistic contact term for amino acid i at position j; Xji for each of the rotamer model structures 1∼k (here, k is the total number of rotamers for amino acid type i) for amino acid i at position j was calculated (Equation (1)) and the largest Xji in this set of Xji(rotamer1∼k) was used in Equation (4). This term corresponds to the most favourable contribution from amino acid i at position j to the protein-protein complex formation. Yji(rotamer1∼k) for each of the rotamer model structures 1∼k of amino acid i at position j was calculated (Equation (2)) and the smallest Yji in this set of Yji(rotamer1∼k) was used in Equation (4).

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Wrote the paper: AL JRR. 	The aim of this study was to determine the association between the rs6552828 polymorphism in acyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACSL1) and elite endurance athletic status. 	We studied 82 Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes, and a group of sex and ethnically matched healthy young adults (controls, n = 197). The analyses were replicated in a cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (runners) [cases, n = 241 (128 male)] and healthy sedentary adults [controls, n = 504 (267 male)]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	The odds ratio (95%CI) for an elite endurance Chinese athlete to carry the G allele compared with ethnically matched controls was 1.381 (1.015–1.880) (P-value = 0.04). 	Our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Caucasians, yet a marginal association seems to exist for the Chinese (Han) male population. 	
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2].

To this end, we studied a cohort that comprised Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes (cases), and sex and ethnically-matched healthy young adults (controls).

PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Discussion 	The main finding of our study was that the ACSL1 rs6552828 SNP, located in the first intron of the ACSL1 gene, 715 bp and 718 bp upstream of exon 2 and the start codon, respectively, was not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Spanish men, yet a marginal association was found in Chinese men. 	The ACSL1 gene is a putative candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolic adaptations to regular exercise, at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level. Long-chain acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase (ACSL) isoenzymes, of which ACSL1 is the main and most studied isoenzyme convert free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) in an ATP-dependent manner, simultaneously activating and trapping FFA within cells [13].

PMC3400600	rs6552828		RefSNP	It must be also kept in mind that the A allele was the major allele in the Chinese cohort, which highlights inter-ethnic differences in genotype distributions. 	To our knowledge, there is no functional data on the rs6552828 SNP; thus, we can only speculate about mechanisms underlying our findings. 	The intronic location of this SNP has the potential to affect mRNA stability or to modulate ACSL1 gene transcriptional activity. Indeed, non-coding SNPs could regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA leading to changes in gene expression [17] and phenotype traits [18], [19]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828		RefSNP	Another possibility is that the ACSL1 is part of the group of candidate genes, among which are calcineurin genes [21], but many of which are yet to be identified, whose cumulative effect explains, at least partly, individual variations in endurance performance in the Chinese Han population. 	It could also be possible that the rs6552828 SNP may be a surrogate marker for other functional ACSL1 SNPs in the region. 	We believe the results of our study are overall valid, as all the following criteria were met [2]: cases clearly presented the main study phenotype (i.e. being an elite athlete), as we studied some of the best elite endurance athletes world-wide, participants within both cohorts were ethnically-matched, genetic assessment was accurate and unbiased, genotype distributions were in HWE in the control group of the two cohorts, and we used a replication cohort of a different ethnic origin. Current body of knowledge on genetic factors associated with exercise phenotypes and athletic status comes mainly from research performed on Caucasian populations. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	Further investigations are thus needed with other ethnic groups and populations as the one studied here, i.e. representing an important fraction of the total planet population. 	In summary, our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is marginally associated with male elite endurance status in Chinese (Han) population yet such association was not found in Chinese females or in a different (Caucasian) cohort. 	Our findings exemplify the need for further genetic association studies in the field of sport sciences to use at least two cohorts of a different ethnic background in order to increase the generalisability of their results.

The B. platyphylla Actin gene (GenBank accession number: EU588981) [51] was used as an internal control (reference gene) to normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, which has been improved by Chao Dai et al. in 2011 [30]. 	The validity of the Bplactin gene as a control gene has been tested and proved by pre-experiment before the real-time RT-PCR (Figure S2).

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). 	Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied.

PMC3598806	5TnC		PDBe	To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied. 	The 5TnC based system served to establish a frame of reference to which to compare the structural transitions discerned from the simulations. 	Dynamics of the N-lobe and Closing of the A/B Helix Hydrophobic Pocket The level of openness of the TnC N-lobe hydrophobic pocket in the holo and apo state and the closing of the pocket can be observed and measured in a molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. 
PMC3598806	5TnC		PDBe	To establish a consistent metric across all our simulations we measured the openness of the pocket as the distance d between the alpha-C atoms of the first residue of the A helix (GLU16) and the last residue of the B helix (LEU48). 	For the closed 5TnC system the pocket openness distance was d = 13.65 Å±0.71 (averaged over the duration of the simulation). 	For the open, Ca2+-depleted TnC system the pocket rapidly closed to d = 13.23 Å±0.60 (averaged over the last 10 ns of the 3 TnC2Ca2+ simulations). The open, Ca2+-saturated systems TnC pocket closed to d = 15.74 Å±1.29 (averaged over the last 10 ns of the 3 TnC4Ca2+ simulations). 
PMC3598806	5TnC		PDBe	The GLY34O-PHE74HN distance showed the greatest fluctuation: it ranged between 2 Å and 8 Å in the simulations of the Ca2+-depleted state. 	The distances observed for the four H-bonding partners compared well to the distances measured in the apo TnC simulation (5TnC). 	Semi-closed State of TnC N-lobe Ca2+-saturated or semi-saturated TnC reaches a semi-closed conformation in the absence of TnI. 
PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. 	Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. 	The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2].

PMC3689696	AY452039	Methods	ENA	For distance calculation the distance estimation method K3ST (Kimura’s three-substitution-types; [29]) was used. 	To construct cluster networks in form of rooted rectangular phylogrammes, the sequence AY452039 of Candida picachoensis CBS 9804T was used as outgroup. 	This species is close enough to the M. pulcherrima group [7] to have a D1/D2 sequence moderately related to the analysed sequences but far enough to be an uncontroversial outgroup. To generate neighbor-nets, Equal Angle setting was chosen and the sequence used as outgroup in cluster networks was excluded from the analysis, as its inclusion had little effect on the overall structure (the neighbor nets are unrooted networks) of the network and the layout of the network was improved by its exclusion.

Comparison of the cloned sequences with the database D1/D2 sequences of the type strains (AJ745110 and AF360542) confirmed our hypothesis that the ambiguous nucleotides of the type strains could be due to heterogeneity of the PCR products used by the depositors for sequencing. 	It is evident from Fig. 1 and Tables 2 and 3 that all their ambiguous nucleotides corresponded to sites variable in the clones and their ambiguity symbols (M, R, Y and N) were in agreement with the alternating nucleotides (A/C, A/G, C/T and any base, respectively). The Megablast search in GenBank with the cloned sequences did not identify identical sequences with the exception of fc21 of M. fructicola.

PMC3730352	AB065375	Introduction	ENA	For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. 	In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). 	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010).

PMC3757009	KC952001	Results	ENA	To address the regulatory role of cytokinin in rhizoid formation during Rosa canina regeneration, we cloned a type-A ARR homologous gene. 	A cDNA fragment was amplified using degenerate primers and then the full-length cDNA (accession number KC952001) named RcRR1 was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). 	The full transcript of RcRR1 is 939 bp in length and contains a 702 bp open reading frame, a 116 bp 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and a 121 bp 3′-UTR. To characterize the function of RcRR1 in Rosa canina, we performed phylogenetic analysis using MEGA4.

PMC3804621	KF152923	Results	ENA	To evaluate and compare the structure of the OitaAP2 gene with that of known AP2-like genes, the OitaAP2 locus was amplified from genomic DNA using multiple primer pairs. 	Sequence comparison of the OitaAP2 and OitaAP2_ISO cDNAs with the genomic sequence of the OitaAP2 locus (accession number KF152923) revealed the presence of 10 exons and 9 introns (Figure 1d). 	This gene structure appears conserved for the AP2 genes of Arabidopsis, grapevine [55] and apple [56], all of which constitute 10 exons and 9 introns. The twelve AP2-like genes of the orchid E. pusilla show an intron number ranging from 7 to 11; however, the specific structure of the EpAP2-11 gene, the putative ortholog of OitaAP2, is not reported [41].

PMC3843656	rs11209026	Introduction	RefSNP	Different studies have identified IL23R as a susceptibility factor associated to multiple inflammatory conditions [16,17,18]. 	In these studies several independent signals located within IL23R locus were suggested; however, only the R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism, whose minor allele plays a protective role for several autoimmune disease, appear to have a functional involvement [19,20]. 	Additionally, the rs1495965 polymorphism has been reported as the stronger IL23R association with Behçet’s disease (BD), a systemic autoimmune disease involving uveitis, in a previous combined meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [21,22]. On the other hand, STAT4 has been also identified as another shared susceptibility locus [23,24].

PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	Using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR), we identified rs17099451 in MMP8, using a single locus model, with a mean cross-validation of 87.0%. 	Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%. 	Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease.

Of the SNPs selected by the MDR method, rs17099451 in MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3 were regarded as the most significant results in a 2 × 2 dominant model analysis. 	The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease. The main pathogenic mechanism of bronchial asthma involves a particular form of chronic inflammation, in which the increase in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the respiratory tract membrane and exfoliation of the respiratory epithelium cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, followed by airway remodeling.1 These pathological changes result from the interactions between the inflammatory mediators and the various cytokines produced by the infiltrated cells or the structural cells.2 
PMC3911802	rs40401		RefSNP	An SNP, rs17099451, in MMP8 was selected by the single gene locus model; the cross-validation mean for this model was 87.0%. 	The two-gene loci model selected two combinations, viz., MMP8 and ADAM33 SNP rs44707, as well as MMP8 and IL-3 SNP rs40401, of which the CVC means reached 45.0% 	Using the aforementioned selected SNPs, the single gene locus model was found to be superior to the two-locus model, based on balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluations, when used to predict bronchial asthma development in the testing data. The balanced accuracy means for these SNPs were 55.7 and 54.5%, and the sensitivity means were 68.7 and 56.2%, respectively.

The minor alleles were A and C in the MMP8 and IL-3 SNPs, respectively (Table 1); the risk alleles were the major alleles. Association Analysis of MMP8 and IL-3 Alleles with Asthma 
PMC3911802	rs40401		RefSNP	The empiric p value calculated by permutation testing was 0.014.

In a single locus model, we found that MMP8 rs17099451, and in a two-locus model, the combination of this rs17099451 in MMP8 SNP and rs44707 in ADAM33, as well as this MMP8 SNP and rs40401 IL-3, were selected as significant asthma development risk markers. 	The single locus model of the MMP8 was consistently selected, and the balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluation against the test data were superior in the single locus model compared with those in the two-locus model. In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model.

In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model. 	It is known that MMP8 is involved in the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis.18–20 Until recently, MMP8 has been thought to be produced only by neutrophils, but it is now known to be expressed in some other cell types, including articular chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cytotrophoblasts.21–25 Using an MMP8 knockout mouse model, Gueders et al. revealed an important role for MMP8 in the control of neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration during allergen-induced lung inflammation; they also showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of MMP8 is partly caused by regulation of inflammatory cell apoptosis.26 In asthma patients, a significant inverse correlation between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid MMP8 levels and FEV1 and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid–activated MMP8 forms and FEV1 was detected.27 Inhaled budesonide normalized the MMP8/tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 ratio in asthmatic children via up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 production and down-regulation of MMP8 production by airway macrophages.28 Overall, these data suggest that MMP8 and its activation have an important role in the airway destruction, healing, remodeling, and treatment response in asthma. 
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	Furthermore, IL-3 is a cytokine produced by active T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, which stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.30 Moreover, IL-3 mRNA-expressing cells and IL-3 production are increased in asthma patients; this increase in IL-3 is independent of eosinophil number.31 Park et al.32 reported that one exonic SNP (in exon 1), IL3 + 79T > C (Ser27Pro) showed significant association with the risk of asthma and atopy. 	The Pro-allele had dominant, protective effects against the development of asthma in nonatopic subjects (p = -.002) and also showed significant association with the risk of atopy in normal control subjects (p = 0.007).32 We also found that rs40401 in IL-3 had the most significant effect in the 2 × 2 dominant model analysis, which suggests that the minor C allele may have a suppressing effect on asthma development. 	Van Eerdewegh et al. reported that ADAM33 on chromosome 20p13 was linked to asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, using a genomewide scan of 460 white families.9 The ADAM33 gene group appears to be related to proliferation, differentiation, or migration of fibroblasts, muscle fibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells, factors that are related to bronchial hyperresponsiveness or bronchial remodeling. However, these proteins do not appear to be involved in the respiratory epithelium, which is related to asthmatic immunologic or inflammatory components.9,33 Although a previous genomewide association study in a Japanese population did not implicate ADAM33 among the three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma,34 another study suggested the involvement of ADAM33 in the development of childhood asthma among the Japanese.35

PMC4030988	1R8J		PDBe	It is speculated that E-to-H unit must be the basic structure in the early stage of the evolution of globin-like fold proteins, and this unit might grow to various globin-fold proteins during evolution. 	Proteins in other folds, for example, 1R8J, 1XL3 and so on, might also have grew from each ancestor protein with a structure similar to the E-to-H helix unit during evolution. 	Among the hit proteins, 1R8J is interesting because this protein is composed of two domains, one is the E–to-H unit and the other is the domain, while the other hit proteins are all proteins. This also indicates that the E-to-H helix unit widely exists in the structural space of proteins.

PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search. 
PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to identify the conserved residues across the E-to-H helix unit of each protein hit by the Dali search, homologous amino acid sequences of the helix unit were collected from the amino acid sequence database, UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/), by means of BLAST. 	The amino acid sequence of the E-to-H helix unit of a representative protein for each family as well as that of leghemoglobin (1FSL) were queried against the UniRef100 which is non-redundant set of the UniProt database. 	A threshold of the expected value of a BLAST search for a hit amino acid sequence retrieval was taken sufficiently low value, e = 0.001, to ensure that homologous sequences were obtained. We made a multiple alignment of the obtained amino acid sequences for each query protein using MUSCLE [30].

PMC4107892	GU727556	Article	ENA	Two cultures listed in the CBS collection as E. subulatus (CBS 458.88 and CBS 139.90) were found to be phylogenetically and morphologically distinct (Figs 1 & 6, respectively) and represent different taxa. 	Highest similarity of the LSU sequences was found with “Mollisia incrustata” GenBank GU727556; however, this sequence does not appear to be congeneric with other Mollisia sequences on GenBank (data not shown) and thus the application of the supposed taxonomic lineage of Mollisia (Leotiomycetes; Helotiales; Dermateaceae) would not be confirmed here.

PMC4188009	2ei4	Figure	PDBe	Structural analysis was performed with CNS (Brünger et al., 1998 ▶), REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011 ▶) and XtalView (McRee, 1993 ▶). 	The structure of aR2 in the P321 crystal (PDB entry 2ei4) was used as an initial model. 	After rotational and translational searching with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 ▶), water and lipid molecules were added on the basis of the 2F o − F c map and the structure was refined by several cycles of simulated-annealing and individual B-factor refinements. The final refinement of the protein structure using REFMAC5 resulted in an R cryst of 21.4% and an R free of 23.4% (Table 1 ▶). 
PMC4188009	1c3w	Figure	PDBe	It has been reported that the neutral purple form is destabilized in bR-containing vesicles reconstituted with egg lethicin, in which the transition from the neutral purple form into an inactive red form with λmax at 480 nm takes place at pH 6.5 (Nasuda-Kouyama et al., 1990 ▶). 	With respect to the protein structure in the P63 crystal, Glu194 OE2 in the structural model solved at 1.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 1c3w) has an unusually large B factor (62 Å2; Luecke et al., 1999 ▶). 	(The B factor of Glu199 OE2 of aR2 in the H32 crystal is 31 Å2.) It is possible that the conformation of Glu194bR in the P63 crystal represents a mixed state between the neutral purple form and the alkaline pink form. There is another caveat to the structural model of bR that was built using the P63 crystal.

The cells were incubated under low Ca2+ (0.2 mmol/L CaCl2, 3.8 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L EGTA) condition or stimulated by the addition of A23187 (Ca2+ ionophore) to a final concentration of 5 μmol/L at 37°C. 	After aliquots were taken at 20 min, the amount of ATP was measured by bioluminescence method (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) based on luciferin–luciferase reaction with BLR‐101C Luminescence Reader (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan).

PMC4208647	A23187	Results	ENA	Then, we investigated whether VNUT gene expression is linked with the secretion of nucleotides from MEG‐01 cells. 	Nucleotide secretion was triggered by the addition of A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, since it causes entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell interior; the resultant rapid increase in Ca2+ facilitates exocytosis of secretory vesicles. 	As shown in Figure 4A, appreciable amounts of ATP and ADP were released from the cells in a time‐dependent fashion. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in the medium, no A23187‐dependent release of nucleotides was observed.

This inhibition was partially recovered by removal of the substances by washing, which is consistent with the mode of inhibition of VNUT (Fig. 5D). Glyoxylate is a potent and selective inhibitor for vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT). 
PMC4208647	A23187		ENA	ATP uptake was measured after 5 min in the absence or presence of 0.1 mmol/L glyoxylate. 	(D) Dose dependence of ATP release initiated by A23187 at 5 μmol/L on glyoxylate concentration in MEG‐01 cells. 	
PMC4208930	Q9QIX6	Results	UniProt	The structure of NS2 protein has been modeled previously and in this model amino acids from 27 to 49 formed trans-membrane α helix (TMH-2).43 Results of modeling show that this rare codon cluster is located in this trans-membrane α helix (TMH-2). Figure 3 shows the modeled NS2 and the position of rare codon clusters. 	For NS3 protein, Sherlocc program identified TrEMBL entries Q9QIX6_9HEPC.The NS3 protein has 631 residue and three rare codon clusters found in polyproteins extending from amino acids 1062-1069, 1096-1100 and 1132-1136. NS3 is a multifunctional protein and the N-terminal domain (residues 1027–1119) contains eight β strands rather than six, including one strand contributed by NS4A.44 This array of b strands gives rise to a b sheet that superimposes with most of the distorted barrel found in the N-terminus of chymotrypsin.45 Result of modeling showed that these three rare codon clusters lie between strands A1-B1, E1-F and A2-B2 in N-terminal domain of NS3. Figure 4 shows the modeled NS3 and the position of rare codon clusters. 	As mentioned, HCVpro database for NS5A detected three Pfams. For Pf01506 ID this database did not identify any rare codon cluster while for Pf08300 and Pf08301 IDs two rare codon clusters were identified.

PMC4208930	PF09251	Discussion	Pfam	The preliminary goal of this study was to perform a survey of rare codon clusters in the HCV genome and then identify the location of these clusters in the structure of HCV protein. 	Previous studies on the distribution of rare codons clusters were performed on a limited number of proteins or protein families.2 The Sherlocc program and the online Sherlocc Finder Interface are efficient tools that can be used to study the widespread translational pauses in protein families.2 Please note that clusters identified by Sherlocc were compared with cases foundin the literature.2 For example, in the Salmonella phage P22 tail spike protein in which rare codons were previously identified using the MinMax algorithm,15 Sherlocc also identified rare codon clusters in the Salmonella phage P22 tail-spike protein family (PF09251).2 Another case involved the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) protein for which rare codon clusters were identified computationally in a multi-organism sequence alignment of this protein.42 The Sherlocc program also identified rare codon clusters in the CAT protein family (PF00302). 	In the present study, we used Sherlocc program to analyze rare codon clusters in HCV genome and the structure of HCV proteins. The results were interesting and showed that HCV has five rare codon clusters and these rare codon clusters may play an essential role in ensuring proper folding of the protein chain.

PMC4337061	DAA64469	Results	ENA	After identifying the 956 co-upregulated (Figure 4B) and 734 co-downregulated genes (Figure 4A) in the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 together with the differentially regulated genes (36 DEGs) of the TO-VS-IFN versus TO-VS-SAV3 shown in Figure 4C, we manually narrowed the scope of DEGs to 60 genes induced by type I IFNs in both the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 groups in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN treatment and SAV-3 infection in TO-cells from the 60 selected genes obtained from the entire transcriptome. 	And as such, we identified 16 genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway (Table 3), 22 genes belonging to different antiviral effector families (Table 4), 12 genes associated with adaptive immune responses (Table 5) and 10 apoptosis associated genes (Table 6) as shown below.Table 3 Repertoire of genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway  Family  Gene name  Abbr  Gene ID

PMC4337061	ACI68449	Results	ENA	After identifying the 956 co-upregulated (Figure 4B) and 734 co-downregulated genes (Figure 4A) in the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 together with the differentially regulated genes (36 DEGs) of the TO-VS-IFN versus TO-VS-SAV3 shown in Figure 4C, we manually narrowed the scope of DEGs to 60 genes induced by type I IFNs in both the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 groups in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN treatment and SAV-3 infection in TO-cells from the 60 selected genes obtained from the entire transcriptome. 	And as such, we identified 16 genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway (Table 3), 22 genes belonging to different antiviral effector families (Table 4), 12 genes associated with adaptive immune responses (Table 5) and 10 apoptosis associated genes (Table 6) as shown below.Table 3 Repertoire of genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway  Family  Gene name  Abbr  Gene ID

PMC4479853	rs1420101	Introduction	RefSNP	SNPs associated with childhood asthma could be consistently linked to transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.13 The second asthma GWAS analyzed sequence variants affecting blood eosinophil counts in Icelanders, and the ten most significant SNPs were further studied in 12118 Europeans and 5212 East Asians including Koreans. 	While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

Complementary Raman spectra are also provided. Time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data have been measured from ∼90 mol% deuterated isotopologues of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O at 295 K to a resolution of sin (θ)/λ = 0.77 Å−1. 
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	Since the incoherent neutron scattering cross section of 1H is large (80.3 barns) it is usual to prepare perdeuterated specimens whenever possible (the incoherent cross section of 2D being only 2.1 barns) as this optimises the coherent Bragg scattering signal above the background, reducing the counting times required for a high-precision structure refinement from many days to a matter of hours on the instrument used for these measurements. 	These data were therefore measured using Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O samples. 	The occurrence of polyhydrated forms of both Na2MoO4 and Na2WO4 suggests that both would be excellent candidates for the formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes with water-soluble organics, such as amino acids, producing metal-organic crystals with potentially useful optical properties (cf., glycine lithium molybdate; Fleck et al., 2006 ▸). High-pressure polymorphs of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O are indicated from Raman scattering studies (Luz-Lima et al., 2010 ▸; Saraiva et al., 2013 ▸). 
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	The clusters corner-share via O6 to create a ‘slab’ parallel to (010) (Fig. 2 ▸ b). 	The mean Na—O bond lengths are statistically identical in Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O being ∼1.6% longer in the NaO6 octa­hedra and ∼2.3% shorter in the NaO5 polyhedra than Na—O bonds in the anhydrous crystals (Fortes, 2015 ▸). 	The agreement in Na—O bond lengths with the X-ray single crystal studies of Capitelli et al. (2006 ▸) and Farrugia (2007 ▸) is very good. Overall, the agreement in bond lengths and angles for the two independently refined data sets is excellent (Tables 1 ▸ and 2 ▸). 
PMC4518980	2D2O		PDBe	Presumably the error in Farrugia’s analysis arose due to the substantial absorption correction required (μ = 18.7 mm−1) for an accurate structure refinement from X-ray single-crystal data. 	Raman spectra of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2MoO4·2D2O were first reported by Mahadevan Pillai et al. (1997 ▸); subsequently, Luz-Lima et al. (2010 ▸) and Saraiva et al. (2013 ▸) published the Raman spectra of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O as a function of temperature (13–300 K) and as a function of hydro­static pressure (to 5 GPa). 	Both compounds exhibit evidence of a ‘conformational change’ on cooling through 120 K: the molybdate appears to undergo two high-pressure phase transitions, one at 3 GPa and the second at 4 GPa; the tungstate apparently undergoes a high-pressure phase transition at 3.9 GPa. The Raman spectra reported here (Figs. 
PMC4518980	2D2O		PDBe	Raman spectra were acquired with a B&WTek i-Raman plus portable spectrometer; this device uses a 532 nm laser (37 mW power at the fiber-optic probe tip) to stimulate Raman scattering, which is measured in the range 170–4000 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 3 cm−1. 	Data were collected for 600 sec at 17 mW for Na2MoO4·2H2O (as bought), 180 sec at 37 mW for Na2MoO4·2D2O, 300 sec at 17 mW for Na2WO4·2H2O (as bought) and 220 sec at 37 mW for Na2WO4·2D2O; after summation, the background was removed and peaks fitted using Pseudo-Voigt functions in OriginPro (OriginLab, Northampton MA). 	These data are provided as an electronic supplement in the form of an ASCII file. Small qu­anti­ties of ordinary hydrogen were found to be present in both specimens, the proportion being determined by the ratio of the areas under the ν 1/ν 3 (H2O) bands after normalisation relative to the height of the strong ν 1 (XO4 2−) band.

The two-dimensional interaction heat map, epigenomic signals, RNA expression, DNA repeats and reference genes are shown. Arrow indicates the boundary position between two TADs. 
PMC4551926	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	There exist different kinds of structural changes across cell lines, which can be captured by interaction blocks and corresponding AP values. 	Figure 3 illustrates that TAD can undergo block split when comparing human cell lines GM12878-I with IMR90-I. 	Intuitively, the statistically significant chromatin interactions in cell line GM12878-I are more dispersedly distributed compared with those in cell line IMR90-I, which is accurately captured by interaction blocks and the parameter AP. Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90.

Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90. Consistently, the increase of active epigenomic and transcription signals (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36mes, RNAPII and RNASeq) validates the increased transcription activity in cell line IMR90-I (Figure 3). 
PMC4551926	GM12878	Results	IGSR/1000 Genomes	The similar situations can be observed in traditional Hi-C data sets (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12). 	Structural rearrangement across human cell lines GM12878-I and IMR90-I. 	The TAD region and bidirectional extensions (Chr2: 175,410,000-176,195,000) are shown, including interaction heat maps at 5 kb resolution, clustered interaction blocks, epigeomic signals, RNA expression, DNA repeats and reference genes.

Furthermore, homozygous ALDH1A3 missense and nonsense mutations in humans have been linked to anophthalmia and microphthalmia (MIM: 615113; A/M) with some affected individuals also exhibiting autistic traits [18–23]. 	Though no clear evidence supports a link between variants in ALDH1A3 with autism, mouse studies show that lack of Aldh1a3 (Gene NC_000073.6) results in abnormal GABAergic neuronal differentiation in the forebrain basal ganglia [24]. Malfunctions in this inhibitory system have been found to be associated to mental disorders like ASD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [25,26]. 
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	OMIM	This overexpression has also been reported in ASD children [32]. 	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs).

Homology analyses were performed using the BLAST program.41 To identify contigs likely originating from other sources than the sweet cherry mRNA, the high abundance contigs (Group 1) were aligned against Prunus persica chloroplast (NCBI RefSeq NC_014697.1), mitochondrial (NCBI RefSeq release 51, directory: mitochondrion), ribosomal RNA (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/rRNA/rRNA.tar), plant pathogen (ftp://ftp.plantbiology.msu.edu/pub/data/CPGR/all.plant_pathogen.wgs_and_complete_genome.fasta.gz), yeast (http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64-1-1_20110203.tgz) and viral (NCBI RefSeq release 51, directory: viral) sequences.

PMC4591669	P50694	Results	UniProt	The most abundant contig by far was Pa_24402 with a FPKM sum of 523 781 over the 24 samples, or 4.2 million mapped reads total. 	Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. 
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	InterPro	The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. 	The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase MdPL1 in growing apple.72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. 	Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 
PMC4591669	BG319625	Results	ENA	The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 	Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry (PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry.73 	In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Table S4).

The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein, PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit.29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572. 	The best BG2 hit of Pa_14044 was the putative aminoacrylate hydrolase RutD from Vitis vinifera, while the contig is also the best sweet cherry hit of the Arabidopsis protein BODYGUARD (BDG) (e-value 10×10−169, 61% amino-acid identity), an extracellular α/β superfamily hydrolase essential for cuticle formation.74 Pa_14044 was the only contig in the assembled sweet cherry fruit transcriptome to contain the multi domain PLN03087, ‘BODYGUARD 1 domain containing hydrolase’ (NCBI conserved domains search75). Contig Pa_04572, with the best B2G hit GDSL esterase/lipase LTL1, was the second best sweet cherry hit (e-value 10−157, 86% similarity) of the tomato CD1 protein, a GDSL lipase and putative cutin polymerase in tomato fruit epidermis.76,77 However, the best hit of tomato CD1 was Pa_16669 (e-value 10−159, 86% similarity), a member of cluster NG1-QT36 (Supplementary Fig. S3a).

PMC4591669	IPR012392	Results	InterPro	Exocarp-specific contigs with probable relevance for wax biosynthesis included Pa_00478 (best hit WAX2, or CER1), Pa_06166 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) and the Top 40 contig Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid-transfer protein, allergen Pru av 3) in cluster NG1-QT28, and the unclustered contig Pa_08907 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 19). 	Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. 	Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation. 
PMC4591669	ADY15304	Results	ENA	Pa_06479 is the most highly abundant MYB family transcription factor sequence in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome (total FPKM sum 6415). 	The predicted peptide sequence is identical with GenBank ADY15304.1, defined as R2R3-MYB transcription factor from P. avium, and highly similar (85% similarity) with PavMYB10, another previously identified R2R3 MYB factor sequence from sweet cherry.88 PavMYB10 was identified as a main positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the sweet cherry fruit.88,89 Consistent with such a function, the abundance of Pa_06479 increased with reddening of the fruit (Supplementary Fig. S3b and Figure 1a and 1c). 	The differences between the predicted amino acid sequences of Pa_06479 and PavMYB10 are similar to the differences in varying amino-acid residues among the MYB10 protein sequences from several rosaceous species.88 Cluster NG4-QT67, with centroid expression level elevated from 38 DAFB to maturity and an expression peak 66 DAFB, contains a putative pectate lyase, Pa_14097. 
PMC4591669	AY376878	Results	ENA	With Pa_06731 (NG1-QT43), it is the most abundant pectate lyase transcript in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome. 	It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY37687814) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase PcPEL1 from sour cherry73 (best hit of PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). 	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF.

Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage.90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB. 
PMC4592530	NCT00274742	Methods	NCT	Simulation parameters were based on data from clinical trials and in vitro studies in human hepatocytes (Table 2). 	Time–concentration IL-6 profiles from patients with NHL receiving blinatumomab (Study MT103-104; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00274742) were used. 	IL-6 parameters for CYP enzyme suppression such as Emin and EC50 were taken from in vitro data (median values) from Dickmann et al.18 Default values supplied by the Simcyp library were adopted for some parameters: the mean degradation constant (kdeg) values for CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9 in the liver were 0.0193, 0.0183, and 0.0067 h−1, respectively; the mean kdeg value in the intestine for both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 was 0.03 h−1.20 CYP1A2 activity in the intestine was not considered because it is not expressed in that tissue.21 It was assumed that the magnitude of IL-6 suppression for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the intestine was the same as that in the liver.15,22 In addition, within the Simcyp simulator, it was assumed that IL-6 suppresses the rate of synthesis of CYP450 enzymes in the liver according to the following equation,15 in which [Enzyme]t is the amount of active CYP enzyme at any given time in the liver; [Enzyme]0 is the basal amount of CYP enzyme in the liver; [Enzyme]t = [Enzyme]0 at t = 0; Emin is the minimum CYP enzyme activity (i.e., the maximum suppression) expressed as a fraction of vehicle control; EC50 is the concentration that results in 50% of Emin (i.e., half of the maximum suppressive effect); [I]t is the perpetrator (IL-6) concentration at time t; and kdeg is the degradation rate of each respective CYP enzyme in the liver:  
PMC4592530	NCT00274742		NCT	Magnitude and duration of transient cytokine elevation 	Dose-dependent increases in peak cytokine levels were demonstrated in studies of blinatumomab in patients with NHL and ALL.4,10 Doses administered to patients with ALL ranged from 5–30 μg/m2/day24; higher doses (up to 90 μg/m2/day) were administered in a dose-escalation study in NHL (Study MT103-104; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00274742).16 	Peak cytokine levels increased with initial blinatumomab dose, reaching a plateau around the 60-μg/m2/day dose (Figure 1a). The cytokine profile of a representative patient is depicted in Figure 1b: cytokine elevation was transient, increasing rapidly after infusion started, peaking at ∼6 hours, and declining to baseline starting at 48 hours, despite ongoing infusion with blinatumomab.

The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003].

PMC4682451	164757	Methods	OMIM	The c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants studied in this manuscript have been submitted to the LOVD database at http://www.lovd.nl/MLH1. 	At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type BRAF (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). 	Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (Fig. 1). Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

PMC4682451	138120	Methods	OMIM	M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. 	The promoter of the HSPA5 (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. 	GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region ≥150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI. 
PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	OMIM	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Introduction	NCT	Results indicated reduced exposure to many potentially harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke following product switching. 	Findings support differences in exposure from the use of various tobacco products and are relevant to the understanding of a risk continuum among tobacco products (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917). 	
PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Introduction	NCT	Additionally, these biomarkers account for variations in smoking behaviors among consumers (e.g. puff number, puff volume, puff frequency), unlike the easily quantified and standardized machine-generated mainstream smoke constituent yields (Borgerding & Klus, 2005). 	A randomized, multi-center study of adult cigarette smokers switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus or ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917) (Ogden et al., 2015b). 	Subjects’ experience with the randomized product was followed for 24 weeks. A group of never smokers was included for baseline comparisons.

Additional protocol details are available at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01994746). 	The Institutional Review Board of each participating institution approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. Enrolled participants underwent two glucagon dosing visits, scheduled 1–4 weeks apart.

PMC4724163	KT594769	Results	ENA	The genome of MaHV-1 is the first metatherian herpesvirus to be sequenced. 	Excluding the genomic termini, which remained unresolved, the final genome length of MaHV-1 was approximately 140.1 kbp (Fig. 1) [GenBank:KT594769], larger than previously predicted. 	This difference appears to be due to a larger than predicted inverted repeat region [15]. This included a 98.8 kbp UL region and a 15.3 kbp US region flanked by 13 kbp inverted repeat sequences (IRS/TRS). 
PMC4724163	BAP00706	Results	UniProt	Comparison of other viral core genes yielded similar clustering patterns. 	Comparison of the MaHV-1 UL27 and UL30 ORFs with those of the recently sequenced fruit bat herpesvirus 1 (FbHV-1) [GenBank:BAP00706 and GenBank:YP_009042092; UL27 and UL30, respectively] showed that these ORFs shared 71 and 67 % pairwise aa identity, respectively (83 and 78 % aa similarity). 	This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials. Sequencing of herpesviruses from other metatherians, as well as other Australasian mammals, will be needed to determine the significance of this clustering.Table 1Predicted open reading frames (ORFs) identified in different structural regions of the Macropodid herpesvirus 1 genome and percentage pairwise amino acid identity to ORFs in related alphaherpesviruses% aa pairwise identity# ORFLength (nt)Length (aa)Description (putative) § MaHV2MaHV4HHV1HHV2Unique short region US11392463Infected cell protein 22; ICP222935 US2867288Tegument protein4949 US31449482Protein kinase5659 US4360119Glycoprotein G; predicted non-functional59633235 US61188395Glycoprotein D745657 US71392463Glycoprotein I583839 US81599532Glycoprotein E633432 PW2342113Unique hypothetical PW3582193Unique hypothetical PW41023340Unique hypothetical PW51233410Unique hypotheticalInverted repeat region PW1453150Unique hypothetical ICP437081235Infected cell protein 4; ICP45150 TS951316Thymidylate synthase; host-derived ICP34.5900299Infected cell protein 34.5; ICP34.56256 ICP01629542Infected cell protein 0; ICP05051Unique long region UL1579192Glycoprotein L4147 UL2906301Uracil-DNA glycosylase5960 UL52601866Helicase-primase helicase subunit7373 UL62007668Capsid portal protein6263 UL7888295Tegument protein5149 UL82253750Helicase-primase subunit3839 UL92616871DNA replication origin-binding helicase7070 UL101347448Glycoprotein M5148 UL1124681Myristoylated tegument protein4559 UL121749582Alkaline exonuclease; deoxyribonuclease5656 UL131845614Tegument serine/threonine protein kinase4847 UL14645214Tegument protein6063 UL152100699DNA packaging terminase subunit 17071 UL161098365Tegument protein5154 UL172184727DNA packaging tegument protein5150 UL18951316Capsid triplex subunit 26868 UL1941311376Major capsid protein6970 UL20648215Envelope protein4543 UL211596531Tegument protein4343 UL222631876Glycoprotein H4545 UL231062353Thymidine kinase764244 UL24702233Nuclear protein5253 UL251740579DNA packaging tegument protein6161 UL261761586Capsid maturation protease5352 UL272664887Glycoprotein B83827270 UL282325774DNA packaging terminase subunit 26463 UL2935791192ICP8; single stranded binding protein7069 UL3036751224DNA polymerase6666 UL31921306Nuclear egress lamina protein7372 UL321731576DNA packaging protein6261 UL33390129DNA packaging protein6160 UL34837278Nuclear egress membrane protein4443 UL35408135Small capsid protein5350 UL3685352844Large tegument protein4848 UL3731501049Tegument protein4645 UL381359452VP19C; capsid triplex subunit 15656 UL392916971Ribonucleotide reductase subunit 16566 UL40990329Ribonucleotide reductase subunit 26565 UL411566521Tegument host shutoff protein6061 UL421422473DNA polymerase processivity subunit4444 UL441296431Glycoprotein C3634 UL45516171Membrane protein4240 UL462343780VP11/12; tegument protein4949 UL472133710VP13/14; tegument protein4342 UL481497498VP16; transactivating tegument protein4747 UL49777258VP22; tegument protein6767 UL49A324107Glycoprotein N32 UL501035344Deoxyuridine triphosphatase3935 UL51741246Tegument protein6766 UL5231021033Helicase primase subunit5958 UL531023340Glycoprotein K4647 UL541524507ICP27; multifunctional expression regulator5252 UL55540179Nuclear protein4036 PW6630209Unique hypothetical §Putative function of encoded polypeptides in MaHV-1 #amino acid identities with homologues in Human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV1 and HHV2) and Macropodid herpesviruses 2 and 4 (MaHV2 and MaHV4)Fig. 2The relationship between macropodid herpesvirus 1 (MaHV1) and other viruses from the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily.

PMC4724163	SRP067309	Methods	ENA	Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina, Inc.) in paired-end 150 bp format. 	Over 350 Mbp of sequence data were obtained from 2.69 million paired reads with a mean length of 137 bp (standard deviation of 26.3) and were submitted to the Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP067309]. 	Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and de novo assembly was performed using medium-low default sensitivity settings on the bioinformatics package Geneious version 6.1.7 [37] (Biomatters Ltd). This yielded four large contigs (52.6 kbp, 37.3 kbp, 14.9 kbp and 17 kbp) with consensus sequences that corresponded to herpesvirus sequence, according to Blastx and Blastn searches of GenBank databases [38, 39].

Medium and high sensitivity default settings with a minimum of 90–95 % overlap identity in Geneious version 6.1.7 were used in these assemblies. Prediction of open reading frames (ORFs) using Glimmer3 was restricted to those larger than 240 bp, and ORF annotations were determined by Blastx and Blastn searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases, respectively [38, 39].

PMC4747093	Q9BX84	Discussion	UniProt	Both basic and pre-clinical studies show that the magnesium flux by TRP magnesium channels is highly related with tumor cell proliferation and cycle, angiogenesis, tumor growth and reprogramming, as well as metastasis [20]. 	The R1122Q mutation occurs at the topological domain of TRPM6 towards the cytoplasm, according to the Uniprot database annotation (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84). 	Thereby, dysfunction of the TRPM6 protein may affect the cation homeostasis leading to the tumor development. Recently, Stephens et al. reported two somatic mutations (p.T1822A and p.A1765T) in the TRPM6 gene from screening 100 breast cancer patients of European ancestry [6]. 
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	A pharmacophore model is a 3D arrangement of physicochemical features (e.g., hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, hydrophobic area, aromatic ring) that represents the key interactions between a ligand molecule and its target protein. 	As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	As indicated, the used search keywords were plant chemistry, plant pharmacology, plant natural product, plant compound, plant drug discovery, plant bioactivity, and the total number of PubMed publications per year was retrieved by search with the symbol *. The trend analysis reveals that the increase of PubMed citations in the target areas is faster than the increase in the total number of annual PubMed citations (indicated by the steeper slopes of the respective trend lines). 	(A) Two molecules of magnolol concomitantly occupying the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) are shown, with the chemical interaction pattern that defines the activity of the molecules depicted. 	Yellow spheres represent hydrophobic interactions, red and green arrows mark hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms. This interaction pattern may be converted into a structure-based pharmacophore model and used for virtual screening. 
PMC4762546	JQ315225	Methods	ENA	Polymerase chain reaction 	Based on cytochrome oxidase subunit I sequences of I. hookeri available in GenBank (JQ315225.1), we designed primers and a Taqman probe for Real-Time PCR to specifically detect I. hookeri: Iphag583f 5′-TTGCTGTTCCAACAGGAGTAAA-3′ and Iphag820r 5′-CAAAAAATTGCAAAAACTGC-3′ and probe Iphag612s 6FAM®-AGATGATAAGCTTCAATAAATGGAA-TAMRA®.

PMC4835854	NCT02217475	Results	NCT	Simultaneous CCR2/5 antagonism abrogates age-related response to injury 	In order to abrogate this response, we treated aged TBI mice with cenicriviroc (CVC), a potent, oral, dual-antagonist of CCR2/5, which is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver fibrosis (NCT02217475). 	Separate cohorts of aged TBI animals were treated with either vehicle or CVC twice daily several hours after injury (Fig. 5a). Using this experimental approach, we observed a significant reduction in the numbers of CD11b+F4/80+CD45hiLy6C+ macrophages (Fig. 5b,c), which are analogous to CCR2+ macrophages, recruited into the diseased brain [12, 28].Fig. 5Dual targeting of CCR2/5 with CVC mitigates TBI-induced macrophage recruitment. a In WT mice, CVC or vehicle was administered BID via oral gavage at 100 mg/kg at 2 and 10 h post surgery before animals were euthanized for various endpoints at 24 h following surgery. b A cohort of WT aged TBI animals (n = 8/group) was used for flow cytometry analysis of macrophage infiltration into the injured brain.

PMC4860839	3NMW	Methods	PDBe	Crystals of the APC–ARM/Amer1-A1 complex belonged to the P212121 space group, with one set of the complex in each asymmetric unit. 	The structure was determined at 1.90 Å by the method of molecular replacement with the CCP4 program Phaser [37], using the structure of APC–ARM by itself (PDB code: 3NMW) [10] as the searching model. 	After model-building by Coot [38] and refinement by the CCP4 program REFMAC [39, 40], the final model has an R/R free factor of 18.06%/22.13%. In the Ramachandran plot, 99.4 and 0.6% of residues are in the most favored and allowed regions, respectively. 
PMC4920148	135100	Introduction	OMIM	INTRODUCTION 	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. 	The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously.

PMC4961654	137215	Introduction	OMIM	Most of GC cases are sporadic and hereditary cases account for only 1–3 % of GCs, this includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (Monahan and Hopkins 2016). 	HDGC (OMIM #137215) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. 	Between 25 and 30 % of cases of HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). This gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007).

The averages and standard deviations of computation time of the tested methods for SRR407548, SRS011098, and ERR315856 are shown in Table 4. 	GHOSTZ-GPU with 1 GPU was approximately 3.0–4.1, 3.1–3.9, 12.1–19.0, and 0.9–2.0 times faster than GHOSTZ (original), GHOSTZ (+ loading database thread), RAPSearch, and DIAMOND (sensitive) with 12 CPU threads, respectively.

GHOSTZ-GPU with 3 GPUs was slower than RAPSearch (fast) with 12 CPU threads on ERR315856 and slower than DIAMOND (fast) with 12 CPU threads on all the data. 	Nevertheless, the sensitivity of RAPSearch (fast) and DIAMOND (fast) was clearly worse than that of GHOSTZ-GPU. Thus, GHOSTZ-GPU shows the best performance when high sensitivity is required. 
PMC4970815	SRR407548		ENA	We ran GHOSTZ-GPU with and without each optimization. 	We used 1,000,000 randomly selected short DNA reads from SRR407548 against the KEGG GENES database. 	The acceleration ratios with these optimizations relative to GHOSTZ without the thread for loading a database are shown in Table 5. Each optimization was found to accelerate GHOSTZ-GPU. 
PMC4970815	SRR407548		ENA	On the other hand, a greater amount of memory is required than that for execution of a small number of queries. 	When we used 1,000,000 randomly selected short DNA reads from SRR407548 and the KEGG GENES database, GHOSTZ-GPU required approximately 50 GB of CPU memory for the homology search proper. 	Thus, the memory size of current typical computing systems may be insufficient for GHOSTZ-GPU. For instance, a node in Titan, which is a supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has only 32 GB of memory. 
PMC4996994	LN885567	Methods	ENA	At least 55 isolates were randomly selected for each of the 12 conditions [i.e., 4 soils × (2 cultivars and bulk soil)] and all colonies were purified three times successively, giving a total of 698 isolates. 	Genomic DNA was extracted for all isolates using NucleoSpin® 96 Tissue kits (Ref - 740454.4; Macherey Nagel, Germany) and identification performed by sequencing the housekeeping gene rpoD (accession numbers LN885567 to LN886065, EMBL-EBI database) using primers rpoDf/rpoDr targeting the rpoD alleles of bacteria from the P. fluorescens group (Frapolli et al., 2007). 	When rpoD amplification failed, the 16SrRNA encoding rrs gene was amplified with pA/pH (Edwards et al., 1989) and sequenced (accession numbers: LN885368 to LN885566, EMBL-EBI database). rpoD sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004).

PMC5035930	rs76726265	Results	RefSNP	These data demonstrate that compound heterozygosity for the mutations led to a significant loss of IFT81, more than could be accounted for by presence of one null allele, suggesting that the missense mutation destabilized IFT81. 	In addition to the IFT81 mutations, the exome sequence analysis in R98-443A identified heterozygosity for a known TTC21B variant (c.2600G > A; p.Arg867His; rs76726265). 	Because TTC21B mutations have shown to cause ATD, and this variant was predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen with Bayes probability of 0.999 by the MutationTaster algorithm), mRNA and protein levels were characterized by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis respectively.

PMC5070816	AFW98990	Discussion	ENA	A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. 	The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. 	Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].

PMC5296949	NCT01692756	Conclusion	NCT	Corticosteroids have previously been demonstrated to reduce early OA changes such as osteophyte formation and cartilage lesion in a canine OA model [54] and to reduce cartilage degradation when administered early after anterior cruciate ligament injury in a porcine model [55]; however, they do not entirely halt disease progression. 	Clinical trials are currently underway to examine the effect of intra-articular administration of a synthetic glucocorticoid on pain, joint function, inflammation, and cartilage degradation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01692756). 	Anti-cytokine, anti-MMP therapies, and anti-S100A8/A9 therapies are promising candidates for new disease-modifying OA drugs. However, preventing the expression and/or release of degradative mediators rather than inhibiting their activity may prove more efficient.

PMC5393379	NC_007782	Methods	RefSeq	Conversely, Gastropoda were constrained as a monophylum, so that at least some possible artifacts, due to long-branch attraction (LBA) with the 5 outgroup taxa, are avoided. 	Moreover, the mtDNA of Lottia digitalis (GenBank Accession Number NC_007782) turned out to be very fast-evolving and very prone to create LBA artifacts, therefore this taxon was excluded from the study, thus lowering the number of ingroups to 109. 	Being Lottia the only known representative of the clade with a published complete mtDNA, unfortunately this also led to the exclusion of the whole Patellogastropoda from our analysis. The ML analysis was extensively described elsewhere (see, in particular, see supplementary Additional file S4, Supplementary Material online of Plazzi et al. 2016).

PMC5428514	GSE65194	Introduction	GEO	The identification of molecular genetic abnormalities in breast cancer is important to improve the results of treatment. 	In the present study, we analyzed microarray data of breast cancer expression profiling (NCBI GEO database, accession GSE65194), focusing on Na +/K +-ATPase coding genes. 	We found overexpression of the ATP1A1 and down-regulation of the ATP1A2. We expect that our research could help to improve the understanding of predictive and prognostic features of breast cancer. 
PMC5428514	GSE65194	Introduction	GEO	Both down- and up-regulation of alpha- and beta- subunits were shown in solid tumors of different origin 14– 19. 	In the present study, we analyzed public breast cancer expression profiles made using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (NCBI GEO database 20, accession GSE65194) for the expression of alpha subunits of NKA. 	We found abnormalities in ATP1A1 (coding α1-subunit) and ATP1A2 (coding α2-subunit) expression ( Table 1) in breast cancer samples relative to their expression in normal breast tissue. ATP1A1 was overexpressed approximately 1.5 times in all groups of breast cancer samples (p<0.05). Coincidently, ATP1A2 expression decreased by more than 2 times (p<0.05).

PMC5449478	SRP080654	Methods	ENA	In our study, the FDR < 0.05 and fold change > 2 were used as significance cut-offs of the gene expression differences. 	Sequencing data were deposited to the Short Read Archive (SRA) database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the accession number SRP080654. 	Further, the DEGs were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses according to Zhang et al. (2013). GO terms with corrected P-value < 0.05 and KEGG pathways with P-value < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differential expressed genes.

PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	In the present study of patients with established CAD, we investigated the association between 45 lead SNPs from loci associated with CAD and five common biochemical markers of inflammation. 	The main findings were; 1) for SNP rs2075650 in the TOMM40, APOE locus, the established CAD-risk allele was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP levels, 2) No other CAD-related SNPs were associated with the inflammatory marker levels, either measured as individual SNPs or when combined into a GRS. 	Previous GWASs have demonstrated a robust association between the rs2075650 G-allele and an increased risk of CAD [11]. In a recent study based on the present cohort, subanalysis also confirmed an association between rs2075650 and recurrent CAD events showing that an increase in the number of CAD risk alleles was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–1.97) of the primary endpoint composed of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stable coronary revascularization [19].

However, our findings are consistent with results from several previous large population-based cohort studies. In these studies, the same inverse relationship between the CAD risk allele and lower levels of hs-CRP has also been observed in European Americans [21], Australian twin families [22], Asians [23], and Hispanics [21] but not Afro-Americans [21]. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Discussion	RefSNP	The mechanistic explanation for this inverse association is currently unknown. 	The marker rs2075650 is located in the TOMM40 gene, just upstream of APOE, and APOC1. 	The CAD risk allele (G) has been associated with a range of other phenotypes including reduced longevity [24], reduced BMI [25], increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [22,26], and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease [27]. Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene.

Because of the relatively strong linkage disequilibrium in the TOMM40/APOE locus, it has been suggested that the G-allele at rs2075650 is in fact tagging causal variation in the APOE gene. 	The APOE encodes the apolipoprotein E with three different isoforms (ε2, ε3, and ε4 defined by the combination of rs7412 and rs429358. Northwestern European ancestry (CEU): r2 = 0.02 and r2 = 0.20 with rs2075650, respectively), of which the ε4 isoform has long been known to associate with LDL-C, Alzheimer’s disease, and hs-CRP [28,29].

However, recent data suggest that the TOMM40/APOE locus is genetically complex [30], and therefore it is plausible that the G-allele is tagging different underlying causal variants with different effects on CAD risk and hs-CRP, a concept supported by Middleberg et al [22]. This would also be in line with the current understanding that hs-CRP is not causally related to cardiovascular risk [31]. 
PMC5501546	rs4129267	Conclusion	RefSNP	Some previous GWASs have explored the association between CAD-associated risk variants and common inflammatory markers, of which the IL6R locus has been associated with several. 	In studies of hs-CRP, the IL6R locus (rs4129267) was consistently, though moderately, associated with hs-CRP levels (CEU: r2 = 0.54 with rs4845625) [32–34]. 	Furthermore, IL6R (rs4129267) has been associated with plasma levels of fibrinogen and IL-6 [35–37]. Although we observed a nominal association between the IL6R locus and C3, our study does not support a significant effect of IL6R on the inflammatory response.

PMC5501546	rs2250644	Discussion	RefSNP	Other CAD-associated loci have also emerged in GWASs of inflammatory markers. 	A large study from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology) consortium demonstrated a significant association between fibrinogen and variants near LIPA (rs2250644) and SH2B3 (rs7310615) [36]. 	Although these variants are in perfect linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs genotyped in our study (CEU: r2 = 1.00 for both), we did not find evidence of such association. Other GWASs have also demonstrated weak associations between variants at the AB0 locus (rs657152 and rs8176704; CEU: r2 = 0.46 and r2 = 0.02 with rs495828) and IL-6 [34,37], and a Chinese GWAS of C3 found an association with rs11575839 close to HLA-C (CEU: r2 = 0.02 with rs3869109) [38].

PMC5501546	rs1561198	Discussion	RefSNP	To our knowledge, the present study is the first to explore the association between calprotectin and CAD-associated risk variants. 	Although none of the CAD-associated variants significantly affected calprotectin levels, a trend was observed for rs1561198. 	This SNP is located between the VAMP5 and VAMP8 genes, whose products are involved in different aspects of vesicle trafficking including cytokine release and phagocytosis [43]. Hence, a link between this locus and calprotectin levels may plausibly exist. 
PMC5501546	rs2075650	Conclusion	RefSNP	Conclusion 	In the present study, a common CAD-associated variant at the TOMM40/APOE locus (rs2075650) was significantly associated with lower levels of hs-CRP in patients with stable CAD. 	Future studies using deep sequencing of the TOMM40/APOE locus in large clinical samples are warranted to determine if rs2075650 is truly causing opposite allelic effects on CAD and hs-CRP, or if the opposite association is explained by underlying linkage disequilibrium with several hidden functional variants of which some affect the development of CAD independent of hs-CRP. None of the remaining variants, both assessed independently or combined as a GRS, were associated with hs-CRP, IL-6, calprotectin, fibrinogen, or C3.

Our findings may suggest that the effect of these CAD-loci on CAD development does not act through pathways significantly affecting these commonly used inflammatory biomarkers.

PMC5520553	rs776746		RefSNP	Therefore, the identification of markers to facilitate individualized tacrolimus therapy, especially in patients with HCC undergoing transplantation, is imperative. 	Tacrolimus is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A isoenzymes.[7] A cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) gene variation involving an A-to-G transition at position rs776746 within intron 3 was significantly associated with CYP3A5 expression. 	Tacrolimus is poorly metabolized in CYP3A5 rs776746 GG carriers.[8] However, the effects of CYP3A5 rs776746 do not explain the total individual differences in tacrolimus metabolism. Therefore, additional markers can play a role in individual variation.

Therefore, additional markers can play a role in individual variation. The complement system affects liver function and process of liver cirrhosis and eliminates virus-infected and cancer cells as well.[910] The sixth component of the complement system (C6) is involved in the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC) with other components (C5–C9) following activation of the complement cascade.[11] The MAC was reported to mediate transplant rejection, C6 is an acute phase protein, which was studied in a rat heart transplantation model.[12] Interestingly, we demonstrated that patients with C6 rs9200 GA presented with HCC recurrence following OLT.[13] However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has yet found the association between C6 gene polymorphisms and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.

Therefore, we initially hypothesized that C6 gene polymorphisms might regulate MAC function and mediate tacrolimus metabolism. This study was to investigate the association between tacrolimus metabolism and C6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large cohort of patients undergoing OLT for HCC and to evaluate the possible role of tacrolimus as an immunotherapeutic intervention tailored to individual patients during early postoperative period.

PMC5520553	rs776746	Discussion	RefSNP	In the current study, researchers investigated the associations of CYP3A5, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-18 genetic polymorphisms with tacrolimus metabolism.[456] Based on our findings, we propose the existence of a gene interaction network that affects tacrolimus pharmacogenomics in patients with HCC after OLT. 	Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the CYP system. CYP3A5 rs776746 allele A noncarriers produce a truncated, nonfunctional CYP3A5 enzyme due to a splicing defect; therefore, these noncarrier patients metabolize tacrolimus more slowly than carriers.[8] In the current study, the CYP3A5 rs776746 genotype in donors altered tacrolimus C/D ratios during the 4-week posttransplantation, which was consistent with earlier studies.[17] In contrast, in this study, the recipient CYP3A5 rs776746 genotype was found to influence tacrolimus levels only at weeks 1, which was consistent with a recent meta-analysis and systematic review.[18] In the final combination analysis, an additional Kruskal-Wallis test including CYP3A5 polymorphisms alone revealed significantly lower tacrolimus C/D ratios in patients with rapid-metabolizing genotypes at 4-week posttransplantation (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, P = 0.007, and P = 0.001, respectively, data not shown). 	Thus, we hypothesized that CYP3A5 rs776746 polymorphisms play a key role in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics although donor CYP3A5 polymorphisms have a more significant influence.[19] A limited number of clinical markers have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.[20] However, these markers or genetic polymorphisms do not account for all the observed variations. Interestingly, in this study, variations in tacrolimus C/D ratios among individual patients were partially correlated with C6 polymorphisms.

This sequence information was analyzed to determine regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a species or between different species can show either similarities between protein functions or relations between species. 
PMC5523526	Q5U9N0	Conclusion	UniProt	Homology modeling 	CCPI (Uniprot: Q5U9N0) was modeled using ab initio protocol of the I-TASSER.[34] Subsequently, five models were generated and assessed on the basis of RMSD and TM-score. 	This online server theoretically measures various physicochemical parameters such as molecular mass. The overall quality factor score of CCPI was predicted by ERRAT (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/ERRAT/). 
PMC5523526	Q5U9N0	Conclusion	UniProt	Sequence and structure determination 	The CCPI sequence obtained from http://www.uniprot.org/ (Uniprot: Q5U9N0) has 176 amino acid sequences;first 1–19 are the signal peptide shown in red and 20–176 are chain [Figure 4a]. 	The molecular mass of C. cajan was 19.97 kDa with isoelectric point 9.54.[41] Procheck showed that 77.6% of the residues were in the allowed region of Ramachandran plot.

The CCPI sequence (Uniprot: Q5U9N0) was analyzed and showed that it had 176 amino acid sequences;first 1–19 were signal peptides and rest were chain. 	The 3D structure created elucidated the presence of 3 beta-sheets, 3 beta-hairpins, 2 β-bulges, 6 strands, 3 helices, 1 helix–helix interaction, 41 β-turns, and 27 γ-turns.

PMC5539595	KT716847	Discussion	ENA	Recurrently identified in our population, subtype IIdA17G1, was reported to be the cause of an outbreak in Finland in 2012, with more than 250 individuals involved and it was associated with consumption of fries and salads (Cacciò and Chalmers, 2016), whereas subtype IIdA18G1 has been widely identified in Europe (e.g., Czech Republic, Spain) and in the Middle East (e.g., Turkey, Iran, Kuwait, etc.). 	Less frequently observed, subtype IIdA19G2 has been detected in France as a foodborne etiological agent (GenBank number KT716847.1), IIdA14G1 in Spain (Plutzer and Karanis, 2009), and IIdA16G1 in Egypt and Tunisia (Rahmouni et al., 2014). C. meleagridis, mainly isolated from poultry and birds, has been frequently observed in Africa (Aldeyarbi et al., 2016) as well as within mixed cryptosporidium infections (Ng-Hublin et al., 2013). 	Although, as stated earlier, Qatari children have limited contact with wildlife, such animal subtypes may infect them indirectly through housemaids who themselves may have been exposed to animals back home and/or through their presence in the food supply via remnants of fertilizers of animal origin on salad crops.

PMC5589870	APG79361	Results	ENA	Figure 2). 	Bronnoya virus was the most divergent virus found in our study, exhibiting only 28% amino acid identity to the most similar published virus sequence – Hubei orthoptera virus 2 (APG79361.1) – and tentatively positioned between the Phleboviruses and Hantaviruses (Fig. 2, Suppl.

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Results	RefSNP	We aimed to investigate whether genetic variations in glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor are associated with responses to DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes. 	Genetic variations of rs3765467 in GLP-1 receptor were explored in 246 patients with type 2 diabetes who received DPP-4 inhibitors treatment for 24 weeks in addition to previous medication. 	Patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) > 7% and who were naive to any DPP-4 inhibitors were enrolled. Responders were defined as those who showed a > 10% reduction in HbA1c after DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	A number of studies have reported on associations between specific genetic variations and glycemic responses obtained with antidiabetic medications.[6–9] Genetic mutation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ2 was shown to affect responses to rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[6] However, DPP-4 inhibitors, to which responses by T2DM patients vary, the genetic factors are not fully understood.[10] A 52-week treatment with DPP-4 inhibitor as add-on therapy in Korean population showed that DPP-4 inhibitor responders had higher basal fasting plasma glucose, with no effect of age on their response rate.[10] This was in contrast to another study that was mainly based on Caucasian population of DPP-4 inhibitor responders characterized older age with mild fasting hyperglycemia.[11] GLP-1 receptors are involved in the DPP-4 inhibitor action mechanism, and GLP-1 responses may help predict the efficacy DPP-4 inhibitors.[12] A recent study reported that DPP-4 inhibitors could activate incretin receptors and influence the gut-to-pancreas neural axis.[2] The efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors might be affected by GLP-1 receptor, in that the altered structure or affinity of GLP-1 receptor could determine the difference in responses to DPP-4 inhibitors. 	Previously, it was reported that the rs3765467 variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene (GLP1R) was associated with insulin secretory response to exogenous GLP-1 in nondiabetic subjects.[13] Therefore, we investigated whether this same variation in GLP1R could affect T2DM patients’ responses to DPP-4 inhibitors.

Given that triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values were not normally distributed, statistical analyses of these values were conducted on log-transformed data.

PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	Many investigators have found the concepts of genetic variation and antidiabetic medication efficacy to be quite attractive. 	For PPAR agonists, polymorphisms of PPAR, adipose tissue, adiponectin, and cholesterol synthesis have all been shown to have an impact on drug potency.[6–8,20,21] Genetic variants in transcription factors have also been shown to influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metformin.[22] Although the correlation between DPP-4 inhibitors and genetic variation is controversial, our study would support such a correlation with the A allele of rs3765467. 	Previously, we reported no significant association between genetic variations in DPP4 itself, and patient responses to DPP-4 inhibitors.[23] On the other hand, an association between interleukin-6 polymorphism and DPP-4 inhibitor response has been reported.[24] Recent preclinical studies have shown association between DPP-4 inhibitors and incretin receptors.[25,26] Since administration of DPP-4 inhibitor to incretin receptor knockout mice did not improve glycemic parameters, these findings suggest the importance of incretin receptor in glucoregulatory actions of DPP-4 inhibitors. Two possible functional mechanisms of genetic effects have been suggested:[27] (1) GLP-1 receptor enhances cAMP signaling, and (2) GLP-1 receptor alters pancreatic β cell apoptosis or proliferation. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	Two possible functional mechanisms of genetic effects have been suggested:[27] (1) GLP-1 receptor enhances cAMP signaling, and (2) GLP-1 receptor alters pancreatic β cell apoptosis or proliferation. 	Several papers reported that variation in GLP1R could regulate intracellular postreceptor signaling.[28–31] Moreover, GLP1R variant is reported to be able to alter receptor binding affinity.[31,32] Rs3765467 is a nonsynonymous mutation in which amino acid arginine is replaced by glutamine at Exon 5 position 131 (R131Q) of the GLP-1 receptor, and it was also reported to be linked with cAMP signaling in oxynotomodulin.[32] A recent human study showed that rs3765467 had a very profound insulinotropic effect in response to infused GLP-1 agonist.[13] Given this point, a GLP1R variation, especially rs3765467, could be a candidate for determining the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors. 	Meanwhile, the degree of DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy could be explained by ethnicity.[33] Compared to non-Asians, Asians exhibit a higher capacity to respond to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment. In a meta-analysis study, lower BMI in Asians, which could be related to insulin sensitivity, was referred to as a primary factor.[33] According to an international database, minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs3765467 is reported to occur in up to 36% of Asians, which is relatively high compared to other ethnicities.[34] In the current study, the MAF was 17.1%.

The relatively high A allele frequency in Asians may account for the better response in these populations. A recent Taiwanese study showed that GLP-1 analog response was not affected by GLP1R variation.[35] The study enrolled 36 patients with poorly controlled hyperglycemia and treated them with a 6-day continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and exenatide, a GLP-1 analogue.

Patients with rs3765467 minor allele genotype showed a significant reduction in the plasma glucose level before adjustment. 	The small sample size might account for the statistical insignificance after adjustment. In contrast, our study showed response rates for GA and GG/GA genotypes of 52.7% and 68.8%, which were comparable to our estimation. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467	Discussion	RefSNP	First, we could not assess insulin sensitivity or pancreatic beta cell function due to a lack of information on C peptides and insulin levels. 	However, a previous study showed that the minor allele of rs3765467 is associated with a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion in response to exogenous GLP-1 infusion.[13] Second, types and dose of DPP-4 inhibitors were not controlled in the study population. 	Despite uncontrolled medication, difference in the types of DPP-4 inhibitor between responder and nonresponder was insignificant. Third, physical activity and dietary changes that could improve hyperglycemia were not evaluated in the current study. 
PMC5591096	rs3765467		RefSNP	In multivariate regression analysis, both GA/AA genotype and an A allele for GLP1R were consistently associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response. 	This suggests that variation in GLP1R (rs3765467) can influence DPP-4 inhibitor efficacy. 	Further studies in a large population are warranted to determine the mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibitor response in GLP1R. Moreover, it would be interesting to identify the genetic differences related to DPP-4 inhibitor response among other ethnic groups.

We report interim results through 3 years of an extension study (NCT00930553) in patients who received alemtuzumab during the core CARE-MS I trial, constituting a total of 5 years of follow-up from CARE-MS I enrollment.

PMC5629772	NCT01699477	Introduction	NCT	In one study, central lateral thalamotomy using MRgFUS in 12 patients suffering from chronic medically-refractory NP reported mean pain relief of 57% at 12 months [42]. 	Further clinical trials are underway to investigate the effects of MRgFUS thalamotomy for neuropathic pain (NCT01699477). 	Obsessive-compulsive disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is among the most challenging and debilitating anxiety disorders, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1.6% [43]. 
PMC5629772	NCT02348411	Introduction	NCT	This single case report demonstrated marked clinical improvement. 	Two clinical trials (NCT02348411, NCT02685488) are currently underway to further define the role of ultrasound in depression. 	Brain tumors The most common brain tumors, metastatic and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have prognoses of 3 [64] and 4 months survival, respectively, if left untreated [65].

PMC5629772	NCT00147056	Introduction	NCT	This complication highlighted the challenges of ablating a large volume and vascular neoplastic tissue as well as greater attention to patients or pathologies with increased risk of hemorrhage. 	Currently phase I trials (NCT01698437, NCT00147056, NCT01473485) are underway with results pending. 	Targets located close to the skull are difficult to thermoablate without unacceptable rise in temperature in bone, scalp, or neighboring neurovascular structures. Recently, two proof of concept animal studies of non-thermal ablation of skull base lesions were reported.

PMC5629772	NCT02343991	Introduction	NCT	In another study, eight treatments of ultrasound delivered NK-95 cells in mice injected with human HER2-expressing breast tumor resulted in an increase in overall survival from approximately 50 to 150 days [29]. 	As the result of compelling preclinical data, a pilot trial is underway to investigate safety and feasibility of ultrasound mediated BBB disruption for patients with high-grade gliomas to deliver TMZ (NCT02343991). 	Alzheimer’s disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than five million people in the United States, and increasing. 
PMC5629772	NCT02986932	Introduction	NCT	The presence of neurofibrillary tangles and hyper-phosphorylated tau are closely correlated with the progression of cognitive deficits in patients with AD. 	An ongoing phase I trial will study the feasibility and safety of BBB opening in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease (NCT02986932).

PMC5731891	NCT02876861	Discussion	NCT	Currently, only a few prospective randomized studies are ongoing for locally advanced UTUC. 	One ongoing randomized trial (NCT02876861) evaluating the role of 2 to 4 cycles of NAC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) for patients with locally advanced UTUC who are eligible for cisplatin hopefully will provide insight for clinical benefit. 	However, this study will not provide the useful information for the role of NAC in cisplatin-ineligible patients. The use of carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting is still a matter of debate [14]. 
PMC5737465	PRJNA275635	Methods	BioProject	Population Genomic Data Processing 	We downloaded whole genome resequencing data from 200 individuals of a single C. grandiflora population, generated by Josephs et al. (2015) (NCBI accession number PRJNA275635, ID: 275635). 	We trimmed the paired-end 100-bp raw reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014), and randomly subsampled reads of each individual to a total of 54 million reads per sample (average coverage 25×) to avoid an overrepresentation of individual samples with high coverage. We mapped the trimmed reads to a TE-merged reference with bwa bwasw 0.7.13 (Li and Durbin 2009), as recommended before analyses with PoPoolationTE2 (Kofler et al. 2016). 
PMC5737465	PRJNA212731	Methods	BioProject	C. rubella was derived from a C. grandiflora-like outcrossing ancestor fairly recently, most likely <200,000 years ago (Foxe et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2009; Brandvain et al. 2013; Slotte et al. 2013), and it is the best available model for inferring such information. 	Additionally, a previous study found no evidence for different TE silencing efficacies between C. rubella and C. grandiflora (Steige et al. 2015), hence, we expect silenced TEs in C. rubella to be also silenced in C. grandiflora.TEs targeted by siRNAs were determined by using small RNA sequencing data from roots, seedlings, and flowers of the C. rubella reference accession generated by Smith et al. (2015) (NCBI Accession: PRJNA212731, ID: 455735/456437/456438). 	We trimmed the raw sRNA reads with Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al. 2014) and mapped them to the TE-merged-reference using STAR 2.5.1b (Dobin et al. 2013), with default settings modified to allow mapping of small RNA reads. After removing all reads with more than one nucleotide soft-clipped from their 5′ end, in order to remove long RNA reads which were not fully mapped by STAR, we considered all RNA reads, which mapped to a TE, with a length of 24 nucleotides and no mismatches to be siRNAs.

PMC5750462	1EA3	Discussion	PDBe	Detailed crystallographic data for all four structures (M(NLS-88R)-neutral, M(NLS-88R)-acidic, M(NLS-88E)-neutral and M(NLS-88E)-acidic) obtained are presented in Table 1. 	M(NLS-88R)-neutral occurs as physiological monomers similar to wt-M1 structure 1EA3 (also crystallized at neutral pH),12 and are arranged loosely in a so-called ‘face-to-back’ orientation with each other in the cell (Figure 1A). 	The residues Lys104 (part of the NLS motif), Arg134, Tyr100 and Asp94 on the ‘face’ of one molecule (Monomer A) interact with several complementary residues on the ‘back’ of a second molecule (Monomer B), including Glu29, Asp30, Lys21 and Ser17 (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite also crystallizing at a neutral pH, the two monomers (A and B) of M(NLS-88E)-neutral unexpectedly associate to form a physiological face-to-face dimer with the NLS basic residues adjacent to each other similar to wt-M1 dimer 1AA7 (crystallized at acidic pH).13 The two monomers of M(NLS-88E)-neutral are similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of ~0.4 Å, but are different from those in wt-M1 1AA7.13

Least-squares superpositions of the four M(NLS-88R)-acidic monomers or superposition of its two independent dimers resulted in low r.m.s.d.s of 0.2–0.4 Å or 0.4 Å, suggesting similar quaternary conformation or monomer–monomer arrangements.

Similar to wt-M1 dimer 1AA7 crystallized at acidic pH,13 the monomers in each dimer of M(NLS-88R)-acidic are arranged in a so-called ‘face-to-face’ orientation that are related by a non-crystallographic twofold axis with the basic residues of the NLS motif close to the dimer interface (Figure 1C). 	On the other side, M(NLS-88E)-acidic has monomers A and B associate in a face-to-face arrangement to form dimer 1, and has molecule C similarly associated with its dyad equivalent to form dimer 2. All three M(NLS-88E)-acidic monomers superposed on each other with a r.m.s.d. of ~0.5 Å. However, least-squares superposition of the two M(NLS-88E)-acidic independent dimers 1 and 2 resulted in a very large r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å (see Supplementary Table S2 in the Supplementary Material), indicating that the two dimers of M(NLS-88E)-acidic show significantly different dimer arrangements. 
PMC5750462	1AA7	Discussion	PDBe	A few dimer interface hydrogen-bond interactions (Asn85 to Arg134 and X88 to Tyr100) are conserved, whereas the rest of the contacts are mostly unique to each structure (Figure 1F; see Supplementary Table S3), highlighting the differences in the relative monomer–monomer arrangement of different dimers. 	The analyses indicated that M(NLS-88R)-acidic (dimers 1 and 2) had a very similar dimeric arrangement as wt-M1 1AA7 structure (r.m.s.d. of 0.6 Å screw rotation angle of 2°, Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S2). 	However, M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer differs significantly from wt-M1 1AA7 or M(NLS-88R)-acidic (r.m.s.d. of 1.9 Å screw rotation angle of ~17°, Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S2). Dimer 1 of M(NLS-88E)-acidic is more like M(NLS-88E)-neutral dimer (r.m.s.d. of ~0.6 Å screw rotation angle of ~8°, see Supplementary Table S2), but not its dimer 2 (r.m.s.d. of ~0.6 Å screw rotation angle of ~15°, see Supplementary Table S2).

PMC5750462	1EA3		PDBe	Thus, the acid-facilitated M1 conformational change is likely irreversible, presumably to prevent dissociated M1 from re-associating with vRNP in the cytosol after virus uncoating. 	At neutral pH where basic and acidic amino acid residues exist predominantly in their ionized forms, M1 monomers are driven to interact in a face-to-back manner that involves predominantly electrostatic contacts,10 for example, wt-M1 1EA3 (pH 7.0) and M(NLS-88R)-neutral. 	At acidic pH, M1 dimerization is anticipated as it is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions between the symmetry-related helices H6,10 for example, wt-M1 1AA7 (pH 4.0), M(NLS-88R)-acidic and M(NLS-88E)-acidic.

When comparing wt-M1 neutral (1EA3) and acidic (1AA7) structures, several hydrogen-bond interactions occurring at the dimer interface of 1AA7 appear to serve as the fulcrum of the subunit rotation for transition from the face-to-back-oriented 1EA3 to the face-to-face-oriented 1AA7.10 Some of these inter-subunit hydrogen-bond interactions are conserved in the dimeric structure of M(NLS-88)-acidic, including X88-O to Tyr100-OH and Asn85-ND2 to Arg134-O (see Supplementary Table S3). 	In addition to these conserved inter-subunit hydrogen-bonds, the G88R mutation also results in an extra hydrogen-bond from Arg88-NE to Arg134-O in M(NLS-88)-acidic structure.

PMC5766183	4mut	Results	PDBe	EMSA experiments revealed that the E89A+R91A mutant of the UbaLAI-N domain retained residual DNA binding ability (KD for specific DNA is approx. 200 nM, or 5000-fold lower than observed with wt UbaLAI-N, Supplementary Figure S5A and D). 	To generate an UbaLAI variant with a completely disabled N-domain, we have introduced two additional mutations, R37A and H38A, thereby generating a quadruple (R37A + H38A + E89A + R91A) mutant of the full-length UbaLAI (henceforth referred to as UbaLAI-4mut), and a corresponding variant of the UbaLAI-N domain. 	EMSA experiments with the quadruple UbaLAI-N mutant confirmed complete loss of its specific DNA binding ability (Supplementary Figure S5E). DNA binding by the full-length UbaLAI-2mut and UbaLAI-4mut proteins was investigated by a standard gel-shift assay. 
PMC5766183	4mut		PDBe	EMSA experiments with the quadruple UbaLAI-N mutant confirmed complete loss of its specific DNA binding ability (Supplementary Figure S5E). 	DNA binding by the full-length UbaLAI-2mut and UbaLAI-4mut proteins was investigated by a standard gel-shift assay. 	Both mutants formed complexes with specific DNA (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure S7), but the electrophoretic mobility of these complexes was significantly lower than mobility of the complex formed by wt UbaLAI (Figure 2A). Using EMSA with DNA fragments of different length we have confirmed that UbaLAI-2mut-DNA binding stoichiometry in the specific complex is 1:1 (no additional radiolabeled complex was formed upon titration of the UbaLAI-2mut-DNA complex with a long unlabeled DNA fragment, Figure 5B). 
PMC5766183	4mut		PDBe	The cartoons in panels (A) and (B) depict the single radiolabeled complex detected in the experiments. 	The DNA cleavage reactions of both UbaLAI-2mut (Figure 6) and UbaLAI-4mut (Supplementary Figure S8) were also affected by the mutations in the UbaLAI-N domain. 	Under substrate excess conditions (Figure 6A) the sole reaction product formed by UbaLAI-2mut in 1-site and 2-site plasmid cleavage reactions was nicked DNA. Thus, unlike the wt enzyme, UbaLAI-2mut is unable to complete cleavage of both DNA strands of the 2-site plasmid during a single binding event, but instead dissociates from the nicked intermediate. 
PMC5766183	4mut		PDBe	But in stark contrast to the wt enzyme, we did not observe any inhibition of DNA cleavage under enzyme excess conditions (compare Figure 3B and C and Figure 6B and C). 	The catalytic activity of UbaLAI-4mut, the enzyme variant with a completely disabled UbaLAI-N domain, increased steadily with increasing enzyme concentrations (up to 200-fold enzyme excess over the substrate, the highest enzyme excess used in our experiments) on both 1-site and 2-site plasmid substrates (Supplementary Figure S8). 	
PMC5766183	3hqf	Discussion	PDBe	We show here that Type IIE enzymes UbaLAI and EcoRII use similar N-terminal effector domains specific for the 5′-CCWGG-3′ sequence. 	Despite the fact that UbaLAI-N and EcoRII-N domains share only 18% sequence identity (Supplementary Figure S1C), their overall structures are very similar (Figure 4B): 134 of 173 residues of the EcoRII N-terminal domain (3hqf) could be aligned with UbaLAI-N with r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (DALI server (22)). 	The loops of the N-arms adopt slightly different conformations in both domains; the C-arms overlay better, but the loop between the strands in the C-arm of UbaLAI-N is shorter (Supplementary Figure S6). Both domains make identical contacts with the central T0:A0 base pairs employing overlaying residues (Figure 4D and E, Supplementary Figure S6). 
PMC5766183	4mut		PDBe	Such direct interaction of UbaLAI-2mut with the DNA via the C-domain bypasses the ‘authorization’ by UbaLAI-N, and therefore requires higher enzyme concentrations. 	Exclusive use of this ‘unauthorized’ DNA binding pathway by the UbaLAI-4mut enzyme explains why its activity is detectable only at high protein concentrations (Supplementary Figure S8). 	Mechanism of double-stranded DNA cleavage Structural homologs of UbaLAI-C, REases BcnI and MvaI, are monomeric single-domain REases (Figure 1D) that form an asymmetric complex with their recognition sites (11,12). 
PMC5766183	2reu	Discussion	PDBe	According to sequence analysis, only the N-terminal Sau3AI domain contains an intact catalytic center, while the catalytically inactive C-terminal domain acts as an effector domain (26). 	Though the originally proposed Sau3AI reaction mechanism involved transient dimerization (25), recent structural studies of apo-Sau3AI performed by Xu et al. are consistent with the monomeric oligomeric state of Sau3AI (PDB IDs 2reu and 4pxg (27)). 	We therefore propose that Sau3AI may also employ an UbaLAI-like reaction mechanism, as depicted in Figure 7B. A similar mechanism to UbaLAI was also described for the Type IIS enzyme BfiI, which contains a B3-like DNA recognition domain specific for the 5′-ACTGGG-3′ DNA sequence attached to a nonspecific nuclease that cuts DNA 5/4 nucleotides downstream from the recognition site (28,29).

All SHs have unique, individual digital object identifiers (DOIs; https://www.doi.org/) for unambiguous reference across time and scientific studies (e.g., 10.15156/BIO/SH216455.07FU which resolves to http://dx.doi.org/10.15156/BIO/SH216455.07FU). 	UNITE recently received an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant to improve the support within the database for handling, processing, and characterising the mycobiome from the built environment (the built mycobiome). Several actions have been taken towards that goal, including a workshop to annotate all extant built-environment fungal ITS sequences according to the MIxS-BE annotation standard (Glass et al. 2014; Abarenkov et al. 2016).

PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	NCT	4SC‐202 inhibits canonical HH/GLI signaling in murine and human HH‐responsive cells 	4SC‐202 is a novel small‐molecule inhibitor selectively targeting class I HDACs 1/2/3 and the lysine‐specific demethylase LSD1.17 Notably, 4SC‐202 has shown excellent safety and promising anti‐leukemic activity in a recent phase I clinical trial (see TOPAS study at clinicaltrials.gov trial no. NCT01344707 and J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	To analyze whether 4SC‐202 affects HH/GLI signaling, we first treated Sonic Hh stimulated murine Hh/Gli luciferase reporter cells with 4SC‐202 and found that 4SC‐202 strongly repressed Gli activity with an IC50 of ∼50 nM (Fig. 1 a). To address the relevance of this finding to physiological HH/GLI signaling in a human context, we used HH responsive human medulloblastoma cells (i.e., Daoy) as a human model of canonical HH/GLI signaling in cancer cells.18 Daoy cells and NIH/3T3 express robust levels of HDAC1/2/3 (Figs. 1 b and 1 c) and activation of HH signaling by Smoothened agonist SAG induces HH target genes (e.g. GLI1 and HHIP) at the mRNA and protein level.18 Notably, 4SC‐202 treatment efficiently repressed SAG‐induced GLI1 (Fig. 1 d) and HHIP (Fig. 1 e) expression with an IC50 of ∼240 nM and ∼140 nM, respectively, without affecting primary cilia formation, an essential process for the coordination of HH/GLI signal activation (Supporting Information, Fig. 1).19 Analysis of GLI1 protein expression confirmed the concentration‐dependent repressive effect of 4SC‐202 on HH/GLI signaling (Figs. 1 f and 1 g). 
PMC5813224	NCT01344707	Discussion	NCT	Intriguingly, analysis of the genetic landscape of SHH subgroup medulloblastoma identified frequent somatic alterations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.25 In light of these findings, our data together with the previous studies by the Canettieri group may provide a mechanistic basis for this observation and guide possible new therapeutic approaches. 	The clinical relevance of our findings is further underlined by a recent phase I clinical trial with 4SC‐202, where 18 out of 24 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies went into follow up treatment, one patient showed complete response and remained on study medication for >28 months, while another patient had a partial response over a period of 8 months (Clinical trial: NCT01344707, poster J Clin Oncol 32:5 sec, 2014 (suppl; abstr 8559)). 	Although it is unclear whether the promising clinical response to 4SC‐202 treatment was due to inhibition of GLI activity, the results of the present study warrant further clinical evaluation of 4SC‐202 as a treatment for GLI‐dependent cancers including BCC, medulloblastoma and possibly other malignancies with high medical need.

PMC5845183	NCT03029897	Abstract	NCT	Methods/design 	We designed a multi-centric, open cluster-randomized controlled trial, called the Vigip-SEP study (NCT03029897), using the App My eReport France® to report ADR to the appropriate authorities in E2B language, in accordance with European regulations. 	RR-MS patients who were initiated on, or switched, first-line DMD will be included. In the experimental arm, a neurologist will introduce the patient to the App to report ADR to the appropriate French authorities.

PMC5846725	PRJNA260115		NCT	For example, ACT has been used for qPCR studies in Platycladus orientalis [43], TUB in Salix matsudana [49], UBQ in longan tree [24], and EF1β and GAPDH in Vernicia fordii [50]. 	We selected these genes from RNA sequencing data (PRJNA260115) and used qPCR together with statistical and graphical techniques (geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder) to determine the most stable internal control gene for qPCR studies. 	On the basis of three algorithms analysis results, we found ACT and GAPDH with most stable gene expression among whole plants, as well as different tissues under both stress and normal conditions (Table 5). Actin (ACT) is a cytoskeleton structural protein involved in cell signaling while glyceradehde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plays pivotal role in energy yielding step during carbohydrates metabolism and involved in DNA repair [51,52]. 
PMC5849279	NCT01970969	Methods	NCT	Trial registration 	ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01970969 	In prospective cohort study, Eric Topol and colleague validate a genetic risk score for identification of patients at the highest risk of developing atrial fibrillation. 
PMC5849279	NCT01970969	Methods	NCT	An independent data and safety monitoring board provided ongoing study oversight throughout the trial period. 	This study (S1 Protocol) was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01970969) and is reported as per the TRIPOD guidelines (S1 Checklist). 	Cardiac rhythm monitoring and event adjudication The primary event was an instance of AF/atrial flutter as defined by standard electrocardiographic criteria for a minimum duration of 5 seconds (AF event). 
PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	However, rs10033464 (4q25, PITX2) displayed a risk estimate in the opposite direction than had been previously reported by others. 	This discrepancy appears to be in part due to linkage disequilibrium between this marker and the nearby SNP with the strongest association in this gene, rs2200733 (p = 0.005). 	We and others have observed that the risk alleles at these markers are negatively associated with each other. There remains uncertainty in the optimal genetic risk model for AF, and superior models will certainly evolve in the future as more genetic discoveries are made. 
PMC5849279	rs2200733	Results	RefSNP	In this light, we also considered a modified AF GRS that included only the most strongly associated SNP in each gene—which is a common solution in GRS estimation to eliminate confounding due to linkage disequilibrium [32]. 	The resulting 9-SNP model included rs2200733 for PITX2 and the other 8 SNPs from the other genes. 	The risk of AF with this modified AF GRS, as in the 12-SNP model, was greater for the highest AF GRS quintile than for the lowest AF GRS quintile (OR 5.07; 95% CI 2.04–12.60; p < 0.001), and this model appeared to better differentiate risk of AF throughout the distribution of genetic risk (S3 Table). As expected, the risk estimates derived for both AF GRS models remained significant in an analysis limited to participants who self-reported as white (S4 Table).

Compared to NSC osteoblast secretome, 12 proteins were significantly less secreted (Osteomodulin, IGFBP5, VCAM-1, IGF2, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, versican, calumenin, IGFBP2, thrombospondin-4, periostin, reticulocalbin 1 and osteonectin), and 13 proteins were significantly more secreted by SC osteoblasts (CHI3L1, fibulin-3, SERPINE2, IGFBP6, SH3BGRL3, SERPINE1, reticulocalbin3, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, TIMP-2, IGFBP3, TIMP-1, SERPINF1, CSF-1). Similar changes in osteomodulin, IGF2, SERPINE1, fibulin-3 and CHI3L1 mRNA levels were observed. 
PMC5856400	PXD008494	Methods	PRIDE	For identification, the minimum to consider is at least two different peptides per protein identified and to check the false positive rate, this should be as low as possible (the false positive rate will be of maximum 4% because of the settings used in PLGS database search). 	The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD008494 [12]. 	Quantitative Real-time RT PCR RNA from 1.106 cells was isolated by RNeasy mini kit total RNA isolation system (Qiagen, Belgium) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed by using the Rotor Gene (Qiagen, Belgium)- SYBR premix Ex Taq (Takara, Belgium). 
PMC5884136	1DWC	Methods	PDBe	An in silico molecular docking study was performed to validate the binding potency of the phenolic compounds to thrombin by using AutoDock 4.2 program [23]. 	The molecular dockings were conducted by using the crystal structure of the thrombin-argatroban complex (PDB ID = 1DWC) at 1.53 Å resolution [24], where the ligand argatroban was deleted using UCSF Chimera. 	Besides, polar hydrogen atoms were added, and the crystal water was remained. The three-dimensional chemical structures of compounds were drawn by ChemOffice and minimized energy, with outputting in PDB format.

PMC5893785	NCT00297193	Introduction	NCT	Mechanistic studies suggest that restoration of immunological tolerance in chronic autoimmunity occurs after auto-HSCT via eradication of immune memory and reconfiguration of the immune system. 	Although case reports suggested exceptional benefit for patients with refractory CD after auto-HSCT (14, 15), concerns about safety and a lack of understanding as to whether benefit relates to the chemotherapeutic agents administered during mobilization/pre-transplant conditioning regimen or the transplant itself, led to the Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease (ASTIC) randomized controlled trial (NCT00297193) (16, 17). 	This was conducted at 11 accredited centers in 6 European countries (16, 17). Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Crohn’s disease compared cyclophosphamide mobilization alone to mobilization, high-dose chemotherapy, and auto-HSCT in patients with refractory CD (16, 17).

PMC5953197	NCT02685397	Discussion	NCT	Radiation therapy can be an effective treatment for bone pain relief and 48 Gy in 3 fractions SBRT treatment in patients with multiple oligometastases, have shown promising long-term disease control (Salama et al 2012). 	An on-going clinical trial is investigating the eradication of oligometastases, including bone lesions, in patients with mCRPC (NCT02685397). 	Radiation therapy is typically used in symptomatic and late stages of disease. However, implementation of treatment early in the course of the disease may increase quality of life and reduce overall metastatic tumour burden; in turn, delaying disease progression and improving long-term survival. 
PMC5960098	GSE37020		NCT	Systematic simulation studies showed that: 1) the three improved tests performed better (i.e., having larger power, while keeping nominal Type I error rates) than the other three tests for data with outliers and having different variances between cases and controls; 2) for data from normal distributions, the three improved tests had slightly lower power than jointLRT and AW. 	The analyses of two Illumina HumanMethylation27 data sets GSE37020 and GSE20080 and one Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC data set GSE107080 demonstrated that three improved tests had higher true validation rates than those from jointLRT, KS, and AW. 	
PMC5960098	GSE37020		NCT	Real data analyses 	We applied all six statistical tests to three publicly available DNA methylation data sets (GSE37020 [16], GSE20080 [17] and GSE107080 [18]) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). 	GSE37020 and GSE20080 used Illumina HumanMethylation27 (HM27k) platform to produce DNA methylation profiles for 27,578 CpG sites. Both data sets measured cervical smear samples collected from normal histology (regarded as normal samples) and changed tissues with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) (CIN2+ samples).

GSE37020 contains 24 normal samples and 24 CIN2+ samples, while GSE20080 contains 30 normal samples and 18 CIN2+ samples. 	GSE107080 contained DNA methylation profiles of about 850K sites measured from whole blood samples using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC (EPIC) platform. GSE107080 included 100 individuals with illicit drug injection and hepatitis C type virus (IDU+/HCV+) and 305 individuals without illicit drug injection and hepatitis C type virus (IDU-/HCV-). 
PMC5960098	GSE37020		NCT	All the individuals are recruited from a well-established longitudinal cohort, Veteran Aging Cohort Study. 	For GSE37020 and GSE20080, we excluded CpG sites residing near SNPs or with missing values. 	Quantile plots and principal component analysis did not show obvious and suspicious patterns (for details please refer to [4]). We then obtained residuals of samples after regressing out the effect of age from DNA methylation levels. 
PMC5960098	GSE37020		NCT	After data quality control and preprocessing (for details please refer to [4]), there were 22,859 CpG sites appearing in both cleaned data sets. 	We used cleaned GSE37020 as the discovery set and cleaned GSE20080 as the validation set to detect CpG sites differentially methylated (DM) or differentially variable (DV) between CIN2+ samples and normal samples. 	For a given CpG site in a given data set, we applied each of the six joint tests to test for equalities of both means and variances. For a given joint test, we claimed a CpG site in the analysis of GSE37020 as significant methylation candidate (different in means or variances) if the false discovery rate (FDR) [19] adjusted p-value for the CpG site is less than 0.05.

The function p.adjust in the statistical software R was used to calculate FDR-adjusted p-value. For a significant site in the analysis of GSE37020, if the corresponding un-adjusted p-value in the analysis of GSE20080 is less than 0.05 and the difference directions of means and variances are consistent between the two data sets, then we claim that the significance in the analysis of GSE37020 is truly validated in the analysis of GSE20080.

PCR products were recovered (Omega, Norcross, GA, USA), integrated into pET-32 vector (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan), then the recombinant vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α competent cells. 
PMC6155776	4NNI	Introduction	PDBe	However, there are limitations that make them inapplicable for our compounds. 	The complex of POA bound to the ribosomal protein S1 (involved in trans-translation process) was resolved (pdb: 4NNI). 	From this complex it is obvious that POA could be substituted in positions 5- and/or 6-, but not in position 3- [23]. The pyrazinamidase (PncA) active site cavity is quite small and from a model based on the X-ray determined structure of PncA (pdb: 3PL1), it is quite obvious that the only position for possible substitutions of PZA is position 6- of the pyrazine ring [24].

Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA. The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA. 
PMC6155776	2C45	Introduction	PDBe	Substitution of position 3- by a large moiety (benzylamino in our case) would push the PZA core away from the position and orientation needed for an enzymatic conversion by PncA. 	The crystal structure of aspartate decarboxylase (PanD) was resolved (pdb: 2C45), but there are no complexes with bound PZA/POA. 	The binding site and interaction patterns for PZA/POA are therefore unknown. Simulations of PZA/POA binding to PanD by docking and docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation of the complex gave uncertain results [25]. 
PMC6155776	4TZK		PDBe	Such an arrangement enables close proximity of the carbonyl group to Tyr 158 and NAD+ ribose and allows the substituent in the aforementioned 3- position to form additional less specific interactions with substrate binding group residues at the same time (see Figure 4). 	None of assessed compounds reached an affinity higher or equal to (3S)-1-cyclohexyl-N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamide (−9.82 kcal/mol) that is the original 4TZK ligand. 	The best scored compounds 4 and 12 (affinity −8.47 kcal/mol resp. −8.49 kcal/mol, see Table 5) attain similar poses within the active site as most of the direct InhA inhibitors, forming a hydrogen bond network between Tyr 158, NAD+ ribose and the pyrazine core. The carboxamide moiety fulfils a similar role to the carbonyl moiety of the original ligand 4TZK or a phenolate of known inhibitors such as triclosan or PT70 (ring A) (see Figure 5).

The carboxamide moiety fulfils a similar role to the carbonyl moiety of the original ligand 4TZK or a phenolate of known inhibitors such as triclosan or PT70 (ring A) (see Figure 5). 	The hydrophobic benzyl part of discussed compounds exerts hydrophobic interactions with lipophilic residues of the substrate binding loop (Met 103, Pro 193, Met 199, Leu 207 and Ile 215, see Figure 6). An orientation of this benzyl moiety is in accordance with an orientation of hexyl chain of PT70 that is oriented in the hydrophobic entry tunnel, which normally hosts the long alkyl chain of mycolic acid intermediate (see Figure 5).

PMC6243512	rs2066842	Discussion	RefSNP	Environmental carcinogens and NOD-induced proinflammatory cytokines could be possible reasons by which the studied polymorphisms may increase the risk for gastric cancer [9]. 	A meta-analysis evaluated several NOD2 polymorphisms such as rs2066842 C/T, rs2066844 C/T, rs2066845 C/G, rs2066847, L1007fsinsC and risk of cancer. 	The NOD2 rs2066844 C/T polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer for individuals bearing TT or CT genotype compared to individuals with CC genotype. The subgroup of analysis revealed that TT+CT genotype was associated with high risk of colorectal cancer, but there was no important association with the development of gastric cancer.

PMC6303916	rs12953717	Article	RefSNP	It was shown that there was a significant difference between the rs4464148 AG frequency of SMAD7 in the CRC and control groups. 	It was demonstrated that the allele T at rs12953717 of SMAD7 can be introduced as a risk factor of CRC among Iranian patients [24]. 	
PMC6303916	rs3135500	Article	RefSNP	It functions as a sensor of lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycans to induce the (NF)-jB and STAT1 transcription factors which are associated with inflammation-related tumor progression [40, 41]. 	Correlation between rs3135500 (30UTR SNP) of NOD2 and CRC susceptibility was evaluated among the Iranian population. 	
PMC6303916	rs3135500		RefSNP	Correlation between rs3135500 (30UTR SNP) of NOD2 and CRC susceptibility was evaluated among the Iranian population. 	It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. 	
PMC6303916	rs3135500	Article	RefSNP	It seems that the rs3135500 SNP is involved in deregulation of NOD2 through changing the mRNA–miRNA interaction. 	There was a significant correlation between AA genotype of rs3135500 and increased risk of CRC in Iranian population [42]. 	
PMC6303916	rs17281995	Article	RefSNP	CD86 is expressed by immune cells and is associated with inflammation related malignancies and cancer susceptibility. 	The 3’UTR + 237 G/C polymorphism of CD86 was assessed among 300 Iranian CRC cases and showed a strong correlation between rs17281995 polymorphism and risk of CRC [43]. 	
PMC6303916	rs2228570	Article	RefSNP	It has been reported that the vitamin D interaction with its receptor (VDR) is associated with CRC susceptibility [76]. 	It was observed that the ff (TT) genotype of rs2228570 can be suggested as a risk factor genotype for CRC susceptibility among a group of Iranian CRC patients [77]. 	
PMC6306173	NCT01731717	Methods	NCT	The study was approved by the responsible local Ethics Committee of the Chamber of Psychotherapists in Hamburg and conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version). 	The study protocol was registered under ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01731717. 	Patient recruitment Patient recruitment was carried out by the participating GPs and comprised three guideline-recommended assessment steps supported by checklists [38]: First, the GP systematically screened patients with particular risk factors for depression (presence of diffuse somatic symptoms and/or chronic somatic conditions [32, 39]) by applying a 2-item checklist. 
PMC6347085	NCT00940602	Discussion	NCT	A general recommendation has been to initiate ICT when SF reaches greater than 1,000 ng/mL. 	Further prospective evaluation of deferasirox in the TELESTO trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940602) is needed to confirm these data and further define the use of ICT in MDS patients (Shenoy et al., 2014; Taran & Taran, 2015). 	Life expectancy, transfusion burden, and evidence of iron excess (elevated SF), as well as any related patient comorbidities, are currently the main factors to consider when deciding on ICT in the absence of more rigorous evidence-based guidelines (Chaudhary & Pullarkat, 2013).

PMC6366260	rs12255372	Article	RefSNP	For instance, the rs7903146T allele of the TCF7L2 gene was more frequent in patients with T2D who failed to respond to sulphonylureas (SU)2. 	Similarly, carriers of the risk allele rs12255372 T/T were less likely to respond to SU than carriers of G/G3. 	
PMC6372515	CP027611	Discussion	ENA	The gene encoding the MdfA efflux pump was detected in the 810CP genome, the overexpression of which has been associated with resistance to several antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin (Vila et al., 2007). 	Other important findings by our group include the identification of a 9996-bp resistance island that has recently been described in other A. baumannii strains [e.g., AR0101 (GenBank CP027611.1), 11510 (Graña-Miraglia et al., 2017), AF401 (GenBank NZ_CP018254.1), AbH120-A2 (Merino et al., 2014), and AB030 (Loewen et al., 2014)]. 	The blaOXA-23 gene has been considered an important resistance biomarker and is located in either the plasmid or chromosome and is highly prevalent (Mugnier et al., 2010; Opazo et al., 2012; Evans and Amyes, 2014; Luo T.L. et al., 2015). MLST analyses have identified several clonal complexes, groupings of unique genotypes that share at least five loci, and these genotypes have diversified and increased their frequency in the population.

Table 2 presents the results of the interaction analysis. 	
PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	RefSNP	Considering the higher statistical power of haplotype analysis compared to individual SNP analysis when LD was exploited to explore genes associated with diseases, we conducted the haplotype analysis and haplotype—environment interaction analysis to further investigate the roles of SPRY genes in Chinese NSCL/P. 	The results of haplotype analysis altogether indicated that one genetic segment (rs541731- rs9669948, from 80345577 to 80372188) located at 4.5 kb—31.1 kb downstream of SPRY2 was associated with NSCL/P, indicating that the neighborhood region of this segment might contain causal variants. 	Although the position drifted a little compared with formerly reported positions (rs8001641, 222.4 kb upstream of SPRY2; rs9545308, 270.7 kb upstream of SPRY2), our findings still enriched the evidence of this gene in the etiology of NSCL/P. The biological function of SPRY2 has also been identified by several experimental studies.

PMC6406689	rs541731	Discussion	RefSNP	Although statistical interactions do not always guarantee biological interaction, evidence about the biological function of SPRY2 [21,29,30] and the signals in the single haplotype analysis might together support a biological interaction. 	Moreover, four SNPs in the identified genetic region, respectively, rs541731, rs496932, rs9545412, and rs9669948, are enhancer histone marks in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, which play important roles in the development of NSCL/P, as reported by ChromHMM software [31]. 	Genes with histone marks have been reported to have a significantly higher expression, while gene expression levels are correlated with DNA methylation [32]. Based on the general understanding that DNA methylations can be influenced by environmental exposures, it was reasonable to infer that ETS or multivitamin supplementation affected the DNA methylation processes of SPRY2 in embryonic stem cells or embryonic stem derived cells, and then influenced the development of NSCL/P.
