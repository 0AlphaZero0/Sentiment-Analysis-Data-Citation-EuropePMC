PMC1940057	AM282973	Results	ENA	This identity can be explained by the high-stringency PCR conditions and the low degree of degeneration of the two used primers. 	Frame analysis of the nucleotide sequence (696 bp, accession no. AM282973) revealed the presence of a unique internal open reading frame. 	The alignment of the corresponding amino acid sequence (aa) with all available protein sequences using the Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST program [24] showed as expected important aa identities with different NRPS adenylation domains. This identity reaches 50% and 48% with the adenylation domains of the pristinamycin I (PI) synthetase 2, and actinomycin (ACM) synthetase III, respectively (Figure 1). 
PMC2154357	1K4C	Methods	PDBe	All values are reported in Table I together with previous results on KcsA (Bernèche and Roux, 2001; Noskov et al., 2004). 	We estimate that the accuracy and overall significance of the calculated free energies is roughly on the order of 1 kcal/mol, based on the difference between the computations with 1K4C (Noskov et al., 2004) and 1BL8 (Bernèche and Roux, 2001) and the comparison between the CHARMM PARAM27 and AMBER force fields. 	For the simulations with the AMBER force field, the systems were reequilibriated for 1.5 ns before starting the free energy computations. The hydration number of K+ and Na+ in the various binding sites were computed from the average of 800 ps of MD for each configuration; statistical error was estimated by comparing block averages.

For example, in C. elegans, nhr-67 [Swiss-Prot: Q9XVV3] and daf-21 [Swiss-Prot: Q18688] have been shown to interact [27], whereas in human ESR1 [Swiss-Prot: P03372] and HSP90AA1 [Swiss-Prot: P07900] are also known to interact [28].

PMC2216687	Q14181	Discussion	UniProt	Orthologous proteins are generally believed to have similar functions, and the orthologs can be obtained from Inparanoid [31]. 	For example, the H. sapiens gene POLA2, DNA polymerase subunit alpha B [Swiss-Prot: Q14181], was predicted by CSIDOP to exhibit alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Orthologs of POLA2 found by Inparanoid include: POL12 [ORF: YBL035C; SGD:S000000131] in S. cerevisiae, POLA2 [RGD:621817] in R. norvegicus, and CG5923 [FlyBase: FBgn0005696] in D. melanogaster.

PMC2216687	O75995	Results	UniProt	All three orthologs were associated with the alpha DNA polymerase activity (GO:0003889). 	Furthermore, the CSIDOP method detected three molecular function terms for the human protein SLY, SH3 protein expressed in lymphocytes homolog [Swiss-Prot: O75995], while no information was found anywhere else. 	The three functions identified were DNA binding (GO:0003677), chromatin binding (GO:0003682), and zinc ion binding (GO:0008270). The SLY protein contains a COR1 chromatin-binding domain, and it was suggested in [38] that SLY may be targeted to the gonosomes in spermatids and may regulate gonosomal chromatin conformation and expression.

PMC2602789	1GDT	Introduction	PDBe	The 1–2 dimer is present in a structure of γδ resolvase bound to site I DNA (11; Figure 2A), but the 2–3′ interaction has not yet been observed in X-ray structures of complexes containing DNA. Figure 2.Resolvase structures and activating mutations. 	(A) Crystal structure of a wild-type γδ resolvase dimer bound to site I [1GDT; (11)]. 	On the right, residues relevant to the experiments presented here are shown in spacefill on the orange resolvase subunit (in the same orientation); S10 in green; R2 and E56 in blue; G101, E102, M103 and K105 in cyan; A117, R121 and E124 in magenta. The hydroxyl group of S10 is the catalytic nucleophile in recombination. 
PMC2602789	1ZR4	Discussion	PDBe	The γδ resolvase residues E102 and K105 correspond to D102 and Q105, respectively, in Tn3 resolvase. 	(B) Crystal structure of a synaptic tetramer of γδ resolvase with two cleaved site Is [1ZR4; (16)], and on the right the orange resolvase subunit in the same orientation, showing residues in spacefill as in (A), except that the following residues are mutant; A2, K56, S101, Y102, I103, Q124. 	The images were created with PyMol. Resolvase variants with ‘activating’ mutations promote recombination at site I in the absence of the accessory binding sites of res (12,13).

However, the structures do not provide an obvious explanation of how the mutations stabilize the tetramer, or why it is not formed by wild-type resolvase. Li et al. (16) make two hypotheses.

PMC2677866	1CW0	Methods	PDBe	Structural models 	Similarity of the Vsr-like homing endonuclease to known structures was found using the Phyre server (34), and a structure model was created with the Rosetta structure prediction program suite using the K*Sync alignment method (35), with PDB structure 1CW0 as a template. 	For split-inteins structural models we used the I-Tasser server (36) for initial alignment and model creation. Sequences were submitted fused, and the resulting models were subsequently separated, by removing N-terminal Methionine of the C-terminal part of the split-intein. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	Conserved motifs of the HINT protein-splicing family are boxed and labeled, and active-site residues are marked with an asterisk. 	The sequence alignment was refined based on structural modeling with the cyanobacterial DnaE split-intein as a template (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	Sequences are named after their protein host. (C) Electrostatic characteristics of full-length split-inteins. 
PMC2677866	1CW0	Results	PDBe	(A) Conserved sequence motifs of Vsr-like putative homing endonucleases, and their sequence logos. 	(B) Structure based alignment of DnaE-2 locus Vsr-like putative homing endonuclease with E.coli Vsr repair endonuclease (Vsr; PDB code 1CW0). 	Residues that were modeled in similar positions and backbone conformations after sequence threading and energy minimization are shown in upper case; unaligned sequence regions are shown in grey lowercase. Identical residues are highlighted in red. 
PMC2677866	1ZD7	Results	PDBe	To further examine the sequence-to-function features of the new split-inteins, five full-length split-intein pairs were selected from different loci (gp41-1, gp41-8, IMPDH-1, NrdA-2 and NrdJ-1) for a structural analysis. 	The N- and C-terminal sequence parts of the each split-intein were joined to form a contiguous intein, and the overall structure of each intein was modeled based on the available crystal structure of a joined DnaE split-intein (PDB code: 1ZD7). 	All five split-inteins fit the intein structure without major clashes, despite their sequence variations. We previously suggested that the charge distribution along the two long anti-parallel beta-strands of the associated split-inteins molecule has an important role in the electrostatic interaction between the two split-intein parts (17). 
PMC2677866	NZ_ABDA01000203.1	Results	RefSeq	In another case, Vsr-like ORFs are present in two group I introns of recA genes. 	One of these introns is found in a gene fragment from a whole genome shotgun sequencing project of Bacillus cereus (NCBI accession NZ_ABDA01000203.1). 	The fragment includes part of a recA 5′ region and a group I intron with a complete Vsr-like ORF. This region is 94% identical to a B. anthracis recA gene with an active group I intron (45) and identical recA loci from several other sequenced Bacilli (data not shown).

For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10–3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09–2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09–10.49).

The increased risk for carrying three unfavorable genotypes was 13.30-fold compared to patients with 0 to 2 risk genotypes (P = 0.013).

PMC2928273	rs1800795		RefSNP	Furthermore, the cumulative effect of these SNPs was dose-dependent with individuals carrying multiple unfavorable alleles having a corresponding increase in risk. 	Nine genetic variants were identified as significantly associated with esophagitis risk, and of those, six were in proinflammatory genes ( Table 2 ). We found that rs1800795 in IL6 resulted in a 2.16-fold increase in esophagitis. 	This polymorphism is located within the 5′-untranslated region of IL6 and has been functionally studied with conflicting results of the effect on gene expression and response to stimulation [18], [19]. However, a recent meta-analysis of over 5,500 patients was not able to demonstrate a relationship between this variant and IL6 serum levels [20]. 
PMC2928273	rs11556218		RefSNP	However, a recent meta-analysis of over 5,500 patients was not able to demonstrate a relationship between this variant and IL6 serum levels [20]. 	Gao et al. demonstrated that IL16:rs11556218 was significantly associated with colorectal and gastric cancer, but did not observe a correlation between IL16 serum levels measured in these patients and rs11556218 [21]. 	PTGS2:rs20417 was also associated with increased risk of esophagitis. This promoter variant disrupts a Sp1/Sp3 transcription factor binding site and causes a decrease in transcriptional activity in lung fibroblast cells [22], [23].

PMC2928273	rs5275	Discussion	RefSNP	However, this same variant, while altering the Sp1/Sp3 site, also introduces a binding site for another transcription factor, Egr-1, although the consequences are unknown [22]. 	The other two significant variants (rs5275 and rs689470) are located in the 3′-UTR and regulate PSTGS2 mRNA levels. 	Our results suggest that these SNPs are linked with an increase in pro-inflammatory activity leading to esophagitis. Further functional analysis is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms [24].

For anti-inflammatory molecules and esophagitis risk, Khurana Hershey et al. demonstrated that IL4R:rs1801275 resulted in enhanced IL4 signaling and the induction of high levels of the IgE receptor CD23 [25]. 	IL10:rs1800872 and IL10RA:rs3135932 have been shown to decrease IL10 signaling by decreasing serum levels and altering IL10-IL10RA interactions, respectively [26], [27]. The reported functions of these three SNPs would be in agreement with our findings of an increased risk of esophagitis by decreasing the anti-inflammatory response.

Twelve common polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with risk of pneumonitis. 
PMC2928273	rs1800587	Results	RefSNP	The two IL1A variants are in linkage disequilibrium and were found to increase risk by nearly 3-fold. 	IL1A:rs1800587 has been shown to contribute to an increase in IL1-α promoter activity, mRNA levels and protein levels [28]. 	IL1A:rs17561 is a non-synonymous SNP and increases processing of the IL1-α precursor resulting in an increase in the levels of active IL1-α [29]. The variant of IL8:rs4073, which was found to increase pneumonitis risk 3-fold, has been associated with increased secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL8 [30].

Genetic variation in TNF and the receptor TNFRSF1B were also associated with increased risk of pneumonitis. TNF-α signaling is an important modulator of the inflammatory response.

PMC2928273	rs1799724	Discussion	RefSNP	TNF-α signaling is an important modulator of the inflammatory response. 	The TNF:rs1799724 variant is located within the promoter region of the gene and thought to influence gene expression by creating an OCT-1 transcription factor binding site [34]. 	The effect of this differential binding on TNF-α signaling is not clear. Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. 
PMC2928273	rs1061622	Discussion	RefSNP	Some studies have shown an increase in TNF-α production [35], [36], [37], while others have shown the opposite effect [38], [39], [40]. 	For TNFRSF1B, the non-synonymous variant Met196Arg (rs1061622) does not alter TNF-α binding affinity, but results in intensified TNF-α signaling [41] and decreased NF-kB signaling [42]. 	Only one genetic variant was found to confer a protective effect following radiotherapy. This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis.

This variant, rs1799983, in NOS3 was associated with a 70% reduction in risk of pneumonitis. 	Functional studies have demonstrated that this variant results in production of a variant allozyme with reduced enzyme activity [43] resulting in a reduction in nitric oxide production [44]. These observations support our findings of decreased pneumonitis due to decreased inflammatory signaling.

PMC3044699	106210	Introduction	OMIM	Introduction 	Aniridia (AN; OMIM 106210) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the complete or partial absence of the iris. 	The incidence of AN in the general population is about 1 in 64,000 to 96,000 [1]. Vision is usually impaired by other ocular abnormalities such as corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, fovea and optic nerve hypoplasia, and nystagmus [1]. 
PMC3044699	194072	Introduction	OMIM	A small numbers of aniridia cases can be due to large chromosomal deletions or rearrangements [2,8]. 	Aniridia generally occurs in isolation or accompanied by other ocular malformations, but it occurs, more rarely, as part of the WAGR (Wilms’ tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) syndrome (OMIM 194072) [9]. 	WAGR is usually caused by deletions of chromosome 11p13, which include PAX6 and WT1 (Wilms tumor 1) [9]. As large deletions could not be identified by the routine PCR-sequencing mutation detection method, only a few isolated aniridia patients with the large deletions in the PAX6 region have been documented and the most of them are sporadic cases [2,8-18]. 
PMC3044699	NM_001604.3	Methods	RefSeq	For direct sequencing, PCR products were purified (Shenneng Bocai PCR purification kit; Shenneng, Shanghai, China). 	An automatic fluorescence DNA sequencer (ABI, Prism 373A; Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA), used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, sequenced the purified PCR products in both forward and reverse directions. DNAssit, version 1.0 compared nucleotide sequences with the published DNA sequence of PAX6 (GenBank NM_001604.3). 	Mutation analysis By the direct sequencing of 14 exons of PAX6, no mutation was detected in the two families.

(c) The interface structure of the antibody-VEGF is depicted based on the G6-Fab-VEGF complex structure (2FJG), where the 30 CDR interface residues are shown in stick model and the VEGF homodimer structure (V and W chains) shown in sphere model.

PMC3310866	3AUV	Results	PDBe	Since the phage display systems in Figure 1 are based on the scFv and the sc-dsFv scaffolds, it is important to verify that both the scFv and the sc-dsFv structures are similar to the variable domain structure in G6-Fab even in the absence of the two Fab constant domains in the scFv or the sc-dsFv structures. 	High-resolution sc-dsFv structure with the sequence identical to the parent G6-Fab variable domains (except for the two interface cysteines in the sc-dsFv shown in Figure 2) has been elucidated with x-ray crystallography as shown in Figure 2 (PDB code 3AUV); the refinement data are shown in Table S3. 	The corresponding scFv structure has not been attainable experimentally due to high aggregation tendency of the scFv in crystallization conditions. The comparison of the antibody variable domains in the uncomplexed and the VEGF-complexed G6-Fab structure (obtained from 2FJF and 2FJG, respectively, in PDB) with the sc-dsFv structure shown in Figure 2 suggests that the variable domain structures in the G6-Fab and in the sc-dsFv are largely identical to the atomic details.

Although protein-protein core interfaces anchored by hot spots [29], [30], [31] and the hydration-mediated interactions in the peripheral protein-protein interface regions [18], [21], [22], [23], [24] have been well-established qualitatively, the results shown in Figure 1 nevertheless provide rich information on the amino acid preferences for the positions in each of the interface regions.

Only one clear solution was found and the R-work and R-free values of the initial 30 rounds of Refmac5 refinement [39] were 0.2581 and 0.3003, respectively.

To build the sidechain of the residue at position j, the amino acid type i adopting a rotameric structure k from the penultimate rotamer library [44] was locally optimized with the “Clear Geometry” function in Discovery Studio (version 2.5, Accelrys) while the rest of the antibody-antigen complex remained fixed. The sidechain conformations clashing with the rest of the protein complex structure were removed from further consideration. 
PMC3310866	2FJF	Methods	PDBe	The calculation of the structural propensity Zji for amino acid i in position j has been described in details in a previous paper [46]. 	Briefly, local structures in PDB similar to the CDR structures flanking with two stem β-structures in the unbound antibody structure (2FJF) were collected with PrISM using the threshold of PSD<0.1[47]; these local structures were multiple-aligned based on structural similarity with PrISM [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Zji was calculated with the structure-based multiple sequence alignments as the following [46]:(3)where Cji is the number of the amino acid i that appears in the position j of the multiple sequence alignment; pi is the background probability for amino acid i in proteins; M is the number of rows in the sequence profile; the term (B+M-Σk = 1,20Cjk) is the Bayesian prediction pseudo-count, where B = M0.5 is adequate in the calculation. 	Predicted amino acid preference in binary form δpWji for amino acid type i at position j was determined by the logistic regression model:(4)δpWji = 1 when pWji≥ti; otherwise δpWji = 0, where The Xji in Equation (4) is the upper bound of the atomistic contact term for amino acid i at position j; Xji for each of the rotamer model structures 1∼k (here, k is the total number of rotamers for amino acid type i) for amino acid i at position j was calculated (Equation (1)) and the largest Xji in this set of Xji(rotamer1∼k) was used in Equation (4). This term corresponds to the most favourable contribution from amino acid i at position j to the protein-protein complex formation. Yji(rotamer1∼k) for each of the rotamer model structures 1∼k of amino acid i at position j was calculated (Equation (2)) and the smallest Yji in this set of Yji(rotamer1∼k) was used in Equation (4).

The aim of this study was to determine the association between the rs6552828 polymorphism in acyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACSL1) and elite endurance athletic status. 	We studied 82 Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes, and a group of sex and ethnically matched healthy young adults (controls, n = 197). The analyses were replicated in a cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (runners) [cases, n = 241 (128 male)] and healthy sedentary adults [controls, n = 504 (267 male)]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	The odds ratio (95%CI) for an elite endurance Chinese athlete to carry the G allele compared with ethnically matched controls was 1.381 (1.015–1.880) (P-value = 0.04). 	Our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Caucasians, yet a marginal association seems to exist for the Chinese (Han) male population. 	Introduction Elite athletic status is a complex phenotype, with several genetic polymorphisms, many of which remain to be identified, contributing to athletic success, whether individually or in combination with other polymorphisms [1]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	A GWA study was recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] in sedentary Caucasians to study the association of 324,611 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the trainability of one of the main phenotype traits indicative of human endurance performance, i.e. maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). 	The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to acyl coenzyme A synthetase long-chain 1 (ACSL1) gene polymorphism (rs6552828). 	The ACSL1 gene is a candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health-related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolism at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The findings of GWA studies should be further explored in genetic association studies focused on those SNPs showing the highest level of association [2].

Thus, the purpose of the present case:control study was to determine the association between the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism and elite endurance athletic status. 	To this end, we studied a cohort that comprised Caucasian (Spanish) World/Olympic-class endurance male athletes (cases), and sex and ethnically-matched healthy young adults (controls). We also studied a replication cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (cases), and healthy sedentary adults (controls). 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	We also studied a replication cohort of a different ethnic origin (Chinese of the Han ethnic group), composed of elite endurance athletes (cases), and healthy sedentary adults (controls). 	Owing to the important putative role of ACSL1 in aerobic-related phenotypes [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] we hypothesized that the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism is associated with elite endurance athletic status. 	Methods Participants 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed using a StepOne™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 	Allelic discrimination analysis for the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism was performed with predesigned Applied Biosystems TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays on demand (Assay ID: C__30469648_10). 	Replication cohort We obtained samples of peripheral whole blood from elite athletes (during years 2003 and 2004, and 2009–2010) and controls (2004 and 2011) and extracted genomic DNA using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Genotype analyses were performed during June–July 2011 in the Science and Research Centre of the Beijing Sports University (Beijing, China). 	For high-throughput genotyping of the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism, we used a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). 	Primers for PCR and single base extension were designed by using the Assay Designer software package (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). The DNA sample was diluted to 5 ng/µl, and 1 µl of DNA was combined with 0.95 µl of water, 0.625 µl of PCR buffer containing 15 mM MgCl2, 1 µl of 2.5 mM dNTP, 0.325 ul of 25 mM MgCl2, 1 µl of PCR primers and 0.1 µl of 5units/µl HotStar Taq (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Results	RefSNP	Genotypic and allele frequencies were compared among sedentary controls and endurance athletes using the χ2 test. 	We used logistic regression analysis to analyse the association of the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism with elite endurance athletic status.

Genotype distributions met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both controls and athletes (Table 1). Genotype (P = 0.591) and minor allele (A) frequencies were similar in sedentary controls and athletes (P = 0.978).

The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for the association between carriage of the A allele of the ACSL1 rs6552828 polymorphism and athletic status was 0.997 (0.819–1.214). 	Discussion The main finding of our study was that the ACSL1 rs6552828 SNP, located in the first intron of the ACSL1 gene, 715 bp and 718 bp upstream of exon 2 and the start codon, respectively, was not associated with elite endurance athletic status in Spanish men, yet a marginal association was found in Chinese men.

The ACSL1 gene is a putative candidate to explain individual variability in endurance performance, as well as in some health related phenotypes, owing to its potential role in aerobic metabolic adaptations to regular exercise, at the adypocite, cardiomyocite, liver and skeletal muscle fiber level. Long-chain acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetase (ACSL) isoenzymes, of which ACSL1 is the main and most studied isoenzyme convert free fatty acids (FFA) to acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) in an ATP-dependent manner, simultaneously activating and trapping FFA within cells [13]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	ACSL1 is a candidate to explain individual differences in some several disease and endurance exercise-related phenotypes. 	Recent research has shown that the ACSL1 rs9997745 polymorphism influences the risk of metabolic disease, most likely via disturbances in FFA metabolism [16]; no individual or combined association was however found for other SNPs of this gene, i.e. rs4862417, rs13120078, rs12503643 and the one we studied here, rs6552828. 	A GWA study recently conducted by Bouchard et al. [3] on 324,611 SNPs identified a set of 21 SNPs accounting for 49% of the variance in the trainability of VO2max [3]. The strongest association with the training response of VO2max was found to ACSL1 rs6552828.

Interestingly, in our study the A allele was less frequent in elite male endurance Chinese athletes compared with their controls. It must be also kept in mind that the A allele was the major allele in the Chinese cohort, which highlights inter-ethnic differences in genotype distributions. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828		RefSNP	It must be also kept in mind that the A allele was the major allele in the Chinese cohort, which highlights inter-ethnic differences in genotype distributions. 	To our knowledge, there is no functional data on the rs6552828 SNP; thus, we can only speculate about mechanisms underlying our findings. 	The intronic location of this SNP has the potential to affect mRNA stability or to modulate ACSL1 gene transcriptional activity. Indeed, non-coding SNPs could regulate the alternative splicing of mRNA leading to changes in gene expression [17] and phenotype traits [18], [19]. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828		RefSNP	Another possibility is that the ACSL1 is part of the group of candidate genes, among which are calcineurin genes [21], but many of which are yet to be identified, whose cumulative effect explains, at least partly, individual variations in endurance performance in the Chinese Han population. 	It could also be possible that the rs6552828 SNP may be a surrogate marker for other functional ACSL1 SNPs in the region. 	We believe the results of our study are overall valid, as all the following criteria were met [2]: cases clearly presented the main study phenotype (i.e. being an elite athlete), as we studied some of the best elite endurance athletes world-wide, participants within both cohorts were ethnically-matched, genetic assessment was accurate and unbiased, genotype distributions were in HWE in the control group of the two cohorts, and we used a replication cohort of a different ethnic origin. Current body of knowledge on genetic factors associated with exercise phenotypes and athletic status comes mainly from research performed on Caucasian populations. 
PMC3400600	rs6552828	Discussion	RefSNP	Further investigations are thus needed with other ethnic groups and populations as the one studied here, i.e. representing an important fraction of the total planet population. 	In summary, our findings suggest that the ACSL1 gene polymorphism rs6552828 is marginally associated with male elite endurance status in Chinese (Han) population yet such association was not found in Chinese females or in a different (Caucasian) cohort. 	Our findings exemplify the need for further genetic association studies in the field of sport sciences to use at least two cohorts of a different ethnic background in order to increase the generalisability of their results.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	The N-terminal of TnT, the C-terminal of TnT and the C-terminal of TnI are not present in the crystal structure and are not displayed herein. 	Molecular coordinates were obtained from 1YTZ.pdb. 	TnC is a member of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins with four Ca2+-binding sites. TnC consists of two globular lobes, the N- and the C-lobe, connected with a central linker.

Our choice of PDB system was driven by the considerations that while both Ca2+- and apo-form crystal structures are available for the core domain of the skeletal troponin complex, 1YTZ.pdb is the only available structure in the Ca2+ form. The 5TnC.pdb crystal structure of Herzberg and James is the first crystal structure of EF-hand type Ca2+-binding proteins, is determined at 2 Å resolution, and is widely considered to be the gold standard for skeletal TnC structural description.

We did not incorporate these residues in our simulations.

PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	We performed equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on the TnC subunit (residues 3 to 161) and the core domain of the troponin complex. 	The following set of systems were examined: first, open TnC systems where Ca2+ was removed from sites I and II, only from site I, only from site II and not removed at all (molecular coordinates derived from Ca2+-saturated structure - 1YTZ.pdb); second, the closed, deactivated TnC domain (molecular coordinates derived from the Ca2+-depleted TnC - 5TnC.pdb); and third, the troponin molecule Ca2+-saturated and Ca2+-depleted state (molecular coordinates derived from 1YTZ.pdb). 	Thus, we simulated the open activated skeletal Tn and TnC domain in the Ca2+-saturated state; and then to model the structural events leading to thin filament relaxation, we removed Ca2+ from sites I and II of open TnC and simulated the resulting structure. To access the conformational coupling between the two sites and the contribution of each site to the structural transitions of the N-lobe we also simulated structures with only one site occupied.

The 5TnC based system served to establish a frame of reference to which to compare the structural transitions discerned from the simulations. 	Dynamics of the N-lobe and Closing of the A/B Helix Hydrophobic Pocket The level of openness of the TnC N-lobe hydrophobic pocket in the holo and apo state and the closing of the pocket can be observed and measured in a molecular dynamics simulation trajectory. 
PMC3598806	5TnC		PDBe	To establish a consistent metric across all our simulations we measured the openness of the pocket as the distance d between the alpha-C atoms of the first residue of the A helix (GLU16) and the last residue of the B helix (LEU48). 	For the closed 5TnC system the pocket openness distance was d = 13.65 Å±0.71 (averaged over the duration of the simulation). 	For the open, Ca2+-depleted TnC system the pocket rapidly closed to d = 13.23 Å±0.60 (averaged over the last 10 ns of the 3 TnC2Ca2+ simulations). The open, Ca2+-saturated systems TnC pocket closed to d = 15.74 Å±1.29 (averaged over the last 10 ns of the 3 TnC4Ca2+ simulations). 
PMC3598806	5TnC		PDBe	The GLY34O-PHE74HN distance showed the greatest fluctuation: it ranged between 2 Å and 8 Å in the simulations of the Ca2+-depleted state. 	The distances observed for the four H-bonding partners compared well to the distances measured in the apo TnC simulation (5TnC). 	Semi-closed State of TnC N-lobe Ca2+-saturated or semi-saturated TnC reaches a semi-closed conformation in the absence of TnI. 
PMC3598806	1YTZ	Results	PDBe	From electron microscope images [51], we do know that the troponin complex can be divided into two domains-the tail and core domains. 	Crystal structures of the core domain are only available to date and PDB entry 1YTZ is one of them. 	The tail domain is known to interact with tropomyosin [2]. Among the core domain, the inhibitory region and the C-terminal mobile domain of TnI are thought to interact with actin in the apo state [2].

PMC3730352	AB065375	Introduction	ENA	For example, novel mitochondrial Open Reading Frames (ORFs) can arise from gene duplication. 	In bivalve molluscs, a cox2 duplication is found in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Bivalvia, Veneridae) (Okazaki M and Ueshima R, unpublished data; GenBank AB065375.1) and in the mussel Musculista senhousia (Bivalvia, Mytilidae) (Passamonti et al. 2011). 	Moreover, nad2 duplication is at the origin of two novel ORFs in the oyster genus Crassostrea (Bivalvia, Ostreidae) (Wu et al. 2012). Extra elements were also found in Cnidaria mtDNA, either from duplication of extant genes or not: a duplicated cox1 in some hydroidolinan hydrozoans (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa), two novel ORFs in Medusozoa (Kayal et al. 2011), and a novel ORF in every octocoral (Cnidaria, Anthozoa) that has been screened to date (McFadden et al. 2010). 
PMC3730352	GU001953	Results	ENA	Long PCR products were used as a template to amplify single overlapping segments of the LURs and the FUR2 with standard PCRs.

PMC3757009	KC952001	Results	ENA	To address the regulatory role of cytokinin in rhizoid formation during Rosa canina regeneration, we cloned a type-A ARR homologous gene. 	A cDNA fragment was amplified using degenerate primers and then the full-length cDNA (accession number KC952001) named RcRR1 was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). 	The full transcript of RcRR1 is 939 bp in length and contains a 702 bp open reading frame, a 116 bp 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and a 121 bp 3′-UTR. To characterize the function of RcRR1 in Rosa canina, we performed phylogenetic analysis using MEGA4. 
PMC3791179	rs5743808	Table	RefSNP	No polymorphisms in TLR1 or TLR2 were associated with LD. 	A TLR6 polymorphism, 359T>C (rs5743808), was associated with an elevated risk of LD in genotypic and dominant (OR 5.83, p=7.9×10−5) models. 	The increased risk in persons with 359 TC or CC genotypes was further enhanced among smokers. In a multivariate model, 359T>C was associated with a higher risk of LD (OR 4.24, p=0.04), than any other variable, including age and smoking. 
PMC3791179	rs3821985	Methods	RefSNP	We analyzed 14 candidate polymorphisms, 5 in TLR1, 3 in TLR2, and 6 in TLR6 in 98 cases and 268 controls. 	Two TLR6 SNPs (rs3821985 and rs3775073) had HWE p values ≤ 0.001 and were not analyzed further. 	Since TLR1 and TLR6 are contiguous genes on chromosome 4p14, we evaluated the linkage disequilibrium pattern for the 5 TLR1 and 4 TLR6 SNPs in the control population (Fig. 2). The majority of R2 values were <0.65, indicating a low to moderate degree of linkage.

Two SNPs in TLR6 (rs3821985 and rs3775073) showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among control subjects (p<0.001) and were not further evaluated. 	The remaining twelve SNPs passed the HWE p value test (p≥0.001) and were assessed for association with LD, using a genotypic model in the first-pass analysis; those that had a significant association (p<0.05) were then investigated under dominant and recessive genetic models. In the dominant model, carriers of the less common allele (01 and 11 genotypes) were compared with homozygous subjects for the major allele (00 genotype).

PMC3804621	KF152923	Results	ENA	To evaluate and compare the structure of the OitaAP2 gene with that of known AP2-like genes, the OitaAP2 locus was amplified from genomic DNA using multiple primer pairs. 	Sequence comparison of the OitaAP2 and OitaAP2_ISO cDNAs with the genomic sequence of the OitaAP2 locus (accession number KF152923) revealed the presence of 10 exons and 9 introns (Figure 1d). 	This gene structure appears conserved for the AP2 genes of Arabidopsis, grapevine [55] and apple [56], all of which constitute 10 exons and 9 introns. The twelve AP2-like genes of the orchid E. pusilla show an intron number ranging from 7 to 11; however, the specific structure of the EpAP2-11 gene, the putative ortholog of OitaAP2, is not reported [41].

PMC3843656	rs11209026	Introduction	RefSNP	Different studies have identified IL23R as a susceptibility factor associated to multiple inflammatory conditions [16,17,18]. 	In these studies several independent signals located within IL23R locus were suggested; however, only the R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism, whose minor allele plays a protective role for several autoimmune disease, appear to have a functional involvement [19,20]. 	Additionally, the rs1495965 polymorphism has been reported as the stronger IL23R association with Behçet’s disease (BD), a systemic autoimmune disease involving uveitis, in a previous combined meta-analysis of two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [21,22]. On the other hand, STAT4 has been also identified as another shared susceptibility locus [23,24].

Using a two-locus model, combinations of MMP8 and rs44707 in ADAM33, and MMP8 and rs40401 in IL-3, were identified, with mean cross-validation consistencies reaching 45.0%.

The finding that an MMP8 allele was most strongly related to asthma development indicates that metalloproteinase function is crucial to the airflow limitation process involved in this disease. The main pathogenic mechanism of bronchial asthma involves a particular form of chronic inflammation, in which the increase in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in the respiratory tract membrane and exfoliation of the respiratory epithelium cause bronchial hyperresponsiveness, followed by airway remodeling.1 These pathological changes result from the interactions between the inflammatory mediators and the various cytokines produced by the infiltrated cells or the structural cells.2 
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	In this study, we investigated whether any of 31 SNPs in genes encoding cytokines or monokines are associated with asthma development in a Japanese population. 	In a single locus model, we found that MMP8 rs17099451, and in a two-locus model, the combination of this rs17099451 in MMP8 SNP and rs44707 in ADAM33, as well as this MMP8 SNP and rs40401 IL-3, were selected as significant asthma development risk markers. 	The single locus model of the MMP8 was consistently selected, and the balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluation against the test data were superior in the single locus model compared with those in the two-locus model. In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model. 
PMC3911802	rs40401		RefSNP	The single locus model of the MMP8 was consistently selected, and the balanced accuracy and sensitivity evaluation against the test data were superior in the single locus model compared with those in the two-locus model. 	In these analyses, MMP8 rs17099451 and IL-3 rs40401 had the most significant effect on asthma development according to the 2 × 2 dominant model. 	It is known that MMP8 is involved in the pathogenesis of some diseases, such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchiectasis.18–20 Until recently, MMP8 has been thought to be produced only by neutrophils, but it is now known to be expressed in some other cell types, including articular chondrocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cytotrophoblasts.21–25 Using an MMP8 knockout mouse model, Gueders et al. revealed an important role for MMP8 in the control of neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration during allergen-induced lung inflammation; they also showed that the anti-inflammatory effect of MMP8 is partly caused by regulation of inflammatory cell apoptosis.26 In asthma patients, a significant inverse correlation between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid MMP8 levels and FEV1 and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid–activated MMP8 forms and FEV1 was detected.27 Inhaled budesonide normalized the MMP8/tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 ratio in asthmatic children via up-regulation of tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 production and down-regulation of MMP8 production by airway macrophages.28 Overall, these data suggest that MMP8 and its activation have an important role in the airway destruction, healing, remodeling, and treatment response in asthma. 
PMC3911802	rs40401	Abstract	RefSNP	Furthermore, IL-3 is a cytokine produced by active T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils, which stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors.30 Moreover, IL-3 mRNA-expressing cells and IL-3 production are increased in asthma patients; this increase in IL-3 is independent of eosinophil number.31 Park et al.32 reported that one exonic SNP (in exon 1), IL3 + 79T > C (Ser27Pro) showed significant association with the risk of asthma and atopy. 	The Pro-allele had dominant, protective effects against the development of asthma in nonatopic subjects (p = -.002) and also showed significant association with the risk of atopy in normal control subjects (p = 0.007).32 We also found that rs40401 in IL-3 had the most significant effect in the 2 × 2 dominant model analysis, which suggests that the minor C allele may have a suppressing effect on asthma development. 	Van Eerdewegh et al. reported that ADAM33 on chromosome 20p13 was linked to asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, using a genomewide scan of 460 white families.9 The ADAM33 gene group appears to be related to proliferation, differentiation, or migration of fibroblasts, muscle fibroblasts, or smooth muscle cells, factors that are related to bronchial hyperresponsiveness or bronchial remodeling. However, these proteins do not appear to be involved in the respiratory epithelium, which is related to asthmatic immunologic or inflammatory components.9,33 Although a previous genomewide association study in a Japanese population did not implicate ADAM33 among the three new susceptibility loci for adult asthma,34 another study suggested the involvement of ADAM33 in the development of childhood asthma among the Japanese.35

PMC4030988	1R8J		PDBe	It is speculated that E-to-H unit must be the basic structure in the early stage of the evolution of globin-like fold proteins, and this unit might grow to various globin-fold proteins during evolution. 	Proteins in other folds, for example, 1R8J, 1XL3 and so on, might also have grew from each ancestor protein with a structure similar to the E-to-H helix unit during evolution. 	Among the hit proteins, 1R8J is interesting because this protein is composed of two domains, one is the E–to-H unit and the other is the domain, while the other hit proteins are all proteins. This also indicates that the E-to-H helix unit widely exists in the structural space of proteins.

PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to search for a 3D structure similar to that of the E-to-H helix unit, a 3D structure comparison program, Dalilite (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/star), was used [4] with the PDB structures. 	The 3D coordinates of the Cα atoms in the E-to-H units in soy bean leghemoglobin (PDB: 1FSL) were used as a query because the E-to-H unit in this protein has been confirmed as a folding core [2,3,26]. 	To do this, we prepared a 3D structure database, with Dalilite searches for the E-to-H-unit-like structures, by excluding the globin-like fold proteins from the whole PDB structures. Because all the globin-like fold proteins are expected to potentially possess an E-to-H unit, any PDB structures annotated as “globin-like fold” at SCOP were discarded from the Dali search. 
PMC4030988	1FSL	Methods	PDBe	In order to identify the conserved residues across the E-to-H helix unit of each protein hit by the Dali search, homologous amino acid sequences of the helix unit were collected from the amino acid sequence database, UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/), by means of BLAST. 	The amino acid sequence of the E-to-H helix unit of a representative protein for each family as well as that of leghemoglobin (1FSL) were queried against the UniRef100 which is non-redundant set of the UniProt database. 	A threshold of the expected value of a BLAST search for a hit amino acid sequence retrieval was taken sufficiently low value, e = 0.001, to ensure that homologous sequences were obtained. We made a multiple alignment of the obtained amino acid sequences for each query protein using MUSCLE [30].

Highest similarity of the LSU sequences was found with “Mollisia incrustata” GenBank GU727556; however, this sequence does not appear to be congeneric with other Mollisia sequences on GenBank (data not shown) and thus the application of the supposed taxonomic lineage of Mollisia (Leotiomycetes; Helotiales; Dermateaceae) would not be confirmed here. 	Examination of the blast results also did not result in a clear affinity to any of the classes, with a more or less equal similarity to both Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes and therefore this genus is treated here as incertae sedis. It is quite possible that the genus belongs to a class that is currently not represented in the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database.

After rotational and translational searching with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 ▶), water and lipid molecules were added on the basis of the 2F o − F c map and the structure was refined by several cycles of simulated-annealing and individual B-factor refinements. The final refinement of the protein structure using REFMAC5 resulted in an R cryst of 21.4% and an R free of 23.4% (Table 1 ▶). 
PMC4188009	1c3w	Figure	PDBe	It has been reported that the neutral purple form is destabilized in bR-containing vesicles reconstituted with egg lethicin, in which the transition from the neutral purple form into an inactive red form with λmax at 480 nm takes place at pH 6.5 (Nasuda-Kouyama et al., 1990 ▶). 	With respect to the protein structure in the P63 crystal, Glu194 OE2 in the structural model solved at 1.55 Å resolution (PDB entry 1c3w) has an unusually large B factor (62 Å2; Luecke et al., 1999 ▶). 	(The B factor of Glu199 OE2 of aR2 in the H32 crystal is 31 Å2.) It is possible that the conformation of Glu194bR in the P63 crystal represents a mixed state between the neutral purple form and the alkaline pink form. There is another caveat to the structural model of bR that was built using the P63 crystal.

Figure 3 shows the modeled NS2 and the position of rare codon clusters. 	For NS3 protein, Sherlocc program identified TrEMBL entries Q9QIX6_9HEPC.The NS3 protein has 631 residue and three rare codon clusters found in polyproteins extending from amino acids 1062-1069, 1096-1100 and 1132-1136. NS3 is a multifunctional protein and the N-terminal domain (residues 1027–1119) contains eight β strands rather than six, including one strand contributed by NS4A.44 This array of b strands gives rise to a b sheet that superimposes with most of the distorted barrel found in the N-terminus of chymotrypsin.45 Result of modeling showed that these three rare codon clusters lie between strands A1-B1, E1-F and A2-B2 in N-terminal domain of NS3.

Previous studies on the distribution of rare codons clusters were performed on a limited number of proteins or protein families.2 The Sherlocc program and the online Sherlocc Finder Interface are efficient tools that can be used to study the widespread translational pauses in protein families.2 Please note that clusters identified by Sherlocc were compared with cases foundin the literature.2 For example, in the Salmonella phage P22 tail spike protein in which rare codons were previously identified using the MinMax algorithm,15 Sherlocc also identified rare codon clusters in the Salmonella phage P22 tail-spike protein family (PF09251).2 Another case involved the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) protein for which rare codon clusters were identified computationally in a multi-organism sequence alignment of this protein.42 The Sherlocc program also identified rare codon clusters in the CAT protein family (PF00302). 	In the present study, we used Sherlocc program to analyze rare codon clusters in HCV genome and the structure of HCV proteins. The results were interesting and showed that HCV has five rare codon clusters and these rare codon clusters may play an essential role in ensuring proper folding of the protein chain.

PMC4315412	GSE53512	Methods	GEO	T-statistics and log-odds of differential expression with empirical Bayes were computed and adjusted with Benjamini & Hochberg. 	Microarray data is deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus and available under accession number GSE53512. 	For functional annotation Gene Ontology Categories [23] were used. Pathways are annotated corresponding to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [24]. 
PMC4315412	GO:0045087	Results	Gene Ontology (GO)	Validated candidate genes are labelled with asterisk. 	A mapping of Gene Ontology Terms revealed immune system associated functions for Card9 and Defb1 (e.g. ‘positive regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB cascade’, Gene Ontology Term number (GO): 0005737 and ‘innate immune response’, GO:0045087 for Defb1). 	Ephx2 could be mapped to ‘catalytic activity’ (GO: 0003824), ‘metabolic process (GO: 0008152)’ or ‘lipid phosphatase activity’ (GO: 0042577) among others. For Efcab6 only one term was found, i.e. ‘calcium ion binding’ (GO: 0005509). 
PMC4325636	NCT01821118	Discussion	NCT	Anti-amyloid therapies for CAA are under development including ponezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the carboxyl terminus of Aβ40.115 Ponezumab was originally developed for AD immunotherapy, and an acceptable safety profile has been suggested for ponezumab in clinical trials for AD.116,117,118 Currently, ponezumab has been applied to CAA. 	A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is ongoing to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of ponezumab (PF-04360365) in adult patients with probable CAA-related hemorrhages (NCT01821118).119 	Vascular injury secondary to cerebrovascular amyloid deposition (Step 2) is an important target for prevention of CAA-related disorders. Risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms underlying vascular injury leading to CAA-related hemorrhages are discussed below. 
PMC4337061	JQ799139	Methods	ENA	TO-cells originating from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) head kidney leukocytes characterized to possess macrophage/dendritic-like properties [10,11], were propagated at 20°C in HMEM (Eagle’s minimal essential medium [MEM] with Hanks’ balanced salt solution [BSS]) supplemented with L-glutamine, MEM nonessential amino acids, gentamicin sulfate, and 10% FBS. 	The virus used to inoculate the TO-cells has previously been described [6] and characterized by sequencing to be salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV-3) (Genebank accession JQ799139). 	One batch of TO-cells was treated with 500 ng/ml of Atlantic salmon recombinant Type I in triplicates and another was infected with SAV-3 at MOI 1 when the cells were 80% confluent. Thereafter, both the type I IFN treated and SAV-3 infected cells were incubated at 15°C in maintenance media using HMEM growth media supplemented with 2% FBS.

PMC4337061	DAA64469	Results	ENA	After identifying the 956 co-upregulated (Figure 4B) and 734 co-downregulated genes (Figure 4A) in the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 together with the differentially regulated genes (36 DEGs) of the TO-VS-IFN versus TO-VS-SAV3 shown in Figure 4C, we manually narrowed the scope of DEGs to 60 genes induced by type I IFNs in both the TO-VS-IFN and TO-VS-SAV3 groups in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN treatment and SAV-3 infection in TO-cells from the 60 selected genes obtained from the entire transcriptome. 	And as such, we identified 16 genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway (Table 3), 22 genes belonging to different antiviral effector families (Table 4), 12 genes associated with adaptive immune responses (Table 5) and 10 apoptosis associated genes (Table 6) as shown below.Table 3 Repertoire of genes associated with type I IFN signaling pathway  Family  Gene name  Abbr  Gene ID

PMC4427008	rs1544410	Article	RefSNP	In fact, VDR polymorphisms have been identified in various diseases, such as cancer [25] or cancer risk [26], asthma [27], and kidney diseases [28]. 	The best-studied polymorphisms include BsmI (rs1544410), FokI (rs2228570), TaqI (rs731236), and ApaI (rs7975232).

PMC4479853	rs1420101	Introduction	RefSNP	SNPs associated with childhood asthma could be consistently linked to transcript levels of ORMDL3, a member of a gene family that encodes transmembrane proteins anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum.13 The second asthma GWAS analyzed sequence variants affecting blood eosinophil counts in Icelanders, and the ten most significant SNPs were further studied in 12118 Europeans and 5212 East Asians including Koreans. 	While SNP rs1420101 in the IL1RL1/IL18R1 gene cluster at 2q12 was strongly associated with asthma (p=5.5×10-12), its OR was still below 1.5. 	In 2010, a large-scale, consortium-based GWAS of asthma with 10365 asthmatics and 16110 controls confirmed the association of the previously defined SNPs including the ones in ORMDL3 and IL1RL1,14 yet their ORs were within the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Subsequently, GWAS has been applied to determine whether disease-related intermediate phenotypes are causal or secondary to the disease progress.15 A meta-analysis on total IgE concentration showed strong association with HLA-DQ (rs9469220) in Caucasians16 and CRIM1 in Koreans (rs848512 and rs711254).17

To generate retroviral producers, the Phoenix-gp packaging cell line was transfected with pSF91/eGFP or pSF91/DsRed, and a plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein.

PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	Crystal structures of deuterated sodium molybdate dihydrate and sodium tungstate dihydrate from time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction 	High-precision structural parameters for Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O are reported based on refinement of high-resolution time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data. 	Complementary Raman spectra are also provided. Time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction data have been measured from ∼90 mol% deuterated isotopologues of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O at 295 K to a resolution of sin (θ)/λ = 0.77 Å−1. 
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	Since the incoherent neutron scattering cross section of 1H is large (80.3 barns) it is usual to prepare perdeuterated specimens whenever possible (the incoherent cross section of 2D being only 2.1 barns) as this optimises the coherent Bragg scattering signal above the background, reducing the counting times required for a high-precision structure refinement from many days to a matter of hours on the instrument used for these measurements. 	These data were therefore measured using Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O samples. 	The occurrence of polyhydrated forms of both Na2MoO4 and Na2WO4 suggests that both would be excellent candidates for the formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes with water-soluble organics, such as amino acids, producing metal-organic crystals with potentially useful optical properties (cf., glycine lithium molybdate; Fleck et al., 2006 ▸). High-pressure polymorphs of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O are indicated from Raman scattering studies (Luz-Lima et al., 2010 ▸; Saraiva et al., 2013 ▸). 
PMC4518980	2D2O	Supplementary material	PDBe	The clusters corner-share via O6 to create a ‘slab’ parallel to (010) (Fig. 2 ▸ b). 	The mean Na—O bond lengths are statistically identical in Na2MoO4·2D2O and Na2WO4·2D2O being ∼1.6% longer in the NaO6 octa­hedra and ∼2.3% shorter in the NaO5 polyhedra than Na—O bonds in the anhydrous crystals (Fortes, 2015 ▸). 	The agreement in Na—O bond lengths with the X-ray single crystal studies of Capitelli et al. (2006 ▸) and Farrugia (2007 ▸) is very good. Overall, the agreement in bond lengths and angles for the two independently refined data sets is excellent (Tables 1 ▸ and 2 ▸). 
PMC4518980	2D2O		PDBe	Presumably the error in Farrugia’s analysis arose due to the substantial absorption correction required (μ = 18.7 mm−1) for an accurate structure refinement from X-ray single-crystal data. 	Raman spectra of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2MoO4·2D2O were first reported by Mahadevan Pillai et al. (1997 ▸); subsequently, Luz-Lima et al. (2010 ▸) and Saraiva et al. (2013 ▸) published the Raman spectra of Na2MoO4·2H2O and Na2WO4·2H2O as a function of temperature (13–300 K) and as a function of hydro­static pressure (to 5 GPa). 	Both compounds exhibit evidence of a ‘conformational change’ on cooling through 120 K: the molybdate appears to undergo two high-pressure phase transitions, one at 3 GPa and the second at 4 GPa; the tungstate apparently undergoes a high-pressure phase transition at 3.9 GPa. The Raman spectra reported here (Figs. 
PMC4518980	2D2O		PDBe	Raman spectra were acquired with a B&WTek i-Raman plus portable spectrometer; this device uses a 532 nm laser (37 mW power at the fiber-optic probe tip) to stimulate Raman scattering, which is measured in the range 170–4000 cm−1 with a spectral resolution of 3 cm−1. 	Data were collected for 600 sec at 17 mW for Na2MoO4·2H2O (as bought), 180 sec at 37 mW for Na2MoO4·2D2O, 300 sec at 17 mW for Na2WO4·2H2O (as bought) and 220 sec at 37 mW for Na2WO4·2D2O; after summation, the background was removed and peaks fitted using Pseudo-Voigt functions in OriginPro (OriginLab, Northampton MA). 	These data are provided as an electronic supplement in the form of an ASCII file. Small qu­anti­ties of ordinary hydrogen were found to be present in both specimens, the proportion being determined by the ratio of the areas under the ν 1/ν 3 (H2O) bands after normalisation relative to the height of the strong ν 1 (XO4 2−) band.

Intuitively, the statistically significant chromatin interactions in cell line GM12878-I are more dispersedly distributed compared with those in cell line IMR90-I, which is accurately captured by interaction blocks and the parameter AP. Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90.

Together with aforementioned functional annotation, the structural change indicates that this TAD is activated in cell line IMR90. Consistently, the increase of active epigenomic and transcription signals (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K36mes, RNAPII and RNASeq) validates the increased transcription activity in cell line IMR90-I (Figure 3).

Furthermore, homozygous ALDH1A3 missense and nonsense mutations in humans have been linked to anophthalmia and microphthalmia (MIM: 615113; A/M) with some affected individuals also exhibiting autistic traits [18–23]. 	Though no clear evidence supports a link between variants in ALDH1A3 with autism, mouse studies show that lack of Aldh1a3 (Gene NC_000073.6) results in abnormal GABAergic neuronal differentiation in the forebrain basal ganglia [24]. Malfunctions in this inhibitory system have been found to be associated to mental disorders like ASD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [25,26]. 
PMC4564166	601705	Introduction	OMIM	This overexpression has also been reported in ASD children [32]. 	Besides T-cell immunodeficiency, mutations in FOXN1 have also been observed together with congenital alopecia and nail dystrophy (MIM: 601705). 	A homozygote mutation in FOXN1 was reported in a 15-week-old fetus with anencephaly and severe neural tube defect (MIM: 601705) [33]. As ALDH1A3 is an enzyme responsible for Retinoic Acid (RA) synthesis, and FOXN1 has been found to regulated by RORA (gene involved in RA cascade) [17], together with RA’s major role in gene expression regulation during brain development [34], it was questioned if RA might possibly regulate ALDH1A3 and FOXN1 through RA receptors (RARs).

PMC4591669	P50694	Results	UniProt	The most abundant contig by far was Pa_24402 with a FPKM sum of 523 781 over the 24 samples, or 4.2 million mapped reads total. 	Its best B2G hit was GenBank accession P50694, a glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase or thaumatin-like protein, the most abundant soluble protein in the ripe sweet cherry fruit.59 Five other ‘Top 40’ contigs also had B2G hits to published P. avium sequences: Pa_11846 (P. avium allergen 1), Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid transfer protein), Pa_00414 (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), Pa_21625 (thaumatin-like protein) and Pa_03818 (anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase). 	Altogether, based on the best hit descriptions, 11 of the 40 most abundant contigs represent proteins likely related to abiotic and biotic stresses, such as oxidative stress and responses to pathogens. Also, three further contigs described as putative transport proteins may also be associated with defense responses such as metallothionein-like proteins60 and lipid transport protein.61 The latter are predominantly expressed in surface tissues,61 including citrus and tomato fruit.26,27 While relevant in constitutive and acute stress responses, many stress defense proteins were proposed to have other, developmental functions as well. 
PMC4591669	IPR002022	Results	InterPro	The corresponding pectate lyase may be involved in cell wall loosening and rearrangement during the rapid cell fruit growth occurring at this time. 	The finding is in line with the expression peak of the apple pectate lyase MdPL1 in growing apple.72 In our transcriptome, a total of eight contigs contained the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022), four of which were predicted to represent full-length ORFs. 	Three of these contigs were in cluster NG1: The above mentioned Pa_07062 (NG1-QT44), Pa_06731, and, in cluster NG1-QT18, Pa_03006. The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 
PMC4591669	BG319625	Results	ENA	The latter one had two prominent expression maxima, 24 and 66 DAFB, while the former ones were not expressed during Stage III. 	Interestingly, contig Pa_03006 was the best hit of a pectate lyase from sour cherry (PcPEL1, GenBank BG319625; 98% identity), which was highly expressed during the Stage III, and only slightly upregulated during Stage I in developing sour cherry.73 	In cluster NG1-QT42, with expression maxima between 3 and 17 DAFB, the most specific, over-represented terms were related to ribosomes and translation. This is consistent with the high cell division activity characteristic for Stage I. Over-represented GO terms among the 29 exocarp-specific contigs of this cluster were carboxylesterase and tyrosine decarboxylase activities (Supplementary Table S8, Supplementary Table S4). 
PMC4591669	JU090722	Results	ENA	Notable contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 further included two putative transcription factors (an AP2 family member, Pa_00973 and an MYB family member, Pa_23194, best B2G hit MYB66), a putative (hemi)cellulase (Pa_10720) and a lipid transport protein (Pa_22556, best BG2 hit uncharacterized GPI-anchored protein). 	The best PAVE hit of the latter contig was another assembled sweet cherry cDNA encoding a putative lipid transport protein, PaLTPG1 (GenBank JU090722), tentatively involved in cuticle deposition in sweet cherry fruit.29 Other exocarp-specific, putatively cuticle-related contigs in cluster NG1-QT39 included Pa_14044 and Pa_04572. 	The best BG2 hit of Pa_14044 was the putative aminoacrylate hydrolase RutD from Vitis vinifera, while the contig is also the best sweet cherry hit of the Arabidopsis protein BODYGUARD (BDG) (e-value 10×10−169, 61% amino-acid identity), an extracellular α/β superfamily hydrolase essential for cuticle formation.74 Pa_14044 was the only contig in the assembled sweet cherry fruit transcriptome to contain the multi domain PLN03087, ‘BODYGUARD 1 domain containing hydrolase’ (NCBI conserved domains search75). Contig Pa_04572, with the best B2G hit GDSL esterase/lipase LTL1, was the second best sweet cherry hit (e-value 10−157, 86% similarity) of the tomato CD1 protein, a GDSL lipase and putative cutin polymerase in tomato fruit epidermis.76,77 However, the best hit of tomato CD1 was Pa_16669 (e-value 10−159, 86% similarity), a member of cluster NG1-QT36 (Supplementary Fig. S3a).

Contig Pa_04572, with the best B2G hit GDSL esterase/lipase LTL1, was the second best sweet cherry hit (e-value 10−157, 86% similarity) of the tomato CD1 protein, a GDSL lipase and putative cutin polymerase in tomato fruit epidermis.76,77 However, the best hit of tomato CD1 was Pa_16669 (e-value 10−159, 86% similarity), a member of cluster NG1-QT36 (Supplementary Fig. S3a). Cluster NG-QT36 also contained Pa_22209, another exocarp-specific GDSL lipase/esterase homolog with a full-length ORF. 
PMC4591669	IPR012392	Results	InterPro	Exocarp-specific contigs with probable relevance for wax biosynthesis included Pa_00478 (best hit WAX2, or CER1), Pa_06166 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) and the Top 40 contig Pa_29501 (non-specific lipid-transfer protein, allergen Pru av 3) in cluster NG1-QT28, and the unclustered contig Pa_08907 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 19). 	Contigs Pa_08907 and Pa_06166 were, together with Pa_01742 (NG1-QT43), the only three exocarp-specific contigs in Group 1F, which contained a full-length ORF and the InterPro motif very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (IPR012392), essential in wax biosynthesis. 	Pa_08907 was present at much lower levels than the other two but, interestingly, its expression peaked at equal levels during Stage I and during Stage III, while the two major KCS transcripts were abundant mainly during Stage I. Based on the expression patterns, cluster NG1 was likely to contain most of the contigs with potential relevance to the process of our key interest, cuticle formation. 
PMC4591669	ADY15304	Results	ENA	Pa_06479 is the most highly abundant MYB family transcription factor sequence in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome (total FPKM sum 6415). 	The predicted peptide sequence is identical with GenBank ADY15304.1, defined as R2R3-MYB transcription factor from P. avium, and highly similar (85% similarity) with PavMYB10, another previously identified R2R3 MYB factor sequence from sweet cherry.88 PavMYB10 was identified as a main positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the sweet cherry fruit.88,89 Consistent with such a function, the abundance of Pa_06479 increased with reddening of the fruit (Supplementary Fig. S3b and Figure 1a and 1c). 	The differences between the predicted amino acid sequences of Pa_06479 and PavMYB10 are similar to the differences in varying amino-acid residues among the MYB10 protein sequences from several rosaceous species.88 Cluster NG4-QT67, with centroid expression level elevated from 38 DAFB to maturity and an expression peak 66 DAFB, contains a putative pectate lyase, Pa_14097. 
PMC4591669	AY376878	Results	ENA	With Pa_06731 (NG1-QT43), it is the most abundant pectate lyase transcript in the sweet cherry fruit transcriptome. 	It was the best hit of a ripening associated pectate lyase from apple (GenBank AY37687814) and the third best hit of the ripening associated pectate lyase PcPEL1 from sour cherry73 (best hit of PcPEL1 was Pa_03006, NG1-QT18; see above). 	Contig Pa_14097 was more expressed in the exocarp than in the mesocarp (80 DAFB exocarp, 1161±43 FPKM; mesocarp, 245 FPKM), suggesting that in sweet cherry fruit, this ripening associated pectate lyase is mostly relevant for the expansion growth of the exocarp cells. Altogether, the pectate lyase/Amb allergen motif (IPR002022) was identified in eight contigs, four of which were also predicted to contain a full-length ORF.

Other contigs relevant for the cell wall architecture in cluster NG4-QT67 include Pa_09347 (best hit expansin) and Pa_44853 (probable rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme). Both contigs share with Pa_14097 the sharp peak in expression level 66 DAFB, consistent with functions in cell wall re-arrangements that enable the rapid expansion growth at this developmental stage.90 In addition to these cell wall-related contigs in cluster NG4-QT67, contig Pa_02283 (best hit cytidine triphosphate (CTP) synthase 1) also had a sharp expression peak 66 DAFB, with lower but still elevated expression from 73 to 87 DAFB. 
PMC4592530	NCT00274742	Methods	NCT	Simulation parameters were based on data from clinical trials and in vitro studies in human hepatocytes (Table 2). 	Time–concentration IL-6 profiles from patients with NHL receiving blinatumomab (Study MT103-104; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00274742) were used. 	IL-6 parameters for CYP enzyme suppression such as Emin and EC50 were taken from in vitro data (median values) from Dickmann et al.18 Default values supplied by the Simcyp library were adopted for some parameters: the mean degradation constant (kdeg) values for CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9 in the liver were 0.0193, 0.0183, and 0.0067 h−1, respectively; the mean kdeg value in the intestine for both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 was 0.03 h−1.20 CYP1A2 activity in the intestine was not considered because it is not expressed in that tissue.21 It was assumed that the magnitude of IL-6 suppression for CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in the intestine was the same as that in the liver.15,22 In addition, within the Simcyp simulator, it was assumed that IL-6 suppresses the rate of synthesis of CYP450 enzymes in the liver according to the following equation,15 in which [Enzyme]t is the amount of active CYP enzyme at any given time in the liver; [Enzyme]0 is the basal amount of CYP enzyme in the liver; [Enzyme]t = [Enzyme]0 at t = 0; Emin is the minimum CYP enzyme activity (i.e., the maximum suppression) expressed as a fraction of vehicle control; EC50 is the concentration that results in 50% of Emin (i.e., half of the maximum suppressive effect); [I]t is the perpetrator (IL-6) concentration at time t; and kdeg is the degradation rate of each respective CYP enzyme in the liver:

PMC4660618	1KQO	Methods	PDBe	The parameters that were chosen from this server were the best tridimensional model that was generated, the prediction of the Enzyme Commission Number EC number and the gene ontology (GO) terms. 	The tridimensional model that was generated was used for a structural alignment with the HsNMNAT-1 model (PDB ID: 1KQO) (Zhou et al. 2002), which was generated from the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) database and registered on the PDB database (Bernstein et al. 1978). 	This process was performed using UCSF Chimera v.1.8 software (Pettersen et al. 2004). T. cruzi culture and DNA extraction - T. cruziepimastigotes were cultured at 27ºC in Schneider medium (Sigma S9895) that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (Gibco) (Baker & Price 1973, Miralles et al. 2002).

PMC4682451	120435	Introduction	OMIM	Introduction 	Lynch syndrome (MIM #120435) predisposes to the development of colorectal, endometrial, and other cancers [Lynch and de la Chapelle, 2003]. 	It is most commonly caused by constitutional heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, usually MLH1 (MIM #120436) or MSH2 (MIM #609309) [Lynch et al., 2009]. The reported mutations in Lynch syndrome families are genetically heterogeneous and include gross structural alterations such as deletions or inversions, [Wagner et al., 2002] missense, nonsense or frameshift mutations, [Tavtigian et al., 2008] splice site mutations, [Thompson et al., 2014] or variants within MMR gene regulatory regions such as promoter regions [Green et al., 2003].

PMC4682451	164757	Methods	OMIM	The c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants studied in this manuscript have been submitted to the LOVD database at http://www.lovd.nl/MLH1. 	At the age of 38 years, Proband 32 had microsatellite-unstable colorectal cancer with wild-type BRAF (MIM #164757) and loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression (as determined by immunohistochemistry). 	Proband N was a 54-year-old woman who sought advice due to a family history of colorectal neoplasia (Fig. 1). Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 
PMC4682451	600259	Methods	OMIM	Multiplex ligation-dependent PCR amplification (MLPA) was performed using a commercially available kit (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). 	No copy-number alterations were identified in any exons of the MLH1, PMS2 (MIM #600259), MSH2, and MSH6 (MIM #600678) genes in either proband. 	Sequence alterations across the MLH1 and PMS2 genes were further assessed using long-range PCR and Sanger sequencing. No sequence alterations were detected in the MLH1 or PMS2 genes except for the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T heterozygous variants in the MLH1 5′UTR.

PMC4682451	138120	Methods	OMIM	M.CviPI enzyme methylates accessible DNA at GpC sites, whereas nucleosome-bound DNA is inaccessible and remains refractory to GpC methylation. 	The promoter of the HSPA5 (MIM #138120) gene, known to be nucleosome free and accessible, was used as a control for GpC methyltransferase M.CviPl in each sample examined. 	GpCpG sites were excluded from analysis. Nucleosome occupancy was defined as a region ≥150 bp that was inaccessible to M.CviPI. 
PMC4682451	193040	Discussion	OMIM	The VILL c.1164del1 frameshift variant has a MAF of only 0.00008 and is therefore a more recent genetic event within this haplotype. 	The function of VILL is unknown but its homology with the VIL1 (villin [MIM #193040]) gene suggests it may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of microvilli at the epithelial surface of the gut. 	The presence of a constitutional frameshift variant in VILL in Proband 32 raised the possibility that it might explain early-onset cancer. However, this variant is unlikely to be the cause of cancer predisposition because it was absent in Family N in which the c.-28A>G and c.-7C>T variants cosegregated.

PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Introduction	NCT	Results indicated reduced exposure to many potentially harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke following product switching. 	Findings support differences in exposure from the use of various tobacco products and are relevant to the understanding of a risk continuum among tobacco products (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917). 	Introduction Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the USA. 
PMC4720046	NCT02061917	Introduction	NCT	Additionally, these biomarkers account for variations in smoking behaviors among consumers (e.g. puff number, puff volume, puff frequency), unlike the easily quantified and standardized machine-generated mainstream smoke constituent yields (Borgerding & Klus, 2005). 	A randomized, multi-center study of adult cigarette smokers switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus or ultra-low machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes was conducted (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02061917) (Ogden et al., 2015b). 	Subjects’ experience with the randomized product was followed for 24 weeks. A group of never smokers was included for baseline comparisons. 
PMC4722945	NCT01994746	Article	NCT	Exclusion criteria included history of a severe hypoglycemic episode in the month prior to enrollment, pheochromocytoma, or insulinoma; history of seizure disorder; cardiovascular, liver, or kidney disease; use of a β-blocker; or consumption of three or more alcoholic beverages daily. 	Additional protocol details are available at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01994746). 	The Institutional Review Board of each participating institution approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. Enrolled participants underwent two glucagon dosing visits, scheduled 1–4 weeks apart.

PMC4724163	KT594769	Results	ENA	The genome of MaHV-1 is the first metatherian herpesvirus to be sequenced. 	Excluding the genomic termini, which remained unresolved, the final genome length of MaHV-1 was approximately 140.1 kbp (Fig. 1) [GenBank:KT594769], larger than previously predicted. 	This difference appears to be due to a larger than predicted inverted repeat region [15]. This included a 98.8 kbp UL region and a 15.3 kbp US region flanked by 13 kbp inverted repeat sequences (IRS/TRS). 
PMC4724163	BAP00706	Results	UniProt	Comparison of other viral core genes yielded similar clustering patterns. 	Comparison of the MaHV-1 UL27 and UL30 ORFs with those of the recently sequenced fruit bat herpesvirus 1 (FbHV-1) [GenBank:BAP00706 and GenBank:YP_009042092; UL27 and UL30, respectively] showed that these ORFs shared 71 and 67 % pairwise aa identity, respectively (83 and 78 % aa similarity). 	This similarity is comparable to that seen between MaHV-1 and HHV-1/HHV-2 (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which may offer some insight into their evolutionary relationship, for example, may suggest transmission of herpesviruses from primates to bats, and then to marsupials. Sequencing of herpesviruses from other metatherians, as well as other Australasian mammals, will be needed to determine the significance of this clustering.Table 1Predicted open reading frames (ORFs) identified in different structural regions of the Macropodid herpesvirus 1 genome and percentage pairwise amino acid identity to ORFs in related alphaherpesviruses% aa pairwise identity# ORFLength (nt)Length (aa)Description (putative) § MaHV2MaHV4HHV1HHV2Unique short region US11392463Infected cell protein 22; ICP222935 US2867288Tegument protein4949 US31449482Protein kinase5659 US4360119Glycoprotein G; predicted non-functional59633235 US61188395Glycoprotein D745657 US71392463Glycoprotein I583839 US81599532Glycoprotein E633432 PW2342113Unique hypothetical PW3582193Unique hypothetical PW41023340Unique hypothetical PW51233410Unique hypotheticalInverted repeat region PW1453150Unique hypothetical ICP437081235Infected cell protein 4; ICP45150 TS951316Thymidylate synthase; host-derived ICP34.5900299Infected cell protein 34.5; ICP34.56256 ICP01629542Infected cell protein 0; ICP05051Unique long region UL1579192Glycoprotein L4147 UL2906301Uracil-DNA glycosylase5960 UL52601866Helicase-primase helicase subunit7373 UL62007668Capsid portal protein6263 UL7888295Tegument protein5149 UL82253750Helicase-primase subunit3839 UL92616871DNA replication origin-binding helicase7070 UL101347448Glycoprotein M5148 UL1124681Myristoylated tegument protein4559 UL121749582Alkaline exonuclease; deoxyribonuclease5656 UL131845614Tegument serine/threonine protein kinase4847 UL14645214Tegument protein6063 UL152100699DNA packaging terminase subunit 17071 UL161098365Tegument protein5154 UL172184727DNA packaging tegument protein5150 UL18951316Capsid triplex subunit 26868 UL1941311376Major capsid protein6970 UL20648215Envelope protein4543 UL211596531Tegument protein4343 UL222631876Glycoprotein H4545 UL231062353Thymidine kinase764244 UL24702233Nuclear protein5253 UL251740579DNA packaging tegument protein6161 UL261761586Capsid maturation protease5352 UL272664887Glycoprotein B83827270 UL282325774DNA packaging terminase subunit 26463 UL2935791192ICP8; single stranded binding protein7069 UL3036751224DNA polymerase6666 UL31921306Nuclear egress lamina protein7372 UL321731576DNA packaging protein6261 UL33390129DNA packaging protein6160 UL34837278Nuclear egress membrane protein4443 UL35408135Small capsid protein5350 UL3685352844Large tegument protein4848 UL3731501049Tegument protein4645 UL381359452VP19C; capsid triplex subunit 15656 UL392916971Ribonucleotide reductase subunit 16566 UL40990329Ribonucleotide reductase subunit 26565 UL411566521Tegument host shutoff protein6061 UL421422473DNA polymerase processivity subunit4444 UL441296431Glycoprotein C3634 UL45516171Membrane protein4240 UL462343780VP11/12; tegument protein4949 UL472133710VP13/14; tegument protein4342 UL481497498VP16; transactivating tegument protein4747 UL49777258VP22; tegument protein6767 UL49A324107Glycoprotein N32 UL501035344Deoxyuridine triphosphatase3935 UL51741246Tegument protein6766 UL5231021033Helicase primase subunit5958 UL531023340Glycoprotein K4647 UL541524507ICP27; multifunctional expression regulator5252 UL55540179Nuclear protein4036 PW6630209Unique hypothetical §Putative function of encoded polypeptides in MaHV-1 #amino acid identities with homologues in Human herpesvirus 1 and 2 (HHV1 and HHV2) and Macropodid herpesviruses 2 and 4 (MaHV2 and MaHV4)Fig. 2The relationship between macropodid herpesvirus 1 (MaHV1) and other viruses from the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily.

PMC4724163	SRP067309	Methods	ENA	Sequencing was carried out using a 300 cycle V2 SBS kit (Illumina, Inc.) in paired-end 150 bp format. 	Over 350 Mbp of sequence data were obtained from 2.69 million paired reads with a mean length of 137 bp (standard deviation of 26.3) and were submitted to the Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP067309]. 	Reads were trimmed to an error probability limit of 0.5 % and de novo assembly was performed using medium-low default sensitivity settings on the bioinformatics package Geneious version 6.1.7 [37] (Biomatters Ltd). This yielded four large contigs (52.6 kbp, 37.3 kbp, 14.9 kbp and 17 kbp) with consensus sequences that corresponded to herpesvirus sequence, according to Blastx and Blastn searches of GenBank databases [38, 39].

PMC4747093	Q9BX84	Discussion	UniProt	Both basic and pre-clinical studies show that the magnesium flux by TRP magnesium channels is highly related with tumor cell proliferation and cycle, angiogenesis, tumor growth and reprogramming, as well as metastasis [20]. 	The R1122Q mutation occurs at the topological domain of TRPM6 towards the cytoplasm, according to the Uniprot database annotation (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BX84). 	Thereby, dysfunction of the TRPM6 protein may affect the cation homeostasis leading to the tumor development. Recently, Stephens et al. reported two somatic mutations (p.T1822A and p.A1765T) in the TRPM6 gene from screening 100 breast cancer patients of European ancestry [6]. 
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	A pharmacophore model is a 3D arrangement of physicochemical features (e.g., hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, hydrophobic area, aromatic ring) that represents the key interactions between a ligand molecule and its target protein. 	As an example, the chemical interaction pattern that defines the interaction of magnolol with the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) is presented in Fig. 2A [for more details about the significance of this example the reader is referred to (Zhang et al., 2011) and (Fakhrudin et al., 2010)]. 	3D-multiconformational compound libraries can be screened against a pharmacophore model to retrieve molecules that map the pharmacophore features and consequently have a high likelihood of being active on the target. Depending on the target, this method can achieve success rates between 2 and 30% (Hein et al., 2010). 
PMC4748402	3R5N	Figure	PDBe	As indicated, the used search keywords were plant chemistry, plant pharmacology, plant natural product, plant compound, plant drug discovery, plant bioactivity, and the total number of PubMed publications per year was retrieved by search with the symbol *. The trend analysis reveals that the increase of PubMed citations in the target areas is faster than the increase in the total number of annual PubMed citations (indicated by the steeper slopes of the respective trend lines). 	(A) Two molecules of magnolol concomitantly occupying the binding site of PPARγ (PDB 3R5N) are shown, with the chemical interaction pattern that defines the activity of the molecules depicted. 	Yellow spheres represent hydrophobic interactions, red and green arrows mark hydrogen bond acceptor and donor atoms. This interaction pattern may be converted into a structure-based pharmacophore model and used for virtual screening.

PMC4835854	NCT02217475	Results	NCT	Simultaneous CCR2/5 antagonism abrogates age-related response to injury 	In order to abrogate this response, we treated aged TBI mice with cenicriviroc (CVC), a potent, oral, dual-antagonist of CCR2/5, which is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and liver fibrosis (NCT02217475). 	Separate cohorts of aged TBI animals were treated with either vehicle or CVC twice daily several hours after injury (Fig. 5a). Using this experimental approach, we observed a significant reduction in the numbers of CD11b+F4/80+CD45hiLy6C+ macrophages (Fig. 5b,c), which are analogous to CCR2+ macrophages, recruited into the diseased brain [12, 28].Fig. 5Dual targeting of CCR2/5 with CVC mitigates TBI-induced macrophage recruitment. a In WT mice, CVC or vehicle was administered BID via oral gavage at 100 mg/kg at 2 and 10 h post surgery before animals were euthanized for various endpoints at 24 h following surgery. b A cohort of WT aged TBI animals (n = 8/group) was used for flow cytometry analysis of macrophage infiltration into the injured brain.

PMC4920148	135100	Introduction	OMIM	INTRODUCTION 	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP; OMIM 135100) is a rare genetic disease with a prevalence of about one per 2-million people. 	The inheritance is autosomal dominant, although most cases are due to sporadic new mutations (Shore et al., 2005). Individuals with FOP are characterized by a peculiar congenital toe malformation and, usually starting within the first decade of life, by a progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that takes place following some types of injury (such as trauma, medical surgery, intramuscular immunization, infections) or spontaneously.

PMC4943204	rs78378222	Results	RefSNP	Somewhat unexpectedly, all the observed mutations had rather high DAFs (> 1%) in the 1000 Genomes data set. 	Moreover, only two of the SNPs (rs78378222 and rs986475) affected PAS hexamers corresponding to unique polyadenylation sites (one per gene), whereas the other three SNPs affected the signals near alternative sites, two proximal and one distal.

PMC4961654	137215	Introduction	OMIM	Most of GC cases are sporadic and hereditary cases account for only 1–3 % of GCs, this includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) (Monahan and Hopkins 2016). 	HDGC (OMIM #137215) is an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition cancer syndrome with high penetrance. 	Between 25 and 30 % of cases of HDGC are caused by mutations in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) (Hallowell et al. 2016; Hansford et al. 2015). This gene maps to chromosome 16q22.1, consists of 16 exons and encodes the cell-to-cell adhesion protein, E-cadherin (Masciari et al. 2007). 
PMC4970815	SRR407548		OMIM	On the other hand, a greater amount of memory is required than that for execution of a small number of queries. 	When we used 1,000,000 randomly selected short DNA reads from SRR407548 and the KEGG GENES database, GHOSTZ-GPU required approximately 50 GB of CPU memory for the homology search proper. 	Thus, the memory size of current typical computing systems may be insufficient for GHOSTZ-GPU. For instance, a node in Titan, which is a supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has only 32 GB of memory.

Genomic DNA was extracted for all isolates using NucleoSpin® 96 Tissue kits (Ref - 740454.4; Macherey Nagel, Germany) and identification performed by sequencing the housekeeping gene rpoD (accession numbers LN885567 to LN886065, EMBL-EBI database) using primers rpoDf/rpoDr targeting the rpoD alleles of bacteria from the P. fluorescens group (Frapolli et al., 2007). 	When rpoD amplification failed, the 16SrRNA encoding rrs gene was amplified with pA/pH (Edwards et al., 1989) and sequenced (accession numbers: LN885368 to LN885566, EMBL-EBI database). rpoD sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Sequences were manually filtered to discard gaps and aligned regions of low quality.

PMC5035930	605489	Results	OMIM	Other clinical findings are noted in Table 1 and the presence and extent of multilevel organ involvement supports the subgroup of SRPS type II, Mohr-Majewski syndrome. 	Exome sequence analyses identified variants in the ciliary gene that encodes IFT81 [OMIM 605489] in both cases. 	ATD case R98-443 showed compound heterozygosity for two variants: c.87G > C, predicting the protein change p.Leu29Phe (rs200335504_dbSNP) and c.1534C > T predicting the protein change p.Arg512* (rs200335504_dbSNP) (Fig. 1J). Both changes are of low allelic frequency (5.322e-05 and 1.659e-05, respectively), in the ExAC database (http://exac.broadinstitute.org).

PMC5035930	rs76726265	Results	RefSNP	These data demonstrate that compound heterozygosity for the mutations led to a significant loss of IFT81, more than could be accounted for by presence of one null allele, suggesting that the missense mutation destabilized IFT81. 	In addition to the IFT81 mutations, the exome sequence analysis in R98-443A identified heterozygosity for a known TTC21B variant (c.2600G > A; p.Arg867His; rs76726265). 	Because TTC21B mutations have shown to cause ATD, and this variant was predicted to be damaging (SIFT, PolyPhen with Bayes probability of 0.999 by the MutationTaster algorithm), mRNA and protein levels were characterized by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis respectively.

PMC5070816	AFW98990	Discussion	ENA	A2M is an evolutionarily conserved element of the innate immune system and a non-specific protease inhibitor involved in host defense, and it has been revealed that A2M is relative to immunity in L. vannamei [65]. 	The F11 gene (GenBank: AFW98990.1) was reported to play a role in immunity [1]. 	Recent studies revealed the importance of KLKB1 in shrimp immune response, particularly towards protect animals from the microbial pathogens [66]. Aquatic animals metabolize foreign toxicity of chemicals mainly by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis and conjugation reactions catalyzed by various enzymes, and the metabolic activation is primarily catalyzed by the cytochrome P450-dependent oxygenase system in the endoplasmic reticulum [67].
