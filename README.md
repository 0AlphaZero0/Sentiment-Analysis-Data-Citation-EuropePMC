### Description :

This project is based on [EuropePMC](http://europepmc.org/), this is an on-line database that offers free access to a large and growing collection of biomedical research literature. Actually there is more than 35.3 million of abstract and 5.3 million of full text articles on this database. [EuropePMC](http://europepmc.org/) team is part of the [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), this organisation is itself part of the [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/) organisation. This structure is an international one, composed of 24 country and the goal of this organisation is to develop biology research. It is for this purpose that the EMBL-EBI was created, indeed in the last few years *bioinformatics* had a real impact on biology research, this is due to the fact that the data in this environment has grown in an impressive way, mostly come from genetics. The goal of EMBL-EBI is to create open access tools to facilitate the biology research. 
In this perspective a large number of tools have been created in particular:
- [Clustal Omega](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
- [GeneWise](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/genewise)
- [MUSCLE](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/)
- [and many others..](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/all)

### Organisation :

This GitHub is ogranized as follows : 

- [Bibliography](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/Bibliography) 
  * It corresponds to all articles I've read. There is a [README.md](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/blob/master/Bibliography/README.md) that contain all citations as BibText and link to papers pdf. All papers that I've read are stored in this folder.
  
- [Datasets](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/Datasets)
  * There is two folder in this folder, one that contain [existing datasets](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/Datasets/Existing-Dataset) and a second one that contain [dataset created](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/Datasets/Dataset-created) for machine learning analysis 

- [Logbook & Notes](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/Logbook%20%26%20Notes)
  * In this folder there is all of my notes for the complete internship, there is also a lot of figure that I use in my notes, all of these informations are displayed in the [README.md](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/blob/master/Logbook%20%26%20Notes/README.md)

- [ML Analysis](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/MLAnalysis)
  * In this folder there is all of the machine learning script and pipeline that I use for an automatic classification of data citations.
  
- [PipelineDatasetCreation](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/tree/master/PipelineDatasetCreation)
  * In this folder there is the pipeline that I use to create a complete dataset of data citations.

There is also a planning that you can find [here](https://github.com/0AlphaZero0/Sentiment-Analysis-Data-Citation-EuropePMC/projects/1)
