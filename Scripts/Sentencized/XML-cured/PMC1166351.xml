</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular small gram-negative bacteria associated with different arthropod hosts. Many Rickettsia species infect human beings and are responsible for mild to severe diseases. Rickettsia felis, the agent of the flea-borne spotted fever rickettsiosis, exhibits several specificities among the currently recognized Rickettsia species. After being identified in fleas in 1990 [1], R. felis has been found worldwide in flea species such as Ctenocephalides felis, parasitizing cats and dogs, and Pulex irritans. R. felis is transovarially transmitted in these insects [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Several cases of human infection caused by R. felis have been reported [3,4]. Rickettsia species are phylogenetically classified into two groups: the typhus group and the spotted-fever group (SFG). R. felis belongs to the SFG, together with tick-associated Rickettsia species such as R. conorii, R. sibirica, and R. rickettsii. However its lifestyle resembles that of R. typhi (typhus group), which is also hosted and transovarially transmitted by fleas. Furthermore, R. felis is known to coinfect fleas with Bartonella henselae, B. quintana, and Wolbachia pipientis [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The culture conditions of R. felis were established in 2001 using Xenopus laevis tissue culture (XTC) cells at relatively low temperatures (optimally at 28 °C) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Besides these features, little is known about this pathogen. To date, six Rickettsia genome sequences are available. These are from two typhus group species (R. prowazekii [6] and R. typhi [7]) and four SFG species (R. conorii [8], R. sibirica [9], R. rickettsii, and R. akari). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>This colinearity allowed the precise assessment of orthologous relationships between ORFs of five Rickettsia species (R. felis, R. conorii, R. sibirica, R. prowazekii, and R. typhi). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47" pm="."><plain>The two R. felis plasmids, named pRF and pRFδ, are 62,829 bp and 39,263 bp long, respectively. Their topologies and sizes were confirmed experimentally (Figures S1 and S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49" pm="."><plain>The pRF plasmid contains 68 ORFs, of which 53 (77.9%) exhibited homologs in public databases and 44 (64.7%) were associated with functional attributes. The nucleotide sequences of pRFδ and pRF are identical, except for an additional 23,566-bp segment that contains 24 ORFs (pRF15–pRF38) in pRF (see Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51" pm="."><plain>These plasmids are likely to be R. felis specific since all attempts to detect specific plasmid sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from DNA of available reference rickettsial species were unsuccessful. In contrast, the same assays against 30 fleas naturally infected by R. felis resulted in amplification of the plasmid sequences in all cases. <p><text><SENT sid="53" pm="."><plain>Plasmids are referred to as conjugative or nonconjugative. The former are disseminated by conjugation from cell to cell, while the latter are only vertically transmitted. The pRF plasmid encodes several homologs of proteins involved in the different conjugative steps (see Table 3; Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56" pm="."><plain>First, it exhibits a split gene (pRF38/pRF39) homologous to the traA Ti of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens tumor-inducing plasmid [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57" pm="."><plain>TraATi is thought to be a DNA-processing machinery with nickase and helicase activities to generate the transfer strand from the origin of transfer (oriT) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58" pm="."><plain>Second, the pRF encodes another split gene (pRF43/pRF44) homologous to the traD F in the Escherichia coli F plasmid. TraDF is a “coupling protein” that connects the DNA-processing machinery (and transfer strand) to the mating pair formation (Mpf) apparatus, a type IV secretion system (T4SS) [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60" pm="."><plain>Finally, pRF exhibits an ORF (pRF47) similar to TraGF, a protein involved in the F-pilus assembly and aggregate stabilization [12]. <p><text><SENT sid="61" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of these ORFs linked to the initiation of plasmid transfer, the pRF sequence lacks clear homologs for the proteins involved in the Mpf apparatus found in other bacteria. Nevertheless, the R. felis chromosome (as well as other Rickettsia genomes) encodes most of the components of T4SS, which are highly similar to the vir genes of A. tumefaciens. Since the R. felis T4SS components (virB2 [RF1075], virB3 [RF0087], virB4 [RF0088], virB6 [RF0089, RF0090, RF0091, RF0092, and RF0093], virB8 [RF0463 and RF0465], virB9 [RF0462 and RF0466], virB10 [RF0467], virB11 [RF0468], and virD4 [RF0469]) are conserved in all sequenced Rickettsia genomes that lack plasmids, the primary suspected role of the R. felis T4SS is to translocate virulence factors to hosts. However, the T4SS of A. tumefaciens (vir) and Legionella pneumophila (dot/icm) have been shown to function both as DNA-transfer machineries and as effector translocators [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65" pm="."><plain>Thus, the R. felis T4SS may also promote the transfer of DNA as in A. tumefaciens. We also noticed that the R. felis chromosome exhibits a DNA primase gene (RF0786) similar to TraC found in the E. coli IncP plasmid. TraC initiates the replication of transferred DNA strands in the recipient cells. Finally, the R. felis chromosome encodes a protein (RF0020) similar to competence protein ComE3, a protein (RF0964) similar to the F-pilin acetylation protein TraX, and a split gene (RF0705/RF0706) homologous to the P-pilus assembly protein FimD. In conclusion, the presence of those putative conjugative transfer genes suggests that the R. felis plasmids have been acquired by conjugation and that R. felis may still retain the capacity of transferring plasmids. </sec><sec id="s2c"><title><text><SENT sid="70" pm="."><plain>Genome Plasticity </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71" pm="."><plain>We identified 333 repeated DNA sequences (50 to 2,645 bp long) in the R. felis genome, accounting for 4.3% of the sequence, a proportion markedly higher than in other sequenced Rickettsia genomes (see Table 1; Figure 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72" pm="."><plain>The major source of those repeats is the proliferation of transposase genes, for which we identified 82 copies (or inactivated derivatives). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="73" pm="."><plain>Among other obligate intracellular bacteria, only W. pipientis wMel [14] and Parachlamydia sp. UWE25 [15] exhibit such a high number of large mobile genetic elements. The occurrence of highly similar transposase sequences appears to play a major role in the plasticity of the R. felis genome (see Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76" pm="."><plain>Transposase ORFs were identified at most extremities of the R. felis genomic segments colinear with the R. conorii genome, suggesting that the R. felis chromosome has been rearranged many times through recombination mediated by these mobile sequences. With the use of the GRAPPA software inferring the most parsimonious genome-rearrangement scenario, we estimated at least 11 inversion events between R. felis and R. conorii. In contrast, only four inversions are required to associate more distantly related R. conorii and R. prowazekii genomes. In addition to transposases, we identified eight phage-related ORFs (see Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80" pm="."><plain>The R. felis genome thus appears to have been invaded more frequently by such foreign DNAs than other Rickettsia species. Besides long repeats, Rickettsia genomes are known to contain a number of small palindromic repeats (Rickettsia palindromic elements [RPEs]) capable of invading both coding and noncoding regions [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="82" pm="."><plain>We identified 728 RPEs in the R. felis genome. Of these RPEs, 85 were found within ORFs and three were found in RNA-coding genes. <p><text><SENT sid="84" pm="."><plain>The R. felis chromosome and plasmids share several homologs, suggesting gene exchanges between these replicons. Of 68 ORFs in pRF, 11 have a close homolog (&gt;50% amino acid sequence identity) in the chromosome; these are seven transposases, patatin-like phospholipase (pRF11), thymidylate kinase (pRF13), and two small heat-shock proteins (pRF51 and pRF52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86" pm="."><plain>Among these, patatin-like proteins exhibit the most intriguing phylogeny (Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87" pm="."><plain>The genomes of five Rickettsia species (R. prowazekii, R. typhi, R. conorii, R. sibirica, and R. felis) exhibit chromosomal patatin-like phospholipase gene (pat1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88" pm="."><plain>Gene organization around pat1 is similar between these Rickettsia. Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis for these Pat1 and the plasmid-encoded Pat2 indicates a close relationship between Pat1 (RF0360) and Pat2 of R. felis, together being an outgroup of Pat1 sequences of other Rickettsia, suggesting a gene replacement of the chromosomally encoded pat1 by the plasmid-encoded pat2 in the lineage leading to R. felis. <p><text><SENT sid="90" pm="."><plain>Most R. felis genes with orthologs in other Rickettsia have probably been inherited vertically from a common ancestor. On the other hand, genes without orthologs in other Rickettsia may have been acquired by lateral gene transfer. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the taxonomic distribution of BLASTP best hits of R. felis ORFs against the nonredundant database (excluding rickettsial sequences) (Figure S5). R. felis ORFs with orthologs in other Rickettsia matched preferentially (64%) with sequences from the same taxonomic group as R. felis (i.e., α-proteobacteria). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the BLAST best hits for the chromosomal ORFs lacking orthologs in other Rickettsia were found preferentially in γ-proteobacteria (31%; 58 ORFs) and cyanobacteria (18%; 33 ORFs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94" pm="."><plain>The taxonomic distributions of the best matches for these two ORF sets were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001; χ2 test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="95" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that many R. felis-specific genes may originate from distantly related organisms by lateral transfer. However, methods based on nucleotide composition bias failed to identify unambiguous candidates for lateral gene acquisition in R. felis. </sec><sec id="s2d"><title><text><SENT sid="97" pm="."><plain>Surface Antigens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="99" pm="."><plain>Five sca members have been identified in the previously published Rickettsia genomes. Several Sca proteins are known to account for major antigenic differences between Rickettsia species [17] and may play important roles in adhesion to host cells [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="101" pm="."><plain>Sca proteins are characterized by highly variable N-terminal sequences and a conserved C-terminal autotransporter β-domain, which translocates the N-terminal part outside the outer membrane. The R. felis genome exhibits the highest number of sca genes among currently available Rickettsia genomes. We identified nine intact sca paralogs (sca1, sca2, sca3, sca4, sca5/ompB, sca8, sca9, sca12, and sca13) as well as four fragmented or split paralogs (sca0/ompA, sca7, sca10, and sca11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="104" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that, under mild log growth phase, all R. felis sca paralogs were transcribed, including split ones. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that ancient duplication events gave rise to these paralogs before the divergence of Rickettsia species. We noticed that sca genes exhibit highly different patterns of presence/absence across different Rickettsia species (Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="107" pm="."><plain>Only ompB and sca4 are conserved in all available Rickettsia genomes [19], remaining members being degraded or absent in one or more species. Together with the accelerated amino acid changes, differential gene degradation of sca paralogs probably contributes to the intra-species variation of those cell-surface proteins and might be linked with their adaptation to different host environments. <p><text><SENT sid="109" pm="."><plain>R. felis is genetically and serologically classified into the SFG of Rickettsia [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="110" pm="."><plain>However, cross-reactivities caused by both proteins and lipopolysaccharides have been found with R. typhi using mouse sera [2] and human sera (Figure S6). R. conorii rarely cross-reacts with R. typhi. We therefore suspected that genes found in both R. felis and R. typhi, but missing in R. conorii, might be responsible for the cross-reactivities of R. felis and R. typhi. A list of such genes includes a sca family gene (sca3), encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 319 kDa, and rfaJ for the lipopolysaccharide 1,2-glucosyltransferase (Table 4). <SecTag type="TABLE"><table-wrap id="pbio-0030248-t004" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="113" pm="."><plain>R. felis ORFs Present in R. typhi but Absent or Degraded in R. conorii and R. sibirica </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="117" pm="."><plain>These enzymes control the concentration of alarmone, (p)ppGpp (guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphates), which in turn acts as an effector of transcription. Remarkably, R. felis exhibits 14 spoT, (spoT1–13 and 15) paralogs (Figure S7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="119" pm="."><plain>Using RT-PCR, we examined the transcription status of 14 R. felis spoT genes. All the spoT ORFs were transcribed. We classified these ORFs into two groups, based on their alignment against the sequence of the Streptococcus dysgalactiae Relseq that possesses both (p)ppGpp hydrolase and synthetase activities [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="122" pm="."><plain>The first group (SpoT1–10, 14, and 15) was aligned with the sequence of the hydrolase domain, and the second group (SpoT11, 12, and 13) with the sequence of the synthetase domain. Being consistent with the previous observation [23], our phylogenetic analyses suggest that each paralogous gene group originated in early duplication events before the divergence of Rickettsia species. Notably, every sequenced Rickettsia genome encodes at least one ORF exhibiting hydrolase catalytic residues and one ORF exhibiting synthetase catalytic residues, suggesting that both hydrolase and synthetase functions are required for Rickettsia. We also found that seven spoT (spoT1–4 and 7–9) genes were located in the R. felis chromosome next to a gene encoding a transporter of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) including proline/betaine transporters. MFS is also a large paralogous gene family composed of at least 23 ORF members in R. felis. <p><text><SENT sid="127" pm="."><plain>Toxin–antitoxin systems are composed of tightly linked toxin and antitoxin gene pairs and ensure stable plasmid inheritance when they are encoded in plasmids. In these systems, the toxic effect of a long-lived toxin is continuously inhibited by a short-lived antitoxin only when whole systems are maintained.

The presence of pili-associated genes prompted us to investigate, by electron microscopy, the presence of such appendages on the cell surface.

Without pili, many disease-causing bacteria lose their invasion capability.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="199" pm="."><plain>R. felis is the first obligate intracellular bacterium exhibiting a possible conjugative plasmid. Of the nine previously published studies of members of the Order Rickettsiales (six in Rickettsiaceae, three in Anaplasmateceae), none exhibited a plasmid. Several other obligate intracellular bacteria, such as Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydophila caviae, C. burnetii, Wigglesworthia glossinidia, and Buchnera aphidicola, are known to possess plasmids. Recently, the reannotation of the genome of Parachlamydia, an obligate intracellular bacteria living in amoeba, predicted an F-like DNA conjugative system encoded in a genomic island [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="203" pm="."><plain>However, no conjugation has yet been observed for those plasmids and genomic island.

<SENT sid="208" pm="."><plain>The comparison with W. pipientis is interesting. This intracellular bacterium also multiplies in arthropods (including fleas) and is transmitted transovarially. The most relevant finding in its genome was the detection of repetitive mobile DNA elements. Many ankyrin repeats and several TPRs were also found. It appears that R. felis and W. pipientis share common genomic features, possibly because of their similar niches (we found two Ct. felis fleas in France coinfected with W. pipientis and R. felis). </plain></SENT>

Y. pestis, transmitted by fleas, also exhibits many more insertion sequences than its close relative, Y. pseudotuberculosis [48]. </plain></SENT>
