<SENT sid="477" pm="."><plain>We have found that the mutant protein of single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) from Thermus thermophilus (Tth) HB8 enhances the efficiency of amplification of DNA templates. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="483" pm="."><plain>Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is an isothermal method that amplifies circular DNA by a rolling circle mechanism (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="484" pm="."><plain>The reaction products are high molecular weight, linear, double-stranded, tandem repeat copies of the input template that can subsequently be used for DNA sequencing, restriction endonuclease digestion and other methods used in cloning, labeling and detection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="485" pm="."><plain>Kits that use this method for preparation of circular DNA templates for direct use in cycle sequencing are commercially available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="486" pm="."><plain>RCA variants have been employed for the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms through ligation of circularizable DNA probes and for whole bacterial or human genome amplification via multiple-displacement amplification (5–8). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="487" pm="."><plain>Although the utility of RCA is beginning to be accepted widely, several technical problems still remain to be solved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="488" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the most significant is the appearance of nonspecifically amplified products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="489" pm="."><plain>In practice, even with the most optimized reaction conditions (e.g. using modified random oligonucleotides) (9), nonspecific RCA products cannot be completely eliminated, particularly in instances where complex and/or very low amounts of the template DNA are used. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="490" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific RCA products are most likely to be derived from false priming at sites where primer dimers are formed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="491" pm="."><plain>Recently, a heat stable SSB protein from a thermophilic bacteria, Thermus thermophilus (Tth), has been isolated and fully characterized (10–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="492" pm="."><plain>Bacterial SSB proteins are required for DNA replication and repair (13,14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="493" pm="."><plain>Most SSB proteins bind nonspecifically to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and prevent the formation of secondary structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="494" pm="."><plain>Wild-type and mutant SSB-encoding genes from T.thermophilus HB8 were cloned and the proteins they encode have undergone preliminary characterization (J.I. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="495" pm="."><plain>Inoue, manuscripts in preparation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="496" pm="."><plain>We attempted to eliminate nonspecific RCA products by employing these heat-stable SSB proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="497" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the presence of SSB protein could greatly stimulate polymerization (isothermal strand-displacement), and therefore reduce the formation of primer dimer and lead to the elimination of nonspecific RCA products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="498" pm="."><plain>Mutated SSB proteins would be ideal candidates for such an application owing to their predicted ssDNA binding efficiency. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="499" pm="."><plain>In this report, we demonstrate that a mutant SSB protein from T.thermophilus strain HB8 (TthSSB) increases the efficiency of DNA synthesis and the accuracy of RCA using the bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="683" pm="."><plain>A thermophilic SSB protein and its mutant form from T.thermophilus HB8 were purified and its effects on the activity of phi29 DNA polymerases were assayed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="684" pm="."><plain>The presence of TthSSB-255 mutant protein shortened the elongation time required to synthesize a DNA fragment by phi29 DNA polymerase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="685" pm="."><plain>Such stimulation could be the result of direct interactions between TthSSB and DNA polymerase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="686" pm="."><plain>However, as an increase in DNA synthesis was also observed when a Bst DNA polymerase was used (Supplementary Figure S1), it follows that the effect of TthSSB-255 was not due to specific interactions with a DNA polymerase, but was most probably due to an indirect consequence of its binding to ssDNA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="687" pm="."><plain>There are several putative explanations for such an indirect effect on DNA synthesis stimulation since the TthSSB-255 protein showed weak binding to ssDNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="688" pm="."><plain>For example, the TthSSB-255/ssDNA complexes could avoid the formation of folded ssDNA structures, which are generally considered to block the progression of DNA polymerase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="689" pm="."><plain>In addition, the primers could hybridize not only free ssDNA region but also ssDNA on the TthSSB-255/ssDNA complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="690" pm="."><plain>Then, TthSSB-255 could prevent non-productive binding of DNA polymerase to ssDNA, and direct it to specific dsDNA regions where the primers hybridize, thus allowing more effective strand-displacement in the RCA reaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="691" pm="."><plain>Although several groups have reported that DNA binding proteins, such as T4gene 32, enhance RCA reactions, there are no reports on the application of SSB protein for RCA where the protein reduces nonspecific RCA products (17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="692" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions we employed here, the inclusion of wild-type SSB protein either from E.coli or T.thermophilus in the reaction mixture for RCA neither reduced nonspecific products nor template concentrations required for RCA. TthSSB-255 could only enhance RCA reactions drastically, which showed weak ssDNA binding affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="693" pm="."><plain>This characteristic of the protein would be critical for reduction of nonspecific products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="694" pm="."><plain>As shown in Supplementary Figure SP2, TthSSB has a significant cluster consisting of acidic residues in its C-terminus although the role has not been cleared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="695" pm="."><plain>Since F255P substitution is in the cluster, it may be related to a function of ssDNA binding in spite of acidic environment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="696" pm="."><plain>The utility of RCA-based whole genome amplification has been demonstrated for a variety of uses including quantitative PCR, SNP genotyping, Southern blot analysis of restriction fragments, chromosome painting (FISH), subcloning and DNA sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="697" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of whole genome amplification depends on its ability to give complete coverage of the genome with little regional bias, which is critical when the product is to be used for SNP genotyping (19,20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="698" pm="."><plain>At extremely low template concentrations, regions of the genome are rarely lost, resulting in loss of one allele despite amplification of the locus (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="699" pm="."><plain>At a considerably lower template concentration, RCA in the presence of TthSSB-255 protein could amplify template homogeneously than conventional RCA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="700" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this method may be applicable to a genotyping application. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="701" pm="."><plain>Finally, the homology between TthSSB and TaqSSB proteins is very high especially in the C terminal domain (see Supplementary Figure S2) (22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="702" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we strongly suspect that the same effects will be achieved by the TaqSSB mutant protein, which has the mutated amino acid at the same site. </plain></SENT>
