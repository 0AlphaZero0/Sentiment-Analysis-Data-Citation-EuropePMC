</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="754" pm="."><plain>The mammalian heart is an organ of considerable structural and regulatory complexity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="755" pm="."><plain>Emphasis is now being placed on unraveling the genetic circuitry underlying cardiac patterning and morphogenesis and how this relates to congenital disease (Fishman and Chien 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="756" pm="."><plain>A key gene in the myocardial developmental regulatory hierarchy in vertebrates is Nkx2-5, a homologue of the Drosophila homeobox gene, tinman, essential for specification of the heart and visceral muscle lineages in the fly (Harvey 1996). Nkx2-5 can promote cardiogenesis in vitro (Skerjanc et al. 1998) and to a limited extent in vivo (Cleaver et al. 1996) and can rescue some of the functions of tinman when expressed as a transgene in tinman-mutant Drosophila embryos (Park et al. 1998; Ranganayakulu et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="761" pm="."><plain>In frogs, dominant negative inhibition of Nkx2-5 leads to complete obliteration of heart formation, suggesting an essential role in specification of the cardiac lineages in this vertebrate (Fu et al. 1998; Grow and Krieg 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="763" pm="."><plain>Homozygous mutations in murine Nkx2-5 lead to arrest of cardiac morphogenesis at the linear heart tube stage (Lyons et al. 1995; Tanaka et al. 1999; Biben et al. 2000), whereas heterozygous mutations in both the human and mouse genes confer atrial septal defects and conduction abnormalities (Schott et al. 1998; Biben et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="769" pm="."><plain>Nkx2-5 is thought to act, in part, via its association with the transcription factors GATA4 (Durocher et al. 1997) and serum response factor (Chen and Schwartz 1996), and in vivo and/or in vitro studies have identified atrial natriuretic factor, A1 adenosine receptor, calreticulin, and α-cardiac actin as direct target genes (Chen and Schwartz 1996; Durocher et al. 1996; Biben et al. 1997; Rivkees et al. 1999; Guo et al. 2000).</plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="774" pm="."><plain> However, in knockout mice genes encoding the regionally expressed transcription factors Hand1/eHand, Irx4, Msx-2, and N-myc and the actin cross-linking protein SM-22α are also dysregulated (Biben and Harvey 1997; Biben et al. 1997; Tanaka et al. 1999; Bruneau et al. 2000), suggesting a role for Nkx2-5 in the development of patterning information and heart tube morphogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="778" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we describe the gene Chisel (Csl), which was cloned during a differential screen for genes downregulated in homozygous Nkx2-5 mutant hearts. Csl encodes a protein of 9 kD expressed in the heart, all skeletal muscles, and smooth muscles of the stomach and pulmonary veins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="779" pm="."><plain>In the heart, Csl transcripts were expressed only in the specialized working myocardium of the atrial and ventricular chambers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="780" pm="."><plain>Although Csl knockout mice showed no obvious phenotype, over-expression in the C2C12 myogenic cell line led to effects on cytoskeletal dynamics in myoblasts and cell signaling–dependent enhancement of cell fusion in myocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="781" pm="."><plain>The activities of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and myocyte enhancer–binding factor (MEF)2 transcription factors were also enhanced in a cell signaling–dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="782" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that Csl acts in the signaling network through which the structural, functional, and regulatory states of muscle cells are coordinated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1059" pm="."><plain>1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1060" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that the two dominant effects of overexpressed Csl discussed above share a common mechanism, that is, perturbation of regulated cytoskeletal dynamics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1061" pm="."><plain>However, Myc-Csl overexpression did not induce myosacs in a subline of C2C12 cells that differentiate 1–2 d in advance of those in which myosacs were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1062" pm="."><plain>Although the reason for this is unclear, it is possible that the rat L6E9 line in which the myosac phenotype was initially observed and the permissive C2C12 line have become less robust with respect to regulation of cytoskeletal remodelling due to adaptations to tissue culture. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1063" pm="."><plain>In addition to its dominant effects on myoblast and myocyte cell shape and behavior, Csl also augmented the activities of the NFAT and MEF2 families of transcription factors in an IGF-1 signaling–dependent manner at late stages in the culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1064" pm="."><plain>For NFAT, this effect was largely CsA insensitive, indicating that it did not involve the calcineurin pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1065" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of this augmentation is unknown, although it highlights the fact that overexpression of Csl can influence intracellular signaling events in addition to structural changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1066" pm="."><plain>Since both NFAT and MEF2 regulate the myoglobin promoter, which is selectively expressed in slow fibers (Chin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1067" pm="."><plain>1998), and since Csl itself is enriched in slow fibers, overexpression of Csl in C2C12 cells may promote a slow fiber phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1068" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the activity of NFAT and MEF2 like that of serum response factor, a key transcriptional regulator in muscle cells, is stimulated by increased actin dynamics (Sotiropoulos et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1069" pm="."><plain>1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1070" pm="."><plain>Although we acknowledge that overexpression experiments require cautious interpretation, further analysis of the above effects may offer new insights into Csl function in muscle cells and the prominent role played by the cytoskeleton and myofilament and its associated signaling molecules in muscle development, function, and disease. </plain></SENT>
