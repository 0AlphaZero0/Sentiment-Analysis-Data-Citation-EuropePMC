</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="1307" pm="."><plain>To evaluate complex interrelated processes and to assemble an integrated view of activated signaling networks, a systems biology strategy was applied to genomic and proteomic responses by primary human macrophages over the course of HIV-1 infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1308" pm="."><plain>Macrophage responses, including cell cycle, calcium, apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and cytokines/chemokines, to HIV-1 were temporally regulated, in the absence of cell proliferation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1309" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways remained unaltered by HIV-1, although TLRs 3, 4, 7, and 8 were expressed and responded to ligand stimulation in macrophages. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1311" pm="."><plain>Activation of pathways other than TLR was inadequate to stimulate, via cross-talk mechanisms through molecular hubs, the production of proinflammatory cytokines typical of a TLR response. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1318" pm="."><plain>Tissue macrophages play a central role in immune response pathways and are major targets for chronic infection by viruses including HIV-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1319" pm="."><plain>Infected macrophages constitute a stable viral reservoir that facilitate spread of HIV-1 to other cells or tissue compartments and contribute to immune pathogenesis [1]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1320" pm="."><plain>HIV-1 interacts through multiple signaling pathways to reprogram the transcriptome and the proteome of host cells [5], [8]–[13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1321" pm="."><plain>HIV-1-induced stimulation of macrophages is a multi-step process that occurs directly in infected cells, as well as indirectly in bystander cells through paracrine signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1322" pm="."><plain>For example, interactions between Env gp120 and the cellular CD4/coreceptor complexes initiate response cascades through intracellular phosphorylation within the MAPK pathway leading to production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [10], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1323" pm="."><plain>While Env gp120 activates multiple signaling pathways, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) [15], protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) [9], [16], calcium [9], [11], or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors [12], other viral proteins also mediate effects on macrophage gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1324" pm="."><plain>The accessory protein Nef interacts with and inhibits the function of the cellular proapoptotic protein, ASK1 [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1325" pm="."><plain>In addition, HIV-1 genomic RNA activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and monocytes through pattern recognition receptors, specifically Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7), which initiate a signal transduction cascade to mediate release of TNF and interferons [18], [19] that may contribute to viral replication [20]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1326" pm="."><plain>Coordinate induction of multiple pathways can lead to cross-talk through convergence of signals at the level of phosphorylation and/or other post-translational modifications resulting in complex cellular responses, such as dynamic cytokine profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1327" pm="."><plain>Convergence of signals is mediated by molecular hubs that include biochemically diverse proteins, such as transcription factors (i.e. NF-κB), kinases (i.e. NEMO or PRKCG), or structural proteins (i.e. YWHAE) [21]–[25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1328" pm="."><plain>Molecular hubs integrate pathways into complex networks, regulate the overall organization of signaling networks, amplify or inhibit signals, and increase the complexity of the transcriptional response machinery [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1329" pm="."><plain>Network interactions can be mapped by using systems biology strategies that, in contrast to a single pathway approach, integrate multifaceted analyses to provide a global and dynamic perspective of cellular responses [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1330" pm="."><plain>Macrophage activation is classically defined as M1 (pro-inflammatory) or M2 (regulatory) [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1331" pm="."><plain>Classical macrophage activation involves two steps, priming (e.g. IFN-γ treatment) and triggering (e.g. LPS treatment), which modulate gene or protein expression [31], [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1332" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used a systems biology approach to integrate genomic and proteomic data across signaling networks with a focus on calcium, apoptosis, and MAPK known from independent pathway studies to respond to viral proteins and contribute to HIV-1 infection [9], [33], [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1333" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis also incorporated cell cycle and TLR pathways to characterize global and comprehensive host cell response and to define the activation phenotype of macrophages in response to replicating virus. </plain></SENT>
