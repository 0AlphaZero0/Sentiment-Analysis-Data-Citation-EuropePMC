<SENT sid="1675" pm="."><plain>In rhesus macaques, however, haplotypes are characterized by the presence of unique combinations of multiple B genes, which may display different levels of polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1676" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to shed light on the evolutionary history of this highly complex region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1677" pm="."><plain>First, the robustness of the microsatellite MIB-linked to almost half of the B genes in rhesus macaques (Mamu-B)–for accurate B haplotyping was studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1678" pm="."><plain>Based on the physical map of an established haplotype comprising 7 MIB loci, each located next to a certain Mamu-B gene, two MIB loci, MIB1 and MIB6, were investigated in a panel of MHC homozygous monkeys. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1679" pm="."><plain>MIB1 revealed a complex genotyping pattern, whereas MIB6 analysis resulted in the detection of one or no amplicon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1680" pm="."><plain>Both patterns are specific for a given B haplotype, show Mendelian segregation, and even allow a more precise haplotype definition than do traditional typing methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1681" pm="."><plain>Second, a search was performed for retroelements that may have played a role in duplication processes as observed in the macaque B region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1682" pm="."><plain>This resulted in the description of two types of duplicons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1683" pm="."><plain>One basic unit comprises an expressed Mamu-B gene, adjacent to an HERV16 copy closely linked to MIB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1684" pm="."><plain>The second type of duplicon comprises a Mamu-B (pseudo)gene, linked to a truncated HERV16 structure lacking its MIB segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1685" pm="."><plain>Such truncation seems to coincide with the loss of B gene transcription. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1686" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to the duplication processes, recombination between MIB and Mamu-B loci appears to have occurred, resulting in a hyperplastic B region. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1689" pm="."><plain>Gene products of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), a multicopy gene system present in nearly all vertebrate species, play a key role in immune-related defense reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1690" pm="."><plain>MHC class I molecules, for instance, are involved in the binding and presentation of intracellular generated peptides to CD8+ T cells, whereas class II molecules present peptides from extracellular origin to CD4+ T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1691" pm="."><plain>The hallmark of the Mhc class I and II genes is their abundant polymorphism as well as gene copy number variation observed between as well as within species [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1692" pm="."><plain>Due to its prominent role in disease susceptibility/resistance and transplantation biology, the MHC region has been studied extensively in humans (HLA) and non-human primates [5]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1693" pm="."><plain>Equivalents of the classical HLA class I genes, HLA-A and HLA-B, have been defined in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), and are designated Mamu-A and -B [12]–[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1694" pm="."><plain>The orthologue of the classical HLA-C locus, however, is absent in the rhesus macaque. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1695" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, both classical class I genes, -A and -B, are multiplicated in rhesus macaques and should therefore be considered as paralogues [14], [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1696" pm="."><plain>Equivalents of the nonclassical HLA class I genes HLA-E and -F that are characterized by a low degree of polymorphism and differential tissue distribution, have also be detected in the rhesus macaque and have been named Mamu-E and -F [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1697" pm="."><plain>In particular, the ancestral B gene seems to have been subject to expansion during the evolution of the rhesus macaque, which started 23–31 million years (Myr) ago [20], as was concluded based on the observation that a particular MHC region comprises multiple Mamu-B-like genes [16], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1698" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a large panel of rhesus macaques of Indian and Chinese origin showed that the copy number and content of B loci could vary significantly per chromosome [22]–[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1699" pm="."><plain>Some of these genes, for example Mamu-I (also named B3), may represent nonclassicals with specialized functions [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1700" pm="."><plain>In the past, when molecular methods were not yet available, typing has been performed with alloantisera in analogy to the human situation, and 16 Mamu-B specificities (serotypes) have been defined [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1701" pm="."><plain>For each serotype at least one unique combination of transcribed B genes has been determined in animals of Indian origin [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1702" pm="."><plain>Apart from qualitative dissimilarities, quantitative differences are also observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1703" pm="."><plain>Based on expression levels, rhesus macaque MHC class I gene products can be divided into majors and minors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1704" pm="."><plain>Serotyping is a complex, expensive, and outdated technology; in addition, class I gene sequencing is highly cumbersome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1705" pm="."><plain>An easier and thorough way of characterizing and typing the B region is to study closely linked markers such as microsatellites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1706" pm="."><plain>To develop a fast and accurate typing protocol, an in silicio search for Mamu-B region-associated microsatellites was performed, and D6S2810 (MIB) was selected as a promising candidate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1707" pm="."><plain>MIB, a (CA)n dinucleotide repeat that is polymorphic in length, shows nucleotide variations, and is closely linked to the Mhc-B locus/loci, both in hominoids and Old World Monkeys [26]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1708" pm="."><plain>Seven different loci, named MIB1 to 7, could be defined next to certain Mamu-B loci on the haplotype that covers the complete Mamu-B, and class II and III regions by in silicio analysis [16], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1709" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the region has been subjected to expansion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1710" pm="."><plain>Indeed, nineteen Mamu-B genes are present on this haplotype, of which all but one of the nine telomerically oriented B genes are associated with one MIB copy [16], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1711" pm="."><plain>The ten other B genes are not accompanied by a MIB structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1712" pm="."><plain>To assess the robustness of MIB microsatellite typing to infer B serotypes and complex B haplotypes, MIB1 and MIB6 of homozygous rhesus macaques have been analyzed by genotyping and sequencing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1713" pm="."><plain>In order to learn more about the possible mechanisms leading to duplications, a study of the genomic environment of genes, including transposable elements, may be helpful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1714" pm="."><plain>Retrotransposons, such as ERV, MIR, MLT and LTR, contribute strongly to the diversification of gene families by way of insertions/deletions within intergenic and intragenic duplicated regions or by acting as recombination hotspots [30]–[36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1715" pm="."><plain>For example, within the Mamu-A region (alpha block), 28 duplicons have been described and HERV16 sequences appear to map directly to the breakpoints [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1716" pm="."><plain>In humans, a long HERV16 sequence has also been observed centromeric of HLA-B [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1717" pm="."><plain>Tandem duplications of HLA genes and HERV16 sequences with and without MIC genes have been hypothesized [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1718" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, we intended to screen for such retroelements and for their potential implications in the functional and evolutionary genomics of the duplication processes within the class I B region of rhesus macaques. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1759" pm="."><plain>In silicio analysis resulted in the identification of 12 MIB loci in a MHC heterozygous rhesus macaque using the NCBI Blast database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>) [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1760" pm="."><plain>Seven MIB loci map to one haplotype, whereas the other five are located on the complementary chromosome, for which not all overlapping contigs are available [16], [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1761" pm="."><plain>For that reason, attention was focused on the haplotype for which all relevant information is available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1762" pm="."><plain>As can be seen, all seven MIB loci are situated next to Mamu-B (pseudo)genes, which correspond to the loci named B1 to B9, in their order of appearance as was defined by Daza-Vamenta and coworkers (Fig. 1, supplementary Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1763" pm="."><plain>By annotating the genes on the different BAC clones (supplementary Table 1) and by comparing them with the information in the NHP-MHC database, seven of the nine loci could be identified as expressed Mamu-B or B-like (I) genes [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="1827" pm="."><plain>Based on the genomic data, two primer pairs have been designed that should amplify specifically MIB1 and MIB6, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1828" pm="."><plain>As can be seen, in the case of the B11 serotype both MIB loci are situated between two expressed Mamu-B genes (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1829" pm="."><plain>The two genes next to MIB1, Mamu-B*12 and -B*38, represent ‘majors’ and are transcribed at high levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1830" pm="."><plain>MIB6 maps between the Mamu-B*49 and -I, which was named B3 by other investigators [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1831" pm="."><plain>The first one represents a ‘minor’ that is transcribed at low levels, whereas Mamu-I may represent a nonclassical [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1832" pm="."><plain>MIB genotyping was then performed on a panel of MHC homozygous rhesus macaques, mostly of consanguineous origin, comprising eight different serotypes (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1833" pm="."><plain>As expected, MIB1 and MIB6 genotyping of monkeys positive for the B11 serotype resulted in the definition of one single amplicon each. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1834" pm="."><plain>Amplification of MIB6 of the other B serotypes also resulted in one PCR product of distinct but variable length. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1835" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the Mamu-B11-specific STR displays length variation at the population level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1836" pm="."><plain>The exception is provided by the B13 and B24 serotypes, for which no MIB6 locus could be amplified . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1837" pm="."><plain>In contrast, genotyping with the MIB1 primers resulted in far more complex patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1838" pm="."><plain>The most parsimonious explanation is that the MIB1 primer pair, although specific for its locus on the B11 serotype, may amplify several related MIB loci in the case of other serotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1839" pm="."><plain>Since the analysis was performed on truly homozygous animals, genotyping allows the characterization of one to five MIB1 amplicons per haplotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1840" pm="."><plain>The different amplification patterns of MIB6 as well as MIB1 appear, however, to be haplotype and serotype specific (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="1841" pm="."><plain>To verify that the different amplicons are inherited in a Mendelian manner, two families have been analyzed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1842" pm="."><plain>Informative pedigree information of one family is shown, together with the corresponding serotypes as well as the MIB inheritance patterns (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1843" pm="."><plain>The results verify that the STRs segregate according to Mendelian rules and illustrate that both microsatellite patterns are haplotype specific. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1844" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this approach proves that the two STR lengths as defined for MIB6 of serotype B11 (Table 1) are not methodical artifacts but are founder haplotype specific (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1911" pm="."><plain>A similar step has already been suggested to have taken place before the evolution of the HLA-B region in humans [14], and based on these novel data it is likely to have occurred before the Old World monkey-hominoid split. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1912" pm="."><plain>In the ancestor of Old World monkeys, ∼25 Myr ago, both duplicons must have been subject to several rounds of tandem duplications (Fig. 6), a scenario that is supported by the phylogenetic analysis of different MIB loci in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1913" pm="."><plain>This scenario may also help to shed light on the localization and functionality of B genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1914" pm="."><plain>An example is given by MIB1 (Fig. 1, Fig. 5), which, on this specific chromosome, is the most centromeric MIB locus followed upstream by Mamu-B loci with truncated or lost HERV16 sequences. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1919" pm="."><plain>However, the 5′ enhancers and other regulatory sequences may have been affected during subsequent duplication steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1920" pm="."><plain>The centromeric B-genes themselves appear to be intact, which implies that they are perfect substrates to recruit new sequences for immune response purposes by means of recombination-like processes [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1921" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, old sequences that once had a function in the immune response can be reactivated by recombination, positioning them in the correct context of functionally operative promotors and/or enhancer elements. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1923" pm="."><plain>An example is given by the identical MIB1-STR segment that is present on B17, B24, B2, and B13 haplotypes (Table 1, rows; Fig. 4, shadowed). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="1927" pm="."><plain>However, the observation that the same MIB locus, MIB5, is present on both reported haplotypes [16], [29] but localized next to different B loci makes this possibility very unlikely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1928" pm="."><plain>Thus, such sharing of identical MIB loci on different B haplotypes is most likely explained by recent crossing over events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1929" pm="."><plain>It seems plausible that subsequent to the duplication processes, recombination has occurred between various MIB and Mamu-B loci, promoted by associated transposable elements acting as recombination hotspots [30]–[36], resulting in a hyperplastic B region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1930" pm="."><plain>Extensive gene copy number variation may also be explained by unequal crossing over processes. </plain></SENT>
