<SENT sid="2629" pm="."><plain>Using various biochemical approaches, these adapter proteins have been shown capable of binding to a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptors1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2630" pm="."><plain>Important insights into the true biological roles of Grb10 and Grb14 have come from gene-deletion studies in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2631" pm="."><plain>The Grb10 gene is maternally imprinted in mice, and loss of the maternal allele results in mice that are approximately 30% greater in size than wild-type littermates, with disproportionately large livers3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2632" pm="."><plain>As adults, these mice exhibit improved glucose tolerance, increased muscle mass and reduced adiposity4,5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2633" pm="."><plain>Transgenic mice overexpressing Grb10 show postnatal growth retardation and insulin resistance as a consequence of hyper-negative regulation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2634" pm="."><plain>Male Grb14−/− mice are of normal size and exhibit improved glucose tolerance and enhanced insulin signaling in muscle and liver7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2635" pm="."><plain>These in vivo studies established that Grb10 and Grb14 are important tissue-specific negative regulators of insulin and IGF1 signaling. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P3"><text><SENT sid="2636" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence suggests that Grb10 and Grb14 might contribute to type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes in humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2637" pm="."><plain>In the ob/ob mouse model for type 2 diabetes, Grb14 mRNA levels were increased by 75–100% in adipose tissue, and in type 2 diabetic patients, Grb14 mRNA levels were elevated by 43% in subcutaneous adipose tissue compared with non-diabetic control patients8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2638" pm="."><plain>In a genome-wide association scan of an Amish population, the strongest association between type 2 diabetes and a single-nucleotide polymorphism was in the Grb10 gene9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P4"><text><SENT sid="2639" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that the BPS region of Grb14 binds as a pseudosubstrate in the active site of the insulin receptor kinase to suppress substrate phosphorylation and thus downregulate insulin signaling10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2640" pm="."><plain>The Grb14 SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated activation loop of the kinase to increase the affinity and specificity of the Grb14-insulin receptor interaction10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2641" pm="."><plain>In an effort to understand the roles of the RA and PH domains of Grb10 and Grb14 in inhibition of insulin signaling, we determined the crystal structure of the tandem RA and PH domains of human Grb10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2642" pm="."><plain>The structure reveals that these two domains, along with the ~40-residue intervening linker, form an integrated RA-PH structural unit, which is dimerized via a helical extension of the PH domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2643" pm="."><plain>We provide evidence that Grb14 is a more potent inhibitor of insulin signaling than Grb10, and that both phosphoinositide and GTPase binding are crucial for downregulation of insulin signaling by Grb14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2644" pm="."><plain>Our structural and biochemical data yield insights into the mechanisms of membrane recruitment not only for Grb7-10-14, but also for the so-called MRL proteins11: MIG-1012, Rap1-interacting adapter molecule (RIAM)13,14, lamellipodin15 and Pico16, which are Ena/VASP-binding adapter proteins predicted to possess a similar RA-PH structural unit. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="2647" pm="."><plain>We engineered an E. coli expression construct to encode residues 106-357 of human Grb10, comprising the RA and PH domains, with a 6xHis-tag included on the N-terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2648" pm="."><plain>Initial size-exclusion chromatography experiments on purified protein indicated that adventitious disulfide-bond formation was occurring (ten cysteines in this construct), leading to dimerization and higher-order oligomerization, despite the presence of reducing agent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2649" pm="."><plain>To suppress disulfide-bond formation, we introduced four cysteine to serine substitutions (see Online Methods), based on their solvent exposure in available structures of RA and PH domain, at which point the protein ran as a single monomeric species on a size-exclusion column. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2650" pm="."><plain>This protein was nevertheless refractory to crystallization, and we introduced two additional substitutions at presumed surface residues of the PH domain (K270A, E271A) to facilitate lattice interactions17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2651" pm="."><plain>These substitutions did not affect phosphoinositide binding in vitro (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2652" pm="."><plain>Crystals of this protein were obtained in monoclinic space group C2 with two Grb10 RA-PH molecules in the asymmetric unit (Ala270 and Ala271 are, in fact, in lattice contacts). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2653" pm="."><plain>The structure was determined by single anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing of selenomethionyl-substituted protein crystals, and the structure was refined at 2.6 Å resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2654" pm="."><plain>Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2655" pm="."><plain>Although disulfide-bond formation was apparently not an obstacle to crystallization of Grb14 RA-PH (only four cysteines, no evidence of disulfide formation), we were unable to obtain crystals of wild-type Grb14 RA-PH or the double mutant K272A/E273A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="2656" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of Grb10 RA-PH reveals canonically folded RA and PH domains with two exceptional features: an extensive interface between the two domains and the intervening linker, and a dimerized RA-PH unit via a C-terminal helical extension of the PH domain (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2657" pm="."><plain>The RA domain adopts the ubiquitin-like fold observed for other RA domains such as those from c-Raf18 and RalGDS19, comprising a five-stranded β sheet and three short α helices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2658" pm="."><plain>The Grb10 PH domain comprises a seven-stranded (anti-parallel) β sandwich and a C-terminal α helix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2659" pm="."><plain>In contrast to canonical PH domains, which terminate after the C-terminal helix, the polypeptide chain in the Grb10 PH domain undergoes an approximately 90° turn after this helix, facilitated by conserved Gly342, and then forms a two-turn α helix (α2 in Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2660" pm="."><plain>This helical extension to the Grb10 PH domain is involved in dimerization of RA-PH (Fig. 1c, detailed below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="2661" pm="."><plain>The RA and PH domains are adjoined through an anti-parallel β-strand interaction: β4 of the RA domain with β5 of the PH domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2662" pm="."><plain>The RA-PH interface buries a total surface area of 1,326 Å2 and is fortified by a number of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2663" pm="."><plain>Two hydrophobic residues from each domain—Leu160 and Leu162 (RA) and Phe287 and Leu318 (PH)—interdigitate to form a small hydrophobic cluster in the interface (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1 online (electron density map)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2664" pm="."><plain>The hydrophobicity of these residues is conserved in Grb7-10-14 (Fig. 2a) and in the MRL proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2665" pm="."><plain>In “stand-alone” RA and PH domains, the corresponding residues are typically hydrophilic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2666" pm="."><plain>A salt bridge is made between Glu167 (RA) and Arg337 (PH), both of which are conserved in Grb7-10-14 and in the MRL proteins, and several hydrogen-bonding interactions are present in the interface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2667" pm="."><plain>Limited trypsin digestion of Grb10 and Grb14 RA-PH, which separates the two domains, followed by size-exclusion chromatography confirmed the physical association of the domains (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2668" pm="."><plain>In this configuration of the RA and PH domains, both the Ras (or other small GTPase) binding site in the RA domain and the phosphoinositide binding site in the PH domain are accessible (Fig. 1b, note positions of labels ‘RA’ and ‘PH’). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="2669" pm="."><plain>The linker between the RA and PH domains of Grb10 comprises approximately 40 residues that are well conserved in Grb7-10-14 (Fig. 2a), but less conserved in the MRL proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2670" pm="."><plain>In the Grb10 RA-PH structure, residues in the linker form two short α helices and one β strand, the latter of which augments (in an anti-parallel fashion) β1 of the PH domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2671" pm="."><plain>The linker interacts primarily with the PH domain and its C-terminal helical extension (α2) via Grb7-10-14-conserved (hydrophobicity) Tyr194, Phe196, Phe197, Phe203, Phe204, Met208, Val209, Leu223, Leu224, Phe227 and Leu228 (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2672" pm="."><plain>These contacts appear to stabilize the position of α2 for dimerization. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="2673" pm="."><plain>In the crystal structure, the two RA-PH molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by an approximate two-fold axis (174° rotation, 0.5 Å translation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2674" pm="."><plain>The dimerization interface buries a total surface area of 1,566 Å2, and the contributing residues are mainly from the C-terminal helical extension (α2) of the PH domain (Met343, Leu344, Tyr346, Gln347, Asn348 and Arg350) and also from the RA-PH linker (Gln224 and Asn228) (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2675" pm="."><plain>These residues are relatively well conserved in Grb7-10-14 (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2676" pm="."><plain>At high loading concentrations (&gt;20 mg/ml), a dimer peak as well as a monomer peak is evident by size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting that the Kd for dimerization in solution is relatively high (see Discussion). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2677" pm="."><plain>A double-alanine substitution (Q347A/N348A) in the dimer interface suppresses dimer formation (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="2679" pm="."><plain>Because a majority of PH domains bind to membrane phosphoinositides, we characterized the phosphoinositide binding specificities of Grb10 and Grb14 RA-PH using BODIPY TMR-conjugated phosphoinositides in a fluorescence-polarization assay20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2680" pm="."><plain>Grb10 RA-PH bound to several phosphoinositides—PI(5)P, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3—with affinities (Kd values) in the 4 to 10 μM range, and bound poorly to all others (Fig. 3a and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2681" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the Grb10 PH domain binds relatively non-specifically to phosphoinositides and with modest affinities, characteristics that are common among PH domains21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2682" pm="."><plain>Using the same fluorescence-polarization assay, we also measured the phosphoinositide binding constants for Grb14 RA-PH (Fig. 3b and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2683" pm="."><plain>Despite 64% sequence identity in the PH domains of Grb10 and Grb14, the Grb14 PH domain bound to phosphoinositides with lower affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2684" pm="."><plain>The best binder was PI(3,4,5)P3 with a Kd of 28 μM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2685" pm="."><plain>All other phosphoinositides bound weakly with Kd values &gt; 90 μM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="2686" pm="."><plain>Most phosphoinositide-binding PH domains engage the headgroup “atop” the loop connecting the β1 and β2 strands (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2687" pm="."><plain>A subset of PH domains, including β-spectrin22, Tiam1 and ArhGAP920, bind headgroups via a non-canonical mode, in which the headgroup binds on the “side” of β2 and interacts with the β5-β6 loop as well (Fig. 3d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2688" pm="."><plain>A sequence alignment of Grb10 and Grb14 with various PH domains (Fig. 2b) suggests that phosphoinositides may bind non-canonically to the Grb10 and Grb14 PH domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2689" pm="."><plain>Canonical-binding PH domains (e.g., Grp123,24 and Akt25) contain a lysine or arginine two residues C-terminal to a buried hydrophobic residue in β1 (Leu239 in Grb10) (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2690" pm="."><plain>In Grb10, Grb14 and ArhGAP9, a hydrophobic residue is positioned here (Val241 in Grb10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2691" pm="."><plain>Non-canonical-binding PH domains usually contain instead a basic residue three residues C-terminal to the conserved hydrophobic residue, as do Grb10 (Lys242) and Grb14 (Lys244). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2692" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the next residue in Grb10 and Grb14 is a glutamic acid (Glu243/245 in Grb10/14), which would be predicted to hinder headgroup binding at the canonical site, both sterically and electrostatically (Fig. 3c). β-spectrin and ArhGAP9 also contain residues with large (although not acidic) side chains at this position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2693" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in Grb7, this residue is a glycine, as in Grp1 and Akt, which bind PI(3,4,5)P3 canonically. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="2694" pm="."><plain>In the β5-β6 loop, less sequence similarity is exhibited between β-spectrin, ArhGAP9, and Grb7-10-14 (Fig. 2b), and therefore it is more difficult to predict which residues in the β5-β6 loop of Grb7-10-14 might be involved in binding headgroups non-canonically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2695" pm="."><plain>Although there are several basic residues in this loop in Grb7-10-14, their positioning in the Grb10 RA-PH structure indicates that they are unlikely to interact directly with phosphate groups of the headgroup. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2696" pm="."><plain>One residue in the β5-β6 loop of Grb10 that appears to be positioned for headgroup binding is Asn297, which is a glycine in Grb14. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="2697" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, attempts to co-crystallize (or soak) Grb10 RA-PH with various phosphoinositide headgroups were unsuccessful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2698" pm="."><plain>To explore the phosphoinositide binding modes utilized by Grb10 and Grb14, we introduced several individual point mutations into Grb10 and Grb14 RA-PH and measured phosphoinositide binding using the fluorescence-polarization assay. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="2701" pm="."><plain>Lys242 and Lys247 are positioned to interact with headgroups only in the non-canonical binding mode (Fig. 3d), and these mutations resulted in approximately a two- and five-fold loss of binding, respectively (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2702" pm="."><plain>Lys250 could interact with the 1-phosphate group in either binding mode (canonical or non-canonical), and mutation to alanine also resulted in a five-fold loss of binding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="2703" pm="."><plain>The case for non-canonical binding is strengthened by the N297G mutation in the β5-β6 loop of the Grb10 PH domain, which also resulted in a five-fold loss of binding (Table 2), and the E243G/L244S mutation in the β1-β2 loop, which had no appreciable effect on headgroup binding, but would be predicted to increase canonical binding in the absence of an alternative binding mode (Fig. 3c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2704" pm="."><plain>In Grb14, this same mutation resulted in a four-fold increase in PI(3,4,5)P3 binding, while replacement of Gly299 with asparagine (β5-β6 loop) did not result in higher (Grb10-like) binding affinities. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="2733" pm="."><plain>After insulin stimulation, the insulin receptor is downregulated by several mechanisms, including dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases such as PTP1B28,29 and binding of the adapter protein Grb147. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2734" pm="."><plain>The BPS region in Grb14 directly inhibits the catalytic activity of the insulin receptor by binding as a pseudosubstrate in the kinase active site, and the C-terminal SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated activation loop10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2735" pm="."><plain>Our current structural and biochemical studies focused on the RA and PH domains of Grb10 and Grb14, and demonstrated that they, in addition to the BPS region and SH2 domain, are required for inhibition of insulin signaling by Grb14 (Fig. 5a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="2736" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure of Grb10 RA-PH reveals that these two domains, separated in sequence by ~40 residues, nevertheless physically associate to form a single structural unit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2737" pm="."><plain>The RA-PH interface is conserved in Grb14 and Grb7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2738" pm="."><plain>We propose that the role of the integrated RA-PH structural unit is to optimize binding of small GTPases (e.g., Ras) at the plasma membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2739" pm="."><plain>That is, binding of the PH domain to membrane phosphoinositides will favorably position the structurally coupled RA domain for binding to membrane-anchored GTPases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2740" pm="."><plain>As judged from the Grb14-Ras-insulin receptor structural model (Fig. 6), the particular mechanism of membrane anchoring of a GTPase—N-terminal (e.g., Arf proteins) versus C-terminal (e.g., Ras proteins), length of the tether—could dictate whether a given GTPase will interact with an RA-PH unit, in addition to the intrinsic GTPase-RA domain binding affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2741" pm="."><plain>For example, the Rap1 C-terminal tail is seven residues shorter than that of N-Ras, which could explain, in part, why Rap1 binds poorly to Grb14 (data not shown) and Grb726. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P22"><text><SENT sid="2742" pm="."><plain>Most PH domains bind to membrane phosphoinositides and do so with modest affinities21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2743" pm="."><plain>The measured binding affinities to the Grb10 PH domain are in the 4–10 μM Kd range (for PIP2 and PIP3, Table 2), whereas for the Grb14 PH domain, the range is ≥30 μM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2744" pm="."><plain>The sequences of the Grb10 and Grb14 PH domains, particularly a glutamic acid in the β1-β2 loop (Glu243 in Grb10) (Fig. 3c), suggested that these PH domains may bind phosphoinositides non-canonically20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2745" pm="."><plain>The mutagenesis data (Table 2), although not unequivocal, indicate that the Grb10 PH domain binds phosphoinositides non-canonically, but that the Grb14 PH domain may bind phosphoinositides canonically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2746" pm="."><plain>Because Grb14 RA-PH showed modest in vitro specificity toward PI(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3b), we tested whether wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3K, affects the ability of Grb14 to be recruited to the insulin receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2747" pm="."><plain>The co-immunoprecipitation results (data not shown) suggest that PI-3K activity is not required for Grb14 recruitment to the receptor. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P23"><text><SENT sid="2748" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, PH domains have been implicated in binding directly to activated GTPases30, raising the question whether the Grb14 PH domain, which binds phosphoinositides weakly, could bind directly to GTPases together with the RA domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2749" pm="."><plain>Based on the relative position of the RA and PH domains in the Grb10 RA-PH structure and the mode of GTPase binding to an RA domain18,27 (with corroboration from the Grb14 K140A result (Fig. 4b)), a direct interaction between the Grb14 PH domain and a GTPase appears unlikely. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P24"><text><SENT sid="2750" pm="."><plain>Grb14 binds better to activated Ras than Grb10 (Fig. 4a), although it is not clear from the Grb10 RA-PH structure and a sequence comparison of the RA domains why this might be so. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2751" pm="."><plain>Because membrane recruitment via the PH domain is important for the interaction of Grb14 with Ras (K252A in Fig. 4b), differences in the phosphoinositide binding characteristics of the PH domains of Grb10 and Grb14 might account for the differential ability to interact with Ras. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2752" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that the higher-affinity (and more promiscuous) PH domain of Grb10 results in recruitment to different regions of the plasma membrane than Grb14, or perhaps to internal membranes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2753" pm="."><plain>Of note, dimerization of the RA-PH unit through the C-terminal extension of the PH domain will increase membrane binding avidity21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2754" pm="."><plain>Although Grb10 RA-PH only weakly dimerizes in solution (Supplementary Fig. 4 online), dimerization of the Grb10/14 SH2 domain31, along with membrane association of the PH domain, will enhance formation of the RA-PH dimer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P25"><text><SENT sid="2755" pm="."><plain>Our functional studies monitoring Akt and ERK activation downstream of insulin stimulation demonstrated that Grb14 is a more potent inhibitor of insulin signaling than Grb10 (Fig. 5a), at least in CHO-IR cells, which is probably due to more efficient recruitment of Grb14 to the insulin receptor (Fig. 5b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2756" pm="."><plain>Previous biochemical experiments showed that the Grb14 BPS region is a more potent inhibitor (and thus better binder) of the insulin receptor than the Grb10 BPS region32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2757" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrating that Grb10 is a weak binder of Ras compared to Grb14 (Fig. 4a), and that GTPase is evidently necessary for full recruitment of Grb14 to the insulin receptor (K140A in Fig. 5b), indicate that the RA-PH unit of Grb14 also contributes to its inhibitory signaling potency versus Grb10. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2758" pm="."><plain>In light of these biochemical results for Grb10, it is somewhat surprising that Grb10−/− mice display an improved insulin-signaling phenotype4,5, although the expression levels of Grb10 versus Grb14 in insulin-responsive cells has not been characterized. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P26"><text><SENT sid="2759" pm="."><plain>The tandem RA-PH domains of Grb7-10-14 are conserved in a second adapter-protein family (MRL proteins11) comprising the Caenorhabditis elegans protein MIG-1012, the mammalian proteins RIAM13,14 and lamellipodin12 and the Drosophila melanogaster protein Pico12, all of which are Ena/VASP-binding proteins involved in actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2760" pm="."><plain>Genetic evidence indicates that MIG-10 interacts with the small GTPase CED-10/Rac133. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2761" pm="."><plain>RIAM, although named for its ability to interact with Rap113, was shown in a different study to bind instead to Ras14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2762" pm="."><plain>Despite efforts to do so, no small GTPase has been identified as a lamellipodin binder15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2763" pm="."><plain>The PH domains of RIAM and lamellipodin, like Grb10 and Grb14, contain an acidic residue in the β1-β2 loop (Glu243 in Grb10, Supplementary Fig. 2 online), which suggests that these PH domains might bind phosphoinositides via the non-canonical mode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2764" pm="."><plain>Whether in RA-PH-containing proteins the phosphoinositide binding mode influences GTPase binding or specificity remains to be determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P27"><text><SENT sid="2765" pm="."><plain>In response to insulin, a number of cellular signaling pathways are activated, including the PI-3K and ERK pathways, which are then attenuated at the level of the insulin receptor by PTP1B and Grb14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2766" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms that govern the kinetics of insulin signaling are not well understood, in particular, how the duration of positive signaling is controlled. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2767" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor by endoplasmic reticulum-tethered PTP1B is thought to require endocytosis of the receptor, and the time scale for this process (minutes) provides a window of opportunity for recruitment and phosphorylation of IRS proteins to activate the PI-3K and ERK pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2768" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the negative regulator Grb14 is a multi-domain cytoplasmic adapter protein, not unlike the PH-PTB-containing IRS proteins, which binds to the phosphorylated (activated) kinase domain of the insulin receptor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2769" pm="."><plain>We have shown here that Grb14-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling requires functional RA and PH domains, and that Grb14 can bind to activated Ras. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2770" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that Ras activation serves as a timing mechanism for the negative-feedback inhibition of insulin signaling by Grb14. </plain></SENT>
