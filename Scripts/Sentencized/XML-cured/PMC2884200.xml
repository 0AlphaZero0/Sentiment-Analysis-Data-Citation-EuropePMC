<SENT sid="3109" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the basis of this phenotype using molecular and biochemical methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3110" pm="."><plain>Iodine staining of starch granules in 72 plants from 38 landrace accessions found 58 nonwaxy and 14 waxy phenotype plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3111" pm="."><plain>All waxy types were in plants from Chinese and Korean accessions, a distribution similar to that of the waxy phenotype in other cereals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3112" pm="."><plain>Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) protein was present in the endosperm of both nonwaxy and waxy individuals, but waxy types had little or no granule-bound starch synthase activity compared with the wild types. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3113" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of the GBSSI (Waxy) gene showed that this gene is present in two different forms (L and S) in P. miliaceum, which probably represent homeologues derived from two distinct diploid ancestors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3114" pm="."><plain>Protein products of both these forms are present in starch granules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3115" pm="."><plain>We identified three polymorphisms in the exon sequence coding for mature GBSSI peptides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3116" pm="."><plain>A 15-bp deletion has occurred in the S type GBSSI, resulting in the loss of five amino acids from glucosyl transferase domain 1 (GTD1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3117" pm="."><plain>The second GBSSI type (L) shows two sequence polymorphisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3118" pm="."><plain>One is the insertion of an adenine residue that causes a reading frameshift, and the second causes a cysteine–tyrosine amino acid polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3119" pm="."><plain>These mutations appear to have occurred in parallel from the ancestral allele, resulting in three GBSSI-L alleles in total. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3120" pm="."><plain>Five of the six possible genotype combinations of the S and L alleles were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3121" pm="."><plain>The deletion in the GBSSI-S gene causes loss of protein activity, and there was 100% correspondence between this deletion and the waxy phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3122" pm="."><plain>The frameshift mutation in the L gene results in the loss of L-type protein from starch granules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3123" pm="."><plain>The L isoform with the tyrosine residue is present in starch granules but is nonfunctional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3124" pm="."><plain>This loss of function may result from the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine, although it could not be determined whether the cysteine isoform of L represents the functional type. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="3127" pm="."><plain>The evolution and diversification of crop plants has been shaped over thousands of years by conscious and unconscious human selection on a wide range of phenotypic traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3128" pm="."><plain>In plants cultivated primarily as a carbohydrate source, including cereals, loci that determine starch quality have been among the key targets for human modification (Whitt et al. 2002; Olsen et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3131" pm="."><plain>Plant starch comprises two polymers: amylose, a predominantly linear chain of α-1,4-linked glucosyl units, and amylopectin, a highly branched molecule with short α-1,4-linked glucosyl chains linked by α-1,6-linkages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3132" pm="."><plain>Cereal endosperm starch typically comprises 15–30% amylose and 70–85% amylopectin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3133" pm="."><plain>Amylose synthesis is catalyzed by granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI, EC 2.4.1.242), which catalyzes the extension of the amylose molecule by the transfer of α-D-glucose from adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-glucose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3134" pm="."><plain>Mutations at the GBSSI (also called Waxy or Wx) locus that result in amylose being present in low levels or absent in endosperm starch (Fukunaga et al. 2002)—the waxy phenotype—have been characterized in several species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3136" pm="."><plain>In barley, a 413-bp deletion in the promoter and 5′ untranslated region of the GBSSI gene disrupts transcription, reducing the production of GBSSI protein to a fraction of its levels in the nonwaxy type (Domon et al. 2002; Patron et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3139" pm="."><plain>In maize and in foxtail millet (Setaria italica [L.] P. Beauv), gene expression is disrupted by diverse transposable element insertions (Wessler and Varagona 1985; Wessler et al. 1990; Marillonnet and Wessler 1997; Kawase et al. 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3143" pm="."><plain>In rice, a G→T mutation at the splice site of intron 1 results in incomplete processing of pre-mRNA (Hirano and Sano 1991; Wang et al. 1995; Hirano et al. 1998; Isshiki et al. 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3147" pm="."><plain>In sorghum, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been identified, which causes a Glu to His mutation that may inactivate the GBSSI protein (McIntyre et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3149" pm="."><plain>In all the above diploid crops, the waxy phenotype has arisen by spontaneous mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3150" pm="."><plain>In hexaploid bread wheat, a waxy line has been produced by crossing partially waxy cultivars with spontaneous mutations in the three GBSSI homeologues in the A, B, and D genomes (Nakamura et al. 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3152" pm="."><plain>These have been characterized, respectively, as a 23-bp deletion in the Wx-A1b allele that affects transcript splicing or a 173-bp transposon insertion in an exon; a deletion of the entire GBSSI transcription unit in the Wx-B1b allele; and a 588-bp deletion in the Wx-D1b allele that leads to the deletion of 30 amino acids from the C-terminus (Vrinten et al. 1999; Saito et al. 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3155" pm="."><plain>Distinct single-nucleotide insertions and deletions causing frameshift mutations have been identified as responsible for the independent origin of null Wx-A1 alleles in emmer wheat (Saito and Nakamura 2005). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3156" pm="."><plain>With the exception of waxy strains of emmer and bread wheats, which have been generated by modern breeding programs, waxy varieties of cereals originated in east and southeast Asia, where they have been selected in response to a cultural preference for glutinous-type (i.e., waxy) starchy foods (Sakamoto 1996; Olsen and Purugganan 2002). Panicum miliaceum L. (broomcorn, proso, or common millet), a tetraploid species (2n = 4x = 36), is one of the world's oldest and historically most important domesticated cereals; recent data attest to its presence as early as 10,000 cal BP in northern China (Crawford 2009; Lu et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3159" pm="."><plain>Its probable center of domestication was in this region (although with possible independent domestications further west in Eurasia; Zohary and Hopf 2000; Jones 2004; Hunt et al. 2008), and there is currently considerable interest in its early cultivation and domestication, as revealed through diverse analytical techniques including stable isotopic analysis, phytoliths, and lipid biomarkers (Jacob et al. 2008; Barton et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3164" pm="."><plain>These factors make this crop an interesting species in which to investigate the selection of waxy mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3165" pm="."><plain>Distinct terms indicating glutinous broomcorn millet are recorded in Chinese classical texts dating back some 2,000 years (Sakamoto 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3166" pm="."><plain>Waxy millet therefore provides an ideal system to explore the biochemistry and molecular biology that lie behind ancient food-preference choices. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="3167" pm="."><plain>Previous work (Graybosch and Baltensperger 2009) has shown that the waxy trait in this tetraploid species is determined by recessive alleles at two loci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3168" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we have provided the first characterization of these loci, obtaining DNA sequence for the region corresponding to the full length of the mature GBSSI protein for two GBSSI homeologues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3169" pm="."><plain>We found evidence for the presence of these two forms of GBSSI in starch granules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3170" pm="."><plain>At one locus, we have established a clear link between a genetic mutation and its biochemical effect of loss of GBSSI activity, leading to loss of amylose synthesis and waxy-type endosperm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3171" pm="."><plain>At the other locus, we identified three alleles, of which two result in the loss of active GBSSI protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3172" pm="."><plain>It was not possible to determine whether the third allele represents the functional version of this homeologue, but consideration of the allele distributions and genotype combinations enables us to establish a hypothesis for the evolution of the waxy phenotype in this species. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4262" pm="."><plain>This precludes identification of possible mutations in these sites from DNA sequencing, so to confirm the N-terminus of the mature peptide, we looked for the expected fragments in the peptide mass fingerprints. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="4274" pm="."><plain>Broomcorn millet represents a unique case among plant species with waxy mutants, in being a functional polyploid (Graybosch and Baltensperger 2009) in which waxy phenotypes have appeared and become established without deliberate modern breeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4275" pm="."><plain>This contrasts with the situation in wheat, in which partially waxy lines were discovered with mutations in one or two of the A, B, and D (in hexaploids) genome homeologues of GBSSI, and fully waxy tetraploid and hexaploid wheats have only very recently been synthesized through crossing appropriate partially waxy lines (Nakamura et al. 1993, 1995; Yamamori et al. 1994). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4278" pm="."><plain>Although reticulate evolutionary relationships and the ancestry of polyploid taxa in the genus Panicum are not yet known, the presence of the S and L GBSSI genes in all samples is consistent with the inference from meiotic chromosome behavior by Hamoud et al. (1994) that P. miliaceum is an allotetraploid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4279" pm="."><plain>We have observed comparable related pairs of other protein-coding nuclear sequences from P. miliaceum (Hunt HV, unpublished data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4280" pm="."><plain>The L and S sequences would thus represent homeologues of the GBSSI gene derived from two (currently unknown) diploid ancestors of P. miliaceum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4281" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of Waxy sequences in the genus Panicum would be needed to confirm this interpretation; Fortune et al. (2007) demonstrated the presence of both paralogous and homeologous Waxy sequences in hexaploid Spartina species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4282" pm="."><plain>However, the phylogenetic evidence clearly indicates that both the L and S types in P. miliaceum represent GBSSI genes; neither represents the GBSSIb/GBSSII type isoforms that are typically found in nonendosperm tissues, such as the pericarp in wheat, and pods, roots, and nodules in pea and contribute to amylose synthesis in these organs (Hylton et al. 1996; Denyer, Barber, et al. 1997; Vrinten and Nakamura 2000; Edwards et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4286" pm="."><plain>It is likely that orthologues of the GBSSIb/GBSSII protein exist in P. miliaceum too but encoded by loci distinct from those coding for the L or S genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4287" pm="."><plain>Waxy mutants in different species result variously from mutations that cause loss of GBSSI gene expression, loss of starch granule–bound protein, or loss of enzyme activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4288" pm="."><plain>The data accumulated from other species consistently indicate that GBSSI is the sole locus controlling endosperm starch waxiness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4289" pm="."><plain>Polygenic control occurs only when this locus is duplicated in functional polyploids: The genetic data of Graybosch and Baltensperger (2009) indicated the existence of distinct waxy mutations at two GBSSI loci in P. miliaceum. Our SDS-PAGE data showed that the GBSSI protein was present in approximately equal amounts in both waxy and nonwaxy lines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4290" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Graybosch and Baltensperger (2009) found only trace amounts of GBSSI in waxy lines; however, we have found that the recovery of GBSSI from starch can vary with genotype and extraction method (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4291" pm="."><plain>The SS activity data demonstrated that the GBSSI protein in waxy types was nonfunctional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4292" pm="."><plain>Consideration of the protein identities and genotype data indicates that, depending on the particular mutant alleles present in a given genotype, either one (S) or two (S and L) GBSSI loci contribute to this nonfunctional protein product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4293" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the mutations at these two loci as follows. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4294" pm="."><plain>Our experiments revealed two S-type GBSSI alleles (S0 and S−15) and three L-type GBSSI alleles (LC, LY, and Lf). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4295" pm="."><plain>Of the six possible combinations of these S and L alleles, we found only five: None of the 72 plants analyzed had the genotype S−15/LC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4296" pm="."><plain>The most common genotype was S0/LC (31 plants, from 17 accessions). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4297" pm="."><plain>We can postulate that this represents the ancestral genotype, for the following reasons: It is the most abundant genotype, and its distribution includes accessions from northern China, thought to be the center of diversity and origin of broomcorn millet (Crawford 2009; Hu et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4299" pm="."><plain>From the phenotype of the S0/Lf plants, we know that the S0 allele encodes an active GBSSI protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4300" pm="."><plain>Given that no waxy mutants are known in any wild plant species (Sakamoto 1996; Shapter et al. 2009), it is highly likely that the diploid ancestors of Panicum miliaceum, and the newly formed tetraploid P. miliaceum or its wild progenitor, had S and L alleles encoding functional proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4302" pm="."><plain>The data of Graybosch and Baltensperger (2009) indicate that a functional L-type allele still exists in the genepool. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4303" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesize that LC encodes this active GBSSI, although proof of this is lacking at present, in the absence of an S−15/LC genotype individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4304" pm="."><plain>Both the LC and S−15 alleles are present at relatively high frequency in Chinese samples, but because P. miliaceum is strongly self-pollinating, it is possible that nonrandom mating has meant this genotype has not arisen or is extremely rare. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4305" pm="."><plain>If our model is correct, the mutant S−15 allele in combination with either the mutant LY or mutant Lf allele is required to produce a plant with the waxy phenotype. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4306" pm="."><plain>Redundancy of homeologous gene copies in polyploid species means that it is not uncommon for one homeologue to lose function (Wendel 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4307" pm="."><plain>It is possible that following tetraploidization in P. miliaceum, a loss-of-function mutation in either the S or L GBSSI gene would have had little effect on starch phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4308" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with the results of Graybosch and Baltensperger (2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4309" pm="."><plain>We found two such genotypes with loss-of-function mutations in just the L gene: S0/LY in 15 plants and S0/Lf in 12 plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4310" pm="."><plain>We have shown that both the LY and Lf alleles confer loss of L-type GBSSI function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4311" pm="."><plain>The mutant LY and Lf alleles arose independently, as demonstrated by the finding that no plant with the frameshift mutation in exon 9 also had the alanine substitution in exon 7, and they may have become widespread within the P. miliaceum distribution because, in isolation, they had little impact on the starch phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4312" pm="."><plain>This is demonstrated by the high frequency of the LY allele in samples from western Russia, Ukraine and the Caucasus, far from the region where sticky-starch foods are preferred. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4313" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that a mutant L allele in an S0 background may confer a partially waxy phenotype with a slightly lower than normal amylose content that is favored for some food uses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4314" pm="."><plain>If so, these alleles may have spread more rapidly through the population due to active selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4315" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that partial waxy mutants of wheat were selected specifically for the production of udon noodles (Nakamura et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4317" pm="."><plain>The varieties of hexaploid wheat now grown for udon noodle production have one or two inactive waxy alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4318" pm="."><plain>It is thought that the slightly lower amylose content of these genotypes confers desirable phenotypic properties and has thus been selected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4319" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of loss of activity in mutant L-type GBSSI clearly differs between alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4320" pm="."><plain>For the Lf mutant allele, a frameshift due to the insertion of an additional nucleotide (A) is responsible for the loss of the L protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4321" pm="."><plain>The predicted protein product of the Lf gene has its GTD1 domain disrupted and truncated as a result of the frameshift within GTD5 and is therefore unlikely to be catalytically active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4322" pm="."><plain>We did not see any evidence for this protein from immunoblotting, and it is probable that it is unstable or not synthesized at all (perhaps as a result of nonsense-mediated decay of the RNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4323" pm="."><plain>The LY allele is also evidently inactive, and we can hypothesize that it is the substitution of adenine for guanine at position 249 in exon 7 (which causes the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine in the amino acid sequence) that results in loss of L protein activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4324" pm="."><plain>The cysteine residue is conserved in all monocot GBSSI sequences and is located in GTD5, close to the active site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4325" pm="."><plain>It is likely that the loss-of-function mutation in the GBSSI-S gene arose in a line already carrying an L-gene mutation, because no S−15/LC genotype plants were found, and that this resulted in a plant with a fully waxy phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4326" pm="."><plain>A single mutation appears to account for loss of S protein activity in all samples analyzed: The 15-bp deletion was present in all plants with waxy-type grain, and conversely, all genotypes with this deletion had waxy grain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4327" pm="."><plain>We found 14 waxy-phenotype plants: 9 plants with the S−15/Lf genotype and 5 with the S−15/LY genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4328" pm="."><plain>It is unlikely that the S−15 mutation occurred more than once, and so, we suggest that the two genotypes that demonstrably result in waxy phenotypes, S−15/LY and S−15/Lf, arose from hybridization between one of these genotypes and a phenotypically nonwaxy plant with the alternative mutant L allele in an S0 background. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4329" pm="."><plain>The five amino acid deletion in the GBSSI-S protein, responsible for the loss of S protein activity in the P. miliaceum S−15 allele, lies in the GTD1 (fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4330" pm="."><plain>The seven-amino-acid sequence spanning the deletion in the wild-type allele (ALNKEAL) is conserved in all monocot GBSSIs, suggesting it is functionally important. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4331" pm="."><plain>Our immunoblot, peptide fragment MS data and SS activity assay results show that the mutant GBSSI-S protein is present but nearly or completely inactive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4332" pm="."><plain>This mutant GBSSI protein nevertheless persists in binding to starch granules, as has been found previously for some mutant GBSSIs in other species (e.g., one of the three mutant pea embryo GBSSI isoforms identified by Denyer et al. [1995] was found in normal amounts inside starch granules). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4333" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that the five-amino-acid deletion in the P. miliaceum GBSSI-S protein results in a disruption of the GTD1, resulting in the observed loss of SS activity, but does not affect the binding of this protein to the starch granules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4334" pm="."><plain>It is possible that other mutant GBSSI alleles exist in P. miliaceum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4335" pm="."><plain>However, our determination of the full-length amino acid sequences of the mature L and S GBSSI proteins, inferred from DNA sequence and peptide mass fragment data in multiple waxy and nonwaxy samples, means that we can be confident that no other mutations exist that universally account for loss of functional protein at either locus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4336" pm="."><plain>All waxy-type individuals in this study came from accessions of East Asian (Chinese and Korean) origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4337" pm="."><plain>All samples originating elsewhere (Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mongolia) were nonwaxy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4338" pm="."><plain>Chinese samples showed a mixture of waxy and nonwaxy types both within and between accessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4339" pm="."><plain>This distribution of waxy phenotypes concurs with the data of Kimata and Negishi (2002), who found waxy and intermediate phenotypes in around 60% of P. miliaceum accessions from East Asia (China, Korea, and Mongolia) and at very low frequencies among accessions from elsewhere in Eurasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4340" pm="."><plain>These authors also found that nearly 100% of Japanese accessions were waxy or intermediate; we did not include any samples from Japan in this study, and we did not observe any of the intermediate phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4341" pm="."><plain>A similar geographic pattern is found in other cereals, comprising a mix of waxy and nonwaxy varieties in East and Southeast Asia, and near-exclusively nonwaxy varieties elsewhere in the range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4342" pm="."><plain>This includes both species domesticated within the region (foxtail millet, rice) and those domesticated elsewhere and introduced into East Asia (barley, maize, sorghum, and Job's tears; Sakamoto 1996; Patron et al. 2002; Kawase et al. 2005; Olsen et al. 2006; Fan et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4347" pm="."><plain>Waxy types have not been recorded in wild cereals (Sakamoto 1996; Shapter et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4349" pm="."><plain>Selective sweeps in the Waxy genomic region have been demonstrated in rice and maize that reflect strong postdomestication selection, revealing the shaping of crop genome evolution through human choice (Olsen et al. 2006; Fan et al. 2008; Vaughan et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4353" pm="."><plain>A “glutinous-endosperm starch food culture,” which arose early in the history of cereal farming in East and Southeast Asia and remained confined to the cultures of this region, is thought to have driven selection for waxy mutants arising in domesticated cereal populations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4354" pm="."><plain>The waxy broomcorn millet lines in this study all showed the same mutation in the GBSSI-S gene, implying a single origin for the loss of protein function in this homeologue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4355" pm="."><plain>In the GBSSI-L gene, there are two nonfunctional alleles of independent origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4356" pm="."><plain>As in foxtail millet (S. italica), where waxy phenotypes have resulted from several different transposon insertion events (Kawase et al. 2005), waxy alleles in broomcorn millet may have distinct distribution geographies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4358" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the distribution of these alleles within and between populations, varieties, and landraces of cultivated broomcorn millet is of great relevance to understanding both the history of this crop's origins and spread and how the organization of crop plant diversity has been shaped by human food choices. </plain></SENT>
