Identification of long-range acting elements is particularly important in the case of disease genes as mutations in these elements can result in human disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that long-range control of gene expression is facilitated by chromatin looping interactions. These interactions can be detected by chromosome conformation capture (3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4442" pm="."><plain>Here, we employed 3C as a discovery tool for identification of long-range regulatory elements that control the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene, CFTR. We identified four elements in a 460-kb region around the locus that loop specifically to the CFTR promoter exclusively in CFTR expressing cells. The elements are located 20 and 80 kb upstream; and 109 and 203 kb downstream of the CFTR promoter. These elements contain DNase I hypersensitive sites and histone modification patterns characteristic of enhancers. The elements also interact with each other and the latter two activate the CFTR promoter synergistically in reporter assays. Our results reveal novel long-range acting elements that control expression of CFTR and suggest that 3C-based approaches can be used for discovery of novel regulatory elements. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="4448" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="4449" pm="."><plain>Appropriate spatial and temporal control of gene expression depends on regulatory input from cis-acting elements such as promoters, enhancers and repressors. Identification of these elements is challenging because they can be located far from their target gene, sometimes up to several megabases (1–3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4451" pm="."><plain>Detailed knowledge of such distant regulatory elements and their mechanism of action will greatly contribute to basic understanding of gene expression. <p><text><SENT sid="4452" pm="."><plain>Abundant evidence suggests that human disease can be caused by mutations that affect distant regulatory elements, while leaving the disease gene itself intact. Examples include Aniridia, caused by loss of distant regulatory elements of the PAX6 gene, and blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) that can be caused by deletion of regulatory elements located &gt;600 kb from the FOXL2 gene (4,5). <p><text><SENT sid="4454" pm="."><plain>Regulatory elements are often characterized by the presence of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS), which can mark the position where transcription factors are bound to DNA. Other chromatin features found at distant regulatory elements are increased levels of H3K4me1 and histone acetylation (6,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4456" pm="."><plain>In addition, these sequences are often conserved across species (8,9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4457" pm="."><plain>All these features can be used to identify putative functional elements and these powerful strategies are currently widely applied (10,11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4458" pm="."><plain>However, these analyses do not immediately reveal the target genes of these regulatory elements. <p><text><SENT sid="4459" pm="."><plain>Regulatory elements can directly associate with target promoters through chromatin looping (1–3,12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4460" pm="."><plain>These looping interactions can be detected using chromosome conformation capture, or 3C (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4461" pm="."><plain>The insight that regulatory elements physically associate with promoters provides a methodology to discover novel regulatory elements by performing systematic 3C analyses to search for genomic elements that are found to interact with a specific promoter. Here we tested the feasibility of such an approach by analysis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) locus. Identification of extragenic regulatory elements for this locus (and other disease related loci) is especially important because (i) they could be screened for mutations in patients with no known mutations in the CFTR gene itself, and thus aid in proper diagnosis, and (ii) they could be included in gene therapy constructs (to recapitulate endogenous CFTR regulation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4464" pm="."><plain>Finally, identification of CFTR regulatory elements will provide basic insights into the mechanisms that control expression of CFTR, which could also lead to new approaches to boost or manipulate CFTR expression in patients. <p><text><SENT sid="4465" pm="."><plain>The CFTR gene is, when both alleles are mutated, responsible for cystic fibrosis. It contains a promoter that has many characteristics of a housekeeping gene including potential binding sites for SP1 (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4467" pm="."><plain>Also present is a critical CCAAT-like element, shown to bind C/EBP (15), implicating cAMP as a possible regulator. Supporting a role for cAMP in CFTR regulation is data showing that cAMP activation of protein kinase A can regulate basal CFTR expression (16) and the discovery that CREB and ATF-1 bind the CFTR promoter in a cAMP-responsive manner (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4469" pm="."><plain>A YY1 element has also been identified that, when mutated, significantly increases the expression of CFTR (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4470" pm="."><plain>However, despite the abundance of regulatory elements in the CFTR promoter, it is clear that additional elements are required for the complex spatio-temporal expression pattern of the CFTR gene (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4471" pm="."><plain>Indeed, work from the Harris laboratory has identified additional putative regulatory elements located within introns of the gene, as well up- and down-stream of the locus. For instance, HNF1α has been found to interact with a putative regulatory element in introns 1, 10, 17a and 20 and over-expression of this protein results in increased CFTR mRNA levels (20,21). <p><text><SENT sid="4473" pm="."><plain>Here we applied a systematic 3C analysis to a 460 Kb chromosomal region surrounding the CFTR transcription start site (TSS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4474" pm="."><plain>We examined different cell lines that either express or do not express the gene in order to identify regulatory elements that function specifically in CFTR-expressing cells. Our approach was validated by identification of previously discovered regulatory elements, e.g. an element located 203 Kb downstream of the promoter that coincides with a DHS [referred to as DHS4574+15.3 (22)] and that has been found to be able to act as an insulator (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4476" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we discovered an additional regulatory element: one located within intron 11 (109 kb downstream of the TSS) that interacts with the CFTR TSS exclusively in cells that express the gene. Additional 3C analyses allowed us to define the locations of long-range-acting elements at ∼1 kb resolution. In CFTR expressing cells, these elements contain the characteristic features of known regulatory elements, such as the presence of a DHS and specific histone modification patterns. Interestingly, we find that regulatory elements also interact with each other, and in the case of the elements located 109 and 203 Kb downstream of the TSS synergistically activate the CFTR promoter in reporter assays. These studies identify novel CFTR regulatory elements and provide insights into combinatorial control of the gene. Finally, these results provide strong evidence that 3C-based approaches provide tools for ab initio discovery of regulatory elements and their target genes. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="4482" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>

Potential enhancer elements were amplified with primers containing B4B1R tails and each of these elements was cloned upstream of the promoter fragment. As the EcoRI DNA looping elements as identified by 3C were on average 4 kb in size, we split each element in smaller overlapping segments of 1.1–1.8 kb to allow positioning of the regulatory element more precisely: element III was split into two and element IV into three segments.

<SENT sid="4530" pm="."><plain>3C is a widely used method and the procedure has previously been described in detail (13,25,32,33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4531" pm="."><plain>Briefly, 3C employs formaldehyde cross-linking to capture physically interacting chromatin segments. Cross-linked chromatin is then solubilized, digested and intra-molecularly ligated so that pairs of interacting genomic elements are converted into unique ligation products. Ligation products are then detected and quantified by semi-quantitative PCR (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). <p><text><SENT sid="4534" pm="."><plain>Here we used 3C as a discovery tool for ab initio identification of distant regulatory elements that interact specifically with the active CFTR promoter. We performed 3C with Caco2 cells, which express high levels of CFTR, and with GM06990 lymphoblastoid cells, which express very low levels of CFTR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>) to identify genomic elements that physically associate with the CFTR promoter. We used a PCR primer located in the EcoRI fragment that contains the CFTR TSS and paired it with primers in restriction fragments throughout a 460-kb region surrounding the promoter (primer sequences available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4537" pm="."><plain>This experimental setup will detect ligation (and thus long-range interaction) of the promoter fragment with any of the other restriction fragments. The results are shown in Figure 1A (3C data available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4539" pm="."><plain>In GM06990 cells, we observe that the promoter fragment interacts most strongly with nearby restriction fragments and that interaction frequencies decrease precipitously for fragments located farther away. This inverse relationship between interaction frequency and genomic distance is expected for a flexible chromatin fiber in the absence of any specific long-range looping interactions (13,24,34–36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4541" pm="."><plain>Specific long-range looping interactions would result in peaks of interaction frequency super-imposed upon this background of interactions. We conclude that in GM06990 cells, the promoter does not engage in specific interactions with elements located in the surrounding 460 kb (Figure 1A). Figure 1.Chromosome conformation capture (3C) reveals four elements that interact with the CFTR transcription start site. All experiments used EcoRI to digest the chromatin. Interaction frequencies between the CFTR transcription start site and a 460 kb surrounding region are determined by 3C.

In addition, we observe frequent interactions with several other restriction fragments, as evidenced by local peaks in interaction frequency above the background of non-specific associations. Two interacting restriction fragments are located 20 and 80 kb upstream of the TSS; one is located within the CFTR gene 109 kb downstream of the promoter in intron 11 and a fourth fragment is located 203 kb downstream of the TSS (15 kb downstream of the 3′-end of the gene). <p><text><SENT sid="4553" pm="."><plain>To confirm these results we analyzed two additional pairs of cell lines, each composed of one cell line that expresses CFTR and one that does not. First, we chose HT29 cells, which express high levels of CFTR (37), and K562 cells, which do not express CFTR (as determined by RT-PCR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4555" pm="."><plain>We again performed 3C to analyze long-range interactions with the CFTR promoter fragment (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4556" pm="."><plain>We observe that in both cell lines the promoter fragment frequently interacts with neighboring fragments, as expected, but these interactions are less frequent in HT29 cells than in K562 cells. We have previously observed that interaction frequencies around active promoters can be reduced, possibly as the result of local chromatin decondensation (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4558" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we found no evidence for specific long-range looping interactions in K562 cells, but we again observe local peaks in interaction frequency for multiple restriction fragments in CFTR-expressing HT29 cells. Importantly, these interacting restriction fragments are the same as those observed in Caco2 cells (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4560" pm="."><plain>In addition, we observe a region encompassing several EcoRI restriction fragments around the 3′-end of the CFTR gene that all display increased interaction frequencies as compared to K562 cells, suggesting the presence of multiple interacting elements in that region. <p><text><SENT sid="4561" pm="."><plain>Second, we analyzed HeLa S3 cells that express CFTR at a low level and HepG2 cells that do not express CFTR (as determined by RT-PCR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4562" pm="."><plain>In HeLa S3 cells we again detect specific long-range interactions between the CFTR promoter fragment and a set of distant fragments, whereas no specific long-range interactions were detected in HepG2 cells (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4563" pm="."><plain>All interacting fragments correspond to the same set of fragments detected in Caco2 and HT29 cells, except one: in HeLa S3 cells the promoter fragment does not frequently interact with the fragment located at −20 kb. Instead, the promoter fragment associates more frequently with the restriction fragment immediately adjacent to this fragment, located at −17 kb. In HepG2 this −17 kb fragment also interacts with the promoter fragment somewhat more frequently than neighboring fragments. The two adjacent fragments located at −17 and −20 kb may contain two separate elements, or a single interacting region that displays cell type specific differences in the precise point of contact with the promoter. Finally, as in HT29 cells, we observe that in HeLa S3 cells the promoter fragment frequently interacts with several restriction fragments near and beyond the 3′ end of the gene. <p><text><SENT sid="4568" pm="."><plain>Thus, multiple long-range interactions are observed between the CFTR promoter fragment and several restriction fragments upstream and downstream of the gene as well as within an intron of the gene.

Therefore we hypothesized that element III acts in concert with element IV. To test this directly we generated constructs in which both elements were cloned upstream of the CFTR promoter–luciferase construct. Specifically, we tested the part of element III (IIIb) that overlaps the BsrGI–EcoRI restriction fragment that contains the looping element.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="4692" pm="."><plain>We have employed 3C to identify long-range regulatory elements that may be involved in controlling the CFTR gene. We identified four elements that interact with the CFTR promoter specifically in CFTR-expressing cells. These looping elements appear to be gene regulatory elements based on the following observations. First, two of the elements had been previously identified as putative regulatory elements and one of these elements (element II) has been found to directly affect CFTR expression (28,41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4696" pm="."><plain>Second, these elements contain DHSs and, in the case of elements III and IV patterns of histone modifications in CFTR expressing cells that have previously been found to be predictive of distal regulatory elements (6,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4697" pm="."><plain>Third, elements III and IV can synergistically activate the CFTR promoter in expressing cells indicating that these elements can function as transcriptional enhancers. <p><text><SENT sid="4698" pm="."><plain>Our studies did not identify all previously discovered regulatory elements around the CFTR locus. There are several reasons for this. First, we did not analyze all restriction fragments throughout the 460 Kb surrounding the CFTR promoter. For instance, initially we did not analyze interactions between the CFTR promoter and a known enhancer that is located 10 kb downstream of the promoter in intron 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4702" pm="."><plain>The Harris lab has recently shown that this element interacts with and regulates the CFTR promoter (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4703" pm="."><plain>We have been able to confirm this looping interaction in subsequent 3C experiments using BsrGI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4704" pm="."><plain>Second, we have focused on only those elements that consistently interact with the CFTR promoter in CFTR expressing cell lines (Caco2, HT29, HeLa S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4705" pm="."><plain>We did find that in some cell lines (e.g. HT29) there are additional elements that appear to frequently interact with the CFTR promoter, for instance a region just downstream of the gene.

<SENT sid="4707" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have been able to confirm previously detected regulatory elements (elements I and II, as well as the known enhancer in intron 1), thereby validating our approach, and we have discovered novel CFTR regulatory elements. <p><text><SENT sid="4708" pm="."><plain>In this study we focused on elements III and IV. Further 3C experiments allowed us to narrow the regions of interaction of these elements down to ∼1 kb. The results of the 3C mapping were fully consistent with reporter assays and both approaches identified the same putative regulatory elements. In addition, these elements coincide precisely with the presence of DHSs present in CFTR expressing cells and with regions enriched in histone modifications associated with enhancers (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4712" pm="."><plain>Combined, these independent lines of research provide strong evidence that bona fide CFTR regulatory elements were identified. In a very recent similar study the Harris lab identified the same elements III and IV as CFTR enhancers (49). <p><text><SENT sid="4714" pm="."><plain>The long-range looping interactions described here are clearly correlated with expression of the CFTR gene. However, we note that the frequency of looping is not quantitatively related to the level of CFTR expression. The frequency of interaction between the CFTR promoter region and elements III and IV is quite comparable in Caco2 cells and HeLa S3 cells, despite the fact that Caco2 cells express the gene at a much higher level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4717" pm="."><plain>This indicates that these long-range interactions are not sufficient for high levels of expression. One possible explanation is that in Caco2 cells additional transcription factors and/or co-regulators bind these elements to further activate the gene. We also point out that the long-range looping interactions between the CFTR promoter and elements I–IV are not required for a low level of expression, as GM06990 cells express very low, but detectable, levels of CFTR while none of these long-range interactions are detected. It is possible that this low level is simply due to basal promoter activity or is the result of long-range interactions with other distal regulatory element. For instance, we find that in GM06990 cells the promoter is interacting with the enhancer element in intron 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq175/DC1">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4722" pm="."><plain>Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that immortalized cell lines such as GM06990 display somewhat altered expression patterns as compared to the primary cells of origin. <p><text><SENT sid="4723" pm="."><plain>The four elements we uncovered in our 3C analysis interact with the CFTR promoter in all three CFTR expressing cells.

<SENT sid="4725" pm="."><plain>We do note that the frequency of interaction between pairs of elements varies (Figure 2), and is also somewhat different between cell lines. Thus, although the overall conformation of the locus is comparable in Caco2 and HeLa S3 cells, there may be slight differences in the frequencies with which long-range interaction occur.

The grey circle symbolizes the spatial domain containing the clustered promoter and regulatory elements. <p><text><SENT sid="4733" pm="."><plain>Our reporter assays suggest that elements III and IV activate the CFTR promoter in a synergistic manner. This is interesting because elements III and IV directly associate with each other, which could provide a mechanism by which widely spaced elements can coordinately control gene expression. It is likely that specific protein complexes associate with these elements and mediate interactions between them and with the CFTR promoter. Previous work from the Harris Lab has started to identify some proteins that could potentially associate with the DHS that is present in element IV. They found that this element contains two CT polymorphisms, and these mutations alter the DNA binding of ARP-1 and HNF-4 in vitro (50). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4740" pm="."><plain>Future studies will be aimed at identifying these protein complexes in more detail so that the mechanisms of long-range associations and their effect on transcription can be further dissected. <p><text><SENT sid="4741" pm="."><plain>Identification of extra-genic elements that affect expression of CFTR will not only provide basic insights into spatio-temporal regulation of this important gene, it may also be important for genetic diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. A significant number of patients with cystic fibrosis symptoms do not appear to carry mutations in the CFTR exons or promoter, suggesting that extra-genic or intronic mutations may be present, e.g. in long-range acting gene regulatory elements. Mutations in regulatory elements can also result in disease characteristics that are distinct form the full cystic fibrosis phenotype, such as congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. In the absence of information of the positions of distant regulatory elements it is not feasible to screen for mutations in a very large genomic region. Thus, identification of CFTR regulatory elements, as we have described here, provides new targets for mutation screening. Furthermore, gene therapy approaches for cystic fibrosis could benefit from knowledge of gene regulatory elements by including such elements in CFTR gene targeting constructs. <p><text><SENT sid="4747" pm="."><plain>We have shown that 3C technology can be used to discover novel regulatory elements throughout gene loci.
