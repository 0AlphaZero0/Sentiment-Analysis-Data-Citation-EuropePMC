<SENT sid="4884" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="4885" pm="."><plain>Obesity is associated with a low-grade proinflammatory state resulting in an increase of circulating cytokines and inflammatory markers [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4886" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory cytokines have been involved in the impairment of insulin signaling, thus providing molecular links between inflammation and insulin resistance [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4887" pm="."><plain>Inflammation reportedly produces metabolic alterations in skeletal muscle with both inflammatory response and insulin resistance being associated with loss of muscle mass by decreased protein synthesis and increased proteolysis [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4888" pm="."><plain>Recently, our group has shown that leptin reverses muscle loss of ob/ob mice by inhibiting the activity of the transcriptional factor forkhead box class O3a (FoxO3a) [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4889" pm="."><plain>Leptin is an adipocyte-derived peptidic hormone [7] that inhibits food intake and increases thermogenesis by acting through its hypothalamic receptors [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4890" pm="."><plain>Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are obese, hyperphagic, exhibit type 2 diabetes, decreased body temperature and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4891" pm="."><plain>Leptin is a member of the long-chain helical cytokine family and its receptors, which belong to the class I cytokine receptors, are present in bone marrow and spleen as well as on peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4892" pm="."><plain>Leptin increases in response to acute infection and sepsis and it has been reported to exert a profound influence on the function and proliferation of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells [11], on the phagocytosis of macrophages/monocytes [12], and to have a direct effect on the secretion of anti- and proinflammatory cytokines [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4893" pm="."><plain>In this regard, impaired cellular and humoral immunity have been shown in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice as well as in leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4894" pm="."><plain>These studies reflect the molecular nature of leptin as a cytokine and are consistent with leptin signaling playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated inflammation and muscle loss. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4895" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, gastrocnemius muscle samples from wild type and ob/ob mice were analyzed for mRNA presence of over 41,000 transcripts by microarray analysis to identify genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress that are affected by leptin deficiency and leptin administration in ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4896" pm="."><plain>It was shown that leptin increases the gastrocnemius weight and reduces the high expression levels of genes related to the obesity-associated low-grade inflammation in skeletal muscle of ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4989" pm="."><plain>The biological processes mainly affected between control ob/ob mice and wild types included “response to oxidative stress” (P = .0006), “response to stress” (P = .0031) and “acute-phase response” (P = .023). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4991" pm="."><plain>Importantly, comparison of leptin-treated and control ob/ob groups showed that leptin administration altered the expression of genes implicated in the “positive regulation of lymphocyte activation” (P = .0003), “positive regulation of immune response” (P = .0032) and “response to stress” (P = .0187), as well as genes involved in the “chaperone cofactor dependent protein folding” (P = .0023). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="4992" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, leptin reduced the expression of several genes related to inflammatory conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4993" pm="."><plain>DNA microarray analysis showed that 86 genes encoding proteins related to defense, stress, and inflammatory responses were altered in the gastrocnemius muscle of control ob/ob mice and modified by leptin administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4994" pm="."><plain>Leptin reduced the mRNA levels of various isoforms of the family of heat shock proteins (HSPs) (Dnajc16, Dnaja4, Dnajb4, Hspa2, Hspa4, and Hspb7), metallothioneins (Mt2, Mt4), crystallins (Cryab, Crybb1) and RNA binding proteins (RBMs) (Rbm9, Rbm22) in ob/ob mice (Table 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4995" pm="."><plain>In addition, histocompatibility 2, complement component factor B H2-Bf and several genes of the acute-phase response or inflammatory processes, such as kallikrein 5 (Klk5), and serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor clade C member 1 (Serpinc1) and clade B member 1a (Serpinb1a), displayed an increased expression in ob/ob mice that was reduced by leptin administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4996" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, gene expression of Cryl1, Hsp105, Rbm5, and H2-Aa were enhanced in ob/ob mice after treated with leptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4997" pm="."><plain>Pair-feeding, which accounts for the decrease in food intake that is independent of the direct action of leptin, altered the expression of 1,960 genes, upregulating 984 while downregulating 976 genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4998" pm="."><plain>In the context of a food intake reduction as compared to the simple effect due to the caloric restriction, leptin administration further significantly altered the expression of genes involved in processes encompassing “immune response” (P = 5.53e−8) “defense response” (P = 3.83e−6), “response to oxidative stress” (P = 2.99e−5), “positive regulation of T cell activation” (P = .0003) and “positive regulation of immune cell mediated cytotoxicity” (P = .0004) (Table 4). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="5006" pm="."><plain>Obesity is accompanied by a chronic proinflammatory state associated not only with insulin resistance, but also with muscular atrophy [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5007" pm="."><plain>Our study provides evidence that leptin constitutes a negative regulator of oxidative stress and inflammation in the gastrocnemius, which is a representative skeletal muscle of the whole skeletal musculature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5008" pm="."><plain>This statement is supported by findings reported herein: (a) leptin deficiency is accompanied by systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, muscle inflammation, and reduced muscle mass; (b) systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, muscle atrophy and inflammation of ob/ob mice are reversed by leptin administration independently of the effects of food intake inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5009" pm="."><plain>Therefore, leptin is able to prevent the muscle atrophy associated with obese and inflammatory states. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5010" pm="."><plain>Skeletal muscle constitutes an important target for leptin playing a key role on the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5011" pm="."><plain>Since obese ob/ob mice exhibit an increased oxidative stress and impaired immune response [14, 15] and a reduced skeletal muscle mass [21] compared with their lean littermates, we aimed to identify the genes related to inflammatory processes differentially altered by leptin in the gastrocnemius muscle of obese ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5012" pm="."><plain>In particular, 86 transcripts encoding inflammation-related proteins were shown to be modified by exogenous leptin administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5013" pm="."><plain>However, it has to be taken into account that many of these genes are multifunctional and may have important functions in other biological processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5014" pm="."><plain>Among them, leptin repressed the high expression levels of acute-phase reactants and several members of the HSP and RBM families. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5015" pm="."><plain>In addition, confirming a previous study of our group [6], leptin treatment increased the reduced muscle weight of gastrocnemius muscle of ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5016" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data suggest that leptin may prevent the obesity-associated inflammatory state and the muscle mass loss related to inflammatory states in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5017" pm="."><plain>Leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice display many abnormalities in the immune response similar to those observed in starved animals and malnourished humans [14, 15, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5018" pm="."><plain>In this respect, exogenous leptin replacement to ob/ob mice modulates T cell responses in mice and prevents starvation-induced immunosuppression, suggesting that lack of leptin is directly involved in these immune system abnormalities [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5019" pm="."><plain>In agreement with these studies, our findings show that leptin deficiency and administration differentially regulate biological processes related to the immune response as well as the T and B cell differentiation and activation in gastrocnemius muscle of ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5020" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalanced redox state in which prooxidants overwhelm the antioxidant capacity, resulting in an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to oxidative damage of cellular macromolecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5021" pm="."><plain>The major ROS is the superoxide anion (•O2 −). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5022" pm="."><plain>Dismutation of •O2 − by superoxide dismutase (SOD) produces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a more stable ROS, which, in turn, is converted to water by catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5023" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress is increased in diabetes [26, 27] with leptin administration reportedly improving insulin sensitivity in normal and diabetic rodents [28–30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5024" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between leptin and oxidative stress has not been clearly exhibited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5025" pm="."><plain>Leptin stimulates in vitro ROS production by inflammatory cells [31] and endothelial cells [32] and the level of systemic oxidative stress in nonobese animals [33, 34], suggesting a “prooxidative” role of leptin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5026" pm="."><plain>However, administration of recombinant leptin reduces the oxidative stress induced by a high-fat diet in mice [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5027" pm="."><plain>In this sense, findings of our study show a high oxidative stress in diabetic ob/ob mice, as reflected by increased TBARS concentrations in serum and the gastrocemius muscle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5028" pm="."><plain>These observations are in agreement with a large number of studies related to increased plasma TBARS or MDA in diabetic rats [36] and humans [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5029" pm="."><plain>Lipid peroxidation is a common index of free radical mediated injury and induction of antioxidant enzyme is a common cellular response [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5030" pm="."><plain>More importantly, leptin administration decreased serum and gastrocnemius TBARS concentrations as compared to control ob/ob mice, with TBARS levels in gastrocnemius muscle from pair-fed ob/ob animals remaining very similar to those of control ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5031" pm="."><plain>In this sense, from a molecular perspective, our results further show that transcript levels of Sod1, Gpx3 and glutathione S-transferase π 1 Gstp1 are downregulated in control ob/ob mice as compared to wild type controls being upregulated after leptin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5032" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, leptin administration also upregulated Gpx7, glutathione S-transferase μ 5 (Gstm5) and glutathione S-transferase θ 2 (Gstt2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5033" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the high expression of catalase (Cat) was repressed by the exogenous injection of leptin to ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5034" pm="."><plain>These findings are in line with previous observations showing the restoration of the defective antioxidant enzyme activity in plasma of ob/ob mice [39] and humans with a leptin gene mutation [40]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5035" pm="."><plain>Acute-phase reactants have been suggested to contribute to the maintenance of the chronic low-grade inflammation state involved in the progression of obesity and related diseases [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5036" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our study provides evidence that genes of the acute-phase response were altered in gastrocnemius muscle of ob/ob mice, which were counteracted by exogenous leptin administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5037" pm="."><plain>Leptin reduced the elevated gene expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator (Plat) and lipocalin-2 (Lcn2), which are upregulated in many inflammatory conditions [42, 43], including human obesity [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5038" pm="."><plain>In addition, a pivotal role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of muscle wasting in disuse and in a variety of pathological conditions is now being widely recognized [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5039" pm="."><plain>A potential link between oxidative stress and muscle atrophy involves the redox regulation of the proteolytic system [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5040" pm="."><plain>Moreover, various inflammatory cytokines induce oxidative stress [47] and muscle atrophy through the activation of the lysosomal [48, 49] and the ubiquitin-proteolysis system [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5041" pm="."><plain>In this context, biological processes related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses were altered in the gastrocnemius muscle of ob/ob mice and improved following leptin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5042" pm="."><plain>In spite of the usual upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin-ligases MAFbx and MuRF1 in most conditions associated with atrophy, their gene expression levels in ob/ob were lower as compared to wild type animals, although no statistically significant differences were observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5043" pm="."><plain>Contrarily to what would be expected, leptin administration prevented the increase of both MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA expression levels induced by pair-feeding in ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5044" pm="."><plain>A plausible explanation for this surprising finding may relate to the fact that in extreme conditions the energy homeostasis system is overriden whereby leptin is able to inhibit muscular protein degradation associated to food intake reduction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5045" pm="."><plain>These data are in accordance with a previous study of our group evidencing that leptin replacement inhibits the ubiquitin proteolysis system activity in leptin-deficient mice [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5046" pm="."><plain>Muscle atrophy is associated with increased expression of genes coding for RBM proteins which facilitate the translation, protection, and restoration of native RNA conformations during oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5047" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the gene expression of RBM proteins may increase as a compensatory mechanism in response to loss of muscle proteins [51, 52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5048" pm="."><plain>Other proteins involved in oxidative stress are metallothioneins, endogenous antioxidants [53] that have been shown to be overexpressed in muscle atrophy in rodents [54–56]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5049" pm="."><plain>In the present work, we have observed that administration of leptin inhibits the gene expression of several members of the RBM (Rbm9, Rbm22) and metallothioneins (Mt2, Mt4) families in the gastrocnemius of ob/ob mice, suggesting that leptin may modulate the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses and consequently, the muscle loss related to inflammatory states. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5050" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in the chaperone system were also differentially expressed in ob/ob mice as compared to wild types and modified by leptin treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5051" pm="."><plain>HSPs represent a family of molecular chaperones induced in response to cellular stress, responsible for maintaining the structure of proteins and contributing to the repair of damaged or malformed proteins in highly oxidative and lipotoxic conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5052" pm="."><plain>As a result, HSPs are considered antiproteolytic proteins [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5053" pm="."><plain>Muscle atrophy is also associated with an increased gene expression of HSPs [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5054" pm="."><plain>In fact, HSPs are repressed in many rat models of skeletal muscle atrophy [54, 59, 60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5055" pm="."><plain>HSP70 is constitutively expressed in skeletal muscle, but its levels are increased in response to oxidative stress [61] with the induction of HSP70 expression by hyperthermia and during inactivity attenuating muscle atrophy [62, 63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5056" pm="."><plain>In this regard, a recent study has shown that HSP70 prevents muscle atrophy induced by physical inactivity through inhibition of the muscle atrophy-related transcription factor FoxO3a and the expression of MAFbx and MuRF1 [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5057" pm="."><plain>Among the HSPs, HSP70 and αB-crystallin in particular, are considered negative regulators of muscle cell apoptosis [65, 66] and may inhibit the loss of nuclei taking place during muscle atrophy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5058" pm="."><plain>In addition, ROS induce the activity of FoxO [67] and gene expression of members of the ubiquitin-proteolysis system in myotubes [68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5059" pm="."><plain>In this sense, our results provide evidence that leptin inhibits the increased gene expression of different members of the HSPs (Hspb7, Dnajc16, Hspa4, Cryab, and Crybb1) in the gastrocnemius muscle of ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5060" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the elevated expression of HSPs in the control and pair-fed ob/ob groups suggests a high defense and stress response in these mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5061" pm="."><plain>Moreover, induction of HSPs may confer broader health benefits to patients who are insulin resistant or diabetic [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5062" pm="."><plain>In mammals, caloric restriction has been shown to upregulate HSP induction [70, 71], while expression of HSP72 has been found to be low in skeletal muscle of patients with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes [72, 73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5063" pm="."><plain>Figueiredo et al. [74] have recently shown that leptin downregulates HSP70 gene expression in chicken liver and hypothalamus but not in muscle, which was independent of food intake restriction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5064" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, Bonior et al. [75] reported an increase in HSP60 gene expression in pancreatic cells by leptin. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="5065" pm="."><plain>Obesity is accompanied by a chronic proinflammatory state resulting in an increase in circulating cytokines and inflammatory markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5066" pm="."><plain>In this regard, inflammation produces metabolic alterations in skeletal muscle with both inflammatory response and insulin resistance being associated with muscle mass loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5067" pm="."><plain>Findings of our study provide evidence that systemic and skeletal muscle oxidative stress, muscle atrophy and the elevated expression of genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammation of ob/ob mice are reversed by leptin administration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5068" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data thereby support that leptin is able to prevent the muscle atrophy associated with obese and inflammatory states in ob/ob mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5069" pm="."><plain>Most obese people develop muscle atrophy in spite of exhibiting high leptin circulating concentrations, which may be explained by the leptin resistance present in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5070" pm="."><plain>Our paper sheds light on the relation between obesity and the loss of muscle mass associated to inflammatory states suggesting that leptin treatment may be an attractive therapeutic approach to prevent muscle loss associated with inflammatory diseases. </plain></SENT>
