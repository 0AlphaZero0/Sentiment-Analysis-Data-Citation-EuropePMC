<SENT sid="7216" pm="."><plain>In some higher plants, the economic significance of mitochondria is boosted by its role in the determination of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7217" pm="."><plain>To outline characteristics of the plant mitochondrial genome and identify CMS-related genes, the mitochondrial genomes of more than 10 fertile or sterile plant species have been sequenced, including Arabidopsis thaliana [2], Beta vulgaris [3], [4], Oryza sativa [5], [6], [7], Brassica napus [8], Zea mays [9], [10], Nicotiana tabacum [11], Triticum aestivum [12], Vitis vinifera [13], Citrullus lanatus, and Cucurbita pepo [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7218" pm="."><plain>Research revealed that unique deleterious genes inserted into the mitochondrial genome confer CMS traits on natural plant germplasm [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7219" pm="."><plain>In higher plants, natural CMS has been identified in more than 150 species over the past century [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7220" pm="."><plain>CMS emergence undoubtedly stems from alteration of the mitochondrial genome [15], [17], but the question is whether this kind of genomic alteration is the result of toxic genes being inserted during the past century or from the substoichiometric shifting of mitochondrial DNA molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7221" pm="."><plain>Research in a few crops has demonstrated that substoichiometric shifting results in the inherent CMS-triggering mitotype dominating mitochondrial genome constituents [18]–[20], which results in the occurrence of CMS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7222" pm="."><plain>In the common bean, a progenitor mitochondrial form containing a three-molecule CMS-associated configuration is universally present in the germplasm [18], and substoichiometric shifting can explain the emergence of CMS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7223" pm="."><plain>In cybrids between CMS radish and B. napus, mitochondrial genomic components of the two species coexist in stable rapeseed progenies, and the phenomena of substoichiometric shifting has been observed between male fertile and sterile plants [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7224" pm="."><plain>In B. napus, at least five natural occurrences of CMS have been independently reported [22]–[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7225" pm="."><plain>Genetic experiments and restriction mapping have shown that the CMS lines can be classified as two cytoplasmic groups, one including T-CMS and S-CMS [22]–[24], which is commonly referred to as the “nap” cytoplasm present in normal fertile accessions, and the other group as “pol” cytoplasm including pol-CMS, MI CMS, and shaan 2A CMS [25]–[27], which has been the most widely applied line in the world. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7226" pm="."><plain>During the past few decades, the fact that the grouped CMS accessions from multiple independent findings have the same genetic regulation has been a perplexing issue for researchers [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7227" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the mechanism for natural CMS in B. napus, the main mitochondrial genome of pol-CMS was sequenced and compared to the sequence of Westar (nap cytoplasm), uncovering structural and evolutionary differences. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="7376" pm="."><plain>The mitochondrial genome in higher plants is very stable, maintaining plant survival in natural environments to achieve its important functions in living activities, so it is not probable that so many cases of CMS emerge only by evolution of the mitochondrial genome over one century. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7377" pm="."><plain>Substoichiometric shifting of coexisting mitotypes in plants may be an explanation of the phenomena related to CMS findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7378" pm="."><plain>The mitotype diversification cannot be explained by evolutionary events occurring over a short time, and the mitotypes are probably evolutionary products of a long time-span and coexisting in the mitochondrial population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7379" pm="."><plain>The presence of mitochondria carrying alternative, rearranged genomes (sometimes referred to as “sublimons”) has been associated with phenotypic switching, tissue differentiation, cytotype evolution, and various nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions in higher plants [35]. </plain></SENT>

B. napus cultivars sharing the same cytotype can vary considerably with respect to the copy number ratio; therefore, the value of the copy number ratio is controlled, at least to some extent, by the nuclear genotype. </plain></SENT>
