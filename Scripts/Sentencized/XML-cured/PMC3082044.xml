In the present study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for RSV resistance using 98 backcross inbred lines derived from the cross between the highly resistant variety, Kasalath, and the highly susceptible variety, Nipponbare. Under artificial inoculation in the greenhouse, two QTLs for RSV resistance, designated qSTV7 and qSTV11KAS, were detected on chromosomes 7 and 11 respectively, whereas only one QTL was detected in the same location of chromosome 11 under natural inoculation in the field. The stability of qSTV11KAS was validated using 39 established chromosome segment substitution lines. Fine mapping of qSTV11KAS was carried out using 372 BC3F2:3 recombinants and 399 BC3F3:4 lines selected from 7,018 BC3F2 plants of the cross SL-234/Koshihikari. The qSTV11KAS was localized to a 39.2 kb region containing seven annotated genes. The most likely candidate gene, LOC_Os11g30910, is predicted to encode a sulfotransferase domain-containing protein. The predicted protein encoded by the Kasalath allele differs from Nipponbare by a single amino acid substitution and the deletion of two amino acids within the sulfotransferase domain. Marker-resistance association analysis revealed that the markers L104-155 bp and R48-194 bp were highly correlated with RSV resistance in the 148 landrace varieties. These results provide a basis for the cloning of qSTV11KAS, and the markers may be used for molecular breeding of RSV resistant rice varieties. </p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="8402" pm="."><plain>Electronic supplementary material </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="8405" pm="."><plain>Rice stripe disease, one of the most serious viral diseases in the temperate regions of East Asia, is caused by rice stripe virus (RSV), which is transmitted by small brown plant hopper (SBPH, Laodelphax striatellus Fallen). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8406" pm="."><plain>The spread of this disease has resulted in severe losses in japonica rice production in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Area of China since 2000 (Sōgawa 2005; Wang 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8407" pm="."><plain>Currently, the most common control measure is the application of pesticides that target the SBPH vector, which is costly and harmful to the environment. Development of resistant varieties offers a more economical, efficient and environmentally safe way to control this disease. <p><text><SENT sid="8409" pm="."><plain>Resistance to RSV has been studied in Japanese upland rice varieties and two loci, Stv-a and Stv-b, have been reported (Washio et al. 1968a). Stv-a and Stv-b are complementary dominant genes. The former was linked with the glutinous endosperm (wx) and photosensitivity-1 (Se-1) loci on chromosome 6, and the latter was located on chromosome 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8411" pm="."><plain>Some indica paddy varieties, including the Pakistani indica paddy variety, Modan, have a different resistance allele Stvb-i, which is incompletely dominant and allelic with Stv-b on chromosome 11 (Washio et al. 1968b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8412" pm="."><plain>In the 1960s, Stvb-i from Modan was introduced into many japonica varieties, including St. No. 1, Chugoku 31, Aichi 6 and Aichi 97 for the control of RSV (Toriyama et al. 1966; Maeda et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8413" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the derivative varieties harboring Stvb-i were widely cultivated in Japan and in the Jiangsu province of China, and showed a stable resistance to RSV (Wang 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8414" pm="."><plain>However, varieties with a single resistance gene are at an increased risk of their resistance being overcome by new strains of the virus. It is thus necessary to discover new genetic resources for resistance to RSV for use in rice breeding programs. <p><text><SENT sid="8416" pm="."><plain>The Stvb-i gene in Modan was preliminarily localized to a 1.8-cM segment on chromosome 11 using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers (Hayano-Saito et al. 1998), and then finely mapped to a 286 kb region covered by two overlapping BAC clones (Hayano-Saito et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8417" pm="."><plain>In the Korean indica variety Milyang 23, one QTL for RSV resistance was detected in the interval between markers XNpb202 and C1172 on chromosome 11 (Maeda et al. 1999), which was reported to be allelic with Stvb-i. Subsequently, the same research group using both RFLP and SSR markers reported two QTLs in the Japanese upland rice variety, Kanto 72. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8419" pm="."><plain>The QTL on chromosome 11 corresponding to Stv-b exerted a greater effect than the other on chromosome 2 by reducing the infection rate of RSV (Maeda et al. 2004, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8420" pm="."><plain>In the indica variety, DV85, Ding et al. (2004) also detected two major QTLs for RSV resistance. One was mapped to the same chromosomal region as Stvb-i, and the other was mapped on chromosome 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8422" pm="."><plain>More recently, three QTLs were detected in the Indian landrace Dular, one on chromosome 3 and the other two in the RM287–RM209 and RM209–RM21 intervals on chromosome 11, respectively (Wu et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8423" pm="."><plain>All these studies indicate the presence of a single resistance gene or gene cluster against RSV on chromosome 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8424" pm="."><plain>In addition, most of previous studies on QTL detection for RSV resistance used RFLP molecular markers, which are tedious and costly, and difficult to use for marker-assisted selection (MAS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8425" pm="."><plain>Recently, Wu et al. (2010) reported the fine mapping of qSTV11TQ to a 55.7 kb interval, which based on pedigree and physical mapping appears to be Stvb-i or an allele. <p><text><SENT sid="8426" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to identify QTLs for RSV resistance from the resistant rice variety Kasalath and to develop PCR-based molecular markers for fine mapping and marker-assisted selection of any major QTLs detected. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="8427" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>

A total of 314 rice accessions (299 landraces and 15 commercial varieties from Japan, Korea, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), and China) were screened for resistance to RSV. Of these, 148 landraces with different levels of resistance were selected for marker-trait association analysis (Supplementary Table 1). <p><text><SENT sid="8432" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight backcross inbred lines (BILs, BC1F8), derived by single seed descent from the cross Nipponbare/Kasalath//Nipponbare (Lin et al. 1998), were used to detect QTL for RSV resistance. These BILs were genotyped using 245 RFLP markers distributed along the 12 rice chromosomes. A panel of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) was generated in Koshihikari genetic background by first selecting 49 lines from BC1F3 plants of Koshihikari/Kasalath//Koshihikari in which a single large chromosome segment of Kasalath was introduced to the genetic background and then back-crossing with the recurrent parent Koshihikari to the BC3 generation without selection. A whole-genome survey, based on 129 RFLP loci, was used to select 39 CSSLs, designated from SL-201 to SL-239. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8441" pm="."><plain>All 7,018 plants were genotyped using two molecular markers flanking the qSTV11KAS locus and the recombinants were selected for evaluation of RSV resistance. Three hundred and seventy-two BC3F2:3 recombinant lines and their derived 372 BC3F3:4 lines selected from Population I were used for evaluating and validating RSV resistance, respectively. In addition, 27 BC3F3:4 recombinant families (each including ten lines) derived from Population II were used to further narrow the interval harboring qSTV11KAS. For the allelism test between qSTV11KAS and Stvb-i, an Aichi97/Kasalath F2:3 mapping population, consisting of 168 lines, was generated.Fig. 1Development of genetic populations for rough and fine mapping of qSTV11KAS.

Field trials were conducted in randomized complete blocks with three replicates. Plots consisted of single 18 cm rows of 50 plants with 10 cm spacing between rows. No pesticide was used during the entire growth period. The percentage of virus-containing SBPH in the fields was estimated to be 39% in 2004, 27% in 2007 and 29% in 2008, respectively, as determined by the random sampling and ELISA analysis (Wang et al. 2004). <p><text><SENT sid="8453" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic evaluation of BILs, CSSLs and populations for rough and fine mapping were conducted using artificial inoculation in greenhouse according to Sakurai et al. (1963) with some modifications. Thirty germinated seeds of each line were sown in plastic dishes filled with soil; the weak seedlings were eliminated at the one-leaf stage, and 25 healthy seedlings of each line were kept for inoculation. When the seedlings were at the one-and-half-leaf stage, SBPH nymphs of first to second instars were released into the dish covered with plastic cylinder at a density of about five SBPHs per seedling. During inoculation period, the SBPHs in each dish were disturbed with a small soft brush every day to avoid aggregation. Three days later, all SBPH nymphs were killed with pesticide and seedlings were transferred to a greenhouse, where they grew for about a month until symptoms were observed. The experiments were performed with four replications. The percentage of virus-laden SBPH used in artificial inoculation was estimated to be 31% in 2006, 27% in 2007, 35% in 2008, and 41% in 2009, respectively. <p><text><SENT sid="8460" pm="."><plain>Seedlings were evaluated and grouped into six classes (A, B, Bt, Cr, C and D) based on the severity of the RSV symptoms observed.

The detection of distinct QTL using different inoculation methods might reflect the fact that artificial inoculation caused more disease symptoms after RSV infection, thus resulting in more QTLs detected.

<SENT sid="8626" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the amino acids of the proteins predicted to be encoded by LOC_Os11g30910 in Nipponbare (susceptible) and Kasalath (resistant) revealed that the Kasalath protein contains one amino acid substitution (serine to threonine) and two amino acid deletions (alanine-alanine) in the sulfotransferase domain-containing region (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8627" pm="."><plain>The amino acid differences predicted by the Kasalath coding region of LOC_Os11g30910 may affect sulfotransferase structure resulting in functional differences that account for the difference in response to RSV between Kasalath and Nipponbare. <p><text><SENT sid="8628" pm="."><plain>Because the identification of qSTV11KAS candidate genes was based on annotation of the RSV susceptible Nipponbare, it is possible that there are other genes at the locus in the resistant cultivar Kasalath and sequencing of the Kasalath locus is being performed. To definitively identify the gene underlying qSTV11KAS, functional complementation tests with LOC_Os11g30910 from Kasalath and the other candidates at the qSTV11KAS locus are currently underway. </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="AppESM1"><title><text><SENT sid="8630" pm="."><plain>Electronic supplementary material </plain></SENT>
