Three seasons of monitoring natural populations have quantified that L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora is always found growing sympatrically with L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and that their flowering times overlap considerably. Despite their subspecific rank within the same species crossing experiments have confirmed that their F1 hybrids are sterile. An analysis of twelve microsatellite markers, with unique alleles in each taxon, also shows exceedingly low levels of gene flow between populations of the two subspecies. Due to the lack of previous phylogenetic resolution among L. floccosa subspecies, we used Illumina next generation sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms from genomic DNA libraries of L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora. These data were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes. From these variable loci, a total of 2772 bp was obtained using Sanger sequencing of ten individuals representing all subspecies of L. floccosa and an outgroup. The resulting phylogenetic reconstruction was fully resolved. Our results indicate that although L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora are closely related, they are not sister taxa and therefore likely did not diverge as a result of a sympatric speciation event. </p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec id="s1"><title><text><SENT sid="9075" pm="."><plain>Introduction <p><text><SENT sid="9076" pm="."><plain>With the notable exception of polyploid speciation in plants, sympatric speciation, the theory that genetic divergence within an interbreeding population can result in the evolution of new species, remains an intensely debated issue [1], [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9077" pm="."><plain>In contrast, allopatric speciation, in which new species arise as a result of geographic isolation, is uncontroversial with numerous observed and experimental examples. <p><text><SENT sid="9078" pm="."><plain>First proposed by Darwin [3], sympatric speciation held a theoretically prominent, or at least equal role, compared to allopatric speciation until the “neo-Dawinian synthesis” of the mid twentieth century. During that period of time, prominent evolutionary biologists such as Dobzhansky [4] and Mayr [5], [6] strongly dismissed sympatric speciation as unlikely or very uncommon. Due in large part to their work, allopatric speciation has become considered the null hypothesis of most speciation events. However, with foresight Mayr predicted “The issue will be raised again at regular intervals. Sympatric speciation is like the Lernaean Hydra which grew two new heads whenever one of its old heads was cut off “ [6]. <p><text><SENT sid="9083" pm="."><plain>Indeed, in part, as a result of the increased use of molecular phylogenetic techniques within recent decades, many evolutionary biologists have challenged this orthodoxy based on empirical evidence [7] and one experimental study [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9084" pm="."><plain>Additionally, numerous theoretical models have posited that divergent selection may be able to surmount recombination in order to disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, therefore sympatric speciation may be more common than traditionally assumed [1], [7]. <p><text><SENT sid="9085" pm="."><plain>Due to the growing number of putative examples of sympatric speciation, as well as the widely varying quality and quantity of criteria used to ascertain a speciation event, Coyne and Orr [1] have proposed four rigorous criteria that they conclude must be met in order to reject an allopatric speciation null hypothesis. These are, which we modify slightly: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="9087" pm="."><plain>The species must be largely or completely sympatric. Here, Coyne and Orr are stipulating that individuals of the species in question must physically occur within the dispersal distance (or cruising range) of one another. </list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="9088" pm="."><plain>The species must have substantial reproductive isolation. In other words, speciation must be complete. Evaluating this criterion can be subjective because of the numerous and often conflicting species concepts. As a result, we chose to evaluate this criterion using the least subjective of the species concepts, namely the biological species concept. </list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="9091" pm="."><plain>The sympatric taxa must be sister groups. Preferably, this criterion should be evaluated using multiple loci. This is due to the fact that hybridization may falsely indicate, at a single locus, a sister relationship between two species, which in reality, are not closely related. In practice, an evaluation of molecular data from organelles and multiple nuclear loci may often be necessary in order to insure an accurate phylogeny. </list-item><list-item><p><text><SENT sid="9094" pm="."><plain>The biogeographic and evolutionary history of the groups must make the existence of an allopatric phase very unlikely.” </list-item></list><p><text><SENT sid="9095" pm="."><plain>Since their publication, two prominent studies have been presented in which the authors claim to have satisfied all of Coyne and Orr's criteria [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9096" pm="."><plain>These studies, however, have been criticized for lack of rigor in meeting at least one of the four criteria.

Stuessy [12] argues, that in consideration of the fact that Lord Howe Island is currently approximately 5% of its original size, an allopatric speciation event is more parsimonious. Additionally, in a later paper, some of the original authors of the Lord Howe Island study have suggested that this speciation event may be more accurately referred to as parapatric [13]. <p><text><SENT sid="9101" pm="."><plain>In this study, using Coyne and Orr's criteria as a guideline, we surveyed the potential of a sympatric speciation event involving two subspecies of Limnanthes floccosa, which co-occur near vernal pools in southwest Oregon, USA. More strictly, we chose to study the evolutionary relationship between Limnanthes floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora.

<SENT sid="9170" pm="."><plain>Overall, these results indicate that, in the wild, there is almost no evidence for genetic exchange between the two taxa. Pragmatically, this is likely due to the breeding systems of L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora. The two taxa are partially (L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora) or predominately (L. floccosa ssp. floccosa) selfing [18], thus there is a natural prezygotic barrier to reproduction between the taxa. <p><text><SENT sid="9173" pm="."><plain>The germination rate of the hybrid seeds was 11% (Table S1). </plain></SENT>

Additionally, the sister taxon to L. floccosa ssp. floccosa is L. floccosa ssp. bellingeriana. Therefore, L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora do not strictly accord with Coyne and Orr's criterion that the taxa in question must have a sister relationship. <p><text><SENT sid="9185" pm="."><plain>The clades to which L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora belong could be recognized as separate, sister species. We feel, however, that this strategy would amount to a taxonomic “sleight of hand” rather than recognition of biological reality. Each subspecies within L. floccosa arguably represents a valid evolutionarily significant unit [12] and, in the past, each of the subspecies within this complex, with the exceptions of L. floccosa ssp. californica and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora, have been recognized as species [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9188" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the microsatellite survey and crossing experiment conducted in this study argue that L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora could be elevated to species status.

<SENT sid="9193" pm="."><plain>Likewise, all known populations of L. floccosa ssp. bellingeriana occur in a geographically and ecologically distinct region, in the foothills and mountains east of the range of L. floccosa ssp. floccosa. <p><text><SENT sid="9194" pm="."><plain>While theoretically it is plausible that approximately 33,000 years ago the divergence of L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora occurred by means of a sympatric speciation event, confirmation of this would require data satisfying Coyne and Orr's fourth criterion, that the existence of an allopatric phase was very unlikely. This criterion is pragmatically in this study, as in most cases, impossible to address.

<SENT sid="9198" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because a sympatric phase between L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora cannot be realistically evaluated, simply inferring allopatry risks an unknown type II error (failure to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true). </plain></SENT>

Given the current and likely forthcoming controversy of sympatric speciation, future studies should and will likely be required to undertake rigorous analyses and experimental evaluations. As demonstrated in this study, recent technological advances, such as next generation sequencing, may allow the recovery of fully resolved phylogenies among recently diverged plant taxa. Except in examples in which the evolutionary history of the taxa in question are complex, for example due to much reticulation, these data will likely be necessary to provide the rigorous and uncontroversial proofs necessary to either prove or disprove putative sympatric speciation events. </sec></sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title><text><SENT sid="9208" pm="."><plain>Methods <sec id="s4a"><title><text><SENT sid="9209" pm="."><plain>Ethics statement <p><text><SENT sid="9210" pm="."><plain>All necessary permits were obtained for the described field studies.

In turn, we sequenced those eight regions from one additional sample of L. floccosa ssp. floccosa and L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora plus two samples each of all remaining subspecies within L. floccosa. Although selecting these SNPs to analyze in the remaining L. floccosa taxa raises the question of ascertainment bias, the paucity of genetic variation found in a previous study [16], as well as this study, particularly within the chloroplast genomes, leads us to believe that the potential for this error is minimal.
