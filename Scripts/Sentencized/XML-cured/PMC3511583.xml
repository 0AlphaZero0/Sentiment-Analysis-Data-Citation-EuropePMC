</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="12669" pm="."><plain>3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) is a common primary metabolite of the synthetic pyrethroid insecticides (SPs) that have been extensively used in agriculture and urban areas because of their high efficiency and low mammalian toxicity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12670" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is also the important chemical raw material widely used in the manufacture of SPs and dyes [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12671" pm="."><plain>A consequence of the increased availability, usage and broad-spectrum applicability of 3-PBA is its widespread exposure among the general population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12672" pm="."><plain>Recent evidences suggest that 3-PBA is the most frequently detected xenobiotic in human urine [3]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12673" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it also possesses endocrine disrupting activity [12]–[14], and adversely affects reproductive function and sexual development as well as the immune system in men [15]–[20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12674" pm="."><plain>As the general metabolic product of SPs, 3-PBA is considered far more potent as endocrine disruptor than the parent molecules [12], [14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12675" pm="."><plain>In the natural environment, 3-PBA is persistent and refractory to degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12676" pm="."><plain>The half-life in soil is reported ranging from 120 to 180 days depending on soil type, climate and other conditions [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12677" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 3-PBA can enter into the aqueous phase, but it tends to be absorbed to the sediment, which in turn increases its half-life in soil [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12678" pm="."><plain>The accumulation and widespread use of 3-PBA have resulted in its ubiquitous presence as a contaminant in urban sediments and surface water thus should be of great environmental and public health concern [2], [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12679" pm="."><plain>Effective measures for disposal of this toxic chemical are critically needed to ensure that human and environmental health will not be compromised by the continued use of 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12680" pm="."><plain>Bioremediation involving the use of living microorganisms in the removal of pollutants is the most promising, environmentally friendly, relatively efficient, and cost-effective process [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12681" pm="."><plain>There is growing body of evidence that environmental hazardous materials could be successfully eliminated by diverse microorganisms belonging to different taxonomic groups [26]–[30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12682" pm="."><plain>However, limited reports have far been available in the literature regarding the microbial degradation of 3-PBA by a pure bacterial culture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12683" pm="."><plain>A possible reason is attributed to its toxicity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12684" pm="."><plain>Previous studies demonstrated that 3-PBA was refractory to microbial degradation and enhanced degradation could not occur in the pure culture [21], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12685" pm="."><plain>Although several bacterial strains have been reported to degrade low concentrations of 3-PBA [21], [22], [32], yet no report on mineralization of this compound is available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12686" pm="."><plain>Halden et al. [21] reported firstly that Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain POB310 was able to utilize 3-PBA as a growth substrate in soil. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12687" pm="."><plain>But degradation of 3-PBA in soil by strain POB310 was incomplete, and bacterial densities decreased even under the most favorable conditions (100 mg·L−1 of 3-PBA, supplementation with P and N, and soil water-holding capacity of 90%). Stenotrophomonas sp. strain ZS-S-01 seems to be the most efficient strain, since it degraded 250 mg·L−1 of 3-PBA within 14 days with a degradation rate of 82.9% [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12688" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the microbial metabolic pathway of 3-PBA has not been investigated so far and remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="12689" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to screen isolates that were capable of effectively degrading 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12690" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the metabolic pathway was first proposed and the potential for bioremediation of 3-PBA contaminated soils was also evaluated. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13147" pm="."><plain>Given the increased 3-PBA use around the world and its prevalent human exposure, effective techniques for disposal of the pollutant are critically needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13148" pm="."><plain>Microorganisms are not only cost-effective but also show good detoxification efficiency with contaminates and provide an environmentally friendly solution to the problem of 3-PBA pollution [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13149" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, attempts to isolate microorganisms in pure culture able to mineralize 3-PBA have usually failed, primarily due to the reason that this chemical is a recalcitrant substrate [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13150" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the accumulated 3-PBA, which has antimicrobial property, prevents the proliferation of pyrethroid-degrading microorganisms [22], [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13151" pm="."><plain>With the aim of obtaining efficient degradative microorganisms, in the last few years our laboratory has screened a range of contaminated soils for 3-PBA degradation activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13152" pm="."><plain>A bacterial strain, designated DG-02, was successfully isolated from the soil with a high efficiency in degrading 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13153" pm="."><plain>16S rRNA gene sequencing and the physio-biochemical characteristics strongly suggested that strain DG-02 belongs to the Bacillus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13154" pm="."><plain>As far as we know, there is no any information concerning the 3-PBA degradation by bacterial strains belonging to the Bacillus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13155" pm="."><plain>Although Bacillus bacteria have been found to degrade a wide range of different xenobiotic aromatic compounds, including thiophanate-methyl [41], cypermethrin [43], chlorpyrifos [44], and 4-chloro-2-nitrophenol [45], our current results firstly describe the biodegradation of 3-PBA by this genus bacteria and definitely expand this list. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13156" pm="."><plain>It is thus becoming evident that Bacillus sp. is ubiquitous in the environment and possesses broad catabolic capabilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13157" pm="."><plain>Bacillus sp. strain DG-02 was capable of degrading a variety of diaryl ether compounds, including 3-PBA, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13158" pm="."><plain>However, the degradation efficiencies were greatly different, suggesting that certain structural requirements must be met for a diaryl ether compound to be effectively metabolized by strain DG-02. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13159" pm="."><plain>3-PBA was degraded faster than 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde, indicating that substitution of the acid group with an aldehyde group reduces the degradation efficiency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13160" pm="."><plain>3-Phenoxybenzyl alcohol was the most persistent, suggesting that replacement the acid group with an alcohol group hinders the 3-PBA hydrolase-substrate interaction in strain DG-02. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13161" pm="."><plain>Another possible reason for degradation reduction could be attributed to the fact that 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol is more toxic and refractory to microbial degradation than 3-PBA [12], [17], [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13162" pm="."><plain>The different capacities of the bacterium to metabolize these chemicals could have been due to a number of factors, including transport, enzyme specificity, or the molecular structure of the diaryl ether compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13163" pm="."><plain>A similar observation has been reported in Pseudomonas sp. strain ET1 [23]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13164" pm="."><plain>It was noteworthy that Bacillus sp. strain DG-02 degraded and utilized 3-PBA as a growth substrate in MSM (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13165" pm="."><plain>Moreover, supplementation of 1% glucose in MSM greatly enhanced the transformation of 3-PBA, thus reflecting excellent environmental adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13166" pm="."><plain>This is an important feature of a pesticide-degrading microorganism to be employed for bioremediation of variable environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13167" pm="."><plain>However, this observation did not quite agree with Cycoń et al. [41] who found supplementation with additional carbon sources led to a lag period followed by enhanced degradation, since these strains preferred to utilize readily available carbon sources. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13168" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the particular strain was found to efficiently degrade 3-PBA over a broad range of temperature (20–40°C) and pH (5.5–9.5), as shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13169" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon gives pesticide-degrading microorganisms advantage in the environment, because they survival and utilize xenobiotics even exposed to adverse condition [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13170" pm="."><plain>In addition, the optimum conditions for 3-PBA degradation by strain DG-02 were determined to be 30.9°C and pH 7.7 based on the response surface methodology (RSM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13171" pm="."><plain>Under these conditions, strain DG-02 successfully remove the 50 mg·L−1 3-PBA initially added to the medium within 72 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13172" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that the degradation was higher at the alkaline conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13173" pm="."><plain>This might be because the higher pH increases the rate of 3-PBA transformation, whereas the acidic conditions may increase the 3-PBA stability and its resistance to chemical and microbial degradation, as described previously by Cycoń et al. [41] for thiophanate-methyl. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13174" pm="."><plain>Another important feature which is worth mentioning is that this strain engaged in efficient degradation of 3-PBA up to the concentration, as high as 500 mg·L−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13175" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other reports on toxic effects of 3-PBA on different bacteria [21], [31], our results suggested that 3-PBA metabolism activity of Bacillus sp. strain DG-02 was not subject to complete catabolite repression by high 3-PBA concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13176" pm="."><plain>However, the specific 3-PBA degradation rate slightly decreased with an increase in the initial 3-PBA concentration, and the critical inhibitor concentration (S m) was determined to be 65.0858 mg·L−1 (Fig. 4b). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13177" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the results of metabolite identification, the metabolic pathway of 3-PBA was first proposed (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13178" pm="."><plain>The transient accumulation of 3-(2-hydroxyphenoxy) benzoic acid indicated that the degradation of 3-PBA by Bacillus sp. strain DG-02 was initiated by oxidization (Fig. 5, step I). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13179" pm="."><plain>Moreover, small amounts of the metabolites protocatechuate, phenol, and 3,4-dimethoxy phenol followed by cleavage of the diaryl ether (Fig. 5, step II), were detected during the degradation of 3-PBA by strain DG-02. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13180" pm="."><plain>Since no abiotic degradation of 3-PBA to these products was observed in cell-free control, the metabolism of 3-PBA was apparently initiated by enzymatic reactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13181" pm="."><plain>This is the first evidence of a novel pathway of degradation of 3-PBA by oxidization and cleavage of the diaryl ether in a microorganism, which plays an important role in the 3-PBA biogeocycle. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13182" pm="."><plain>In our studies, strain DG-02 showed a high survivability in the environment and maximal degradation activity on 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13183" pm="."><plain>As shown in Fig. 6, the introduced strain DG-02 quickly adapted to the environment and rapidly bioremediated 3-PBA contaminated soils during the first incubation period (3 days), apparently there was no lag phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13184" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experiment, 90.1% and 95.2% of the added 3-PBA (50 mg·kg−1) were removed from the sterilized and non-sterilized soils, respectively, and the t 1/2 for 3-PBA was greatly reduced by 124.4 and 98.5 days as compared to the controls, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13185" pm="."><plain>Previous reports showed that the bacterial isolates introduced into the contaminated soil usually failed to degrade the pollutants due to the low activity of these bacteria caused by abiotic and biotic stresses, thus additional treatments were needed to enhance the degradation [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13186" pm="."><plain>In this study, the bacterial isolate was found to efficiently degrade 3-PBA when inoculated into the soil, suggesting that strain DG-02 can be used directly for the elimination of 3-PBA in soil without any other further treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13187" pm="."><plain>In addition, the removal efficiency of 3-PBA in the non-sterilized soil was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than that in the sterilized soil, demonstrating that the indigenous soil microorganisms strongly stimulated the strain DG-02 to degrade 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13188" pm="."><plain>Enhancement of 3-PBA degradation could be explained by the fact that the introduced strain DG-02 and soil microorganisms may have a synergistic effect on metabolization of this recalcitrant, as described previously by Chen et al. [22], [30], with the same soil as used in our study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13189" pm="."><plain>Moreover, analysis of 3-PBA degradation products in soil indicated that the degradation of 3-PBA by strain DG-02 was accompanied by transient accumulation of protocatechuate, phenol, and 3,4-dimethoxy phenol, but they were subsequently degraded rapidly and disappeared finally, which was in line with the 3-PBA degradation in liquid medium. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13190" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, strain DG-02 isolated in the present study was found highly efficient in degrading 3-PBA in different contaminated soils and water resources, thus suggesting the isolate may be a promising candidate for bioremediation of 3-PBA contaminated environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13191" pm="."><plain>This is the first report about biodegradation of 3-PBA by a bacterial strain from the Bacillus genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13192" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the bacterium harbors the metabolic pathway for the detoxification of 3-PBA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13193" pm="."><plain>This is the first evidence of a novel pathway of degradation of 3-PBA by oxidization and cleavage of the diaryl ether in a microorganism, which plays an important role in the 3-PBA biogeocycle. </plain></SENT>
