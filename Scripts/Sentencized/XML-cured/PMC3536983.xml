</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13260" pm="."><plain>Insects, including mosquitoes, display an efficient innate immunity aimed at the isolation and destruction of invaders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13261" pm="."><plain>Their innate immune responses are overall similar to that of vertebrates (Schmid-Hempel 2005) and comprise functional processes for pathogen recognition, signaling and transduction pathways, and effector mechanism processes (Baton et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13262" pm="."><plain>Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are detected by patterns recognition receptors (PRRs; Akira et al. 2001; Medzhitov and Janeway 2002; Dimopoulos et al. 2002) that often trigger a signal amplification system through the activation of serine protease cascades modulated by serine protease inhibitors (Waterhouse et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13263" pm="."><plain>A variety of recognition and signal pathways determine specialized responses (Schulenburg et al. 2007) mediated by at least three transduction pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13264" pm="."><plain>Toll components are activated by Gram-positive bacteria, fungi (Christophides et al. 2004), and virus (Sanders et al. 2005; Ramirez and Dimopoulos 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13265" pm="."><plain>The immune deficiency (Imd) pathway responds to Gram-positive bacteria (Meister et al. 2005), and both Toll and Imd and the Janus-kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK-STAT) participate in responses against Plasmodia (Cirimotich et al. 2010; Garver et al. 2009; Gupta et al. 2009; Bahia et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13266" pm="."><plain>The outcome is the activation of a variety of effector molecules and processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13267" pm="."><plain>Toll and Imd activation leads to the transcriptional induction of several antimicrobial peptides (AMP; Cirimotich et al. 2010; Lemaitre et al. 1995, 1996; Lowenberger et al. 1995; Michel et al. 2001; Richman et al. 1997; Vizioli et al. 2001; Waterhouse et al. 2007), which are mainly produced in the fat body and released into the hemolymph (Tzou et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13268" pm="."><plain>Cellular defenses are mediated by hemocytes and include phagocytosis, nodulation, and encapsulation (Hernández-Martínez et al. 2002; Hillyer and Christensen 2002; Hillyer et al. 2003; Lavine and Strand 2002; Schmidt et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13269" pm="."><plain>Hemocytes also produce humoral molecules, and other organs are involved in cellular and humoral responses, as exemplified by AMP and other responses in the midgut and salivary glands (Dimopoulos et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13270" pm="."><plain>Hemolymph, which contains nutrients, waste, signal molecules, and immune factors is distributed to all insect body structures in an open circulatory system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13271" pm="."><plain>Although secondary pulsatile organs are located in other parts of the body, hemolymph is mainly pumped by the dorsal vessel in alternating anterior (toward the head) and posterior directions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13272" pm="."><plain>This vessel is a tubular organ located medially on the dorsal wall of the tegument of the insect and extends from the abdominal end to the head (Martins et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13273" pm="."><plain>The abdominal portion (heart) is pulsatile and presents wall openings (ostia) that function as valves during hemolymph circulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13274" pm="."><plain>The aorta, which lies in the thorax, has no ostia and simply conducts the hemolymph to the anterior part of the body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13275" pm="."><plain>The heart is tethered to the abdominal posterior wall by six pairs of alary muscles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13276" pm="."><plain>These muscles also maintain the shape of the heart and probably expand the vessel during diastole (Glenn et al. 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13277" pm="."><plain>Pericardial cells (PCs), also named nephrocytes (Andereck et al. 2010; Chapman 1998), are present in single lines along the dorsal vessel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13278" pm="."><plain>They have peripheral finger-like projections bordering a labyrinthine channel system and surface invaginations (Martins et al. 2011; Jones 1977; Rizki 1978). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13279" pm="."><plain>Molecules are taken from the hemolymph by pinocytosis and, after degradation, might be returned to the hemolymph by exocytosis (Andereck et al. 2010; Chapman 1998; Glenn et al. 2010; Martoja and Ballan-Dufrancais 1984). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13280" pm="."><plain>Having osmoregulatory and detoxifying functions, PCs are strategically positioned in a place of high hemolymph flow, where they are also highly exposed to foreign molecules and microorganisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13281" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, immune response markers identified in mosquito PCs suggest that these cells can also participate in the neutralization of pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13282" pm="."><plain>Serpins, a family of proteins that participate in insect immune regulation, are expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of PCs of the Anopheles mosquito after a bacterial infection (Danielli et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13283" pm="."><plain>A member of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family is constitutively present in the cytoplasm and nuclei of PCs (Barillas-Mury et al. 1999). Sp22D, a modular serine protease has been identified in the cytoplasm of PCs both in naive and bacteria-challenged mosquitoes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13284" pm="."><plain>In addition, defensin accumulates in these cells several hours after bacterial challenge (Danielli et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13285" pm="."><plain>Similar observations have been made with the related thioester-containing protein (TEP-I; Levashina et al. 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13286" pm="."><plain>However, no data are available as to whether these proteins originate from endogenous production or are taken from the hemolymph. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13287" pm="."><plain>We provide herein histological, histochemical, ultrastructural, and bioinformatic evidence that indicates the participation of Anopheles albimanus PCs during the elimination of pathogens. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13402" pm="."><plain>Our histochemical observations provide support for antimicrobial defense functions for PC, additional to that of clearance and detoxification of the mosquito hemolymph (Chapman 1998; Jones 1977; Rizki 1978). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13403" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that PC respond and are activated by the presence of yeasts or a component of their cell wall, and that, as a result of their activation, PCs exhibit bacteriolytic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13404" pm="."><plain>The possibility of an increased capacity of PCs to detoxify hemolymph during infections has not been investigated in this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13405" pm="."><plain>An increased clearance capacity of these cells would certainly confound the results attributed to immune activation; however, this possibility has been eliminated in experiments with fixed cells and in vitro experiments without hemolymph. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13406" pm="."><plain>We present here, for the first time, evidence for the activation of PC by yeasts or zymosan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13407" pm="."><plain>The induction of lysosomal activity in PC of yeast- or zymosan-treated mosquitoes, compared with untreated and RPMI-treated controls, was observed in situ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13408" pm="."><plain>The possibility that increased endocytosis of the reagents by activated cells could explain our findings was eliminated by similar results in assays of fixed cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13409" pm="."><plain>Additionally, increased acid phosphatase activity was quantified in the supernatants of short-term cultures after the removal of in-vivo-challenged hearts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13410" pm="."><plain>Acid phosphatase activity induced de novo in PCs was confirmed in assays in which clean hearts were challenged in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13411" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that this enzyme might be present as a zymogen in PCs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13412" pm="."><plain>We also documented that activated PCs lysed M. lysodeikticus (as shown in Figs. 4, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13413" pm="."><plain>Using heart preparations that were carefully cleaned, we minimized the possibility that fat body cells, which are known to produce antimicrobial peptides and lysozyme (Dunn et al. 1985; Faye and Wyatt 1980; Kanost et al. 1988), were responsible for the observed bacterial lysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13414" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in assays with the removed fat cells and the dorsal vessel devoid of PCs, no lytic activity was documented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13415" pm="."><plain>At present, we have no evidence for the molecular origin of the lytic activity observed, but the production of lysozyme has been documented in PCs of Calliphora erythrocephala (Croosley 1972). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13416" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, our results are indicative of a lack of phagocytic activity in these cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13417" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reporting phagocytosis by PC are inconclusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13418" pm="."><plain>Jones (1954) reported the accumulation of ammonia carmine dye into the PCs of A. quadrimaculatus larvae, but this was must probably the result of its uptake by pinocytosis, similar to that in vertebrate nephrons (Lameire et al. 1977). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13419" pm="."><plain>Low magnification observations of latex particles, Escherichia coli, and Plasmodium berghei sporozoites localized in the PC area of A. gambiae have also been interpreted as phagocytosis, but without histological documentation (Hillyer et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13420" pm="."><plain>However, using transmission electron microscopy, we have never observed phagocytozed yeast in A. albimanus PCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13421" pm="."><plain>Instead, most of melanized yeast were aggregated (Fig. 1, arrows) around the mosquito heart. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13422" pm="."><plain>This is compatible with the histological structure of this tissue, which is covered by a basal lamina that limits the transit of particulate material. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13423" pm="."><plain>The presence of melanized yeast near PCs does not indicate that PCs are responsible for this phenomenon, and although we cannot eliminate the possibility of the damage of these yeasts by PCs, melanization was most probably produced by hemolymph components. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13424" pm="."><plain>Insects respond to a wide variety of foreign materials by mounting cellular and humoral processes aimed at the isolation and destruction of invaders (Beerntsen et al. 1994; Cupp et al. 1997; Gorman and Paskewitz 1997; Hoffman et al. 1999; Lavine and Strand 2002; Paskewitz and Riehle 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13425" pm="."><plain>Insects lack filtration organs (e.g., liver, spleen, lymph nodes) that, in vertebrates, remove and are the main sites of immune detection of circulating invading pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13426" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, hemocytes and the fat body have been considered the main tissues responsible of the effector components of the immune response in insects (Hernández-Martínez et al. 2002; Hillyer and Christensen 2002; Hillyer et al. 2003; Lavine and Strand 2002; Schmidt et al. 2001; Tzou et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13427" pm="."><plain>However, an initial encounter with pathogens, through tegument wounds or within the digestive tract, might trigger locally mounted constitutive innate immune responses, such as the production of oxygen radicals and melanization (Lanz et al. 1993), and antibacterial and anti-parasite responses have been documented in the midgut and salivary glands of mosquitoes (Dimopoulos et al. 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13428" pm="."><plain>PCs are strategically located on the dorsal vessel, which is exposed to a high flow of hemolymph, and can therefore encounter circulating microbial invaders and respond with defense mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13429" pm="."><plain>For instance, only 10%–25% of the thousands of malaria sporozoites produced in oocysts invade the salivary glands, and despite attempts to elucidate the fate of the rest of the parasites (Hillyer et al. 2007), the participating mechanisms remain elusive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13430" pm="."><plain>During their journey to the salivary glands, sporozoites are directly exposed to a repertoire of PRRs, antimicrobial peptides (Boman and Hultmark 1987; Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1990; Lowenberger et al. 1996), and other reactive molecules present in the hemolymph (Lanz-Mendoza et al. 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13431" pm="."><plain>However, the extent of the participation of these immune mechanisms to their destruction awaits clarification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13432" pm="."><plain>Cell-mediated immune responses (Bartholomay et al. 2004; Hernández-Martínez et al. 2002; Paskewitz and Shi 2005) have been proposed, and the phagocytosis of sporozoites by hemocytes has been documented (Hillyer et al. 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13433" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the proportion of hemocytes engaged in this process is too small to account for the necessary numbers to eliminate the enormous amount of parasites that do not reach the salivary glands (Hillyer et al. 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13434" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results indicate damage to sporozoites lying near to PCs (data not shown), but the participation of PCs in the process of parasite clearing awaits demonstration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13435" pm="."><plain>Previous studies that have documented the presence, in mosquito PCs, of molecules (serpin, defensin, STAT, and Sp22D) that participate in insect immune responses (Barillas-Mury et al. 1999; Danielli et al. 2003; Levashina et al. 2001) have failed to establish the site of their production, and the possibility of their uptake from the hemolymph cannot be disregarded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13436" pm="."><plain>The transcription and presence of SPRN10 (an important regulator of the immune response) in PCs of A. stephensi (Lycett et al. 2004) and the transcripts coding for immunity-related effectors (AMP, lysozymes, and canonical immune signaling pathways) identified in the A. albimanus heart transciptome support our histochemical, biochemical, cellular, and ultrastructural observations that PCs are actively involved in the mosquito immune response, and not only in scavenging processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13437" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the immune-related transcripts identified in heart preparations are produced by other cells (dorsal vessel muscle and endothelial cells) present in these preparations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13438" pm="."><plain>Additional studies are necessary to reject these possibilities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="13439" pm="."><plain>In summary, we present evidence that A. albimanus PCs respond to the presence of invaders by mounting lytic and toxic responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13440" pm="."><plain>We are currently investigating the heart transcriptome to identify genes and effector molecules during the PC response against pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13441" pm="."><plain>These could provide new insights into the immune mechanisms of malaria vectors. </plain></SENT>
