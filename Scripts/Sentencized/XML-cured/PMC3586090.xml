</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="13824" pm="."><plain>Tremelimumab (formerly ticilimumab) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody, which is directed against human cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), it is also an interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulant. The antibody is being developed by Pfizer as an anticancer agent, which was generated using XenoMouse™ technology provided by Abgenix (now Amgen). </plain></SENT>

The single-arm study was conducted at sites in the US and Canada. Patients received 15 mg/kg every 90 days via intravenous infusion until disease progression. The primary objective was response rate by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours) criteria. Secondary objectives included safety, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. A single patient, who had a stable ovarian mass and a substantial regression in an adrenal mass, received a second dose. The remaining 46 patients had disease progression or disease-related death before reaching the planned second dose at 3 months.[3] Following the completion of this trial in July 2008, no further development was reported and as the indication does not appear on the January 2010 Pfizer pipeline, development is presumed to have been discontinued. </sec><sec id="Sec7"><title><text><SENT sid="13853" pm="."><plain>1.2.4 Gastrointestinal Cancer </plain></SENT>

Four biopsies of residual lesions revealed no melanoma in most areas with a dermo-epidermal CD3/CD8 lymphocytic infiltrate. An area with viable melanoma cells had a prominent intratumoral CD3/CD8 lymphocytic infiltrate. Another patient receiving tremelimumab 10 mg/kg developed a new brain metastasis at 2 months. After external radiation therapy, no new metastases were noted for 7 months with stable lymph node metastasis.[13] </sec><sec id="Sec29"><title><text><SENT sid="13985" pm="."><plain>NSCLC </plain></SENT>
