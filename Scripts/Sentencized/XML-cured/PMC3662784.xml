</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14202" pm="."><plain>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a non-cytopathic virus that causes chronic inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14203" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that vitamin D3 supplementation could improve the SVR in chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) patients [2], [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14204" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the amount of 25-hydoxyvitamin D3 (25(OH) vitamin D3) in the serum could affect the treatment response to pegylated interferon Î± (Peg-IFN-Î±)/ribavirin (RBV) therapy and is complementary to interleukin 28B (IL-28B) rs1297860 C/T polymorphism in enhancing the correct prediction of the SVR in CH-C [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14205" pm="."><plain>Another group reported that, in patients with genotype 1 HCV persistent infection, the 25(OH) vitamin D serum levels and IL28B polymorphism were independently associated with the likelihood of achieving a rapid viral response and SVR after treatment with Peg-IFN/RBV [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14206" pm="."><plain>Although several kinds of mechanisms for the favorable effects of vitamin D3 supplementation were reported, the total effect of vitamin D3 supplementation remains unclear [6], [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14207" pm="."><plain>One group reported that 25(OH) vitamin D3, but not vitamin D3 or 1, 25 dihydoxyvitamin D3 (1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3), appeared to inhibit the viral life cycle at the level of infectious HCV assembly [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14208" pm="."><plain>Another group reported that vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and IFN-Î± could synergistically inhibit HCV production by enhancing the IFN signaling pathway [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14209" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of vitamin D3 on the adaptive immune system in CH-C patients has not been reported yet. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14210" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that vitamin D3, as synthesized in the skin by photolysis from 7-dehydrocholesterol or ingested with food, is transported in the blood to the liver where it is hydoxylated at the C-25-position [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14211" pm="."><plain>Then, it is hydoxylated at the C-1Î±-position to form the active metabolite 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 in the kidney [9], [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14212" pm="."><plain>In this study, we selected 1(OH) vitamin D3, since the local concentration in the liver should be higher than other metabolites of vitamin D3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14213" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 1 (OH) vitamin D3 is safe and commonly used in worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14214" pm="."><plain>1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 is known to regulate calcium and phosphorus metabolism in skeletal homeostasis [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14215" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 plays an important role as an immune-modulator targeting various immune cells [12]â[15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14216" pm="."><plain>Various kinds of immune cells express not only vitamin D receptors (VDRs) but also vitamin D-activating enzymes, allowing local conversion of inactive vitamin D into 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 within the immune system [16], [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14217" pm="."><plain>The active metabolite1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 could enhance the anti-mycobacterial activity in monocytes by enhancing the chemotactic and phagocytic capacity of macrophages [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14218" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 might play an important role in the binding and capturing of antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) at the initiation of the immune response [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14219" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, some groups reported that 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3 could inhibit the differentiation and maturation of DCs [19], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14220" pm="."><plain>In addition to monocyte-derived cells, CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, natural killer cells (NK cells) could be directly and/or indirectly affected by 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3[12], [17], [21]â[24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14221" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3 could contribute to the suppression of the immune response in autoimmune diseases [14], [15], [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14222" pm="."><plain>More Recently, the expression of specific VDRs in liver cells and reduced expression of VDRs in CH-C patients have been reported [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14223" pm="."><plain>In addition, an inverse relationship between the liver VDR expression and inflammation severity has been found [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14224" pm="."><plain>However, the effects of 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3 for the adaptive immune system in the condition of CH-C patients and during treatment with peg-interferon Î± and ribavirin (Peg-IFN/RBV) are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14225" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is urgent to analyze the effect of 1, 25(OH)2 vitamin D3 on the adaptive immune responses that could contribute to the outcome of Peg-IFN/RBV therapy. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14506" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been reported that supplementation of vitamin D3, a potent immunomodulator, could improve the HCV response to antiviral therapy [2], [3], [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14507" pm="."><plain>We used 1(OH) vitamin D3, since hepatocytes have various kinds of enzymes to convert 1(OH) vitamin D3 to the active metabolite 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14508" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we speculated that the administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could affect the liver adaptive immune cells since the local concentration of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 might be higher than the systemic concentration of this active metabolite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14509" pm="."><plain>Another group reported that 25(OH) vitamin D3, but not vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, could have direct-antiviral activity at the level of infectious virus assembly [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14510" pm="."><plain>However, the antiviral activity of 25(OH) vitamin D3 is not so remarkable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14511" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the system of HCV replication in that study did not include the immune cells that are important for the control of HCV replication [32]â[35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14512" pm="."><plain>In this study, we first reported that administration of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could affect the cytokine production from PBMCs and suppress the ISGs mRNA expression in the liver samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14513" pm="."><plain>Among the various kinds of cytokines, IP-10, which was reported to be an important biomarker for the treatment response, could be significantly decreased after 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment in vivo [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14514" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that a high amount of IP-10 is a promising biomarker for difficult-to-treat patients regardless of the IL28B polymorphism [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14515" pm="."><plain>IP-10 can be produced from various kinds of immune cells including monocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14516" pm="."><plain>In this study, we found that calcitriol could reduce the production of IP-10 from PBMCs dose-dependently in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14517" pm="."><plain>In addition to the production of IP-10, the expression of ISG mRNA in the liver biopsy samples with 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment was significantly lower than in those without 1(OH) vitamin D3 treatment regardless of the IL28B polymorphism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14518" pm="."><plain>The excessive expression of ISG mRNA before the Peg-IFN/RBV therapy might induce a poor response to IFN administration [38], [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14519" pm="."><plain>In addition to these results, we confirmed that the amounts of IFN-gamma and RANTES induced by 12-weeks 1 (OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV treatment was significantly higher than those induced by 12 weeks Peg-IFN/RBV treatment without 1 (OH) vitamin D3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14520" pm="."><plain>1 (OH) vitamin D3 could suppress the basal levels of the immune response in the CH-C patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14521" pm="."><plain>However, the subsequent response of the adaptive immune system after the start of Peg-IFN/RBV treatment could have been augmented by 1(OH) vitamin D3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14522" pm="."><plain>These data indicated that calcitriol might be able to stabilize the adaptive immune systems that were out of control in CH-C patients instead of inducing their activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14523" pm="."><plain>In this study, we could not detect a significantly higher rate of SVR in the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group in comparison with those in the Peg-IFN/RBV group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14524" pm="."><plain>However, the addition of 1(OH) vitamin D3 could improve the adaptive immune response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14525" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the SVR rate in the 1(OH) vitamin D3/Peg-IFN/RBV group might have been significantly higher than in the Peg-IFN/RBV group, if the sample size had been large enough to analyze the SVR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14526" pm="."><plain>In addition to previous reports, our data indicated that calcitriol could affect the production of cytokines from PBMCs [25], [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14527" pm="."><plain>However, we could not exclude the possibility of affecting cytokines other than the 10 cytokines we analyzed in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14528" pm="."><plain>Moreover, other groups reported that vitamin D3 might modulate the expression of TLRs and/or their signaling, which are important in the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C virus persistent infection [6], [14], [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14529" pm="."><plain>This study was not a randomized control trial and did not have a large number of patients, since it focused on the effect of 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D3 on the immune cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14530" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, the number of included patients was sufficient for the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14531" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we are conducting a randomized control trial that includes a large number of chronic hepatitis C patients with sever fibrosis and low vitamin D3 concentrations (ongoing study) (UMIN000007400). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="14532" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, calcitriol, could improve the response to Peg-IFN/RBV therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14533" pm="."><plain>Supplementation of 1(OH) vitamin D3 or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 should be reasonable for the conditioning of IFN-based treatment including Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA)/Peg-IFN/RBV, DAA/Peg-IFN, Peg-IFN/RBV and Peg-IFN monotherapy. </plain></SENT>
