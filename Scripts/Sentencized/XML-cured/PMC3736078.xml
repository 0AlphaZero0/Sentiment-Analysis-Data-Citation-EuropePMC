Out of 99 positive leptospira cultures, 52 pathogenic leptospira isolates were characterized at species level by using partial RNA polymerase β-subunit (rpoB) gene sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed that 30, 8, and 14 isolates belong to L. borgpetersenii / L. interrogans, L. kirschneri, and Leptospira intermediate species, respectively. Based on analysis of 99 leptospira isolates, the prevalent Leptospira species were L. borgpetersenii or L. interrogans (30.30%), L. kirschneri (8%) and Leptospira intermediate species (14.14%) in animals and humans. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study to use rpoB gene nucleotide sequence based phylogenetic analysis to identify/detect Leptospira intermediate species (L. wolffii) in animals and humans in India. Hence, the prevalence of this species will surely emphasize the importance of consideration of Leptospira intermediate species and formulate a way for further studies especially in understanding the newly emerging Leptospira in animals and humans and to combat the problem associated with the disease conditions. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Leptospira</kwd><kwd>Animals</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Characterization</kwd><kwd>Prevalence</kwd><kwd>Intermediate species</kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>© The Author(s) 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec id="Sec1"><title><text><SENT sid="14606" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="14607" pm="."><plain>Leptospirosis is an important re-emerging zoonotic disease in tropical and subtropical regions of the world with various animal species acting as carriers. It is considered as an emerging global public health problem (Bharti et al. 2003), caused by different pathogenic species of leptospira and is difficult to control and eradicate in tropical developing countries like India. Hence, early detection of leptospira in the host, prompt treatment as well as creating awareness in the public are the steps that could be taken to reduce the extent of problem and the economical losses associated with it. <p><text><SENT sid="14610" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of leptospirosis is usually achieved by serological investigation particularly by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a gold standard test. The MAT is a well proven, accepted and widely used serological test for the detection of leptospiral antibodies in animals and humans. It is very useful in the demonstration of a four-fold change in antibody titers in paired acute and convalescent sera and is of significant value in diagnosing recent infection. However, in case of animals, getting paired sera is difficult, in such case while testing of single serum in MAT, it is essential to correlate the results with clinical signs of the affected animal. Generally, very high MAT titres with a consistent clinical features are conclusive of leptospirosis. <p><text><SENT sid="14615" pm="."><plain>In any particular geographical region, various leptospiral serovars are prevalent and are associated with one or more maintenance host(s) that serves as reservoir of infection. Leptospira spp. are traditionally classified into 29 serogroups and over 300 serovars (Levett 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14616" pm="."><plain>Further, genotypic methods like DNA-DNA hybridization have identified 20 Leptospira spp. to date (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14617" pm="."><plain>However, antigenically related serovars are classified in two or more different species and a serogroup is often found in several species of leptospira. Serovar identification of isolates are essential to understand the prevalence of leptospira in the epidemiology of this disease, but few laboratories perform Cross Agglutination Absorption Test (CAAT) (Terpstra et al. 1985) and most isolates are therefore not identified at serovar level. Serogroups identified using the MAT have no official taxonomic status, can serve as practical purpose of grouping common antigens together. With the emergence of molecular typing methods, it has become increasingly clearer that the concept of a “serovar” is no longer fully satisfactory as it may fail to define epidemiologically important strains/isolates in an adequate manner (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14621" pm="."><plain>For example, molecular typing has been shown to give better discrimination of strains of the Grippotyphosa serogroup than serological typing (Steinen et al. 1992; Hartskeerl et al. 2004). <p><text><SENT sid="14622" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis identifies three major groups of leptospira with few exceptions, based on the pathogenicity such as pathogenic, saprophytic and intermediate strains of unclear pathogenicity (Paster et al. 1991; (Matthias et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14623" pm="."><plain>Genes used to discriminate between species within the genus Leptospira include RNA polymerase β-subunit (rpoB) (La Scola et al. 2006), DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) (Slack et al. 2006) and leptospiral immunoglobulin-like protein (ligB) (Cerqueira et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14624" pm="."><plain>All the proposed taxonomic markers generate results consistent with those obtained with the 16S rRNA sequences in terms of clustering of the strains into three major groups. <p><text><SENT sid="14625" pm="."><plain>The research activities in leptospirosis since inception of Project Directorate on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance (PD_ADMAS) has led to isolation of Leptospira spp. from diverse animals and humans and their maintenance in the repository, development of a simple leptospira staining kit and recording of the leptospiral abortions in bovines and other animal species (Gangadhar and Rajashekar 1998; Gangadhar et al. 2006; 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14626" pm="."><plain>It is imperative to know the circulating Leptospira species/serovars in animals and humans in different geographical locations in order to investigate the prevalence of Leptospira species during monitoring of the leptospirosis. This helps in appropriate use of panel of leptospira serovars in the MAT for providing proper diagnostic without false negative results. Hence, the preliminary study was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of Leptospira species in animals and humans using the archived cultural isolates recovered from suspected samples of animals and humans in different geographical locality of India collected during different periods up to the species level by using rpoB gene- based sequence and phylogenetic analysis. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="14629" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>

Leptospira genus-specific PCR amplified 331bp products from the leptospira organism and different PCR assays detected 52 pathogenic organism, which also gave expected size of the PCR products from pathogenic isolates as described earlier. The remaining 47 culture isolates might be non pathogenic leptospira, which may require further study to classify these isolates using complete 16S rRNA sequencing.

If such a value goes above 97%, then the isolate under scrutiny should be regarded as being representative of a known species. Surprisingly, 14 isolates belonging to intermediate species group showed identities from 99.1 to 99.6% with only one leptospira strain so far reported from Thailand {L. wolffii serovar Khorat strain Khorat-H2 sequence-NZ_AKWX02000023} (Slack et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>

In India, earlier sporadic human case reports with L. inadai infection and circulation of L. inadai in reservoir hosts have been reported (Gangadhar et al., 2000; 2008). <p><text><SENT sid="14692" pm="."><plain>Further, phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) of 52 isolates based on rpoB gene nucleotide sequences revealed that 30 isolates belong to either L. interrogans or L. borgpetersenii species and eight belongs to L. kirschneri species. However, clustering of 14 leptospira isolates branched into a separate group under intermediate species (namely L. wolffii species). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14694" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, when analyzing in MEGALIGN, these isolates branch into a separate group under L. wolffii species and showed two to three different branching pattern within this group namely 8 isolates in one branch, 4 isolates in another and 2 isolates (ADMAS No. 2779 and 3334) in other separate branches. This may clearly indicate some of the isolates, which belong to particular serovars among this species. This is to be confirmed by further analysis using the referral panel of antigen and antibodies procuring from world reference laboratory.Figure 1Phylogenetic tree showing clustering ofLeptospiraconstructed based on the nucleotide sequence of partialrpoBgene by bootstrap test of phylogeny using neighbor-joining method in MEGA-4 program. The values of major clusters are indicated in the node or branch in tree, which represent the bootstrap confidence tested on using 1000 replicates of the data set. Bar represents the genetic distance i.e., number of substitutions per site. <p><text><SENT sid="14698" pm="."><plain>Based on the present study, the major prevalent pathogenic species of Leptospira in animals and human were L. borgpetersenii / L. interrogans (30.3%), intermediate species (14.14%) and L. krischneri (8%) in India. Similarly, in the bovine population, the percentage prevalence of aforementioned species among pathogenic isolates was 56% (14/25), 36% (9/25) and 8% (2/25), respectively. In Karnataka, the prevalence rate of these species among pathogenic isolates was found to be 62.25% (15/24), 25% (6/24) and 12.5% (3/24), respectively (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14701" pm="."><plain>The intermediate species requires further study to determine the exact serovars or new species, as recently more classification of new isolates was made for this intermediate species (Levett et al. 2006; Matthias et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14702" pm="."><plain>Similarly, L. wolffii, a potential pathogenic leptospira species detected in human, sheep and dog as intermediate species (Slack et al., 2008; Zakeri et. al., 2010ab). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14703" pm="."><plain>The presence of L. wolffii with 100% identity in clinical human samples and animals suspected with leptospira may provide evidence for circulation of L. wolffii and its role in transmission cycle within human and animal hosts in Iran (Zakeri et. al., 2010a). </plain></SENT>

Isolation and characterization of leptospires from the samples collected from different hosts, clearly suggested a possible leptospiral infection / or carrier status. Isolation of leptospires from blood samples of cows with either history of abortions or reproductive disorders does not necessarily incriminate leptospira as the etiology of the disorder but only serve as a possible indicator to the existence of the infection. Role of leptospira infection in abortions and reproductive disorders is well established by earlier workers including our earlier studies (Ellis et al. 1976; Poonacha et al. 1993; Gangadhar et al. 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14709" pm="."><plain>Infected cattle are known to be maintenance host resulting in illness leading to abortion, stillbirth, infertility and mastitis or clinically normal but harbour infection and act as a potential source of infection (Higgins et al. 1980). <p><text><SENT sid="14710" pm="."><plain>Leptospira and its maintenance hosts appear to undergo adaptation to their environment, and the preference and pathogenicity of these hosts can change with time and geographic region. Transmission of the infection among maintenance hosts (which remains largely asymptomatic) is efficient and the incidence of infection in humans are relatively high as they are incidental hosts or accidental hosts (which develop clinical disease). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14712" pm="."><plain>Because of the wide spectrum of animal species that serve as reservoirs/maintenance hosts, leptospirosis is considered as the most widely spread zoonotic disease. <p><text><SENT sid="14713" pm="."><plain>The significance of intermediate species in public health and animal reproduction is neither clearly understood nor documented much in literature. It is imperative to identify the species prevalence as well as to know the pathogenic nature and its virulence factors, drug resistance etc. In order to understand the newly emerging leptospira in animals and humans by employing various techniques and to combat the problem associated with the disease conditions. Further studies should be carried out on characterization, identification by pulse field gel electrophoresis and hybridization techniques and pathological studies using hamster model in order to identify the exact Leptospira species. <p><text><SENT sid="14717" pm="."><plain>The disease is of public health importance and warrants bio-safety measures in handling the organism and/or disease. Prevalence of intermediate species identified, will surely emphasize the importance of consideration of this species in India for further studies especially to understand the newly emerging leptospira in animals and humans and to combat the problem associated with the disease conditions if any. Therefore, it is important to increase attention about this disease among physicians and to strengthen laboratory capacity for its diagnosis. However, systematic random screening of the samples from different animals and at-risk personnel is required to know the exact prevalence rate in particular geographical locality, which again depends on the various epidemiological factors influencing leptospirosis occurrence and its spread. This could be useful in the selection of panel of serovars to be used in the MAT at different geographical location to provide proper diagnosis in animals and humans, which in turn will lead to development of specific diagnostics and also to determine the exact prevalence of leptospirosis in different species. Further, a large systematic epidemiology survey would be needed to define the presence and the prevalence of this pathogenic intermediate species in endemic regions of India. </sec></SecTag></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><text><SENT sid="14723" pm="."><plain>Competing interests <p><text><SENT sid="14724" pm="."><plain>The authors declares that they have no competing interests. </fn><fn><p><text><SENT sid="14725" pm="."><plain>Authors’ contributions <p><text><SENT sid="14726" pm="."><plain>VB and NM-conceptualized and planned the study.
