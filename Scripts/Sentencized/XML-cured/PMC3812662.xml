Although most neuroimaging studies in ASD have been designed to identify commonalities among affected individuals, rather than differences, some studies have explored variation within ASD. There have been two general types of approaches used for this in the neuroimaging literature to date: comparison of subgroups within ASD, and analyses using dimensional measures to link clinical variation to brain differences. This review focuses on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that have used these approaches to begin to explore heterogeneity between individuals with ASD. Although this type of data is yet sparse, recognition is growing of the limitations of behaviorally defined categorical diagnoses for understanding neurobiology. Study designs that are more informative regarding the sources of heterogeneity in ASD have the potential to improve our understanding of the neurobiological processes underlying ASD. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>psychiatry and developmental disabilities</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>functional magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>structural magnetic resonance imaging</kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="200"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="17367"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec id="S1"><title><text><SENT sid="15830" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15831" pm="."><plain>The Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a group of lifelong neurodevelopmental syndromes which manifest in early childhood, defined by the presence of difficulties with social interactions and communication together with restricted, repetitive patterns of interests or behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15832" pm="."><plain>The variety of clinical presentations considered to fall within autism has gradually increased over the past 60 years. Leo Kanner first used the diagnosis in 1943 to describe a relatively homogenous group of individuals with deficits in all three domains but intact intellectual capacity (Kanner, 1968). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15834" pm="."><plain>Work by Lorna Wing and others then went on to place Kanner’s subgroup within a broader spectrum that shared some level of deficit in these core domains but was otherwise highly heterogeneous, including allowing a wider spread of cognitive function (Wing, 1981). <p><text><SENT sid="15835" pm="."><plain>In the previous version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), this heterogeneity was captured primarily through the different categorical diagnoses within the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15836" pm="."><plain>The PDD category included Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), as well as two regressive neurodevelopmental disorders of early childhood frequently associated with autistic symptoms, Rett’s syndrome and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. As research progressed, the clinical and neurobiological validity of the categorical distinctions between Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, and PDD-NOS appeared increasingly doubtful, until they were dropped altogether in the recently released DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15838" pm="."><plain>Instead, a broader ASD diagnosis with dimensional specifiers of severity has been adopted, and a new diagnosis of Social Communication Disorder added for those individuals with problems in social communication but without the symptoms in the domain of restrictive and repetitive behaviors (RRIB) required for an ASD diagnosis. <p><text><SENT sid="15839" pm="."><plain>An explicit goal of the recent reformulation of the diagnostic criteria for ASD was to refocus attention on the aspects of heterogeneity within ASD that were likely to be more meaningful than the previous categorical divisions, both clinically and in relation to underlying pathophysiology. This shift in conceptualization of ASD has occurred within a larger context of increasing dissatisfaction with existing diagnostic categories for a variety of psychiatric syndromes, particularly when seeking to link clinical symptoms to specific neurobiological processes (Insel et al., 2010; Lord and Jones, 2012; Uher and Rutter, 2012). <p><text><SENT sid="15841" pm="."><plain>Heterogeneity of clinical presentation among individuals who meet criteria for a specific diagnosis is a particular impediment. One contributor to this heterogeneity is the checklist approach currently used to assign categorical diagnoses. While allowing a good level of reliability between diagnosticians, it has the unfortunate effect of allowing different individuals to meet the threshold for a particular syndrome without necessarily sharing many specific clinical features. A second contributor to heterogeneity of clinical presentations within a particular syndrome such as ASD is the extensive comorbidity between psychiatric diagnoses (Matson and Williams, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15845" pm="."><plain>It has been estimated that between 14 and 78% of children with ASD also meet criteria for Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Gadow et al., 2005; Gargaro et al., 2011), up to 42% for anxiety disorders (Simonoff et al., 2008; Matson and Williams, 2013), and between 25 and 70% have some level of intellectual disability (ID) (Fombonne, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15846" pm="."><plain>There are a wide variety of other symptoms not considered as “core” but which are nevertheless prominent in sizeable fractions of individuals with ASD, such as poor attention, seizure disorders, poor sleep, and gastro-intestinal dysfunction (Silver and Rapin, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15847" pm="."><plain>How these symptoms relate to the pathophysiology of ASD is not clear, but their frequency is suggestive that they may represent at least in part pleiotropic expressions of common processes (Brock, 2011; Rommelse et al., 2011). <p><text><SENT sid="15848" pm="."><plain>In addition to the clinical heterogeneity within ASD, it is associated with a wide variety of different risk factors, implying the potential for many different pathways to generate symptoms (Geschwind, 2009; Herbert, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15849" pm="."><plain>ASD has been associated with over 100 different genes affecting different aspects of neural development and function (Betancur, 2011), as well as a wide variety of environmental factors (Herbert, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15850" pm="."><plain>Attempting to understand the links of specific risk factors to autism is further complicated by the different ways risk factors can relate to clinical phenomena, described as equifinality and multifinality (Cicchetti and Rogosch, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15851" pm="."><plain>Equifinality refers to the observation that a single clinical syndrome may be associated with many different risk factors. Multifinality describes the converse situation, where a single risk factor can be associated with different clinical outcomes. Examples pertinent to ASD include Fragile X, where up to 45% of affected individuals have been estimated meet criteria for ASD (but 55% do not) (Gallagher and Hallahan, 2012), and 22q11.2d syndrome, which appears to increase risk for ASD in some individuals (Antshel et al., 2007), and schizophrenia in others (Murphy et al., 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15854" pm="."><plain>Research on genetic risk factors for ASD in general has been notable for the lack of specificity to ASD (Betancur, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15855" pm="."><plain>Risk-genes instead appear to confer vulnerability for a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders (Sahoo et al., 2011; Rapoport et al., 2012), suggesting that understanding the role of genetic risk factors for ASD will require identifying the factors that direct an individual with a risk-gene down the path to one neurodevelopmental disorder versus another as much as identifying the genes themselves (Moreno-De-Luca et al., 2013). <p><text><SENT sid="15856" pm="."><plain>Investigators have taken different approaches to the clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity of ASD. Geschwind and Levitt (2007) drew attention to the variety of associated genetic syndromes, endorsing the view that the field should be considering a multiplicity of “autisms” rather than a single condition. They went on to hypothesize that what these “autisms” shared was a common abnormality in brain connectivity that occurred early in development and most strongly affected the links between frontal and temporal/parietal cortices. A large body of work has accrued using multiple neuroimaging techniques across a variety of presentations and ages that has shown impaired functional and structural connectivity between brain regions (Amaral et al., 2008; Horder and Murphy, 2012; Just et al., 2012; Travers et al., 2012). <p><text><SENT sid="15860" pm="."><plain>However, limitations to this formulation have also been recognized (Vissers et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15861" pm="."><plain>While the evidence of abnormalities in connectivity are convincing, it does not in itself explain either how the observed abnormalities in connectivity explain the heterogeneity of specific presentations, or how they differentiate autism from a variety of other disorders characterized by poor connectivity between similar brain regions, such as ADHD and schizophrenia. Pelphrey et al. (2011) proposed an alternative approach, in which heterogeneity was constrained by narrowing attention to the deficits in social communication felt to be the heart of ASD, and focusing on early failures of the neural systems relevant to these. While acknowledging that disruptions in these systems could arise from many different sources, congruent with the observations of multiple risk factors, they argued that what was relevant to ASD was the convergence of these factors on the development of specific aspects of the social brain network, such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus (Pinkham et al., 2008; Kaiser et al., 2010). <p><text><SENT sid="15864" pm="."><plain>Concerns have been raised that this approach focuses too closely on the social communication aspect of ASD, and thus not only does not address the range of clinically relevant symptoms, but also stands to lose information potentially crucial for determining what types of pathophysiology are relevant to a particular individual. Brock (2011) have argued that a better method is to consider the heterogeneity along with the findings: for example, rather than just determining whether the amygdala is hyper- or hypo-activated, one should characterize what differentiates those with hyperactivity from those with hypoactivity. <p><text><SENT sid="15866" pm="."><plain>This leads to the strategy of tackling heterogeneity by identifying more homogeneous subgroups, with the hypothesis that this will decrease noise due to variation and facilitate detection of meaningful group differences or brain-behavior relationships (Volkmar et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15867" pm="."><plain>Comparing putative subgroups against each other can also test whether a particular feature distinguishing the subgroups is related to brain differences, or conversely, if there is something that appears consistently found in individuals meeting diagnostic criteria despite other heterogeneous aspects of the presentation. The subgroups explored the most to date are the different disorders within the PDD category in DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), but other ways of dividing ASD have also been used, including divisions based on clinical features such as regression or level of ID, or subgroups defined by presence of a specific risk factor such as gender or a known genetic disorder. <p><text><SENT sid="15869" pm="."><plain>Heterogeneity can also be addressed by using a dimensional approach to relate variation in neuroimaging measures to some other aspect of the presentation (Constantino, 2011; Lord and Jones, 2012; Uher and Rutter, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15870" pm="."><plain>Being able to determine whether some aspect of the brain is predictive of a clinical symptom can both support the relevance of the imaging data, and perhaps, depending on how much is known about the function of those brain regions, inform the larger questions as to what neural processes are responsible for the clinical presentation. <p><text><SENT sid="15871" pm="."><plain>We first briefly discuss which findings appear to be the most consistent in neuroimaging studies of ASD. The second section will review studies that have looked at subgroups within ASD, and the third section work that has instead focused on dimensional approach, both of the features considered as core symptoms of ASD and of common co-occurring conditions. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="RESULTS"><sec id="S2"><title><text><SENT sid="15873" pm="?"><plain>What is Common within Neuroimaging Findings in ASD? </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15874" pm="."><plain>Most imaging studies of ASD done to date have been done taking the categorical diagnosis as their framework, asking the basic question of whether there are one or more brain differences corresponding to the clinical syndrome that can be recognized despite the various sources of heterogeneity. As is the case for other psychiatric disorders, clinical MRIs of individuals with autism do not typically show gross lesions or other abnormalities that can be used to distinguish affected individuals. Instead, alterations in brain structure or function are most easily detectable as differences between groups, and, given the variability of the syndrome, preferably using large samples. <p><text><SENT sid="15877" pm="."><plain>Meta-analysis provides one method of combining data to create larger databases in which to search for patterns. A meta-analysis by Stanfield et al. (2008) included 43 structural neuroimaging studies comprised of data from over 800 subjects between 3 and 30 years of age with ASD and similar number of matched controls. Although there was considerable heterogeneity of results across the studies they included, significant findings on meta-analysis included enlarged total brain volume, hemispheres, cerebellum, and caudate in ASD, and decreased volumes in other brain regions including midbrain regions, regions of the cerebellar vermis, and area of the corpus callosum. Gray and white matter (WM) volumes were not reported separately in this meta-analysis. <p><text><SENT sid="15881" pm="."><plain>Another recent meta-analysis of differences in brain morphometry in ASD limited its scope to fully automated voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of gray matter volumes (Via et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15882" pm="."><plain>Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, including 496 adolescents or adults with ASD (a combination of Autism and Asperger’s Syndrome) and 471 controls. Of the 17 studies that reported IQ, only one included subjects whose mean IQ was less than 70. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15884" pm="."><plain>This meta-analysis found no differences in global gray matter volume between ASD and controls; regional differences consisted of smaller gray matter volume in the ASD group in the amygdala-hippocampus complex and medial parietal regions. A linked meta-analysis by the same group of WM differences measured with VBM identified 13 eligible studies, including 246 patients with ASD, and 237 controls; while global WM volumes were not different, they did find evidence of increased volumes in regions relevant to language and social cognition (Radua et al., 2011). <p><text><SENT sid="15886" pm="."><plain>Meta-analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have additional challenges due to the even greater variety of possible tasks and conditions to be compared. Philip et al. (2012) examined available fMRI studies in ASD across six different functional domains: visual processing, executive function and language tasks, basic social processing, and more complex challenges of social cognition. They performed their meta-analysis using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method, in which data regarding loci of activations are spatially normalized and then the overlap calculated across different experiments (Eickhoff et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15889" pm="."><plain>Ninety papers met inclusion criteria, with an average sample size of ASD participants of 12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15890" pm="."><plain>Although the wide variety of tasks used made comparison challenging, there were regions of activation that were significantly different between the ASD subjects and controls in each of the functional domains examined. Notable findings included a tendency for decreased activation in ASD across several prefrontal and subcortical brain regions during tasks tapping executive function. Activation patterns in the superior temporal gyri were significantly different between ASD and controls across several domains, although the direction varied: ASD had decreased activation during tasks related to auditory and language processing, but increased during tasks of simple social processing, and mixed findings as demands became more complex. The authors also provided a qualitative review of available studies of functional connectivity that could not be included in an ALE analysis, finding multiple observations of decreased connectivity between areas of the cortex in ASD across a variety of resting or task based paradigms, and conversely some instead of increased connectivity, particularly between subcortical and cortical areas. <p><text><SENT sid="15894" pm="."><plain>Robustness of findings in imaging studies has been limited by the small sample sizes and methodological variability of the studies available. However, technical advances in methods for data acquisition and automated processing are making multi-site large-scale imaging studies increasingly feasible. One such collaboration is the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE1), a consortium of investigators in which members contribute both published and unpublished resting-state fMRI data from ASD subjects and controls obtained using similar clinical and imaging protocols. The first paper from this consortium reported on measures of brain connectivity in a dataset collected across 17 sites. Neuroimaging data included in this analysis were limited to that collected from males (360 ASD, 403 controls) who had IQ within 2 standard deviations of the overall sample mean of 108 (Di Martino et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15899" pm="."><plain>The results helped to clarify conflicting results from earlier studies, confirming that both hyper- and hypo-connectivity are characteristic of brain activity in ASD. Hypo-connectivity was much more prominent, affecting to varying degrees all cortico-cortical connections tested, with particularly strong effects in unimodal association areas such as the fusiform and superior temporal gyri, paralimbic regions such as the insula and paracingulate cortex, and connections between hemispheres. Hyperconnectivity was more limited, affecting primarily subcortical nuclei and parietal cortex. The study represented a significant advance in reconciling previously inconsistent observations (Muller et al., 2011; Vissers et al., 2012), although the population studied was limited to the subset of individuals with ASD with normal range IQ, and did not have the younger subjects needed to answer questions around early developmental changes. <p><text><SENT sid="15903" pm="."><plain>In summary, despite the clinical and etiological heterogeneity with ASD, the use of quantitative methods to look for common patterns across datasets collected thus far has detected evidence of some relatively consistent differences in both brain structure and function on a group level. However, a significant contributor to differences in findings among studies of ASD is age. <sec id="S2-1"><title><text><SENT sid="15905" pm="."><plain>Age effects </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="15906" pm="."><plain>As suggested by the meta-analyses above, structural neuroimaging studies of adolescents and adults have had inconsistent findings, with some reporting enlarged volumes (Piven et al., 1995), but the majority normal or even reduced volumes (Garber et al., 1989), consistent with the meta-analyses of VBM data in older individuals by Via et al. (2011) discussed above (Radua et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15907" pm="."><plain>In contrast, studies of head circumference and brain volumes in children with autism have suggested that brain enlargement is a more consistent finding (Wolff, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15908" pm="."><plain>In the meta-analysis by Stanfield discussed above, age effects are described for the amygdala, such that the differences in amygdala volume correlated with age, becoming larger in younger subjects. While this analysis did not find similar age effects for total brain volume, unlike what had been reported in a previous meta-analysis (Redcay and Courchesne, 2005), there are increased effect sizes for larger total brain volumes in younger children. These and similar observations have led to the hypothesis that the trajectory of brain development in some individuals with ASD may show a two-step deviation: an early acceleration in brain growth, followed by a flattening of the growth trajectory or even relative loss in brain volume sometime during early adolescence (Aylward et al., 2002; Redcay and Courchesne, 2005). <p><text><SENT sid="15911" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that while increased early brain volume is one of the most consistently reported observations, it has not been found by all studies (Raznahan et al., 2013a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15912" pm="."><plain>A recent paper re-examining past reports of increased head circumference in ASD found evidence to suggest that much of this could actually due to bias from cohort effects within commonly used population databases such as the CDC. Those studies in which control data had been collected from the same community as the ASD group were less likely to find head circumference differences (Raznahan et al., 2013b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15914" pm="."><plain>MRI comparisons of global gray and WM volumes in young children have also had mixed results. Studies that limited participants to those that met narrow DSM-IV criteria for Autism were less likely to find group differences, while larger brain volumes were more frequently observed when the patient group was extended to the broader autism spectrum. A recent study of brain volumes in toddlers with regressive versus non-regressive autism (Rogers, 2004; Hansen et al., 2008) of the same clinical severity also only found increased brain volumes in males with the regressive subtypes, while males with non-regressive autism were not different than controls. Brain volumes were not increased in females with either regressive or non-regressive autism, although sample size differences may have affected the ability to detect differences in the latter, as there were many more males in the study than females (114 males/22 females) (Nordahl et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15918" pm="."><plain>These findings, together with the observation that many genetic disorders associated with autism often result in microcephaly (Betancur, 2011), suggest that early increased brain growth is present in only a subset of individuals with ASD (Raznahan et al., 2013a). <p><text><SENT sid="15919" pm="."><plain>There is as yet relatively little work attempting to assess developmental shifts in brain functional activity in ASD. In a recent meta-analysis, Dickstein et al. (2013) addressed developmental questions in fMRI results by using ALE methods to directly compare fMRI study results in children less than 18 years old with those obtained in adults. Tasks were split into those testing aspects of social function, such as theory of mind, face processing, and language, versus non-social capacities such as executive function and reward processing. Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria: 18 studies in children (including 262 ASD participants, average age 12.95 ± 1.74 years) and 24 in adults (288 participants, average age 30.55 ± 4.94 years), with similar numbers of age-matched controls. They reported that loci of both hyperactivation and hypoactivation were more pronounced in the younger subjects: in the group of social tasks, the convergence of hyperactivation was higher in the children in the left postcentral gyrus, and hypoactivation greater in the right parahippocampal gyrus/hippocampus and right superior temporal gyrus. In the non-social tasks, hyperactivation was greater in the ASD children in areas such as the right insula, right middle frontal gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus, while hypoactivation was more pronounced in the right middle frontal gyrus; there were no instances in either condition where convergences of hypo- or hyperactivation were greater in the adult ASD group. While the results need to be followed up in longitudinal analysis, they do suggest that development stage plays an important role in functional differences in ASD as well. </sec></sec></SecTag><sec id="S3"><title><text><SENT sid="15926" pm="."><plain>Subgroups within ASD </plain></SENT>

In the Asperger’s syndrome group, this region was not affected, but there was evidence of greater sulcal depth bilaterally in the intraparietal sulcus.

The sample was also divided into a younger (7.5–12.5 years) and older (12.75–18.5 years) in order to explore developmental effects: similarly to the study of amygdala size in this cohort, findings were more pronounced in the younger group, despite the smaller sample size, and no longer evident in the adolescent group. <p><text><SENT sid="15944" pm="."><plain>Scanning children with intellectual disabilities is challenging, and relatively few studies have focused on LFA. Riva et al. (2011) compared brain volumes in a group of children with ASD aged 3–10 years, average IQ of approximately 52, against controls with normal IQ. They reported similar global brain volumes between the two groups, but a pattern of regional gray matter deficits in the autistic group. Other studies have used control groups matched on level of ID. Predescu et al. (2010) did not find differences between 15 children aged 2–8 with ASD and 10 age-matched children with developmental delay (DD) in global gray and WM volumes measured using VBM. A slightly larger study of 34 children aged 2–7 years with ASD and 13 controls matched for age and developmental level also did not find any significant differences in brain volumes, although there appeared to be a positive relationship between developmental stage in the developmentally delayed group that was absent in the ASD children (Zeegers et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>

They found that level of ID differentiated between clusters, while ASD symptoms did not; more severe ID was associated with smaller volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and corpus callosum genu/splenium, along with higher frequency of epilepsy, facial dysmorphic features, and abnormal early psychomotor development. A significant limitation to the studies available thus far is their relatively small size. Compounding this is that the pathology underlying ID and DD is itself not well understood, and so control groups defined on basis of cognitive function are likely to introduce additional variation related to the causes of the cognitive impairment. </sec></sec><sec id="S3-3"><title><text><SENT sid="15955" pm="."><plain>Subgroups defined by risk factors </plain></SENT>

Analyses of this type thus far have been carried out in primarily in regards to genetic risks. Although ASD has also been associated with a variety of environmental risk factors (Herbert, 2010), much less is yet known about how these might relate to brain differences. The strongest environmental risk identified thus far is severe early neglect, which has been associated with development of autistic behavioral features (Rutter et al., 2007), although studies of children raised in these conditions have also shown a capacity for significant improvements on exposure to a socially enriched environment that ASD generally does not. Some small neuroimaging studies have been done in these populations, which have documented decreased brain volumes and abnormal WM architecture, but the relationship of brain findings to autistic symptoms in these subjects is not known (Bos et al., 2011). <p><text><SENT sid="15962" pm="."><plain>Prenatal exposure to maternal autoantibodies has been suggested as another environmental risk factor potentially playing a role in some individuals with ASD.

Together, these findings support the hypothesis that there may be a subgroup of individuals with ASD in which pathophysiology is linked to a particular immune-mediated process during prenatal development.

Such studies within specific genetic disorders have the additional benefit of allowing comparison of individuals with ASD and ID within a relatively homogeneous cohort. There is an element of controversy regarding the relationship of ASD symptoms to genetic disorders such as FRX, with some arguing that despite appropriate scores on standardized assessments, a closer analysis of clinical features of individuals with genetic syndromes reveals that similarities are superficial, and symptom profiles are not the same as in individuals with iAUT (Moss and Howlin, 2009). </plain></SENT>

It has also been uncertain whether the proportion of males and females may change based on the level of ID. Several early studies reported an interaction of gender with ID, such that the ratio of males to females is nearly equal in individuals with ID, and becomes more prominent in the groups with higher IQ (Wing, 1981; Lord et al., 1982; Volkmar et al., 1993). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15991" pm="."><plain>There were not significant interactions of gender and diagnosis for gray matter volumes. However, for WM, several regions had divergent findings for males and females.

In addition to the difference in direction of findings, there was little spatial overlap between affected regions in males and in females. These findings suggest a difference in neuroanatomical substrates of ASD for males and females, despite similar clinical characteristics. Although in general females who have been identified with ASD have tended to be characterized as clinically more severely affected than males (Dworzynski et al., 2012), suggested by some as due to ascertainment biases, this study as well as the others described above did not find gender differences in their samples in either ID or symptom severity (Bloss and Courchesne, 2007). <p><text><SENT sid="15997" pm="."><plain>There has been one fMRI study to date that targeted gender differences, comprised of a verbal fluency task and a mental rotation task (Beacher et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16095" pm="."><plain>Although key brain regions for sensory function such as the primary somatosensory cortex and insula are among those most consistently showing abnormalities in ASD, to date few neuroimaging studies have examined imaging correlates of abnormal sensory function in ASD directly. Cascio et al. (2012) used fMRI to compare responses to pleasant, neutral and unpleasant tactile stimuli between a sample of 13 adults with ASD and 14 matched controls. They found that the subjective descriptions of the sensations were on average similar between the groups, although there was more variability in the ASD responses, highlighting the heterogeneity within the group. Despite the similarity of the subjective reports, there were significant differences in brain activation: the ASD group had significantly less BOLD response to the pleasant and neutral stimuli, but some areas of increased activation during the unpleasant stimuli, including primary somatosensory cortex and insula. Increased activation in the insula correlated with social impairment scores, supporting the theory put forth by some that abnormal sensory function during early development may contribute to abnormal social development (Hilton et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>

Kleinhans et al. (2010) found higher social anxiety scores correlated with reduced activation in the FG and greater activation in the amygdala in adults in response to angry and fearful faces.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16117" pm="."><plain>Most studies in autism have not had understanding heterogeneity as a goal, but instead have effectively treated it as noise in the search for brain differences that correspond to the categorical diagnosis. These efforts have had some success.

<SENT sid="16120" pm="."><plain>Volumetric and functional differences appear to be more pronounced in younger individuals, with a tendency toward larger volumes earlier in life (Courchesne et al., 2011; Wolff, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16121" pm="."><plain>With maturation these differences decrease in magnitude, particularly for brain structure, such that by adolescence summative measures such as total brain volume are not significantly different than controls.

<SENT sid="16123" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in structural and functional measures of connectivity are a consistent finding. <p><text><SENT sid="16124" pm="."><plain>Efforts to address the heterogeneity of autism in neuroimaging studies have chiefly taken two forms: the first, to subdivide ASD into more homogeneous subgroups, using a variety of criteria; the second, to take a dimensional approach to examining the relationship between neuroimaging data and clinical features. Far fewer studies have been done using these approaches, and sample sizes are often quite modest; negative findings in particular may reflect lack of statistical power, or that studies using more sensitive measures have not yet been performed. <p><text><SENT sid="16126" pm="."><plain>Clinically defined categories have included subgroups such as Aspergers’s versus narrowly defined Autism, ASD with and without significant language impairment, and low-functioning versus high-functioning autism. None of these comparisons have provided a strong case for a neurobiologically robust and distinct subtype, which is not to say variation along these clinical dimensions is not of ongoing interest. The relationship of ID to the pathophysiology of ASD has continued to be a challenging issue, complicated by the fact that brain imaging studies of individuals with significant ID are very difficult to carry out, and so samples including these subjects are often underpowered. This has created a situation where despite the predominance of ID in ASD, most imaging studies, particularly those with the sample sizes necessary for multivariate analyses, are carried out in ASD individuals with normal or near-normal IQ. <p><text><SENT sid="16130" pm="."><plain>There have been a few specific risk factors identified with strong enough associations to ASD to look at affected individuals as specific subgroups. One of these is male gender, whose much higher rates compared to females imply the presence of risk factors unique to males. The few structural imaging studies explicitly designed for gender comparison have generally not found significant differences in the pattern of abnormalities, except for the likelihood of females to show more pronounced brain differences than males. Of other specific genetic risk factors, by far the most work has been done in FXS. Here, the pattern of imaging findings appeared to be driven by the FXS genotype, regardless of whether the individuals met criteria for ASD or not. Some of the brain differences associated with the presence of autistic features in the FXS and non-FXS groups affected similar regions but in opposite directions. <p><text><SENT sid="16136" pm="."><plain>The other most frequently used approach in neuroimaging to heterogeneity with ASD has been through relating dimensional variation in clinical or cognitive measures to brain measures. Although these analyses have been generally intended less to describe heterogeneity than to strengthen the case for the likely relevance of the observed brain differences to the clinical symptoms, they can be informative about whether the variation observed clinically and in imaging measures are likely to be reflective of each other. Although reported findings have been mixed, many have been consistent with what would be expected for brain regions known to be associated with specific functions, as described above. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec id="S6"><title><text><SENT sid="16139" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="16140" pm="?"><plain>So, what has neuroimaging told us about heterogeneity in ASD? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16141" pm="."><plain>The main finding may be that neuroimaging provides no refuge from the multiplicity of presentations and candidate risk factors found in the clinic and the genetics laboratory. Studies to date have made progress in identifying patterns of brain abnormalities present in groups of people with ASD, but inconsistency between study results is still more the norm than the exception, and biomarkers robust enough to be meaningful on an individual level have yet to be identified. Adoption of multivariate methods and pattern identification methods based on techniques such as machine learning may improve results, as more reflective of the widespread and subtle morphologic differences that have become apparent with larger scale studies (Ecker et al., 2012), and are consistent with current hypotheses of ASD as being rooted in abnormalities of synaptic development (State and Sestan, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16144" pm="."><plain>The difficulty with this approach, however, as has been discussed extensively elsewhere (Hyman, 2010), is that it continues to center around a concept of autism, or even the broader range of ASD, as a discrete entity. Such a designation can be highly useful from the practical level of providing a diagnostic label and indications for intervention. However, as a constraint for inquiries into biology, it may more distort than illuminate. Autistic disorders exist not only as a spectrum within the realm of pathology, but also the severe end of a set of continuous traits which extend into the general population, and do not have clear boundaries with other disorders such as ADHD (Lai et al., 2013b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16148" pm="."><plain>Abundant evidence from epidemiologic, genetic and twin studies supports the common nature of the risk factors affecting autistic traits within individuals meeting criteria for the disorder and in the general population (Robinson et al., 2011; Ronald and Hoekstra, 2011; Lundstrom et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16149" pm="."><plain>ASD might be better considered a name assigned to designate individuals whose expression of a particular set of continuously varying traits has reached a certain threshold of severity (Uher and Rutter, 2012). <p><text><SENT sid="16150" pm="."><plain>These issues have been much discussed of late, prompted by the most recent revision of DSM (Kendler, 2012; Lord and Jones, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16151" pm="."><plain>Although DSM-5 left the previous categorical system largely intact, acknowledging its clinical utility and the lack of sufficient evidence to support more substantive revision, for research purposes there has been increasing support for decreasing the emphasis on categorical diagnoses (Uher and Rutter, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16152" pm="."><plain>Proposed alternatives include transdiagnostic dimensional approaches such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoCs) currently under development at the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) in the U.S.2 (Insel et al., 2010), which focus on simpler constructs (for example, response to social stimuli, or working memory) that may be more amenable to linking across multiple levels of neural, cognitive, and behavioral function regardless of which clinical syndrome a particular feature is occurring within. <p><text><SENT sid="16153" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging has revolutionized our understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders by affording observations of brain structure and function in vivo, including the tracing of developmental trajectories in children and adolescents from the very first months of life. It should be kept in mind that despite the rapid technical advances in the field, MRI techniques remain limited to a level of spatial and temporal resolution too coarse to visualize the synaptic or neuronal-level abnormalities that may be core features of disorders such as ASD. If this is the level from which heterogeneity arises, neuroimaging may ultimately not be the best tool for parsing these differences. However, in combination with more finely grained methods such as post-mortem tissue analysis and animal models, neuroimaging studies have the potential to provide a critical intermediate step between risk factors such as specific genes and the cognitive or behavioral features of interest. Such approaches, by focusing on the links between genetic, biological, and behavioral domains, allow us the opportunity to deconstruct our conceptions of ASD back to where they can be grounded in biology. Eventually, heterogeneity may no longer be considered as noise in neuroimaging studies of ASD, and instead take its place as a guide to pathophysiology (Brock, 2011; Georgiades et al., 2013). </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="COMP_INT"><sec id="S7"><title><text><SENT sid="16159" pm="."><plain>Conflict of Interest Statement </plain></SENT>
