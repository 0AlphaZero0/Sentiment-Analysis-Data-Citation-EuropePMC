</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17100" pm="."><plain>Despite of thousands of confirmed disease susceptibility variants [1], the findings from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) so far explain only a portion of the heritability of complex diseases [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17101" pm="."><plain>Multi-SNP approaches like interaction and pathway analysis were proposed [3] to detect the still unexplained portion of genetic disease risk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17102" pm="."><plain>While Genome-wide interaction analysis has become computationally feasible [4], [5], by now only few, if any, replicable interactions have been found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17103" pm="."><plain>In order to explain the phenomenon of missing evidence for interaction, Zuk et al. [6] suggested that common diseases may follow so-called limiting pathway liability models (LPLMs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17104" pm="."><plain>A LPLM is defined by multiple risk factors which imply a risk threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17105" pm="."><plain>Individuals with a risk allele load above the threshold have a strongly increased disease risk, while a baseline risk applies below the threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17106" pm="."><plain>LPLMs can be viewed as a special case of the larger class of liability models [7], [8] which allow that the risk contribution of the involved factors may vary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17107" pm="."><plain>In addition, the LPLMs focus on a single pathway that is under polygenic influence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17108" pm="."><plain>In contrast to that, Li et al. [8] describe two sources of liability to depression, namely genetic liability for stress sensitivity mediating depression, and genetic liability for depression in general. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17109" pm="."><plain>Both sources are shown to be under polygenic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17110" pm="."><plain>A key feature of these models and the simpler LPLMs is that they imply epistasis that goes beyond two-way interaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17111" pm="."><plain>Further important classes of more complex high-dimensional models have been discussed in [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17112" pm="."><plain>Although pointed out previously [10], it is worthwhile to recall that diverging definitions and interpretation of the terms “interaction” or “epistasis” in the literature often lead to confusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17113" pm="."><plain>The topic is intrinsically difficult, since the statistical definition of interaction is scale-dependent [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17114" pm="."><plain>In this paper, as in the majority of statistical publications on the topic, we interpret interaction as deviation from multiplicative relative risks, which corresponds to deviation from additivity on the logarithmic scale used in logistic regression models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17115" pm="."><plain>This definition is the appropriate definition for rare diseases [12] and will also prove to be appropriate in the settings we are going to investigate. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17116" pm="."><plain>The risk allele threshold models proposed by Zuk et al. [6] lead to marginal effects that are comparable with effect sizes observed in GWAS studies and imply both low and high-dimensional interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17117" pm="."><plain>However, pairwise interaction, although present, is typically so small that it would be detectable only with sample of several hundreds of thousands of individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17118" pm="."><plain>In this sense, LPLMs would be consistent with the expected importance of genetic interaction [10], [13], [14] on the hand and lacking statistical evidence for its presence on the other hand. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17119" pm="."><plain>The search for deviation from multiplicativity in all medium-sized SNP sub sets of a GWAS panel is clearly unfeasible and not a realistic strategy in the coming years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17120" pm="."><plain>However, it is an important research question how to decide whether a given set of SNPs displays “supra-multiplicativity” of allelic risks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17121" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present a powerful one degree of freedom (d.f.) regression test for deviation from multiplicativity which simultaneously addresses interactions of all orders and which is particularly powerful in the presence of threshold models. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17124" pm="."><plain>Table 1 shows results from the simulations under the model with marginal effects, but no interaction effects of any kind. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17125" pm="."><plain>Under all scenarios, the empirical levels are slightly lower than the nominal level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17126" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is caused by the application of a Bonferroni-correction to not completely independent test statistics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17127" pm="."><plain>The conservativeness is significant for  and all SNP sizes, as well as for  and for SNP sets with less than 30 SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17128" pm="."><plain>However, the observed conservativeness is rather small in size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17129" pm="."><plain>The strongest difference we observe is an empirical level of 0.042 at  for 40 SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17130" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we conclude that the application of the Bonferroni-correction is sufficient for practical purposes. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><SecTag type="TABLE"></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="17651" pm="."><plain>In summary, we see an over-proportional increase in disease risk, along with growing risk allele load. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17652" pm="."><plain>Since the supra-multiplicativity is not attributable to lower order interactions terms, we can state that the deviation from multiplicativity would have gone undetected without the SMT. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17654" pm="."><plain>We presented the SMT as a test for deviation from multiplicativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17655" pm="."><plain>It can be applied to sets of a size of up to  SNPs and allows joint investigation of all -way interactions, , by a single parameter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17656" pm="."><plain>With  SNPs, there are  allelic interaction terms  that theoretically could be analyzed in a regression framework. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17657" pm="."><plain>With growing , such systematic investigation quickly reaches the limit of computability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17658" pm="."><plain>The SMT, however, can simultaneously assess interactions of different orders. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17659" pm="."><plain>In addition, the formulation as a one parameter test improves power via the reduction of degrees of freedom and by reduction of the multiple testing burden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17660" pm="."><plain>The test is powerful under two assumptions: First, effect sizes of SNP alleles have to depend on the combination of genotypes at other disease SNPs, but, effect directions must not depend on the genotypes at other model SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17661" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the indicator parameter counts the number of risk alleles of an individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17662" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the SMT will lose power when effect directions can be reverted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17663" pm="."><plain>Second, a substantial part of the SNPs under investigation must deviate from multiplicativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17664" pm="."><plain>This assumption might be considered to be a strong one, but is, on the other hand, fulfilled by biologically plausible models which at the same time are easily specified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17665" pm="."><plain>In particular, limiting pathway liability models (LPLMs) lead to strong supra-multiplicativity which can be detected by the SMT, as shown in our simulation study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17666" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the SMT remained powerful when we altered the LPLMs such that marginal SNP effects were allowed to vary substantially. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17667" pm="."><plain>In addition, we exemplified the usefulness of the SMT for small SNP sets by showing that it is much more powerful than standard interaction tests under 3-SNP-recessive models. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17668" pm="."><plain>Zuk et al. [6] have proposed LPLMs as a possible explanation for missing evidence for epistasis in GWAS studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17669" pm="."><plain>With the SMT it is now possible to systematically screen GWAS susceptibility SNPs for their involvement in a LPLM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17670" pm="."><plain>More generally, our approach can be used as a tool to screen pre-defined SNP sets for supra-multiplicativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17671" pm="."><plain>Thereby, it has the potential to assess the presence of simultaneous effects of known SNPs and to contribute to the judgement of their joint relevance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17672" pm="."><plain>In this context, previously confirmed, particular -way interactions can be used as model covariates, in order to detect supra-multiplicativity on top of such interactions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17673" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of known Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility SNPs in previously unpublished data revealed supra-multiplicativity () that was neither attributable to SNP dominance, nor to pairwise or three-way interaction effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17674" pm="."><plain>A sharp risk allele threshold as it would be characteristic of LPLMs was not identifiable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17675" pm="."><plain>Instead, deviation from multiplicativity developed gradually with increasing allele load, and, therefore, was not detectable with standard interaction analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17676" pm="."><plain>Confirmed supra-multiplicativity of risk factors is of potential relevance in various fields. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17677" pm="."><plain>In the presence of supra-multiplicativity, prediction of disease risk can be improved when the joint distribution of risk factors is fully modeled in contrast to prediction based on multiplication of risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17678" pm="."><plain>For application in clinical practice, it is important that all risk factors as such, as well as their amount of supra-multiplicativity, are confirmed by independent studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17679" pm="."><plain>In addition, independent studies would have to specifically investigate whether prediction can be improved over prediction based on the domineering APOE locus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17680" pm="."><plain>Supra-multiplicativity is perhaps even more important for treatment invention and drug development than it is for risk prediction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17681" pm="."><plain>Supra-multiplicative risk factors imply over-proportionally strong disease risk when they occur together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17682" pm="."><plain>Conversely, this means that disease risk can be substantially reduced when the effects on phenotype of only a portion of the risk factors can be blocked. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17683" pm="."><plain>Under a risk threshold model, for instance, disease risk can be reduced to a base-line level when the number of still effective risk factors can be reduced so far that the number of still active risk factors is below the risk threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17684" pm="."><plain>In particular, this means that for a complex disease it might not be necessary to have an antidote for all risk factors, it might be sufficient to inactivate just some of these. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17685" pm="."><plain>Stringent statistical evidence for strong supra-multiplicativity of the risk factors of the disease under investigation, however, is an essential prerequisite for such a perspective. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17687" pm="."><plain>Our work got its stimulus from the manuscript of Zuk et al. [6] who suggested limiting pathway liability models (LPLMs) as an explanation for the missing evidence for interaction in GWAS studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17688" pm="."><plain>An LPLM can be defined as follows: Consider a set of  SNPs, and specify for each SNP its risk allele. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17689" pm="."><plain>Let ,  be the number of risk alleles of an individual. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17690" pm="."><plain>Let ,  be a liability threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17691" pm="."><plain>For individuals with , the risk to be a case is set to be equal to a baseline penetrance , while for individuals with  risk alleles, an increased penetrance  applies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17692" pm="."><plain>It is typically assumed that  and that . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17693" pm="."><plain>By design, such a model leads to marginal SNP effects and also to -way interaction effects for all . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17694" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the effect of the risk allele of SNP , , depends on the number of risk alleles present at SNPs 1 to . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17695" pm="."><plain>Since the interaction effects are distributed over all orders, particular single interaction terms are rather small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17696" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, search for, for instance, pairwise interaction is not the method of choice in the presence of a LPLM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17697" pm="."><plain>Motivated by this, we construct a one degree of freedom (d.f.) test for deviation from multiplicativity for a set of  SNPs that simultaneously addresses all -way interaction effects, . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17698" pm="."><plain>An implementation can be found in our software package INTERSNP [23] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intersnp.meb.uni-bonn.de">http://intersnp.meb.uni-bonn.de</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17699" pm="."><plain>We consider a set of  SNPs with corresponding parameters , , which follow the allele coding used in the logistic regression framework described elsewhere [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17700" pm="."><plain>We introduce a series of indicator parameters , , where  is a liability threshold that shall be investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17701" pm="."><plain>In case an individual has  risk alleles, we set , otherwise we set . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17702" pm="."><plain>Next, we test the liability threshold  by comparingagainst </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17703" pm="."><plain> </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17704" pm="."><plain>In other words, we use the marginal effects of the SNPs as covariates and investigate if the disease risk increases sharply when  risk alleles are present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17705" pm="."><plain>Since the optimal cut-off is not known in advance, all values of  have to be tested. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17706" pm="."><plain>We compute the final p-value  as  where  is the number of cut-offs  for which there are individuals both above and below the threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17707" pm="."><plain>The method will be conservative since the tests are not independent for different values of . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17708" pm="."><plain>In the results section, we will show that the Bonferroni-correction is, nevertheless, more than acceptable for practical purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17709" pm="."><plain>We note that the suggested test allows the inclusion of further covariate parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17710" pm="."><plain>Adaption to quantitative traits is also straightforward. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17711" pm="."><plain>By design, the proposed test can detects various types of deviation from multiplicativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17712" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we call it a supra-multiplicativity test (SMT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17713" pm="."><plain>The SMT is constructed to optimize power in the presence of LPLMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17714" pm="."><plain>More generally, one can expect the SMT to be powerful when a substantial portion of the sub sets of the SNP set under investigation deviate from multiplicativity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17715" pm="."><plain>In addition, effect directions should not be reverted in combination with other risk alleles since the test is build up on risk allele counts per individual. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="17727" pm="."><plain>In order to assess power of the SMT, we investigated limiting pathway liability models (LPLMs) as suggested by Zuk et al. [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17728" pm="."><plain>Let  be the number of model SNPs and let  be a respective allele load threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17729" pm="."><plain>In our set-up,  ranged from 10 to 50 in step sizes of 10 and the threshold  was chosen such that about 1.5% of the general population had an allele load equal to or above the threshold . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17730" pm="."><plain>For individuals below , a baseline penetrance value of 0.03 was assumed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17731" pm="."><plain>For individuals above the threshold, we assumed a strongly increased penetrance , where  was chosen from . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17732" pm="."><plain>For each parameter constellation , we simulated 1,000 data sets with 3,000 cases and 3,000 controls and estimated empirical power at the level  as the portion of simulated data sets significant at . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17733" pm="."><plain>We decided to present power at the level , since an exhaustive search over all subsets of a given set of SNPs quickly leads to a high number of tests. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17734" pm="."><plain>In addition, analysis of  is a number of tests that can be analyzed within a reasonable time frame with our implementation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17735" pm="."><plain>In practice, a less stringent  might be considered sufficient, depending on the number of models that are actually tested, cf. also the section “Data analysis”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17736" pm="."><plain>Power of the liability was not only analyzed for the entire SNP set, but also for marker subsets of all possible sizes, in order to mimic the situation that not all SNPs belonging to a threshold model will be available or known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17737" pm="."><plain>For a set of  SNPs, the number of subsets of size  can be enormously high. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17738" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we could not analyze all subsets, but investigated the “first”  SNPs, in the arbitrary order implied by the set-up, to assess power for subsets of size . </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17739" pm="."><plain>This procedure has also the advantage of improved comparability when moving from subset size  to subset size . </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="17740" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the potential impact of incomplete SNP coverage on the power of the SMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17741" pm="."><plain>To this purpose, we assumed that the true causal SNPs of the 30-SNP LPLM () are not available, but only tagged by proxy SNPs with an  of 0.80. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17742" pm="."><plain>After genotype imputation, such approximation of causal SNPs by SNPs in linkage disequilibrium is realistic. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17745" pm="."><plain>In particular, differences in the contribution of individual SNPs should be allowed in multi-SNP models [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17746" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we modified the 30-SNP LPLM () from above as follows. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17747" pm="."><plain>We maintained the load threshold from before, but varied the weighting of the risk allele contributions from different SNPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17748" pm="."><plain>For one third of the SNPs, the risk allele counts were weighted with a factor of 0.5, for another third of the SNPs, the risk allele counts were weighted with a factor of 1, and the remaining SNPs were weighted with a factor of 2. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="17755" pm="."><plain>Model REZ-B was defined by allele frequencies 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 and a high risk genotype penetrance of 0.70, model REZ-C was defined by allele frequencies 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 and a high risk genotype penetrance of 0.10, and, model REZ-D was defined by allele frequencies 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8 and a high risk genotype penetrance of 0.05. </plain></SENT>
