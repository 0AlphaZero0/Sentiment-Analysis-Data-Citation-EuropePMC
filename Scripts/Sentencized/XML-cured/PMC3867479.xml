Previously, we demonstrated that HMGA1 is a key regulator of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene and an important downstream target of the INSR signaling cascade. Moreover, from a pathogenic point of view, overexpression of HMGA1 has been associated with human cancer, whereas functional variants of the HMGA1 gene have been recently linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. However, despite of this biological and pathological relevance, the mechanisms that control HMGA1 gene expression remain unknown. In this study, to define the molecular mechanism(s) that regulate HMGA1 gene expression, the HMGA1 gene promoter was investigated by transient transfection of different cell lines, either before or after DNA and siRNA cotransfections. An octamer motif was identified as an important element of transcriptional regulation of this gene, the interaction of which with the octamer transcription factors Oct-1 and Oct-2 is crucial in modulating HMGA1 gene and protein expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that HMGA1 binds its own promoter and contributes to its transactivation by Oct-2 (but not Oct-1), supporting its role in an auto-regulatory circuit. Overall, our results provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of the HMGA1 gene, revealing a differential control exerted by both Oct-1 and Oct-2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19629" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they consistently support the hypothesis that a putative defect in Oct-1 and/or Oct-2, by affecting HMGA1 expression, may cause INSR dysfunction, leading to defects of the INSR signaling pathway. </p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by MIUR Italy (protocol 2004062059-002).

<SENT sid="19632" pm="."><plain>By modifying DNA conformation and by recruiting transcription factors to the transcription start site, it facilitates the assembly and stability of stereospecific DNA-protein complexes (so-called enhanceosomes), thus driving gene transcription in response to multiple extracellular and intracellular signals [4], [5], [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19633" pm="."><plain>In addition to its role in gene transcription, HMGA1 is also involved in numerous other processes, including embryogenesis, differentiation, and neoplastic transformation [7], [8], [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19634" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence assigns to HMGA1 an important role in the transcriptional regulation of glucose homeostasis [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19635" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these latter findings, we have shown that defects in HMGA1 expression and/or function, by negatively affecting insulin receptor (INSR) signaling in insulin target tissues, may cause insulin resistance and increase susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus [11], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19636" pm="."><plain>Also, evidence has been provided implicating the HMGA1 locus as one conferring a high cross-race risk of development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome [16], [17], [18], [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19637" pm="."><plain>However, despite this variety of studies, the mechanisms that regulate HMGA1 gene expression are mostly unknown. <p><text><SENT sid="19638" pm="."><plain>Cloning and characterization of the HMGA1 gene reveals a very complex structure [2], [20], with a regulatory region comprising the untranslated exons 1–3, lacking TATA and CAAT, but rich in G and C. Its complexity includes at least two transcription start sites and an extensive alternative mRNA splicing, particularly in the 5′-untranslated region [2], [20], resembling the genes that are regulated without the preferential utilization of any specific start site [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19640" pm="."><plain>Instead, a preferential utilization of start site 2 has been demonstrated under certain experimental conditions, in which tight gene regulation is achieved, following the production of specific mRNA in response to different stimuli [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19641" pm="."><plain>A mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the human HMGA1 gene has been postulated before both in embryonic and cancer cells highly expressing HMGA1 [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19642" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that elevated expression of HMGA1 in these cell models is mainly controlled by specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors, both of which seem to act as positive regulating elements, after binding to the transcription start site 1 and the transcription start site 2, respectively [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19643" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we sought to further investigate the mechanisms that underlie HMGA1 gene expression in different human and rat cell lines widely used in biochemical and molecular genetic studies of gene function and regulation. We report herein the identification of a new mechanism of regulation of the HMGA1 gene, which involves the octamer DNA motif “ATGCAAAT” originally described in immunoglobulin (Ig) gene regulation [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19645" pm="."><plain>As a cis-acting transcriptional regulatory element found in both promoters and enhancers of a wide variety of ubiquitously expressed and cell type-specific genes, this octamer motif is specifically bound by a family of at least 11 distinct nuclear proteins, named octamer-binding (Oct) transcription factors, designated from Oct-1 to Oct-11 [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19646" pm="."><plain>All these factors are characterized by two Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) domains, in which the N-terminal subunit is known as the POU-specific (POUS) domain, while the C-terminal subunit is a homeo domain (POUH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19647" pm="."><plain>Both domains are required for high-affinity, site-specific binding to the octamer motif, and mediate specific protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors or co-factors, thus activating or inhibiting gene expression [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19648" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused our attention on the regulation of HMGA1 gene transcription by the octamer-binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2, whose ubiquitous expression differ from other Oct proteins that exhibit, instead, a developmental and tissue-specific distribution [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19649" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate a role for Oct-1 and Oct-2 in regulating HMGA1 expression through direct interaction with the upstream HMGA1 promoter region. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title><text><SENT sid="19650" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods <sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="19651" pm="."><plain>Cells, protein extracts and Western Blot (WB) <p><text><SENT sid="19652" pm="."><plain>HepG2 human hepatoma cells, and human cervix epithelioid carcinoma cells (HeLa) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). </plain></SENT>

Instead, unlabeled competitor DNA for the octamer motif “ATGCAAAT”, completely abolished protein-DNA complex formation with P3 probe (Figure 3A), indicating that the POU domain is essential for the formation of a DNA-protein complex at this site. On the other hand, binding of HMGA1 to P5 probe was displaced by excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the PRDII element motif (GGGAAATTCCGTGGGAAATTCCGAGCT) (Figure 3A), which, as reported previously by us and others, specifically binds HMGA1 in the minor groove of the central AT-rich region [4], [26], [28], thus suggesting a potential autoregulatory role of HMGA1 on its own promoter. Next, we showed that the protein-DNA complexes formed upon incubation of nuclear extracts from IM-9 cells with labeled P3 were recognized and supershifted to a slower-migrating form by the anti-Oct-1 or anti-Oct-2 antibody (Figure 3B); instead, binding of HMGA1 to labeled P5 produced a protein-DNA complex that was recognized and supershifted by the anti-HMGA1 antibody (Figure 3B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19770" pm="."><plain>As shown in Figure 6A, overexpression of Oct-1 in HepG2 cells caused a decrease in endogenous HMGA1 mRNA and protein levels and this was followed by a decline in INSR mRNA and protein expression.

Using DNA-protein interaction studies combined with ChIP coupled with qRT-PCR, we demonstrated a differential role for Oct-1 and Oct-2 transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of the HMGA1 gene which, in addition to the regulation of HMGA1 mRNA and protein expression, may contribute to the modulation of HMGA1-target genes. The observation that Oct-1 and Oct-2 differentially affect HMGA1 gene expression by binding to the same octamer motif “ATGCAAAT” is consistent with previous reports, in which it has been demonstrated that both Oct-1 and Oct-2 bind to the same DNA sequence but may differ in their activation potential [29], [34], [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19785" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, here we show that, by facilitating the interaction of Oct-2 (but not Oct-1) with the HMGA1 gene, HMGA1 enhances transactivation of its own promoter by this octamer transcription factor, providing evidence for the existence of an auto-regulatory circuit in which HMGA1 activates its own transcription. In relation to Oct-1, it needs to be considered that several isoforms of this transcription factor were described previously, each of which is active in a tissue-specific manner, being able to mediate different and even opposing effects [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19787" pm="."><plain>Thus, we cannot exclude that in other cells the effect of Oct-1 on HMGA1 may be different from that reported here in our work. In this regard, results have been provided indicating that Oct-1, NF-kappa B and HMGA1 cooperate for transactivation of the iNOS promoter in pancreatic β-cells [37]. <p><text><SENT sid="19789" pm="."><plain>As we previously reported, HMGA1 is a main activator of the INSR gene [10], [26], and individuals with defects in HMGA1 have decreased INSR expression and increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus [11], [15], [16], [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19790" pm="."><plain>Also, we showed that, as a novel downstream nuclear target of the INSR signaling pathway [13], HMGA1 represents an important novel mediator of glucose disposal and glucose homeostasis [12], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19791" pm="."><plain>Therefore, based on these observations and the results from the present study indicating that a functional relation can be established between HMGA1, Oct-1 and Oct-2 in the context of the INSR gene, it is tempting to hypothesize that a putative defect in these nuclear proteins may cause INSR dysfunction with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action. In this regard, an association between Oct-1 gene variants and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which may support this intriguing hypothesis, has been reported [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19793" pm="."><plain>Moreover, recent evidences suggest that Oct-1 may play a role in metabolic homeostasis by acting as a sensor for cAMP (cyclic AMP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19794" pm="."><plain>In particular, elevation of cAMP in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells reduces nuclear Oct-1 content [39], [40], and this is consistent with previous observations indicating that expression of HMGA1 increases in response to cAMP [12], [41], thus suggesting that increased HMGA1 expression could be due, at least in part, to the reduction of Oct-1 content. <p><text><SENT sid="19795" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings from this study reveal new mechanistic insight into the transcriptional mechanisms governing HMGA1 gene expression. While additional investigations will be needed to further define the roles of Oct-1 and Oct-2 in HMGA1 expression in other cell systems and models, these results provide a paradigm to suggest other types of molecule, Oct-1 and Oct-2, in addition to HMGA1, which should be searched for in investigations designed to elucidate the causes of impairment of INSR signaling in humans with INSR dysfunction and insulin resistance. </sec></SecTag></body><back><SecTag type="ACK_FUND"><ack><p><text4fund><text><SENT sid="19797" pm="."><plain>We would like to thank Dr. Winship Herr (Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland), for providing expression plasmids encoding Oct-1 and Oct-2. </plain></SENT>
