</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19873" pm="."><plain>Individuals with type 1 diabetes are at a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, despite lack of traditional risk factors [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19874" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in lipid and lipoprotein composition or metabolism may contribute to CVD risk, and may arise due to alterations in synthesis, absorption, or clearance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19875" pm="."><plain>De novo lipogenesis (DNL), the synthesis of fatty acids, is assumed to be a minor contributor to plasma triglyceride (TG) levels in healthy humans, but this may not be true for all disease states. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19876" pm="."><plain>DNL is elevated in states of glucose interolance such as type 2 diabetes [2] and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19877" pm="."><plain>In these individuals, DNL has been reported to contribute significantly to both circulating TG levels and is highly associated with intrahepatic TG accumulation [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19878" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have indicated that up to half of individuals with type 1 diabetes have some degree of liver fat accumulation, which is associated with greater prevalence of vascular disease despite normal plasma cholesterol and TG levels [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19879" pm="."><plain>NAFLD development is highly associated with insulin resistance [6], which may be more prominent in type 1 diabetic individuals than once appreciated [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19880" pm="."><plain>Animal models of type 1 diabetes suggest reduced DNL [9]–[11], but, to date, there have been no investigations of DNL in humans with type 1 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19881" pm="."><plain>Further, the main products of lipogenesis are saturated fatty acids (FA), which may negatively influence cellular function and metabolism [12] and therefore contribute to the metabolic dysregulation observed in type 1 diabetes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19882" pm="."><plain>The deuterium incorporation method is particularly suited to the measurement of DNL because is safe, can be used with a short measurement period (≤24 hours), rapidly equilibrates across body pools, and provides a highly sensitive and precise measurement of in vivo synthesis [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19883" pm="."><plain>Typically when DNL is assessed, only the major product of DNL is measured (i.e. palmitate); however, using gas chromatography isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) allows for the measurement of the synthesis rate of individual fatty acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19884" pm="."><plain>For example, Bergman et al (2013) recently observed that individuals with type 1 diabetes had a lower amount of palmitoleic acid in plasma-TG compared to non-diabetic individuals, which was inversely related to adipocyte insulin sensitivity; these authors questioned whether this reduced content of 16∶1 was due to reduced dietary intake or hepatic synthesis and desaturation [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19885" pm="."><plain>Therefore DNL may have quantitative and qualitative implications, and determination of its potential role in the increased vascular disease risk in type 1 diabetes is of importance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19886" pm="."><plain>As stated previously, the paradox in type 1 diabetes is that these individuals are at a markedly higher risk for premature cardiovascular events compared to the general population despite lack of traditional risk factors; indeed, type 1 diabetic individuals frequently have normal plasma cholesterol levels [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19887" pm="."><plain>Current American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend statin therapy for people with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) over the age of 40 regardless of baseline lipid levels for the purpose of CVD prevention [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19888" pm="."><plain>Individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes have been observed to have lower absorption and higher synthesis of cholesterol [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19889" pm="."><plain>By contrast, type 1 diabetic individuals have been proposed to have reduced synthesis and elevated absorption of cholesterol [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19890" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy in relative cholesterol synthesis begs the question of whether statin therapy is warranted in type 1 diabetic individuals, given that it has been argued that while the benefits of statin therapy for CVD prevention is well established in type 2 diabetes, there is a lack of sufficient evidence that the same is true for type 1 diabetes as many large clinical trials have been underpowered to answer this question [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19891" pm="."><plain>The utility of statins for cholesterol reduction in type 1 diabetes is particularly relevant given that differences in cholesterol synthesis may predict response to cholesterol-lowering treatment [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19892" pm="."><plain>Therefore, determination of cholesterol synthesis in this group is clinically relevant because it may lend insight into appropriate treatment modalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19893" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have been conducted using sterol markers, which can be used to estimate cholesterol synthesis and absorption but are qualitative in nature [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19894" pm="."><plain>The deuterium incorporation method is useful for studying in vivo synthetic pathways [22] and can be used to estimate FA and cholesterol synthesis simultaneously [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19895" pm="."><plain>In addition, the type 1 diabetic patients in previous studies tended to be younger, and therefore investigation of lipid synthesis in subjects with long-standing diabetes is warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="19896" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to objectively measure DNL and cholesterol synthesis in individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes who are otherwise free of diabetic complications, under simulated free-living conditions and using the deuterium incorporation method which is ideally suited to studies of lipid synthesis in short (&lt;24 h) duration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19897" pm="."><plain>It was hypothesized that, given the labile glycemic control in this population, DNL would be elevated compared to healthy non-diabetic individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19898" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was hypothesized that the objectively measured rate of cholesterol synthesis would be reduced in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy non-diabetic subjects, based on previously published literature using sterol markers. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="19902" pm="."><plain>Islet transplant subjects have long-standing and labile diabetes characterized by severe recurrent hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness, but are free of unstable coronary artery disease, proliferative retinopathy and severe proteinuria [24], [25]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20141" pm="."><plain>The finding of similar rates of lipogenesis between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals in the present study is in contrast to the rates of DNL in type 2 diabetic subjects [2], despite a similar labeling procedure and timeframe. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20142" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy in magnitude of lipogenesis may be related to insulin resistance, because insulin resistance appears to have a greater influence on chronically elevating lipogenesis than does dietary intake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20143" pm="."><plain>For example, individuals with insulin resistance, as occurring in type 2 diabetes [2] and NAFLD [3], appear to have high rates of lipogenesis in both the fasting and fed states, which does not display a circadian rhythm [3] or respond to changes in dietary intake as would be expected [2], [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20144" pm="."><plain>Insulin resistance in type 1 diabetic individuals may be more common than previously appreciated [7], [8], but is difficult to assess in these individuals as it requires multi-stage clamp techniques and does not correlate with markers of glycemic control [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20145" pm="."><plain>Despite the potential for insulin resistance to increase lipogenesis in type 1 diabetic individuals as it does in type 2 diabetes, lipogenesis may remain lower in type 1 diabetic patients due to the restriction of total energy intake and particularly dietary carbohydrate in these individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20146" pm="."><plain>This dietary restriction could serve to limit lipogenesis even in the face of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20147" pm="."><plain>The low rate of lipogenesis observed in the present subjects (similar to non-diabetic subjects) is particularly interesting in this population given that it has been recently observed that a significant proportion of individuals with type 1 diabetes may have fatty liver [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20148" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic individuals with NAFLD, lipogenesis is elevated in subjects and contributes a substantial amount of FA to both VLDL- and intrahepatic-TG [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20149" pm="."><plain>By comparison, other FA sources may contribute to hepatic lipid accrual in type 1 diabetes, including adipose-derived free FA (FFA) and dietary-derived TG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20150" pm="."><plain>Plasma FFA concentrations were not measured in the present study, and is a limitation of this investigation, but has been previously shown to be elevated in type 1 diabetic individuals along with an impaired suppression of lipolysis with insulin administration [7], [8], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20151" pm="."><plain>Given the unpredictable nature of glycemic control and potential for insulin resistance (due to duration of diabetes and glycemic lability) in these individuals, it is likely that plasma FFA levels were elevated in these participants as well, contributing to FA flux to the liver and the elevation in postprandial plasma and VLDL TG levels noted here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20152" pm="."><plain>In addition, dietary fat intake was greater in the present diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20153" pm="."><plain>Therefore, primary sources of hepatic lipid in type 1 diabetic individuals are more likely to be derived from dietary fat and adipose lipolysis as opposed to lipogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20154" pm="."><plain>Ideally, a multiple stable isotope approach [3] to label various FA sources (lipogenesis, adipose, and dietary) could be utilized to determine the primary FA sources for VLDL- and intrahepatic-TG in type 1 diabetic subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20155" pm="."><plain>Advice for individuals with NAFLD and type 2 diabetes for the purposes of reducing hepatic lipid accrual and lipogenesis would be to reduce overall caloric intake, with a particular focus on simple sugars [38], [39]; however, this counseling is already provided to type 1 diabetic individuals for glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20156" pm="."><plain>Because lipogenesis does not appear to be elevated in the present cohort, clinical advice for managing lipid metabolism in type 1 diabetic patients could include modifying dietary intake to replace consumption of saturated fat with mono- and polyunsaturated fat which would be expected to have beneficial effects on insulin resistance and modify plasma, hepatic, and adipose fatty acid profiles. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20157" pm="."><plain>The greater intake of dietary fat compared to carbohydrate of the diabetic subjects could contribute to the low observed lipogenesis, as it is generally accepted that dietary fat suppresses while carbohydrate stimulates DNL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20158" pm="."><plain>However, if this were the case it would be expected that the control subjects would have had greater rates of lipogenesis compared to the diabetic subjects, given the higher habitual intake of carbohydrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20159" pm="."><plain>The relationship between carbohydrate intake and lipogenesis is contingent on the overall energy intake of the diet as well as the composition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20160" pm="."><plain>In healthy individuals, DNL is elevated when carbohydrate is consumed in excess of energy needs [40]–[42] or when carbohydrate provides a significantly high proportion of energy (e.g. ∼70–80% energy from CHO) [38], [41], [43], [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20161" pm="."><plain>However, the elevated DNL observed during high-carbohydrate feeding can be augmented by substituting simple carbohydrate for more complex forms, such as starch and fiber [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20162" pm="."><plain>DNL can also be stimulated in the acute setting by providing a high-carbohydrate test meal comprised of mostly simple sugars (e.g. 80–100% of energy as CHO) [46], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20163" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the test day meals used in the present study were similar in fat (as % energy) to the background diet of the diabetic subjects, but were greater than the background diet of the control subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20164" pm="."><plain>It is possible that lipogenesis in the control subjects may have been reduced as a function of the test day feeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20165" pm="."><plain>While it cannot be excluded, this is unlikely given that food quantity was provided in accordance with habitual overall energy intake, carbohydrate was provided in both simple and complex forms, and the difference in fat intake was likely not enough to significantly depress lipogenesis in these healthy subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20166" pm="."><plain>The limited time frame available for testing the diabetic subjects precluded standardization of food intake leading up to the testing period and is a limitation of this investigation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20169" pm="."><plain>The present study provides evidence that the rate of cholesterol synthesis in individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes is comparable to non-diabetic subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20170" pm="."><plain>The finding that cholesterol synthesis may be reduced or at least comparable to non-diabetic subjects is interesting given that the majority of individuals with type 1 diabetes are treated with statin medication aimed at reducing cholesterol synthesis [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20171" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, statin therapy may also upregulate intestinal absorption and synthesis [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20172" pm="."><plain>While we did not assess cholesterol absorption or the relationship between cholesterol absorption and synthesis, previous studies have suggested that type 1 diabetes have relatively reduced cholesterol synthesis but greater cholesterol absorption [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20173" pm="."><plain>If hepatic cholesterol synthesis in type 1 diabetes is comparable to healthy individuals, and if cholesterol absorption (and potentially intestinal cholesterol synthesis) are actually increased, perhaps a different treatment option targeting intestinal cholesterol regulation, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols, should be utilized in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20174" pm="."><plain>Because cholesterol absorption inhibitors may reciprocally increase hepatic cholesterol synthesis [49], a combination of both statins and ezetimibe or plant sterols may prove to be most effective in this population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20175" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a randomized double-blind parallel study of type 1 diabetic patients treated with statins found that the addition of plant sterols (contained in a food spread, providing 3 g/day plant sterols) further reduced serum cholesterol by 10%, LDL-c by 16%, and non-HDL-cholesterol by 15% with no effect on HDL-c [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20176" pm="."><plain>Further, one of cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of statins is the upregulation of LDL-receptors as compensation for reduced hepatic cholesterol synthesis [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20177" pm="."><plain>This feature of statins may be particularly important in type 1 diabetic individuals because evidence suggests there may be impaired lipoprotein clearance in these patients, supported here by the slightly elevated postprandial plasma TG levels at 6 and 8 h, and previous findings of elevated postprandial Apolipoprotein B48 levels in these patients, indicating impaired chylomicron clearance [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20178" pm="."><plain>Postprandial lipemia has been suggested to be particularly atherogenic in diabetes due to finding of greater remnant particle binding capacity to arterial proteins, leading to potentially greater arterial cholesterol deposition [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20179" pm="."><plain>Finally, given the poly-pharmacy and related financial burden already incurred by type 1 diabetic patients, a combination drug-dietary therapy, such as statins and plant sterols, may be ideal in this population [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20180" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present data suggests that pharmacological agents targeting cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols, may be more effective to reduce plasma cholesterol and reduce CVD risk in type 1 diabetic individuals than agents singularly targeting cholesterol synthesis, such as statins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20181" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of current clinical trials testing this hypothesis may provide answers (ClinicalTrials.gov registrations NCT00477204 and NCT00879710). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20182" pm="."><plain>In previous reports, cholesterol synthesis was lower in individuals with type 1 diabetes compared to both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20183" pm="."><plain>Discrepancies between the current report and previous investigations may be due to differences in methodology as well as patient selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20184" pm="."><plain>Previous reports used sterol markers to estimate cholesterol synthesis, which correlate with the deuterium method [55] but are limited to qualitative descriptions of cholesterol metabolism [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20185" pm="."><plain>Sterol markers were not measured in the present study, which is a limitation of this investigation, but would be advantageous to include in future studies to provide additional indicators of synthesis as well as absorption. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20186" pm="."><plain>A further difference between the present study and previous investigations is that subjects in previous studies tended to be younger (age ∼30) and have better glycemic control (A1c ranged 6–8%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20187" pm="."><plain>Finally, though not assessed in this study, it is becoming increasingly appreciated that subjects with type 1 diabetes may also be insulin resistant [7], a state which is associated with elevated cholesterol synthesis [16]–[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20188" pm="."><plain>Therefore, differences in glycemic control may underlie differences in the present observations, suggesting cholesterol synthesis may increase with worsening glycemic control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20189" pm="."><plain>However, further analysis by Gylling and colleagues suggested that improving A1c in diabetic subjects actually increased markers of cholesterol synthesis [56] and therefore this concept requires further investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20190" pm="."><plain>Despite the association of dietary saturated fat intake with plasma cholesterol levels, the effect of dietary fat on cholesterol synthesis in particular is more complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20191" pm="."><plain>In particular, there are few studies addressing how total dietary fat intake affects cholesterol synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20192" pm="."><plain>What has been shown is that significantly restricting total dietary fat intake (to 15% of calories) reduces cholesterol synthesis similar to that achieved by simple restriction of total energy intake (achieved through limiting primarily dietary carbohydrate) [57], whereas changing dietary fat composition appears to induce more apparent differences in cholesterogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20193" pm="."><plain>Specifically, cholesterol synthesis is higher following PUFA consumption, particularly for n-6 PUFA vs. n-3 PUFA, as compared to SFA and MUFA [58], [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20194" pm="."><plain>It is not clear whether the greater total dietary fat intake of the diabetic subjects in the present investigation affected the observed rate of cholesterol synthesis; however, the relative proportions of saturated to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat were similar between groups and therefore are unlikely to have impacted the observed findings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20195" pm="."><plain>In contrast to dietary fat, dietary cholesterol tends to have a neutral effect on cholesterol synthesis; however, increasing cholesterol intake can modestly reduce cholesterogenesis [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20196" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship between plasma cholesterol levels and synthesis has been reported previously [61] and appears to be especially important in individuals who have lower rates of synthesis; these individuals tend to exhibit the largest increase in plasma cholesterol after a dietary cholesterol challenge which suggests a greater role for cholesterol absorption in these individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20197" pm="."><plain>The present findings do not suggest reduced cholesterol synthesis compared to non-diabetic individuals, but synthesis was observed to be inversely related to dietary cholesterol intake in the type 1 diabetic subjects; this finding would support the potential for elevated cholesterol absorption. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20200" pm="."><plain>As described previously, the effect of statins to reduce cholesterol synthesis is abolished by as early as 3 days after statins are ceased [26]; by comparison, LDL-cholesterol levels may not return to statin-naïve levels by 7 days of statin washout [26], [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20201" pm="."><plain>Total and LDL-cholesterol levels from patient histories were significantly higher at time of testing, but it is not possible to determine if LDL-c levels would have increased further after a longer washout period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20202" pm="."><plain>This may explain why plasma lipid levels were similar between the diabetic and control subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20203" pm="."><plain>However, diabetic individuals frequently have cholesterol levels comparable to non-diabetic individuals [1]; therefore it is unlikely that LDL-c levels in our diabetic subjects have been grossly underestimated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20211" pm="."><plain>Second, the finding of cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels in type 1 diabetic individuals with poor glycemic control that are comparable to healthy non-diabetic individuals suggests that the routine use of statin medication for CVD reduction in this group should be evaluated within the context of other treatment options available which may instead modify cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe or plant sterols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20212" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the data indicates that metabolic risk in type 1 diabetic subjects may be beneficially managed by a combination of dietary and pharmaceutical interventions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20213" pm="."><plain>Future research is required to delineate the possible interplay of lipogenesis, free fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in this group, as well as the investigation of alternative cholesterol-lowering treatments in this group for prophylaxis of vascular disease. </plain></SENT>
