</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20314" pm="."><plain>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20315" pm="."><plain>Treatment of PD is complex due to the progressive nature and array of motor and non-motor features of the disease, and the early and late side effects associated with therapeutic interventions [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20316" pm="."><plain>Levodopa is still the most potent symptomatic drug for PD [3]; however, guidelines recommend initial treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist (particularly in young-onset patients) to avoid the development of motor complications associated with long-term levodopa use [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20317" pm="."><plain>Dopamine receptor agonists are also recommended as the first-line treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20318" pm="."><plain>Rotigotine, the levorotatory enantiomer of racemic aminotetralin, is a novel non-ergolinic dopamine receptor agonist with preferential binding to D3, D2, and D1 receptor subtypes [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20319" pm="."><plain>Rotigotine has been incorporated into a silicone-based transdermal patch that provides continuous drug delivery and stable plasma concentrations when the patch is replaced once every 24 h [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20320" pm="."><plain>Following application, approximately half of the administered rotigotine dose (46 %) is systemically absorbed [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20321" pm="."><plain>Rotigotine is rapidly metabolized, mainly by conjugation (sulfation and glucuronidation) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20322" pm="."><plain>The terminal elimination half-life (t½) of unconjugated rotigotine is 5.4 h [10] and of conjugated rotigotine is approximately 10 h [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20323" pm="."><plain>A second pathway is the formation of inactive N-desalkyl metabolites with subsequent conjugation [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20324" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of rotigotine in the treatment of early PD [12–14], advanced PD [15–17], and RLS [18–20] has been demonstrated in randomized placebo-controlled trials and rotigotine is approved for the treatment of PD and RLS in Europe and the USA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20325" pm="."><plain>The efficacy and tolerability of rotigotine have mainly been investigated in Caucasian subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20326" pm="."><plain>Various factors including differences in height, body weight, genetic polymorphism in drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2C9, and enzyme, transporter and receptor saturation, may influence pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rotigotine in subjects of different ethnic origin [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20327" pm="."><plain>The route of administration also plays a role and ethnic differences may not be relevant if the drug is applied transdermally [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20328" pm="."><plain>Many physicians prescribe medications at lower doses when treating Asian patients with PD [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20329" pm="."><plain>For example, subtherapeutic doses of the dopamine receptor agonist pergolide are commonly used in clinical practice in Japan; although doses of up to 1.25 mg/day are recommended for Japanese patients, many receive just 0.6 mg/day [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20330" pm="."><plain>It is important that potential pharmacokinetic differences are considered when determining dose adjustments for different ethnic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20331" pm="."><plain>To compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of rotigotine in subjects of different ethnic origin, the administration of a single transdermal patch (delivering 2 mg/24 h) in healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects was investigated in this open-label phase I clinical study (NCT01761526). </plain></SENT>
