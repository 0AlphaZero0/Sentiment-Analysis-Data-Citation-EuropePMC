</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20560" pm="."><plain>Gut–blood barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20561" pm="."><plain>It is associated with translocation of microbial products, thereby contributing to the systemic immune activation seen in patients living with HIV-1 [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20562" pm="."><plain>In diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, bacterial flagellin has been pinpointed to be of major pathogenetic importance, and high plasma levels of immunoglobulins (IgG) directed towards this bacterial antigen are present [3–5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20563" pm="."><plain>We and others have reported increased plasma levels of microbial translocated products in patients living with HIV-1 who live in high-income countries, which decrease during antiretroviral therapy (ART) [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20564" pm="."><plain>Also, we have suggested that various drug combinations may have different outcomes in terms of improvement of the microbial translocation (MT) markers in patients living with HIV-1 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20565" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the role of MT in the HIV epidemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains controversial and not well studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20566" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that MT is important for HIV disease progression in Africa [9], but this has been disputed [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20567" pm="."><plain>Also, increased MT has been reported in South African subjects before ART, but it remained elevated during efficient therapy [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20568" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain more knowledge about MT in LMICs, we sought to evaluate to which extent Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients living with HIV-1 demonstrate higher levels of biomarkers for MT and if efficient ART influenced these levels in the Vietnamese patients. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><SecTag type="TABLE"></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="20816" pm="."><plain>In all groups, the levels of anti-flagellin IgG, LPS and sCD14 were significantly higher than in matched HIV-negative controls (data not shown; p&lt;0.001 for all). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20817" pm="."><plain>When baseline anti-flagellin IgG levels were compared between the groups using a bivariate analysis, the level in Swedish patients was lower than in both Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients living with HIV (p&lt;0.0001 for both). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20818" pm="."><plain>Vietnamese patients also had lower levels of anti-flagellin IgG as compared to Ethiopian patients (p=0.007) (Figure 4A). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20821" pm="."><plain>In terms of LPS levels, there was no statistically significant difference between Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients; Swedish patients living with HIV-1 had significantly lower levels of LPS as compared to Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients (p&lt;0.0001 for both). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20822" pm="."><plain>In the multivariable analysis, the age, sex and CD4+ T-cell adjusted differences in all three markers between the groups still persisted, except for the sCD14 differences between Swedish and Ethiopians. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20824" pm="."><plain>The Swedish patients were chosen as a reference category, because the Ethiopian patients had a significantly higher expected value of anti-flagellin antibodies (Coeff.=0.54, 95% CI: 0.37–0.72), as did the Vietnamese patients (Coeff.=0.43, 95% CI: 0.20–0.67). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20825" pm="."><plain>The estimated sCD14 levels were significantly higher in Vietnamese patients (p&lt;0.0001, Coeff.=2,344,373, 95% CI: 1,778,541–2,910,204) as compared to the Swedes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20826" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the sCD14 difference between the Swedish and Ethiopian groups was lost and was not statistically significant upon multivariate analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20827" pm="."><plain>In terms of the LPS, the levels were still significantly higher in both Ethiopian (p&lt;0.001) and Vietnamese (p&lt;0.001) patients as compared to the Swedes: choosing Swedish patients as a reference category, the Ethiopian patients had a significant higher expected value of LPS (Coeff.= 140, 95% CI: 122–156), as did the Vietnamese patients (Coeff.=146, 95% CI: 127–164). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20831" pm="."><plain>The present study of patients living with HIV-1 from Vietnam and Ethiopia gives support to the view that MT is an important feature of the HIV-1 disease in LMICs [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20832" pm="."><plain>Thus, the levels of anti-flagellin IgG, LPS and sCD14 were increased in the patients living with HIV-1 from both Vietnam and Ethiopia as compared to HIV-negative controls from the same geographical regions and socioeconomic grouping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20833" pm="."><plain>Also, patients living with HIV-1 from Vietnam and Ethiopia had higher levels of anti-flagellin IgG and LPS as compared to patients living in Sweden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20834" pm="."><plain>It can be argued that significant differences existed in, for example, CD4+ T-cells between the patients from the different countries, but the differences also persisted after multivariate analysis (adjusted for age, sex and CD4+ T-cells). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20835" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible that these differences are related to other factors such as different compositions of the gut microbiota and the food intake, poorer hygiene and sanitation and/or frequent exposure to other gastrointestinal infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20836" pm="."><plain>Also, another factor that may play an important role for these differences is the viral clade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20837" pm="."><plain>It is not unreasonable to assume that clade diversity may play an important role in HIV immune activation as a result of MT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20838" pm="."><plain>Since the viral heterogeneity in our cohorts was limited, the present study did not allow us to evaluate the impact of subtypes on MT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20839" pm="."><plain>However, it is worth exploring further, and we aim to investigate this aspect in the future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20840" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of MT are likely to result in differences in immune activation and thereby to have a profound effect on the host immune profiles afflicting patients living with HIV-1 in LMICs [10, 13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20841" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the LPS and anti-flagellin levels, the sCD14 level was highest in the Vietnamese patients, which could be related to the fact that 30% of them were co-infected with TB, which was not the case for the Ethiopian and Swedish patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20842" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, Toossi et al. found that the level of sCD14 in Ugandan patients living with both HIV and TB was higher than in subjects living with HIV only [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20843" pm="."><plain>It is well established that effective ART reduces MT and immune activation in patients living with HIV-1 who live in high-income countries [1, 16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20844" pm="."><plain>The knowledge concerning patients from LMICs is limited to one South African study reporting that increased MT was found before ART and that it decreased but remained elevated during efficient therapy [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20845" pm="."><plain>In our study, the Vietnamese patients, in whom we had follow-up samples, had undetectable virus after two years of ART [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20846" pm="."><plain>A concomitant decrease in the MT markers was seen, suggesting that ART improves the gut–blood barrier damage also found in patients from these surroundings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20847" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of the Vietnamese patients (n=24) had been treated for two months with tuberculostatics with efficient response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20848" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that these patients had lower anti-flagellin IgG and a tendency to lower LPS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20849" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that antibiotics decrease the MT in monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus [18], and we have reported that a similar effect is seen in humans living with HIV-1 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20850" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible that the tuberculostatics had induced changes in the gut microbiota, resulting in a decreased MT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20851" pm="."><plain>We therefore recommend that any ongoing antibiotic treatment should be considered when MT is studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20852" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the sCD14 level was higher than in the patients without tuberculostatics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20853" pm="."><plain>It is not unlikely that this discrepancy is related to an increased immune activation seen due to remaining disease activity of the TB, since the TB treatment had been given for only two months. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20854" pm="."><plain>Also, we cannot exclude that the increased immune activation was related to other ongoing subclinical OIs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20855" pm="."><plain>Thus, sCD14 is a biomarker not only for MT but also for other immune activation processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20856" pm="."><plain>We also analyzed the association between the biomarkers and the clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20857" pm="."><plain>As expected, a higher viral load and lower CD4+ T-cells correlated to an increased mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20858" pm="."><plain>Also, the results were consistent with earlier reports noting that higher levels of sCD14 are associated with a poorer clinical outcome [19, 20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20859" pm="."><plain>Consistently, patients who did not develop a new OI or died had significantly lower levels of LPS, anti-flagellin IgG as well as sCD14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20860" pm="."><plain>This finding is in line with the possibility that a more pronounced MT may lead to increased immune activation with an associated poorer immunological response to other infections, including OIs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="20861" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that treatment-naïve Vietnamese and Ethiopian patients living with HIV have elevated biomarkers of MT as compared to HIV-negative controls from the same geographical regions and also compared to patients living in Sweden. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20862" pm="."><plain>Also, in the Vietnamese patients the MT was reduced following 2 years of ART. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20863" pm="."><plain>Further investigations of the role of MT in patients living with HIV from LMICs can contribute to an increased understanding of the HIV disease in such countries. </plain></SENT>
