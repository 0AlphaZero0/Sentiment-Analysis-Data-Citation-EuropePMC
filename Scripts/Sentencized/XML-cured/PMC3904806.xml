</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20897" pm="."><plain>Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma, which is the commonest cause of irreversible blindness worldwide (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20898" pm="."><plain>Globally, 60 million people are affected of whom 8.4 million are blind in both eyes (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20899" pm="."><plain>Before this end stage there is a greater risk of falls (3), fractures (4) and motor vehicle collisions (5). <p><text><SENT sid="20900" pm="."><plain>The link between high IOP and glaucoma is clearly seen when there is a readily identifiable cause for raised IOP such as trauma, inflammation, dysgenesis or obstruction of the aqueous humour drainage system in the trabecular meshwork of the iridocorneal angle by iris tissue, pigment or other deposits (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20901" pm="."><plain>It is also evident even when there is no clear cause or obstruction of the iridocorneal angle. Glaucoma occurring under these latter conditions is known as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, causing the greatest burden of disease (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20903" pm="."><plain>The risk of developing POAG is approximately five times higher in subjects with IOPs above the population 95th centile than in subjects with lower IOPs (7); the higher the IOP at screening, the greater the risk of POAG (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20904" pm="."><plain>Both mean and maximum IOP have been reported as closely associated with visual field deterioration (8–15) and optic nerve damage (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20905" pm="."><plain>In a group of subjects affected by POAG despite untreated IOPs below the population 95th centile (‘normal pressure’ glaucoma), worse visual field damage was found in the eye with the higher IOP (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20906" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IOP is currently the only modifiable risk factor for POAG. Therapeutic lowering of intraocular pressure reduces the risk of developing glaucoma (18) and retards disease progression (19–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20908" pm="."><plain>In addition to inherent interest, and its role as a modifiable trait on the causal path to disease, the known heterogeneity of POAG means that a focus on the genetic basis of IOP may be more powerful than studies of POAG directly (22,23). <p><text><SENT sid="20909" pm="."><plain>Heritability estimates for adult IOP range from 0.29 to 0.62 (24–28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20910" pm="."><plain>To date, two regions have been reported to be robustly associated with IOP as a result of linkage analyses, one at 10q22 from a Tasmanian glaucoma pedigree (29) and one at 5q22 in a West African cohort (30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20911" pm="."><plain>A recent Dutch genome-wide association study (GWAS) for IOP (31) also found two associated loci, one of which (TMCO1) overlaps with a previously published POAG GWAS locus (32). <p><text><SENT sid="20912" pm="."><plain>Further elucidation of the genetic basis of IOP would aid in understanding the biology of a major blinding disease (POAG), in risk stratification for development and progression of the disease and in providing therapeutic targets. In order to identify genomic variants that contribute to the determination of IOP, we performed a GWAS as a component of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) (http://www.wtccc.org.uk/ccc2/). </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="RESULTS"><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title><text><SENT sid="20914" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20916" pm="."><plain>Genotype imputation was performed in all 2302 individuals passing genotype quality control (QC) using IMPUTE2 (33) and the 1000 Genomes reference panel (34) (see Materials and Methods and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt293/-/DC1">Supplementary material online</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20917" pm="."><plain>SNPs with low imputation quality (info &lt; 0.7) (35) were excluded, resulting in 6 235 970 SNPs on chromosomes 1–22 which passed QC. <p><text><SENT sid="20918" pm="."><plain>For each individual, the mean IOP between their two eyes was calculated. If an individual had undergone surgery or treatment to an eye, data from that eye were excluded. If the difference in IOP between an individual's two eyes was &gt;10 mmHg, the individual was excluded. Eight outlying individuals whose measurements did not conform to a normal distribution were also removed (see Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20922" pm="."><plain>After genotype and phenotype QC, a total of 2175 samples were available for analysis. <p><text><SENT sid="20923" pm="."><plain>A linear regression fitting an additive model was performed in SNPTEST (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/snptest/snptest.html), where genotype, accounting for imputation uncertainty, was set as the explanatory variable and mean IOP as the response variable (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20924" pm="."><plain>Age and sex were included as continuous and categorical covariates, respectively. This analysis will be referred to as the primary scan.

<SENT sid="20932" pm="."><plain>Two platforms were used for the first phase of replication; genotypes for four SNPs were taken from the custom built Immunochip (36) (see Materials and Methods), and genotypes for the other 27 SNPs were obtained from a Sequenom plex. Results from discovery and replication were combined using a fixed effects meta-analysis by averaging the estimated effect size parameter across the data sets, weighting by the inverse of the variance in the estimates. <p><text><SENT sid="20934" pm="."><plain>For the first phase of replication, we used individuals from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk cohort (see Materials and Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20935" pm="."><plain>Following QC, data were available for 2833 individuals genotyped on Sequenom and 2493 individuals genotyped on Immunochip (all with age, sex and mean IOP data) with 2461 individuals overlapping between the Sequenom and Immunochip replication cohorts. <p><text><SENT sid="20936" pm="."><plain>The results from our data at SNPs previously found to be associated with glaucoma (32,37–39) or IOP (31) are shown in Table 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20938" pm="."><plain>An SNP in TMCO1 (rs7555523), which has been associated with IOP (31) showed evidence for association with mean IOP in both our discovery (P = 0.0303) and replication data (P = 1.70 × 10−3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20946" pm="."><plain>The concordance between the imputed and genotyped calls was 0.96 (eight out of 214 discordant calls) and the correlation was 0.87, suggesting the imputation at this locus is acceptable.

<SENT sid="20952" pm="."><plain>Two SNPs at 11p12 (rs10430986 and rs12222492) showed suggestive evidence for association in the same direction as the discovery data (P = 0.07, P = 0.11), although data were not available for the top SNP in the region (11-41102934). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20953" pm="."><plain>This locus may be worth additional investigation. <p><text><SENT sid="20954" pm="."><plain>A second round of replication of the 7p21 association was next attempted in 2033 individuals from TwinsUK (40), in which the genotypes at rs59072263 were imputed. The SNP had a one-sided P-value of 0.053 assuming the same risk allele as the discovery, giving combined evidence across the three cohorts of P = 1.10 × 10−8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/hmg/ddt293/-/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>), where the G allele is associated with an IOP increase of 0.45 mmHg (95% CI = 0.30–0.61 mmHg). <p><text><SENT sid="20956" pm="."><plain>Replication of the signal of association at 7p21 was also assessed in the large Dutch meta-analysis (31) of IOP comprising 9680 individuals of European ancestry. The associated SNP rs59072263 was not genotyped in this study, but the best available tag (rs6959703; genotype correlation, r2 = 0.61) showed a one-sided P-value = 0.017. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20958" pm="."><plain>Imputation of genotypes by the Rotterdam group at rs59072263, using MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) and the 1000 Genomes data, was also attempted but showed weaker evidence of association (one-sided P-value = 0.178), However, unlike the discovery data and TwinsUK data, which had imputation accuracy (‘IMPUTE info’ and ‘MACH r2’, respectively) of 0.95 and 0.89 at rs59072263, the largest component of the Dutch meta-analysis, comprising almost two-thirds of the study, had MACH r2 &lt; 0.75. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20959" pm="."><plain>Therefore, particularly in light of the clear replication at the best genotyped tag SNP, the lack of replication in the imputed data at P &lt; 0.05 may be due in part to the loss of statistical power which results from the increased noise (imputation uncertainty) in the inferred genotypes (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20960" pm="."><plain>We note that the risk allele is the same in all three replication cohorts. <p><text><SENT sid="20961" pm="."><plain>We also undertook a pathway analysis of SNPs with P &lt; 10−4 (see Materials and Methods), but this failed to pinpoint any pathways with a compelling biological connection to IOP biology. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="DISCUSS"><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title><text><SENT sid="20962" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="20963" pm="."><plain>We have thus identified a novel association between a region on chromosome 7p21 and mean IOP. Since IOP is on the causal pathway to glaucoma, this association is also relevant for susceptibility to glaucoma. The most associated SNP in this region is flanked by two genes, ICA1 and GLCCI1, both of which have been shown to be expressed in the human eye (information from the EMBL-EBI website, see http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/). ICA1 encodes a protein involved in the regulation of secretory vesicle trafficking (42) and has been implicated as an auto-antigen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (43) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20966" pm="."><plain>Vesicular metabolism pathways have previously been ascribed a role in the pathobiology of POAG: a case–control GWAS of POAG found associations with the CAV1 and CAV2 genes which control vesicle transport in transcytosis mechanisms (39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20967" pm="."><plain>The latter mediate drainage of aqueous humour from the eye and it is recognized that increased IOP results from a failure of drainage rather than an overproduction of aqueous humour. <p><text><SENT sid="20968" pm="."><plain>The GLCCI1 gene has been ascribed a role in the sensitivity of various tissues to glucocorticoids, initially thymoma cell lines (45) and recently in the degree of response to glucocorticoid therapy in asthma (46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20969" pm="."><plain>The variant associated with glucocorticoid therapy in asthma (46) was not associated with IOP in our discovery (P = 0.8), and was not in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the IOP associated variant we identified (r2 = 0.114 in the 1000 Genomes data). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20970" pm="."><plain>Topical glucocorticoid therapy causes raised IOP in susceptible individuals (47) and the likelihood of such an IOP response is greater in POAG patients, POAG suspects and first-degree relatives of POAG patients (48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20971" pm="."><plain>The BMES has previously reported an association between use of inhaled corticosteroids and a finding of elevated IOP or glaucoma in subjects with a glaucoma family history (49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20972" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with POAG have elevated blood (50–54) and aqueous humour (52) levels of the endogenous glucocorticoid cortisol compared with age-matched normal subjects. The first glaucoma gene identified, MYOC (55), was a glaucoma candidate gene because of its glucocorticoid inducibility (56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20974" pm="."><plain>It is thus plausible that GLCCI1 may influence IOP via the response to endogenous cortisol. <p><text><SENT sid="20975" pm="."><plain>The effect size of the novel associated SNP we report (Table 2) is substantially higher than that of previously reported SNPs for IOP (beta = 0.45 for rs59072263 when compared with 0.19 for rs11656696 and 0.28 for rs7555523). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20976" pm="."><plain>We can get some indication of the possible consequences of the SNP on POAG, based on its measured effect for IOP, from population studies which relate changes in IOP to POAG risk. This approach suggests that each copy of the G allele at rs59072263 gives an expected odds ratio for POAG of 1.08 (57) and, in untreated glaucoma (in our discovery cohort, in common with other cohorts from the developed world, over 50% of glaucoma was undiagnosed at initial ascertainment) (58), each copy of the allele gives an extra 6% likelihood of significant deterioration in vision (59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20978" pm="."><plain>The novel associated SNP has a higher risk allele frequency (RAF) than previously reported SNPs (RAF = 0.88 for rs59072263 when compared with 0.58 for rs11656696 and 0.12 for rs7555523) so a higher proportion of our cohort will carry at least one potentially deleterious allele.
