<SENT sid="21253" pm="."><plain>Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21254" pm="."><plain>In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="21256" pm="."><plain>Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21257" pm="."><plain>The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21262" pm="."><plain>According to the WHO, 3% of the global population is infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with 3–4 million people newly infected each year [1]–[4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21263" pm="."><plain>Most HCV infections persist, with up to 80% of all cases leading to chronic hepatitis associated with liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [5]–[7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21264" pm="."><plain>A combinatorial treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) provides good clinical efficacy in patients infected with genotypes (GTs) 2 and 3 but is less efficacious in patients infected with the most prevalent GT-1b, thereby emphasizing the urgent need for more effective specifically targeted antiviral therapies for GT-1b [8]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21265" pm="."><plain>The HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an essential enzyme that lacks proofreading activity, thus leading to a population of distinctive but closely related viral variants, termed viral quasispecies, within an infected individual [12]–[14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21266" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of the diversity of HCV quasispecies is important for the prediction of liver disease progression as well as HCV treatment outcomes [15]–[19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21267" pm="."><plain>Currently, studies regarding HCV quasispecies mainly focus on structural genomic regions; therefore, relatively limited data are available regarding nonstructural regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21268" pm="."><plain>Recently, variations in the nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein, particularly in specific codons, were reported to be positively related to a sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) of patients infected with GT-1b [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21269" pm="."><plain>It was also reported that the SVR rate in patients with HCV GT-1b treated with PEG-IFN plus RBV are higher in Asian patients as compared with Caucasians [10], [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21270" pm="."><plain>In particular, previous studies have shown that SVR rates in Korea patients infected with GT-1b range from 56% to 62% [21], [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21271" pm="."><plain>Recently, two SNPs, rs12979860 and rs8099917 of the IL28B gene, showing the strongest association with treatment response, have been reported at a high frequency in Korean patients with HCV GT-1b compared to the frequencies of other ethnic groups [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21272" pm="."><plain>Although prior investigations can partly explain the high SVR rates in Korean patients, other mechanisms may also contribute to this effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21273" pm="."><plain>In the present study, to address this issue, we investigated via quasispecies analysis the mutation frequencies and patterns in the partial NS5B from Korean patients infected with HCV GT-1b, as these are known to be related to the SVR rates, </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="21681" pm="."><plain>Notably, the coexistence of Q and R at codon 309, located in one of the CD8+ T cell epitopes (aa 308 and 315), was found in all 15 Korean subjects via a quasispecies distribution analysis; this may be due to the distinct CD8+ T cell immune pressure against a region between aa 308 and 315 among Koreans (Table S6). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="21686" pm="."><plain>The presence of distinct HLA types among an ethnic group could lead to distinct MHC class I or II restricted immune pressures within its population [37], [43], [44], [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21687" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the frequency and patterns of escape variants against structural and nonstructural HCV proteins reflect the background HLA types among an ethnic group [48], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21688" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study is to investigate the background mutation frequency and patterns of HCV NS5B, reportedly related to a high SVR, from treatment-naïve Korean patients chronically infected with GT-1b in an effort to explain the high SVR in Korean patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21689" pm="."><plain>The significant findings of this study are discussed below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21690" pm="."><plain>First, the entire mutation frequency in the sequenced NS5B region was positively correlated with Cs but not with patients showing disease progression (CH, LC and HCC) [C (2.8%) vs. CH + LC + HCC (2.2%), p = 0.002]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21691" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, similar mutation frequencies were noted within both the CD4+ (p = 0.001) and CD8+ T cell epitope regions (p = 0.05) (Table 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21692" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the accumulation of multiple mutations in NS5B may be induced by vigorous and multi-specific immune pressure in the HCV-acute infection phase and may lead to the functional abnormality of HCV RdRp activity, resulting in the attenuation of HCV pathogenic potentials [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21693" pm="."><plain>This strongly supports previous results which showed that mutations in NS5B were related to the high SVR and EVR of GT-1b chronically infected patients [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21694" pm="."><plain>Second, a pronounced dN frequency in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes in the NS5B region [Korean (4.5%) vs. those of patients from other countries (2.1%), p = 0.001], particularly in the mutational hotspot [Korean (6.4%) vs. other countries (3.1%), p = 0.01], was found in Korean patients but not in patients from other areas (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21695" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there is distinct intrahepatic MHC class II restricted immune pressure at least against HCV NS5B among the Korean population [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21696" pm="."><plain>Broadly directed virus-specific immune pressure at the CD4+ T cell level was recently reported to play a very pivotal role in spontaneous resolution at a very early phase of HCV-acute infection [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21697" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the presence of the multi-specific CD4+ T cell response against HCV can aid not only the induction of a vigorous antiviral CD8+ T cell response but also antibody production for the inhibition of the spread of the virus [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21698" pm="."><plain>Particularly, because three codons (A333, V338 and Q355) out of four reported to be related to the high SVR are located in the mutational hotspot, the acquisition of mutations within this region induced by the distinctive Korean immune pressure at the CD4+ T cell level may contribute to the high SVR found in Korean patients infected with GT-1b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21699" pm="."><plain>In fact, the prediction of the MHC class II HLA allele showed that a region of the CD4+ T cell epitope from NS5B, covering aa 333 to 347, one of two predicted epitopes comprising the mutational hotspot, has high binding affinity for most HLA DRB1 alleles prevalent in Korean populations [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21700" pm="."><plain>In addition, HLA DQB1 03:01 and 03:02, prevalent at frequencies higher than 10% in Koreans, also are noted to be associated with viral clearance [53]–[55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21701" pm="."><plain>Our previous study also showed that there are distinct mutation patterns and a very high mutation frequency of the CD4+ T cell epitopes of the HBV preC/Core region in chronic Korean patients, strongly supporting the hypothesis of this study [56]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21702" pm="."><plain>Third, the frequency of dN within the CD8+ T cell epitope region of NS5B was significantly higher than that outside the CD8+ T cell epitope region [inside CD8+ (2.9%) vs. outside (2.3%), p = 0.001], suggesting the presence of immune pressure at the CD8+ T cell level against HCV NS5B among Korean patients, as shown in patients from other areas (Table 3) [37], [44], [47], [57]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21703" pm="."><plain>However, pronounced differences in the mutation frequency between six regions of CD8+ T cell epitopes were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21704" pm="."><plain>Two of the six CD8+ T cell epitopes (308 to 315 aa and 451 to 459) with high binding affinity to two HLA allele types, HLA-A02:01 and HLA-A24:02, prevalent in Koreans, showed a higher dN frequency compared to other epitopes [308–315: 96 (7.2%) and 451–459: 49 (3.3%)], suggesting the presence of distinct MHC class I restricted immune pressure in Korean patients [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21705" pm="."><plain>Particularly, it is noteworthy that the extraordinary high dN/dS ratio (2.04) found in a region of the CD8+ T cell epitope covering codons 308 to 315, was mainly due to the presence of frequent mutations in codon 309, one of four codons related to SVR rates (Table S4, Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21706" pm="."><plain>The mutation type, Q309R, is known to be frequently mutated in NS5B, particularly in Asian patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21707" pm="."><plain>However, even compared to Japanese patients, also an Asian country like Korea, the strikingly high mutation frequency of Q309R was observed in only the Korean patients [15], [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21708" pm="."><plain>All of the 15 patients harbored this mutation in their quasispecies distribution and more than half (96/166, 57.8%) of all quasispecies from the 15 patients had the mutation type R309. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21709" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the co-existence of both mutated and wild types, not exclusive of the existence of one type alone, was found in all 15 patients, suggesting the advantage of the coexistence of two variants in a patient over the exclusive existence of either type alone in an escape of host immune surveillance or viral fitness (Table S6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21710" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the high frequency of the Q309R mutation in Korean patients may be induced by CD8+ T cell immune pressure which may in part provide a likely explanation for the high SVR rates in Koreans. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21711" pm="."><plain>Finally, it is well known that mutations in NS5B can affect the HCV replication capacity [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21712" pm="."><plain>We found a total of three types of mutations (C316N, Q355K/R and E464Q) which had a significant effect on HCV replication (Cq value: C316N and E464Q p = 0.033, Q355K/R p = 0.003) (Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21713" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our quasispecies analysis showed that two polymorphisms in aa 316, C316 and N316, were strongly related to two polymorphisms in codon 464, Q464 and E464, respectively, in an exclusive manner (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21714" pm="."><plain>The type with both C316 and Q464 signatures showed a significantly higher HCV replication capacity and was more related to patients with advanced liver disease compared to the type with both the N316 and E464 signatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21715" pm="."><plain>The exclusive combination of the SNPs of two codons may be due to the structural constraint of NS5B. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21716" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the coexistence of both types (C316/Q464 and N316/E464) was not found in any patients, suggesting that these two types may be from completely different resources and not a different quasispecies version induced by immune pressure from a patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21717" pm="."><plain>Our data showing phylogenetic segregation between the two types also supports the above hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21718" pm="."><plain>Our study has three potential limitations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21719" pm="."><plain>First, the nested PCR protocol used in this study showed low sensitivity, with the amplification of only 23 samples out of 73 samples (31.5%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21720" pm="."><plain>The strategies for the nested PCR protocol including primer sets and a PCR condition should be modified in the future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21721" pm="."><plain>Particularly, PCR negative amplifications were found with high frequencies in samples with lower HCV viral loads, suggesting novel nested PCR protocol to increase the degree of sensitivity should be applied in a future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21722" pm="."><plain>Second, the modest population size (15 patients) is relatively small to lead to a meaningful conclusion about the relationship between NS5B mutations and liver disease progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21723" pm="."><plain>Third, as single-genome amplification and an end-point dilution strategy were not utilized, the cloning strategy employed in this study is limited when used to represent genuine viral quasispecies in serum samples. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="21724" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that the distinct MHC class II restricted immune pressure against HCV NS5B in Korean patients leads to a pronounced high mutation frequency and distinct mutation patterns in HCV NS5B in Korean patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21725" pm="."><plain>This finding provides important insight into the high SVR and ETR rates during the treatment of GT-1b infected Korean patients. </plain></SENT>
