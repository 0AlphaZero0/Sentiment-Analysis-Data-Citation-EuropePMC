The approach is applied to the conversion of chorismate to prephenate by Chorismate Mutase, where the substrate is treated at the MP2 level of theory while the rest of the system is treated at the RHF level. MP2 geometry optimization is found to lower the barrier by up to 3.5 kcal/mol compared to RHF optimzations and ONIOM energy refinement and leads to a smoother convergence with respect to the basis set for the reaction profile.

In the fragment molecular orbital method (FMO) [15]–[17] one does fragment calculations in the presence of the embedding potential of all the other fragments, whereas in the recently developed effective fragment molecular orbital method (EFMO) [18], [19] fragment polarizabilities are used instead to approximate the many-body polarization. <p><text><SENT sid="21827" pm="."><plain>For fast geometry optimizations, FMO with the frozen domain and dimers (FDD) [20] has been proposed and EFMO/FDD has been used to map the reaction path of the conversion of chorismate to prephanate in Chorismate Mutase at the RHF level for geometry optimization combined with ONIOM for energy refinement [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21828" pm="."><plain>Chorismate Mutase has also been studied extensively by many groups. Particularly, the group of Mulholland has invested considerable amount of resources to evaluate the catalytic effect of Chorismate Mutase [22]–[28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21830" pm="."><plain>Other related QM/MM work on Chorismate Mutase includes FMO energetics refinement by Ishida et al. [29] and the work of Claeyssens et al.[30] who used linear scaling coupled cluster methods to obtain the reaction barrier on structures optimized using a QM/MM approach with density functional theory used to describe the QM region. This study specifically underlines the importance of energy corrections at a correlated level of theory, which in turn requires reliable optimization of the molecular structure. Our recent study [21] emphasizes that in addition to a high quality energy evaluation on the reaction complex, a conformational sampling of the reaction complex geometry is needed in order to obtain a reliable energy barrier, since the reaction barrier can fluctuate by up to 15 kcal/mol between geometry optimizations on different starting conformations. <p><text><SENT sid="21833" pm="."><plain>Our previous methodology was to estimate the reaction barrier in Chorismate Mutase using an EFMO-RHF geometry optimization with an ONIOM MP2 energy correction [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21834" pm="."><plain>It was clear, however, that the RHF based optimization did not always lead to a reliable MP2 correction. For example, the MP2 energy did not converge in a smooth manner with respect to the basis set size. One likely explanation is, that it is in general not optimal to deal with reaction complexes for which the structure is calculated using an uncorrelated wave function method such as RHF. <p><text><SENT sid="21837" pm="."><plain>In this work, we have created a method to obtain a correlated (MP2 level) reaction complex geometry using the EFMO method on a large system, and show a calculation of the reaction barrier in Chorismate Mutase as an example. <p><text><SENT sid="21838" pm="."><plain>We extend EFMO/FDD to enable treatment of only one fragment at the MP2 level and show that it is a good compromise between efficiency and accuracy. Note that the effects of conformational sampling are not investigated in this paper. <p><text><SENT sid="21840" pm="."><plain>This paper is organized as follows: First we present the EFMO method and our extension to the EFMO energy and gradient. Second we compare our method to similar ONIOM calclations on the reaction barrier of the conversion of chorismate to prephanate in Chorismate Mutase. <sec id="s1a"><title><text><SENT sid="21842" pm="."><plain>Theory <p><text><SENT sid="21843" pm="."><plain>The basics of EFMO can be summarized as follows. The system is divided into fragments and we use the adaptive frozen orbital technique (AFO) [31] to treat fragment boundaries by freezing the molecular orbitals corresponding to detached covalent bonds. Ab initio calculations of fragments are carried out without embedding, and the total polarization is evaluated using fragment polarizabilities. In the next step, ab initio calculations of dimers are carried out to account for two-body quantum effects such as the charge transfer between fragment pairs within a cut-off distance, . </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="21850" pm="."><plain>Domain  is defined as all atoms having a frozen geometry and domain  is defined as all atoms whose positions are optimized. Each domain is further divided into a number of molecular fragments. In the frozen domain and dimers methods (FDD) [20], the domain with frozen geometry is further divided as a polarizable domain with frozen geometry,  and a domain with frozen geometry and fragment electron densities that are not updated after they have been calculated the first time. The EFMO energy [21] is then given by:(2)where  and  are the internal energies of domains  and , respectively,  is the interaction between domains  and ,  is the interaction between domains  and  and  is the classical total polarization energy of the whole system. In our EFMO-RHF:MP2 extension, we evaluate the internal energies of domain  and  at the RHF level. Furthermore, we specify a single fragment  (“high level”) from the active domain to be treated at the MP2 level of theory (see Fig. 1 for a schematic overview). </plain></SENT>

The ONIOM approach by Steinmann et al. found the reaction energy to be between −5.48 kcal/mol to −0.82 kcal/mol.

<SENT sid="21961" pm="."><plain>The large increase in calculation time from cc-pVDZ to cc-pVTZ was found to be due to sub-optimal load balancing in GDDI during the MP2 part of the calculation. Subsequently, one optimization using the cc-pVTZ was carried out, in which the calculation of the MP2 fragment energy and gradient was distributed across all 10 nodes. This reduced the average gradient step time from 18845 s to 10911 s. In other words, the slower calculation used 10 GDDI groups in the second (MP2) layer, whereas the faster one had 1 group, during the monomer step. The latter run is more efficient because the MP2 fragment was calculated by all 10 nodes, whereas in the former only by 1 node. <SecTag type="TABLE"><table-wrap id="pone-0088800-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0088800.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="21966" pm="."><plain>Timings for the average geometry optimization step for Chorismate Mutase using using different methods. </caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0088800-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0088800.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><text><SENT sid="21967" pm="."><plain>Method </plain></SENT>

At the EFMO-RHF/6-31G(d):MP2/cc-pVDZ level of theory, the method is about 2.5 times slower than the same calculation at the EFMO-RHF/6-31G(d) level. However, the use of a correlated method (MP2) in the optimization step substantially improves the calculated transition state compared to similar uncorrelated optimization with a subsequent MP2 ONIOM energy correction. <p><text><SENT sid="21987" pm="."><plain>The modest increase in computational cost compared to an similar uncorrelated calculation makes the presented method very attractive for cases where electron correlation is essential for a correct and reliable geometry optimization. The method is a special case within the FMO or EFMO approximations and thus requires no further approximations, such as those in the ONIOM method, and is carried out in a single calculation in the GAMESS program. <p><text><SENT sid="21989" pm="."><plain>The method is thus a general method to obtain geometry optimized correlated structures inside large molecular systems when using FMO or EFMO.
