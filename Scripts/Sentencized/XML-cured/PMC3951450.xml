Between 15–70% of reported cases are fatal. There is no approved vaccine available, and preclinical protection in vivo by an experimental vaccine has not been demonstrated previously. In the present study, the attenuated poxvirus vector, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, was used to develop a recombinant candidate vaccine expressing the CCHF virus glycoproteins. Cellular and humoral immunogenicity was confirmed in two mouse strains, including type I interferon receptor knockout mice, which are susceptible to CCHF disease. This vaccine protected all recipient animals from lethal disease in a challenge model adapted to represent infection via a tick bite. Histopathology and viral load analysis of protected animals confirmed that they had been exposed to challenge virus, even though they did not exhibit clinical signs. This is the first demonstration of efficacy of a CCHF vaccine. </p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Health Protection Agency (subsequently part of Public Health England) of the United Kingdom.

<SENT sid="22081" pm="."><plain>In 1969 it was recognised that the virus causing the disease was identical to a virus isolated in the Congo in 1956 [2], and the disease was subsequently renamed Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22082" pm="."><plain>The causative agent, CCHF virus (CCHFv), is a member of the Nairovirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. <p><text><SENT sid="22083" pm="."><plain>People may be infected with CCHFv by the bite of infected Ixodidae ticks, contamination with tick body contents, or direct contact with the blood, tissues or body fluids of infected human beings or animals. The most efficient and common tick vectors appear to be members of the Hyalomma genus, which commonly infest livestock and other animals. CCHF causes a severe human disease, with a fatality rate of 15–70% [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22086" pm="."><plain>Due to the haemorrhagic nature of the disease, it can also cause nosocomial infections of health-care workers [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22087" pm="."><plain>Although clinical predictors of mortality have been developed [5], correlates of protection are not fully understood. Detectable antibody responses are usually required for survival, but are not predictive of recovery [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22089" pm="."><plain>Therefore it is likely that both antibody and CD8-positive T lymphocytes are required for protection. <p><text><SENT sid="22090" pm="."><plain>CCHF is endemic in many countries in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and southern Africa, and it is an increasing problem for Western Europe, including popular tourism destinations such as Greece and Turkey [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22091" pm="."><plain>The incidence and geographic range of CCHF is increasing, and non-endemic countries are also at risk from imported cases; in October 2012, a fatal case of CCHF occurred in a traveller returning to the UK from Afghanistan [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22092" pm="."><plain>Additionally, concerns over the potential use of CCHFv as a bioterrorism agent have led to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to list the virus as a Category C priority pathogen. Due to the severity of disease, ease of transmission, and the fact that no antiviral compounds or vaccines have been proven to be effective against it, CCHFv is classified as a hazard group 4 pathogen by the UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. <p><text><SENT sid="22094" pm="."><plain>Progress with CCHFv research has been severely hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model. Newborn mice succumb to infection [9], but due to their immature immune systems, they cannot be used for assessing vaccine efficacy. Recently, however, adult small animal models have been developed, using mice deficient in the type I interferon (IFN) signalling pathway, either in the type I IFN receptor (IFNα/βR) [10], [11] or in STAT-1 [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22097" pm="."><plain>CCHFv infection in IFNα/βR-knockout mice replicates human disease via a variety of inoculation routes, including subcutaneous injection which is intended to mimic human infection by tick bite [11]. <p><text><SENT sid="22098" pm="."><plain>A vaccine based on CCHFv, amplified in suckling mouse brain and inactivated by chloroform treatment, has been used in Eastern Europe, but is unlicensed by the European Medicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration. A recent study found that it elicited both a cellular and humoral response to CCHFv, but neutralising antibody titres were low, even in people who had received 4 doses [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22100" pm="."><plain>Controlled studies on protective efficacy have not been reported with this vaccine and, due to its crude preparation, it is unlikely to gain widespread international regulatory approval. Development of a vaccine that meets current international standards is needed. The genome of CCHFv is distributed over three RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the viral nucleoprotein, glycoprotein and RNA polymerase, respectively. The M segment is approximately 5.4 kbp in length and encodes a polyprotein precursor that undergoes proteolytic cleavage events [14], [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22104" pm="."><plain>It contains a single open reading frame of 1685 residues (in strain IbAr10200), which is processed into mature glycoproteins GN and GC, and three other domains of as-yet unknown function: a variable mucin-like domain, a GP38 domain, and an NSm domain. The GN and GC glycoproteins of CCHFv bind target cells and influence infectivity [16] and cell tropism, and are the targets for neutralising antibodies [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22106" pm="."><plain>Virus entry is thought to be primarily mediated by GC, which binds the proposed virus receptor human cell surface nucleolin [18]. <p><text><SENT sid="22107" pm="."><plain>Recent vaccine approaches for CCHF include a DNA-based vaccine expressing the CCHFv M segment, which induced neutralising antibodies in approximately half of vaccinated mice, but the lack of a challenge model at the time meant efficacy could not be demonstrated [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22108" pm="."><plain>Another vaccine candidate using transgenic tobacco leaves expressing GN and GC was fed to mice and induced IgG and IgA. However, antibodies were not tested for neutralisation titres and this oral vaccine was not tested for protection [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22110" pm="."><plain>Neither of these studies investigated cellular immune responses. There is, therefore, at present no safe and effective, commercially-available vaccine against CCHFv. <p><text><SENT sid="22112" pm="."><plain>Poxviral vectored vaccines, such as those based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), have the capacity to accommodate large gene inserts [21], such as the CCHFv M segment. Despite its growth deficiency in most mammalian cells [22], [23], MVA is able to promote high-level gene expression of recombinant genes both in vitro and in vivo, with authentic post-translational modifications in the host cell. Both humoral and cellular immunity [24], [25] can be induced by MVA, without the requirement for an adjuvant. <p><text><SENT sid="22115" pm="."><plain>We aimed to develop a candidate vaccine based on recombinant MVA expressing the CCHFv glycoproteins, to assess the induction of cellular and humoral immunity, and to evaluate efficacy in a challenge model that represents human disease. We adapted a previously described animal model to mimic infection by tick bite, by establishing intradermal delivery of CCHFv to IFNα/βR deficient mice. This is the first demonstration of a CCHF vaccine candidate conferring protection in a preclinical model. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title><text><SENT sid="22118" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods <sec id="s2a"><title><text><SENT sid="22119" pm="."><plain>Animals <p><text><SENT sid="22120" pm="."><plain>Female A129 (IFNα/βR-/-) and 129Sv/Ev mice, aged 5-8 weeks, were obtained from B&amp;K Universal (UK). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="22567" pm="."><plain>Therefore, although GC may contain more neutralising or protective epitopes [17], [51], the inclusion of GN in the vaccine design may have an advantageous effect, by assisting correct trafficking. <p><text><SENT sid="22568" pm="."><plain>In this work, the vaccine candidate encoded the non-structural accessory domains (mucin like domain, GP38 and NSm), as well as GN and GC. This is similar to a candidate DNA vaccine described by Spik et al [19], but in contrast to an oral vaccine that expressed GN and GC only [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22570" pm="."><plain>The structural proteins rely on N-glycosylation of GN for their correct folding and transport [52], and GN in turn has a complex maturation process involving sequential cleavage from the accessory domains [14], [15], [38], [49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22571" pm="."><plain>The mucin-like and GP38 domains are required for correct transport of GN to the Golgi apparatus [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22572" pm="."><plain>There is a complex interplay between the products of the glycoprotein precursor, and the absence of a critical component could have had an unexpected effect on processing and expression of the antigens. <p><text><SENT sid="22573" pm="."><plain>In the MVA-GP vaccine, the full-length glycoprotein open reading frame was controlled by the mH5 poxvirus promoter [33], for increased stability [53], and strong early expression to drive a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response. A leader sequence from human tPA was added for increased immunogenicity and intracellular transport [36], [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22575" pm="."><plain>V5 was added for identification of expressed protein by immunolabelling. <p><text><SENT sid="22576" pm="."><plain>An intradermal challenge route was chosen for our CCHFv infection model since this closely resembles the major natural route of infection via tick bite. The incubation period of CCHF in humans generally varies between 1-7 days [4], [6], but can be as long as 22 days [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22578" pm="."><plain>A shorter incubation period has been associated with acquiring infection by tick bite, compared to by contact with infected human blood [55], and in nosocomial transmission, a shorter incubation period was associated with fatal outcome [54]. <p><text><SENT sid="22579" pm="."><plain>Similar studies with other tick-borne pathogens have also modelled infection and disease using the intradermal route to experimentally mimic tick bite including those using Ehrlichia [56], Lyme Disease [57] and Rickettsia [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22580" pm="."><plain>Previous characterisations of CCHFv infection in mouse models have focused on the intraperitoneal route, although a recent paper has also characterised other inoculation routes, including subcutaneous [11]. <p><text><SENT sid="22581" pm="."><plain>The time to onset of clinical signs, and the survival time in unprotected groups seen in this study, were consistent with those seen by Zivcec et al [11] with a challenge dose of 100 TCID50 delivered subcutaneously. However, the lethal dose observed by that group was 0.05 TCID50, compared to &gt;10 TCID50 in the present study. This difference could be explained by the inoculation route used (subcutaneous versus intradermal), or the genetic backgrounds of the mice used (C57Bl/6 versus 129Sv/Ev). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22584" pm="."><plain>Histopathological lesions seen in the liver and spleen, by both HE staining and immunohistochemistry, were consistent with previous observations [11], [12]. <p><text><SENT sid="22585" pm="."><plain>In this work, both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed in mouse models, with or without fully functional innate immunity. Immunogenicity data from additional MHC genetic backgrounds would be interesting, but would be of limited value without the ability to follow up with efficacy studies. <p><text><SENT sid="22587" pm="."><plain>Characterising immune responses in convalescent patients could illustrate the type of protective immunity required of an effective vaccine. However, very few clinical studies have examined cellular immune responses to CCHF. Akinci et al did not report antibody levels, but found significantly higher levels of CD3+ CD8+ T cells in fatal cases compared to non-fatal cases, which correlated with viral load [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22590" pm="."><plain>Therefore CCHF induces proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells, but these are incapable of controlling infection in fatal cases. Another report also found elevated levels of CD3+ CD8+ cells in paediatric CCHF cases, but there were no fatal outcomes in this study group for comparison [60]. <p><text><SENT sid="22592" pm="."><plain>In order to efficiently capture both CD4+ and CD8+ immune responses to the MVA-GP vaccine, peptides used in the ELISPOT assay were 20 amino acid residues in length. This approach has been shown to stimulate both T cell subsets [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22594" pm="."><plain>A positive T-cell response was only seen in the group that survived lethal challenge. As immunogenicity studies required terminal sacrifice, however, analysis of pre-challenge immune responses and survival studies occurred in different individuals. Any correlation could therefore only be applied to the group as a whole. <p><text><SENT sid="22597" pm="."><plain>The reason for the variable T-cell immunogenicity observed across the glycoprotein domains is unclear, but it is encouraging that the highest levels were seen in the more conserved domains. The mucin-like domain is highly variable across CCHFv strains, with up to 56.4% difference in amino-acid identity, compared to up to 8.4% difference for the rest of the glycoprotein open reading frame [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22599" pm="."><plain>Although the relevance of the cellular response to protection is still unknown, this is promising for designing a vaccine that confers cross-strain protection. <p><text><SENT sid="22600" pm="."><plain>Most clinical CCHF immunity studies have examined serum antibody levels against the nucleoprotein [62], [63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22601" pm="."><plain>Patients with a fatal outcome have a weak or absent antibody response, and Ozturk et al found significant differences between IgM and IgG levels in fatal vs. non-fatal cases [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22602" pm="."><plain>However, other studies were unable to find a significant relationship between the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies and clinical outcome, but found that viral load was a better predictor of prognosis [65], [66]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22603" pm="."><plain>Virus titres decreased in survivors during the first week of disease, independently of antibodies, suggesting a critical role of innate or cellular immune mechanisms [66]. <p><text><SENT sid="22604" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal antibodies, raised against viral glycoproteins, identified protective epitopes in both GN and GC. However, only antibodies recognising epitopes in GC were neutralising in vitro [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22606" pm="."><plain>Therefore direct neutralisation is not the only mechanism by which antibodies can protect against CCHF. Protective antibodies were also found to be cross-reactive across CCHFv clades [51], which is again encouraging for designing a vaccine that confers cross-strain protection. <p><text><SENT sid="22608" pm="."><plain>In this report, we found antibody recognition of similar CCHFv glycoproteins in both the wild-type 129Sv/Ev and A129 mouse strains. The response in A129 mice, however, was slightly delayed. On day 21 of the vaccination schedule, most 129Sv/Ev animals had a detectable IgG response. However, at this time point, most of the A129 humoral response was only detected when the assay specificity was broadened to include IgM. This response was unlikely to be transient, since a predominantly IgG response was detected after an additional 7 days. If protection is mediated via the humoral response, IgG will be required for long-term immune memory, whereas IgM is likely to provide only short term protection from disease. Although IgG was observed at day 28 (the time of challenge) in A129 mice, a longer interval between vaccination and challenge will be needed to confirm that the vaccine induces immune memory. <p><text><SENT sid="22615" pm="."><plain>Quantitation by ELISA also found varying levels of specific antibodies in pooled sera from approximately 20 vaccinated A129 mice, 14 days after the booster was administered. Unfortunately it was not possible to test individual sera from this time point to quantitate the range of individual responses (samples were not available prior to pooling). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22617" pm="."><plain>Since CCHFv-infected cell lysate could not be validated for ELISA, recombinant GN ectodomain was used as the capture antigen. Therefore, vaccine-induced antibodies specific for other domains would not have been detected by this assay. Specific antibodies were only seen in the group that survived lethal challenge, but not all individuals had a detectable response, using either of the methods described. Therefore a direct correlation could not be drawn between induction of CCHFv-specific antibodies, and protection. <p><text><SENT sid="22621" pm="."><plain>At 4 days post-challenge, randomly selected animals were sacrificed for viral load analysis and histological examination. These included 2 animals from the MVA 1974-treated group that did not display any clinical signs of illness. Immunohistochemistry on liver samples of these animals detected viral antigen in the Kupffer cells. An association with Kupffer cells has also been noted in a STAT-1 knockout model of CCHFv, and in human cases [11], [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22625" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was therefore able to distinguish between MVA-GP vaccinated, and control vaccinated individuals in the absence of clinical signs. <p><text><SENT sid="22626" pm="."><plain>It is probable that the MVA-GP vaccinated animals were not completely free from infection, but developed a subclinical disease, as viral RNA was detected in all animals at four days post-challenge. A positive correlation between viral load and severity of disease has been observed in patients [65], [66], consistent with our observations in the mouse model. <p><text><SENT sid="22628" pm="."><plain>At the end of the efficacy study, viral RNA was still detected in surviving animals, although not all individuals had detectable viraemia. Although the consistent levels of viral load seen between day 32 and day 42 may have indicated ongoing, subclinical viral replication, it is likely that the RNA was released from defective viral particles, or from virus that had been inactivated by effective immunity e.g. neutralising antibodies. Initial attempts to amplify live virus from day 42 tissue samples were unsuccessful; therefore the possibility that this vaccine induced sterilising immunity has not been excluded. Interestingly, prolonged viraemia assessed by RT-PCR has also been observed in convalescent patients, but that study did not report any attempts to recover viable virus [67]. <p><text><SENT sid="22632" pm="."><plain>The MVA-GP vaccine induced comprehensive cellular and humoral immunity to CCHFv, which translated into protection against severe disease, such that no clinical signs of illness were apparent during the study. Furthermore, the adaptive immune response elicited by the vaccine was not substantially affected by the absence of the type I IFN receptor in the A129 mice. Protection correlated with T-cell responses, but not antibody induction, although further studies are required to determine exactly which is the protective component. Further directions for this work could also include testing the longevity of demonstrated protective effects, and investigating whether MVA-GP confers protection against multiple CCHFv strains. <p><text><SENT sid="22636" pm="."><plain>This report provides the first demonstration of protection by a CCHF candidate vaccine in a lethal animal challenge model, and validates this application of the IFNα/βR knockout adult mouse model. The MVA-based vaccine approach gives promise that a modern CCHF vaccine, that can meet international regulatory approval, is possible. Currently, the data look extremely promising and represent major progress in the search for a medical intervention that can be used to protect against CCHF. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title><text><SENT sid="22639" pm="."><plain>Supporting Information <supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0091516.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="22640" pm="."><plain>Sequence of Insert.
