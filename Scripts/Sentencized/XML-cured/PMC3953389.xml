</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="22759" pm="."><plain>The Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) has an unmatched versatility among the seven different secretion systems known in bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22760" pm="."><plain>T4SS can translocate not only proteins but also DNA to phylogenetically diverse taxa, including many bacterial species and various eukaryotic cells, as well as import and export DNA from the extracellular milieu. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22761" pm="."><plain>The T4SS shares a common ancestry with bacterial conjugation systems [1], with three types of T4SS described to date: (1) conjugation systems, defined as machines that translocate DNA substrates to recipient cells by a contact-dependent process; (2) effector translocation systems, functioning to deliver proteins or other effector molecules to eukaryotic target cells; and (3) DNA release or uptake systems, which translocate DNA to or from the extracellular milieu [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22762" pm="."><plain>The VirB/D4 secretion system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a typical example of a T4SS, which serves as both a conjugation and an effector translocation system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22763" pm="."><plain>Conjugation systems within the T4SS facilitate the translocation of protein-DNA complexes from the bacterium into the cytoplasm of the host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22764" pm="."><plain>For instance, A. tumefaciens translocates to the host cell a segment of the Ti (tumor inducing) plasmid between the right and left borders (T-DNA) in complex with a cytoplasmic relaxase protein (VirD2) [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22765" pm="."><plain>Proteins involved in T-DNA processing and translocation are classified into three functionally distinct classes [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22766" pm="."><plain>Class I constitutes proteins involved in the processing of the DNA intermediates, such as VirC1, VirC2, VirD1 and VirD2 relaxase [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22767" pm="."><plain>VirC1 and VirC2 proteins assemble the relaxosomal complex at the border sequences of the Ti plasmid and initiate T-DNA processing [6], whereas VirD2 relaxase, when present in the relaxosomal complex, cleaves the bottom strand of the T-DNA, where it remains covalently attached to the 5′ end of the single-stranded T-DNA [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22768" pm="."><plain>Class II comprises 11 VirB proteins that form the T4SS apparatus which is responsible for the translocation of the VirD2–T-DNA complex and the effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm [4], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22769" pm="."><plain>Class III constitutes the coupling proteins (CP), which mediate the interaction between the substrate (VirD2–T-DNA complex) and the transport apparatus [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22770" pm="."><plain>VirD4 CP, the coupling protein in the A. tumefaciens VirB/D4 system, is an inner membrane protein with a large cytoplasmic domain essential for the transfer of both the T-DNA strand and VirE2 to host cells [10]–[12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22771" pm="."><plain>However, the VirD2–T-DNA complex and VirE2 are translocated separately [7], [13], [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22772" pm="."><plain>The translocated effector proteins— VirE2, VirE3 and VirF which are involved in nuclear targeting, import and integration of the T-DNA into the host genome—mediate the interactions between the VirD2–T-DNA complex and host cellular factors [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22773" pm="."><plain>In particular, VirE2 coats single-stranded T-DNA and protects it from host cell nucleases [15], whereas both VirE2 and VirD2 carry the nuclear localization signals that aid in the nuclear import of the T-DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22774" pm="."><plain>VirE2 also interacts with host cell proteins, such as VIP1 and VIP2 [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22775" pm="."><plain>VIP1 and VIP2 localize to plant nuclei and probably facilitate delivery of the T-DNA complex to its site of integration [16] VirF, on the other hand, localizes in the host nucleus and targets VIP1 and VirE2 for proteolysis and thus uncoats the T-DNA from its cognate proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22776" pm="."><plain>This uncoating mechanism is a crucial step that must occur prior to integration of the T-DNA in the host genome [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22777" pm="."><plain>The VirD2–T-DNA complex forms in the bacterial cytoplasm, but there is no evidence to suggest that VirD4 CP can recruit the bulky substrate complex to the T4SS apparatus [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22778" pm="."><plain>In 2007, Guo et al. reported the existence of a subset of proteins defined as ‘recruiting proteins’ that are involved in bringing the nucleoprotein substrate complex formed in the bacterial cytoplasm to the VirD4 CP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22779" pm="."><plain>The VirD2-binding protein (VBP) was subsequently identified as a key protein belonging to this subset and was shown to recruit the VirD2–T-DNA complex to the VirD4 CP [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22780" pm="."><plain>Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have indeed shown that the interaction between VBP and VirD2 is important for T-DNA transfer [8], with VBP interacting with both the VirD2–T-DNA complex and with several of the T4SS components independently, including VirD4 CP, VirB4 and VirB11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22781" pm="."><plain>However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which VBP recruits the complex to VirD4 CP remains unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22782" pm="."><plain>A. tumefaciens is a gram-negative bacteria that causes crown gall disease (tumor formation) in over 140 species of dicots [19].Despite this negative role, researchers have started to exploit the ability of Agrobacterium to infiltrate and infect other organisms to create transgenic plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22783" pm="."><plain>Thus, given the importance of this bacterium in both crop infection and as a research tool, we sought to better understand how VBP recruits the protein-DNA complex to VirD4 CP by exploring the structure of VBP. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="22784" pm="."><plain>Here we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of VBP along with its functional studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22785" pm="."><plain>We show that the two monomers of the asymmetric unit form a tight anti-parallel dimer, with the dimerization confirmed by solution studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22786" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrate that this C-terminal domain is the dimerization domain of full-length VBP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22787" pm="."><plain>Pull-down analyses and plant virulence assays showed that only Agrobacterium harboring dimeric VBP can interact with the key proteins to induce tumor formation in plants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="22795" pm="."><plain>The structure was determined using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method (Table 1).The asymmetric unit consists of two monomers forming a tight dimer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22796" pm="."><plain>Each monomer contains a six-helix bundle with three long anti-parallel α helices (α1, α2, and α6) that forms the major part of this domain, and three shorter helices (α3, α4 and α5) that stack at an angle to the long helices (Figure 1B, Figure S1A, S1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22797" pm="."><plain>The monomers are arranged as anti-parallel dimers with a large buried surface area of 1203 Å2 (or 14% of the total surface area of each monomer). </plain></SENT>
