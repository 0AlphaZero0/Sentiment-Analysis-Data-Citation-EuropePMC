</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23198" pm="."><plain>The apicomplexan parasite, Neospora caninum, is the leading cause of epidemic abortion in cattle and is also a frequent cause of neuromuscular diseases in dogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23199" pm="."><plain>A recent estimate of neosporosis-induced abortions in cattle from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Spain, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the USA suggests an annual economic impact in excess of 1.2 billion USD [1]. N. caninum related diseases have also been reported in other livestock species, including sheep, goats, horses and deer [2],[3] with canids such as dogs, wolves and coyotes being the definitive hosts [4],[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23200" pm="."><plain>Therefore, neosporosis represents a major veterinary health and economic concern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23201" pm="."><plain>Neoguard, a killed tachyzoite lysate and the only vaccine that has been marketed to date, was reported in one publication to reduce the abortion rate in cattle by approximately 50% [6] but does not induce protection against fetal infection in cattle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23202" pm="."><plain>However, more recent trials revealed fewer efficacies in the field, and even suggested that vaccination may increase the risk of early embryonic death [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23203" pm="."><plain>Thus, the vaccine has been taken off the market. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23204" pm="."><plain>The application of live attenuated vaccines, although potentially more efficacious, carries the risk of early embryonic death as a result of potential reversion to virulence [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23205" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy could provide a viable alternative if appropriate compounds are identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23206" pm="."><plain>Both in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to determine efficacy of treatments with lasalocid, monensin, pirithrexim, pyrimethamine, clindamycin, robenidine and trimethoprim [8], artemisinin and artemisone [9], [10], depudecin [11], toltrazuril, and ponazuril [12] although none of these studies showed that treatments were actually effective in cattle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23207" pm="."><plain>To date there is no approved vaccine and no approved treatment for cattle that are infected with N. caninum. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23208" pm="."><plain>A study on prophylactic administration of toltrazuril in newborn calves suggests some degree of protection based on serological response data [13], but protection has never been proven. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23209" pm="."><plain>Treatment with prolonged administration of clindamycin or potentiated sulfa drugs (in combination with trimethoprim) were only successful in eliminating clinical signs in less than 40% cases of canine neosporosis [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23210" pm="."><plain>Clearly, a new and more efficacious therapeutic is needed to reduce the economic impact of neosporosis on farmers and the global economy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23211" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that apicomplexan calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are promising drug targets, as observed from excellent correlations between cell-activity and enzyme inhibition by compounds from a focused bumped kinase inhibitor (BKI) library as well as chemical-genetic validation [15]–[17]. Toxoplasma gondii CDPK1 (TgCDPK1) (TGME49_101440) has been reported to be associated with host cell invasion processes [15], [18]. TgCDPK1 has the smallest possible gatekeeper amino acid in the ATP binding site, glycine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23212" pm="."><plain>Most BKIs have bulky C3 aryl substituents that project into a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the glycine gatekeeper in the ATP binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23213" pm="."><plain>BKIs selectively inhibit TgCDPK1 but don't inhibit mammalian kinases because mammalian kinases have larger gatekeeper residues that block the entry of the bulky C3 aryl substitution into the adjacent hydrophobic pocket. N. caninum is similar to T. gondii in its ability to invade a large variety of cells [19]–[21] and their genomes are highly similar as well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23214" pm="."><plain>The two parasites share a conserved core proteome, similar core biochemical processes, and 99% CDPK1 amino acid sequence identity including a glycine gatekeeper residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23215" pm="."><plain>Thus, it seems likely that BKIs, which efficiently inhibit host cell invasion in T. gondii, will also block N. caninum invasion and growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23216" pm="."><plain>However, it is necessary to test the function of NcCDPK1 as divergence of functions or pathways may have occurred. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23217" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the biochemical, structural, and biophysical aspects of NcCDPK1 enzyme and the nanomolar potency of BKIs in the inhibition of NcCDPK1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23218" pm="."><plain>The effect of BKI inhibitors on N. caninum tachyzoite proliferation and development were determined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23219" pm="."><plain>Seven of the tested BKIs exhibit low-to-mid nanomolar activity against N. caninum proliferation in vitro, making them good candidates for therapeutic investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23220" pm="."><plain>A therapeutic oral trial with a BKI, 1294, demonstrated marked reduction of N. caninum cerebral parasite burden in mice, thus demonstrating proof-of-concept for neosporosis therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23221" pm="."><plain>Thus, our studies define a strategy for the development of potent and safe NcCDPK1 inhibitors that could form the basis of a novel neosporosis treatment regimen. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23228" pm="."><plain>The seven BKIs with 1 to 3 nM IC50s for inhibiting NcCDPK1 enzyme activity inhibit the growth of N. caninum tachyzoites in vitro with EC50 values in the range of 49 to 140 nM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23229" pm="."><plain>Compound 1266 [16], with the higher IC50 of 513 nM, was unable to block N. caninum proliferation in vitro, even at the highest concentration tested (2500 nM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23230" pm="."><plain>Though there are not many BKIs tested yet, there is a good correlation between potency in vitro towards NcCDPK1 inhibition and N. caninum growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23231" pm="."><plain>None of these compounds showed mammalian cell cytotoxicity when assayed against human lymphoblastoid cell, CRL 8155, and none had off-target inhibition of small gatekeeper (threonine) human protein kinases [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23232" pm="."><plain>Our data shows 1294 (Figure 1) had a 2.6 nM IC50 against NcCDPK1 enzyme and 32 nM EC50 against N. caninum tachyzoites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23233" pm="."><plain>Compound 1294 has previously been reported to exhibit profound in vitro and in vivo activity against Cryptosporidium parvum [17] cell growth and have excellent malaria transmission blocking properties [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23234" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic data with 1294 demonstrates favorable absorption with low clearance, supporting daily oral administration, and low toxicity in mammalian cells and rodents [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23235" pm="."><plain>Efficacy against N. caninum tachyzoites in cell culture points to another anti-apicomplexan application for 1294 justifying it for broad spectrum drug development. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23240" pm="."><plain>The active site environment of NcCDPK1 differs at only amino acid position 123 having tyrosine rather than phenylalanine at TgCDPK1 residue 124. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23241" pm="."><plain>This change does not alter the binding surface in the active site, but may act to slightly rigidify the active site conformation by introducing a new hydrogen bonding interaction between residues Tyr 123 and Glu 88. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23242" pm="."><plain>The observed binding pose of the pyrazolopyrimidine (PP) scaffold and the R1 substituent “bump” in the inhibitor complexes studied here is entirely consistent with that seen previously for PP-scaffold inhibitors bound to the T. gondii homolog (Figure 2A, Figure S1 and S2 in File S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23243" pm="."><plain>Compound 1266 [16] is approximately 200 fold less effective at inhibiting CDPK1s relative to other BKIs shown in the study probably due to its distinctive quinoxaline R1 ring system rather than the common naphthalene, quinoline, or isoquinoline R1 group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23244" pm="."><plain>A three-dimensional (3-D) model of CDPK1 with 1266 predicted that the quinoxaline nitrogen at position 9 (N9) is oriented toward the carbonyl oxygen of residue valine 78 (3.3 Å distance). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23245" pm="."><plain>This would have been quite favorable for additional hydrogen bonding if the N9 was hydrogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23246" pm="."><plain>However, a quinoxaline nitrogen may not have a proton at pH values above 1, making this an unfavorable interaction because the carbonyl oxygen of residue valine 78 and the N9 pay a price in solvation energy by facing each other rather than solvent waters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23247" pm="."><plain>Data from this study confirmed that the model for the structural basis of potency and specificity developed for the optimization of potential anti-toxoplasmosis drugs based on this scaffold is also applicable to optimization of anti-neosporosis drugs [22], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23248" pm="."><plain>The pose of the piperidine R2 substituent in the current structures is similar but not identical to that seen in TgCDPK1 complexes with other inhibitors containing piperidine ring substituents at this position, which in turn are not identical to each other. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23249" pm="."><plain>This argues for flexibility in the orientation of the piperidine substituents even after binding of these nanomolar inhibitors, and allows additional chemical modifications of this group if necessary to further optimize PK/AMDET properties. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23261" pm="."><plain>In this conformational state the C-terminal Ca2+-binding domain forms a compact structure that occludes the active site of the N-terminal kinase domain, thus preventing the recognition or phosphorylation of substrate proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23384" pm="."><plain>In normal cell culture, N. caninum tachyzoites lyse or egress from their host cells at around 72 hours (3 days) after infection [19], [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23385" pm="."><plain>BKI inhibition of TgCDPK1 have been linked to the process of invasion and egress of the mammalian host [31], [34], thus what we are observing in N. caninum is consistent with that observation in T. gondii. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23386" pm="."><plain>Beside potential impediment of egress, TEM analysis of HFF cultures infected with N. caninum tachyzoites prior to treatment with compound 1294 for an extended length of time (up to 12 days), revealed major ultra-structural alterations in N. caninum tachyzoites, but not in mammalian host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23387" pm="."><plain>More precisely, the data suggests additional effects of BKIs on molecular target(s) that control(s) separation of tachyzoites during replication, which results in either parasites dying off intracellularly, or seemingly viable parasites forming large multinucleated complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23388" pm="."><plain>In other instances, these complexes also show signs of metabolic impairment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23389" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature or experimental evidence of NcCDPK1 or TgCDPK1 involvement in transducing signals needed in metabolic pathways or cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23390" pm="."><plain>However, egress impediment induced stress from 1294 treatment of N. caninum tachyzoite infected HFF cells could be a potential indirect cause or unrelated to inhibition of NcCDPK1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23391" pm="."><plain>It is also possible that the difference in potency or phenotypic effect on N. caninum versus T. gondii is due to the presence of a second target kinase in N. caninum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23392" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the respective genomes argues against this, however. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23393" pm="."><plain>The most plausible off-target activity would be recognition of another small-gatekeeper kinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23394" pm="."><plain>Seven such kinases can be found in the N. caninum genome, but in each case the protein is directly homologous (E value  = e∧-100 or better) to a T. gondii kinase whose sequence contains that same small gatekeeper residue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23395" pm="."><plain>While this does not rule out the possibility of off-target activity, on balance, it seems more likely that N. caninum is somewhat more sensitive than T. gondii to interference with the targeted CDPK1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23396" pm="."><plain>Previous study on ruthenium complexes had shown that drug effects can clearly differ between T. gondii and N. caninum [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23397" pm="."><plain>Similarly, these observations may be further phenotypic characteristics of NcCDPK1 inhibition suggesting a potential functional divergence or an amplification of physicochemical role relative to TgCDPK1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23398" pm="."><plain>When infected HFF were treated with 1294 for 12 days, followed by passage by trypsinization to remove the compound, proliferation of tachyzoites resumed, indicating that the drug is not parasiticidal in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23399" pm="."><plain>Rather the trypsin may release the viable tachyzoites, which can re-establish infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23400" pm="."><plain>However, it is unclear what specific percentage of intracellular tachyzoites was damaged due to the prolonged exposure to 1294; it is only clear that some of the tachyzoites are viable and can re-establish infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23401" pm="."><plain>Compound 1294 was recently shown to be a highly selective inhibitor for parasites' CDPKs compared with 80 mammalian kinases [23] presumably due to smaller gatekeeper residues in CDPKs and other interactions in the CDPKs active sites [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23402" pm="."><plain>Other enzymes in the N. caninum kinome with small gatekeeper residues, that compound 1294 could potentially inhibit, include NcCamK (NCLIV_046430) with an alanine gatekeeper, NcAGC like kinase (NCLIV_016060) with a serine gatekeeper, NcROP like kinase (NCLIV_030990) with a threonine gatekeeper, and NcMAPK-3 (NCLIV_056080) with a serine gatekeeper. NcMAPK-3 is a TgMAPK-1 (TGME49_312570) ortholog with highly conserved kinase domain of &gt;80% identity. TgMAPK-1 been shown to play some role in sister parasite T. gondii stress response [36], cell division [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23403" pm="."><plain>It is unclear to what extent compound 1294 could impact these targets, but sensitivity is postulated to be related to the size of the respective enzymes' gatekeeper residue in the order alanine&gt;serine&gt;threonine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23404" pm="."><plain>Intracellular damage to tachyzoites may be concentration dependent probably due to different levels of sensitivity of prospective N. caninum off-target enzymes to compound 1294. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23405" pm="."><plain>In addition to demonstrating the molecular and structural basis of BKIs impact on the growth of N. caninum tachyzoites in cell culture, this study provides essential fundamental evidence for potential clinical relevance of 1294 in the management of N. caninum infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23406" pm="."><plain>Although the in vitro data suggest reversible effects on growth inhibition with the removal of drug pressure, the clinical outcome in a mouse model of infection indicates that five to ten days treatment results in an almost undetectable cerebral parasite burden with appropriate length of treatment (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23407" pm="."><plain>Barely detectable number of parasites in the brains of mice from 1294-treated groups at least 2 weeks after the end of treatment, compared to the high levels of brain parasites in the control group, strengthens the argument that 1294 is efficacious in vivo despite not being parasiticidal in in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23408" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with recent observation of 1294 efficacy in the mouse cryptosporidiosis model [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23409" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot prove there was no regrowth of N. caninum in the mouse model after 1294 dosing, the very low parasite counts over 2 weeks after dosing with 1294 (Figure 7) is good evidence that in vivo regrowth was minimal or immunologic containment was established after the end of dosing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23410" pm="."><plain>The reduced numbers of N. caninum tachyzoites in the brains of treated mice is evidence that compound 1294 crosses the blood-brain barrier in sufficient concentration to be useful in clinical cases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23411" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our unpublished studies have shown that 25 to 33% of the plasma levels of 1294 can be found in brain tissue of mice given a single dose of 1294. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23412" pm="."><plain>Favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of compound 1294 [23] combined with an immunologic response, is likely to facilitate a more effective and complete clearance of parasites in vivo compared to the in vitro situation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23413" pm="."><plain>Overall, the prospect of a broad-spectrum anti-apicomplexan agent with no mammalian toxicity profile is quite exciting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23414" pm="."><plain>Although further studies will be needed to fully elucidate the molecular target(s) of 1294, it seems that its role of inhibiting the host cell invasion and egress process is only one of its many functions. </plain></SENT>
