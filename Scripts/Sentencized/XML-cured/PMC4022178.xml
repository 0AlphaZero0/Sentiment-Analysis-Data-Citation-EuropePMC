</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23588" pm="."><plain>Genes sharing a common origin, without any further specification of their evolutionary relationship, are classified as homologs, while paralogs and orthologs constitute subcategories of homologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23589" pm="."><plain>Orthologs evolve from a common ancestral gene via vertical descent (speciation), while paralogs evolve by duplication events taking place after speciation [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23590" pm="."><plain>Apparent gene duplications may also result from horizontal gene transfer (lateral transfer of genetic material between species), and such homologs are classified as xenologs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23591" pm="."><plain>Gene duplication was first developed as a coherent concept by Ohno more than 40 years ago [2], but the prevalence and importance of gene duplication was not clearly demonstrated until fully sequenced genomes became available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23592" pm="."><plain>Estimates of numbers of duplicated genes in genomes of bacteria, archaea and eukarya have shown that large proportions of genes have been generated by gene duplication in all three domains [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23593" pm="."><plain>In eubacterial systems at least three, often partly overlapping, biologically relevant roles of gene duplication can be distinguished: (a) to confer a solution to a selective problem, (b) to facilitate further genetic adaptation, and (c) to give rise to genetic innovation and novel biochemical function [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23594" pm="."><plain>Following a duplication event there are three possible fates for the duplicate genes: deletion, silencing (nonfunctionalization), or selection [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23595" pm="."><plain>In cases of selection three major outcomes have been described: evolution of a new beneficial function in one duplicate (neofunctionalization), partitioning of ancestral functions between the duplicates (subfunctionalization), or conservation of ancestral function(s) in both duplicates (gene conservation) [2, 5–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23596" pm="."><plain>It is however likely that paralog evolution may involve both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization, either concurrently or sequentially [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23597" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence for a mechanism where there is no “invention” of new gene function(s) or direct partitioning of ancestral functions, but rather amplification followed by improvement of extant weak or secondary functions in duplicate genes [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23598" pm="."><plain>Most studies on the outcome of retained gene duplications have been carried out in eukaryotic systems, where gene and genome duplications are currently regarded as the major sources for development of new functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23599" pm="."><plain>However, mechanisms for gene duplication in plants and animals and references therein] differ from those in prokaryotes [11, 12] and references therein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23600" pm="."><plain>In addition, polyploidy and cellular differentiation plays a major role in paralog evolution in many eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23601" pm="."><plain>Gene duplications are among the most common mutations in bacteria, but show high intrinsic instability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23602" pm="."><plain>Most tandem duplication events in bacterial genomes are associated with naturally occurring repetitive sequences, such as rRNA genes, transposable elements and other repetitive elements, but gene duplication can also occur by processes capable of random end-joining in the complete absence of any repetitive sequence [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23603" pm="."><plain>Duplicated genes in bacteria appear to be created mainly by small-scale gene duplication events, and the majority of retained duplicated genes occur as single genes, not duplicated operons [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23604" pm="."><plain>The total number of paralogs in microbial genomes has been shown to correlate with genome size [8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23605" pm="."><plain>Microbial genomes also acquire intra-genome homologs via horizontal gene transfer, leading to xenologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23606" pm="."><plain>For most bacterial and archaeal genomes there appears to be a high level of horizontal gene transfer events in general [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23607" pm="."><plain>Xenologs can also be described as pseudoparalogs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23608" pm="."><plain>It will usually not be possible to discern between pseudoparalogs and true paralogs in a single-genome analysis [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23609" pm="."><plain>Thus, Lerat et al. [15] have proposed the term “synologs” to describe intra-genome homologs arising from either duplication or horizontal transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23610" pm="."><plain>The term was originally introduced by Gogarten [16] with a different definition, but the definition by Lerat et al. seems to be preferred and will be used in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23611" pm="."><plain>For γ-proteobacteria (the class Azotobacter vinelandii [see below] belongs to) it has been shown that horizontally acquired genes only rarely have pre-existing homologs within the recipient genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23612" pm="."><plain>But because synologs are rare in general, lateral gene transfer still contributes substantially to synology [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23613" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, subsequent duplications appear to be more common among laterally transferred genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23614" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to selection for gene dosages, as recently imported genes are likely to have poorly optimized functions [17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23615" pm="."><plain>During annotation work on the genome of the metabolically versatile nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium A. vinelandii DJ [18], we observed that the genome of this organism appeared to have a high frequency of highly similar synologs among proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23616" pm="."><plain>The 5.4 Mb genome contains approximately 5000 protein-coding genes, out of which ~70% have been given a functional assignment [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23617" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the abovementioned observation 943 bacterial and archaeal genomes that were available in the SEED database [19] at the time of the study were analysed for the occurrence of carbohydrate metabolism synologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23618" pm="."><plain>The general opinion is that in most cases, duplicated genes will diverge over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23619" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with Hooper and Berg’s observation that bacterial and archaeal genomes show roughly the same pattern of paralogs in groups of decreasing amino acid identity [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23620" pm="."><plain>Thus, a high incidence of highly similar synologs could be explained either by a recent burst of duplications or repeated horizontal gene transfers, or by a mechanism for gene conservation operating on these specific genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23621" pm="."><plain>The latter would imply that retention of highly similar synologs benefits the organism adaptively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23622" pm="."><plain>The results of this study support that sequence conservation of multiple gene copies can be an adaptive strategy for bacteria to enhance their ability to cope with various environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23625" pm="."><plain>Annotation work on the genome of soil bacterium A. vinelandii DJ [18] revealed a high frequency of synologs among proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23626" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this is also the case for the closely related pseudomonads, and whether synologs are common for other functional categories in these genomes, the occurrence of protein families in the genomes of A. vinelandii DJ and 15 fully sequenced strains in the genus Pseudomonas was investigated using OrthoMCL [20], which uses pairwise sequence alignments to identify groups of similar proteins (protein families) in proteomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23627" pm="."><plain>In this analysis, members of the same intra-genome protein family were regarded as synologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23628" pm="."><plain>The number of identified families was markedly higher in A. vinelandii DJ than in the pseudomonad strains with regard to proteins involved in both carbohydrate metabolism (Figure 1a) and carbohydrate transport (Figure 1b), but not for any of the other functional categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23629" pm="."><plain>In addition, carbohydrate related protein families with more than two members were more common in A. vinelandii (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23630" pm="."><plain>Another interesting outcome of this initial study was that more than half of the identified A. vinelandii protein families assigned to carbohydrate metabolism contained synologs that shared ≥90% protein sequence identity.Figure 1 Distribution of carbohydrate metabolism and transport protein families in A. vinelandii and pseudomonad genomes.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="23635" pm="."><plain>To investigate the occurrence of synologs among carbohydrate metabolism genes in a wider range of organisms, data was extracted from the SEED database [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23636" pm="."><plain>One of the challenges in comparative genomics is that the extent and quality of annotation, as well as the approaches, can vary widely between genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23637" pm="."><plain>The SEED provides an environment in which all genomes have been subjected to the same annotation pipeline, with curation executed across many genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23638" pm="."><plain>Extracting data from this database can thus be expected to yield comparable gene sets for the included genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23639" pm="."><plain>Sequences belonging to the “Carbohydrates” category (including genes involved in transport) were extracted for the 57 archaeal and 886 bacterial genomes available in the SEED database at the time of the study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23640" pm="."><plain>The SEED database sorts protein-coding sequences into FIGfams where all members are believed to have the same functional role(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23641" pm="."><plain>Sequences from the same genome belonging to the same FIGfam, regardless of level of sequence identity, were regarded as synologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23642" pm="."><plain>Out of the 943 genomes, 46 (i.e. 4.9%) were found not to contain any synologs among carbohydrate metabolism genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23643" pm="."><plain>The gene sets extracted from SEED included both functional genes and genes annotated as possible pseudogenes, but the gene sequences were translated before the data set was analysed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23644" pm="."><plain>This ensured that pseudogene sequences containing frameshifts or deletions resulting in severely changed proteins would not be included in the identified sets of highly similar synologs, as the sequence set was also checked for severely truncated proteins (see Methods). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23645" pm="."><plain>Analysing the data set with emphasis on total number of synologs and number of synolog groups (sets of two or more intra-genome synologs) yielded practically indistinguishable qualitative results due to the strong positive correlation between these values (R2 = 0.95 for a linear regression). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23663" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the average sequence identity between synolog pairs in this data set was ~97% (Table 1), which means that the majority of the synologs has a considerably higher degree of identity than the applied cutoff value. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23664" pm="."><plain>The high correlation between number of synologs and number of synolog groups was still present at this cutoff (R2 = 0.97 for a linear regression). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="23742" pm="."><plain>While the total number of protein-coding sequences in the analysed genomes has an approximately symmetric distribution [see Additional file 1: Figure S1a], the distributions of total number of synolog groups as well as synolog fractions have large positive skews (Figure S1b and c [see Additional file 1]), i.e. the majority of the genomes display very low values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23743" pm="."><plain>Thus, the analyses showed that highly similar synologs generally comprise a very small fraction of the predicted proteomes of bacteria and archaea (hereafter referred to as the synolog fraction). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23747" pm="."><plain>An interesting feature of the 40 strains listed in [see Additional file 1: Table S1] is that 78% are pathogenic bacteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23748" pm="."><plain>Thus, even taking into account that approximately one third of all sequenced genomes belong to bacteria that live in association with eukaryotes [43], there appears to be a bias towards this kind of organisms among prokaryotic genomes with a generally high frequency of highly similar synologs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23749" pm="."><plain>There is however otherwise great variation between these 40 strains, as they encompass both plant and animal pathogens, and intracellular as well as extracellular lifestyles. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="23759" pm="."><plain>This supports the hypothesis that there are adaptive benefits in conservation of these highly similar synologs, most likely due to a more flexible regulation of expression and/or increased gene dosages, although this is just one of several possible strategies for adaptation. </plain></SENT>
