</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="24243" pm="."><plain>The ILI consultation rates reported by the Sentinelles network remain the basis of surveillance in Corsica, because the system integrates epidemiological and virological information as well as data about the molecular characterization of the influenza viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24244" pm="."><plain>All surveillance systems analyzed showed a strong correlation with the ILI consultation rates declared by the Corsican Sentinelles network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24245" pm="."><plain>Overall, the RIRs of consulting different medical services that participated in ILI surveillance (Sentinelles network, SOS Médecins, or OSCOUR) showed similar trends, which decreased with age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24246" pm="."><plain>Similarly, virological data from the ILI patients enrolled from the GPs of the Sentinelles network confirmed this trend, as the rate of positivity for at least one respiratory virus decreased significantly with age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24247" pm="."><plain>No clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak by the sentinel nursing homes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24248" pm="."><plain>Among the ILI patients enrolled by the Sentinelles GPs, 80.8% tested positive for at least one of the respiratory pathogens analyzed, which is a higher positivity rate than in previous reports [2],[25],[26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24249" pm="."><plain>This result could be explained by the high specificity of the ILI case definition used in the present study [13] and the unusual length of the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak (13 weeks) [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24250" pm="."><plain>In this study, coinfections were detected in persons aged 44 years and younger at a rate of 9.3%, consistent with previous studies [26], [28], [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24251" pm="."><plain>Several studies have reported an association between viral coinfections and increased morbidity, but these remains controversial [30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24252" pm="."><plain>In our study, all coinfections were associated with mild ILI disease. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24253" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the rate of positivity for at least one respiratory virus decreased significantly with age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24254" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that while human respiratory syncytial virus (A/B), was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus after influenza in patients aged less than 15 years, in agreement with previous studies [31], HRV was the most frequently detected virus in patients aged &gt;65 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24255" pm="."><plain>Information about the non influenza viral infections such as HRV to ILI episodes in older persons is poor, partly because of difficulties in diagnosis related to atypical presentations and low viral loads [32]–[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24256" pm="."><plain>Previously, it has been suggested that HRV could be the cause of exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases and could increase morbidity rates in frail persons as, including the elderly [33]–[34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24257" pm="."><plain>Overall, the RIR of consulting for an ILI was similar among the different surveillance networks analyzed here and decreased significantly with age. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24258" pm="."><plain>Two age groups were characterized by an RIR above 1: preschool and school-aged children less than 14 years old, and working adults aged 30–44 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24259" pm="."><plain>This peak in the 30–44-year-old group could be explained by their proximity to children as parents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24260" pm="."><plain>This trend is in accordance with the viral etiology of the epidemic, characterized by the cocirculation of A(H1N1)pdm2009 and B influenza viruses [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24261" pm="."><plain>In Corsica, no clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak in sentinel nursing homes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24262" pm="."><plain>This was remarkable because of the significant cocirculation of influenza A and B viruses and of other respiratory viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24263" pm="."><plain>This finding is likely attributable to the high VC against influenza viruses among residents, similar to the VC previously reported in French nursing homes [36], and a certain degree of cross-protection from previous exposure to influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24264" pm="."><plain>It could also be due to the result of better general hygiene management, as demonstrated by the rarity of clusters of gastroenteritis (N = 3) declared by the same sentinel nursing homes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24265" pm="."><plain>However, it is unlikely to have arisen through a good VC among staff, as this was low (16%), similar to staff VC levels previously reported that ranged from 10% to 50% [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24266" pm="."><plain>During the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak, epidemiological studies of laboratory-confirmed cases estimated a low-to-moderate vaccine effectiveness against influenza viruses [38]–[41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24267" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses of the HA gene in Corsica showed that all influenza B viruses belonged to the Yamagata lineage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24268" pm="."><plain>Except for one strain that belonged to the group 3, all other Influenza B strains fell into genetic group 2 and were characterized by five mutations compared with the vaccine strain, located at four antigenic sites, which could suggest a drift [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24269" pm="."><plain>The A(H1N1)pdm2009 viruses detected in Corsica belonged to groups 6 and 7, and showed a good match with the vaccine strain [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24270" pm="."><plain>As previously reported, the HA sequences of A(H3N2) viruses isolated in Corsica during the 2012–2013 season [10] were characterized by seven amino acid substitutions at four antigenic sites compared with A/Victoria/361/2011 (2012–2013 vaccine strain), suggesting a drift [42]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24271" pm="."><plain>Several limitations were inherent in the surveillance systems examined in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24272" pm="."><plain>The monitoring of ILI, is mainly based on clinical surveillance, as the virological surveillance, for instance, was carried out by the Sentinelles network. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24273" pm="."><plain>The lack of virological confirmation for the patients of the emergency general practice network (SOS Médecins), who visited the hospital emergency departments (OSCOUR) and/or in nursing homes is an important gap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24274" pm="."><plain>The evaluation of the causative agents of ILI in patients enrolled by the GPs of the Sentinelles network did not cover all possible respiratory pathogens, as other bacterial or viral pathogens that can cause ILI were not investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24275" pm="."><plain>It is possible that a low viral titer could not be detected by RT-–PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24276" pm="."><plain>Moreover, antigenic characterization of the influenza viruses that were characterized genetically was not performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24277" pm="."><plain>Overall, the patients were enrolled using a rather specific ILI case definition (especially for the Sentinelles network and for the SOS Médecins network), excluding infected patients with atypical ILI symptom presentations, including older persons, as well as asymptomatic infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24278" pm="."><plain>Finally, the epidemic threshold was only available for the ILI consultation rates reported by the Sentinelles GPs at a national level, which may not be adequate at a regional level with respect to the GPs Sentinelles network and with respect to the other local surveillance systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24279" pm="."><plain>To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24280" pm="."><plain>Today, the Corsican Sentinelles network is the only network performing viral testing of ILIs in Corsica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24281" pm="."><plain>This consortium will allow the integration of the virological surveillance of more than 20 respiratory viruses with the ILI clinical surveillance of the OSCOUR network (hospital emergency units), the SOS Médecins network (emergency network of GPs), and the surveillance of ARIs in the sentinel nursing homes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24282" pm="."><plain>The integration of virological surveillance in these systems will permit the acquisition of essential information on the spread of the analyzed respiratory viruses in the island, especially influenza viruses, and about the severity of the influenza epidemics. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="24283" pm="."><plain>This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012–2013 ILI outbreak and the influenza epidemic in Corsica using several surveillance systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24284" pm="."><plain>Overall, data collected from the different surveillance systems were well correlated, and they suggest that the influenza epidemic had a low impact on older persons. </plain></SENT>
