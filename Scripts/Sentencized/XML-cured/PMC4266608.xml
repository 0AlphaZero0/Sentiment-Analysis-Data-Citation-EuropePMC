</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="25839" pm="."><plain>Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in tumor growth and progression [1]â[3] and based on the theory that targeting of endothelial cells may be a more effective strategy than targeting tumor cells, during the last decade many anti-angiogenic drugs have been introduced to the clinical setting [4]â[8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25840" pm="."><plain>In order to assess circulating biomarkers of angiogenesis that may predict outcome to antiangiogenic therapies in cancer patients, many approaches have been tested in both preclinical and clinical studies [9]â[11] and among these the quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) by flow cytometry has found wide application [12]â[14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25841" pm="."><plain>CECs are mature endothelial cells released from vessels during physiological endothelial turnover or, in cancer patients, from the tumour vasculature, where they likely reflect endothelial damage or dysfunction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25842" pm="."><plain>These cells are increased in cancer patients when compared to healthy subjects, and their modifications in number and viability has shown predictive, prognostic, dynamic or escape biomarker value [15]â[18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25843" pm="."><plain>The endothelium is not a homogeneous organ. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="25845" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of the genetic, transcriptome and surrounding environment diversity, endothelial cells from different vascular beds have differentiated functions and phenotype [20]â[24], [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25846" pm="."><plain>Currently endothelial markers used to identify CECs are CD34, CD31 and CD146 in combination with CD45, to exclude leucocytes, and a nuclear staining marker (like Syto16, Hoechst or DRAQ5) to eliminate counting of noncellular endothelial microparticles [14], [25]â[26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="25847" pm="."><plain>The CD109 gene encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositolanchored glycoprotein that is a member of the alpha (2)-macroglobulin/C3, C4, C5 family of thioester-containing proteins [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25848" pm="."><plain>CD109 interacts directly with the type I transforming growth factor -beta (TGF-Î²) signaling receptor and negatively modulates TGF-Î² signalling [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25849" pm="."><plain>It is expressed on a subpopulation of CD34+ cells [29], on activated platelets and activated T-cells [30] and on a subpopulation of endothelial cells [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25850" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, it has been reported that CD109 is one of 12 endothelial markers over-expressed in tumor endothelial cells [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25851" pm="."><plain>In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of CEC phenotype, we investigated the expression of CD109 on cultured endothelial cells and on CECs from the peripheral blood of healthy subject and cancer patients. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26017" pm="."><plain>Because blood vessels are distributed throughout the body, the endothelial cells are exposed to an enormous variety of tissue microenvironments, and the wide range of signal inputs is sufficient to generate phenotypic heterogeneity across the vascular tree [19], [21], [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26018" pm="."><plain>Detection of circulating endothelial cells by flow cytometry is an approach widely used in cancer patients, and the identification of the number, viability and kinetic of endothelial cells is a promising tool to stratify patient receiving anti-angiogenic treatment [15]â[18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26019" pm="."><plain>Currently, CECs are enumerated by a multiparametric flow-cytometry approach combining CD146, CD31, CD45, a nuclear binding antigen (Syto16, Dapi or HOECST) along with a viability cellular staining (like 7-AAD or Annexin V). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26020" pm="."><plain>CD109 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface glycoprotein and is one of 12 endothelial markers over-expressed in tumor endothelial cells [23], [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26021" pm="."><plain>In this work, following an approach recently validated in our laboratory [14], we sorted CD109+CECs and CD146+CECs and we confirmed by RT-PCR, in both population the expression of mRNA level of CDH5 (Ve-Cadherin) and CLDN5 (Claudin5) two genes selectively expressed in endothelial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26022" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of CLEC14a, TMEM204, ARHGEF15, Gpr116 expressed in developing endothelial cells [33], were present in CD109+CECs when compared to CD146+CECs, suggesting that these genes may play an important role not only in developing endothelial cells but also in adult angiogenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26023" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that CD109+CECs and CD146+CECs are two different subpopulation of endothelial cells, being these two antigens not expressed on the same cells, while CD34 (a marker currently used to identify progenitor cells) was positive on 20% of CD109+CECs and on 30% of CD146+CECs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26024" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the number, viability and kinetic of CD109+CECs and of CD146+ CECs and observed that both subpopulation of endothelial cells are enriched in the blood of glioblastoma and breast cancer patients, are more viable when compared to value observed in healthy subject, and their number decrease significantly after treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26025" pm="."><plain>In our previous experience, we reported that in patients with breast cancer treated with metronomic chemotherapy, CD146+CEC levels after two months of treatment were associated with prolonged PFS [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26026" pm="."><plain>In another clinical trial, in breast cancer patients treated with metronomic chemotherapy and bevacizumab, baseline CEC levels were also associated with PFS [36], [37] confirming that the quantification of CD146+ CECs is useful to identify patients who might benefit from antiangiogenic treatments [38]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26027" pm="."><plain>In a series of patients with glioblastoma treated with AZD2171, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Batchelor found that viable CEC levels were higher in patients who experienced disease progression during AZD2171 therapy compared to patients without progression at day 112 [39]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26028" pm="."><plain>We recently reported [40] that in glioblastoma patients treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan or with bevacizumab alone, PFS and OS were significantly increased in patients with baseline counts of CD109+CECs higher than 41.1/mls, (1stquartile), while no prognostic factor was associated to CD146+CECs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26029" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that CEC heterogeneity may reflect vascular tumor complexity and that CD109+ CECs might be a potentially useful prognostic marker for glioblastoma patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26030" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that CD109 is over-expressed in tumor vasculature [24], and in this study we observed that all endothelial colonies from healthy subjects and from 10 cancer patients were positive for CD31, CD146, CD34 and VEGFR-2 and negative for CD45, while CD109 was positive on 1/9 endothelial cultures from healthy subject (11%) and on 5/10 (50%) endothelial cultures from cancer patients. </plain></SENT>
