<SENT sid="26102" pm="."><plain>Enhancers that are effective in plants have been isolated from genes of plants as well as from genes of viruses and bacteria that infect plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26103" pm="."><plain>These include enhancers from the tobacco tCUP [3,4], the pea plastocyanin [5], the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) [6,7], the Figwort mosaic virus [8] and the Agrobacterium tumefacians 780 [9,10] and ocs promoters [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26104" pm="."><plain>Plant virus-derived promoters have been shown to be a rich source of strong constitutive promoters for use in plant biology and several have been shown to contain enhancer sequences [6,8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26105" pm="."><plain>The CaMV 35S promoter has been used extensively in driving transgenes in transgenic plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26106" pm="."><plain>Many other viral promoters have also been shown to effectively drive expression of transgenes; CaMV 19S, Rice tungro bacilform virus (RTBV) [12], Soybean chlorotic mottle virus [13], Mirabilis mosaic virus [14,15], Figwort mosaic virus (FMV) [16,17], Peanut streak chlorotic virus [18], Banana streak badnavirus [19], Cestrum yellow leaf curling virus (CmYLCV) [20] and Sugarcane bacilliform badnavirus (SCBV) [19,21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26107" pm="."><plain>Among these, the CaMV 35S and the FMV promoters have been demonstrated to have enhancer sequences within the promoter [6,8]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26108" pm="."><plain>The CaMV 35S enhancer [7] is the most common enhancer used in plant biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26109" pm="."><plain>Several studies have shown that the CaMV 35S promoter is not as active as other strong constitutive promoters in monocots [23-26], raising the question whether the CaMV 35S enhancer sequences are as effective in monocots as they are in dicots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26110" pm="."><plain>However, 2x and 4x arrays of the CaMV 35S enhancer have been shown to enhance transcription of heterologous promoters in stable transformants of rice as well as to cause increased transcript accumulation of endogenous genes [27-30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26111" pm="."><plain>The Sugarcane bacilliform virus (SCBV), like the Cauliflower mosaic virus, is in the Caulimoviridae family of viruses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26112" pm="."><plain>While the Cauliflower mosaic virus is in the Caulimovirus genus and mostly infects dicots, SCBV is in the Badnavirus genus along with Commelina yellow mottle virus (CoMV) and RTBV and infects monocots [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26113" pm="."><plain>Badnaviruses have circular genomes that produce a terminally redundant transcript [31,32]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26115" pm="."><plain>Promoters from several Badnaviruses have been shown to drive expression of heterologous genes in transgenic plants [16,19,22,34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26116" pm="."><plain>Because these viruses infect monocots, they may be useful sources of strong promoters for monocots. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26117" pm="."><plain>SCBV promoters from several isolates of the virus have been tested in transgenic plants and shown to be highly expressed in most tissues tested [21,22,36]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26119" pm="."><plain>This work also presents a dissection of the SCBV-IM promoter and the identification of sequences that can enhance transcription when placed upstream of a truncated maize alcohol dehydrogenase (ZmADH1) promoter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26120" pm="."><plain>Similar to what was seen with the CaMV 35S enhancer [8,37-39], multiple tandem copies of the SCBV-IM enhancer are more effective in increasing transcription than a single copy. </plain></SENT>
