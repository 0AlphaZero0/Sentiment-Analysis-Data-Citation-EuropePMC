</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="26434" pm="."><plain>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a major risk factor for liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26435" pm="."><plain>Approximately, 175 million persons, representing 3% of the whole world population, are affected worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26436" pm="."><plain>HCV infection is now endemic in many countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26437" pm="."><plain>Egypt has the highest prevalence of HCV worldwide; where 6% to 20% of the Egyptian population are HCV positive with an average of 13.8% [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26438" pm="."><plain>HCV, which is a member of the Hepacivirus group of the Flaviviridae family, is an enveloped virus with a single stranded positive sense RNA genome [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26439" pm="."><plain>The HCV genome encodes a single poly-protein that is cleaved into 10 mature proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26440" pm="."><plain>The structural proteins are located near the 5' end of the poly-protein and the non-structural proteins are located near the 3' end [4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26441" pm="."><plain>HCV isolates have been classified into seven genotypes and several subtypes, differing in about 20–25% of the nucleotide sequences [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26442" pm="."><plain>HCV has a very high mutation rate of about 10E-5 error/nt, with large genetic heterogeneity and variability due to the lack of any proofreading mechanism [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26443" pm="."><plain>The geographical distribution of genotypes and subtypes differs greatly from one region to another [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26444" pm="."><plain>In the Middle East and Africa, HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) is the most common genotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26445" pm="."><plain>In Egypt, genotype 4 is the most predominant genotype, and 4a is the dominant subtype [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26446" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Genotype 4 has recently spread to several European countries [9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26447" pm="."><plain>A pool of phylogenetic- related viral quasispecies exists in the blood of infected persons due to the high mutation rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26448" pm="."><plain>The genomes of these quasispecies vary slightly and fluctuate during the course of the disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26449" pm="."><plain>However, the changes in the consensus sequence of a viral population occur only if the population equilibrium is altered by a selection mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26450" pm="."><plain>As discussed in [11], the viral variants may be related to differences in transmissibility, immunogenicity, or pathogenicity, which should be taken into consideration in the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26451" pm="."><plain>The E1/E2 region harbors the E1 and E2 glycoproteins, which are thought to be the viral attachment proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26452" pm="."><plain>This region demonstrates a high level of variability, especially at two sub-regions known as HVR1 and HVR2 [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26453" pm="."><plain>This variability is thought to be related either to the non-clearance of the virus or the resistance to antiviral therapies [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26454" pm="."><plain>This variability also poses a major challenge in vaccine design, where the objective is the identification of protective epitopes conserved across different strains of HCV [14] [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26455" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of HCV E1/E2 region, very few studies have sequenced the full length of the related sequence, especially for genotype 4a. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26456" pm="."><plain>From our data retrieval work described in this paper, there are only 8 Egyptian Genotype 4a sequences covering the E1/E2 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26457" pm="."><plain>The other Egyptian sequences cover only fraction of the region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26458" pm="."><plain>For non-Egyptian Genotype 4a sequences, there are only 6 sequences covering the E1/E2 region and the other ones cover only a fraction of the region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26459" pm="."><plain>There is also no study that analyzed all these sequences and compared them to each other to identify temporal as well as region specific variability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="26460" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we have focused on the E1/E2 region and studied its variability among Egyptian and non-Egyptian isolates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26461" pm="."><plain>Specifically, 1) we sequenced 36 viral genome segments from five patients with HCV genotype 4a covering the E1/E2 region (of about 1,672 nucleotides), 2) we collected all publically available sequences covering E1/E2 genotype 4a and compared them to each other and to our new sequences considering time of isolation and geographical location, and 3) we estimated the rate of change within the Egyptian and Non-Egyptian isolates. </plain></SENT>
