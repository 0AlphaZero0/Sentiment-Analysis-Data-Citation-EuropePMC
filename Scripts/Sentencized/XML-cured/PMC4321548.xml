</text></SecTag></p></abstract><abstract><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="27148" pm="."><plain>Drought stress conditions modify source–sink relations, thereby influencing plant growth, adaptive responses, and consequently crop yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27149" pm="."><plain>Invertases are key metabolic enzymes regulating sink activity through the hydrolytic cleavage of sucrose into hexose monomers, thus playing a crucial role in plant growth and development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27150" pm="."><plain>However, the physiological role of invertases during adaptation to abiotic stress conditions is not yet fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27151" pm="."><plain>Here it is shown that plant adaptation to drought stress can be markedly improved in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) by overexpression of the cell wall invertase (cwInv) gene CIN1 from Chenopodium rubrum. CIN1 overexpression limited stomatal conductance under normal watering regimes, leading to reduced water consumption during the drought period, while photosynthetic activity was maintained. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27152" pm="."><plain>This caused a strong increase in water use efficiency (up to 50%), markedly improving water stress adaptation through an efficient physiological strategy of dehydration avoidance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27153" pm="."><plain>Drought stress strongly reduced cwInv activity and induced its proteinaceous inhibitor in the leaves of the wild-type plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27154" pm="."><plain>However, the CIN1-overexpressing plants registered 3- to 6-fold higher cwInv activity in all analysed conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27155" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the enhanced invertase activity did not result in increased hexose concentrations due to the activation of the metabolic carbohydrate fluxes, as reflected by the maintenance of the activity of key enzymes of primary metabolism and increased levels of sugar-phosphate intermediates under water deprivation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27156" pm="."><plain>The induced sink metabolism in the leaves explained the maintenance of photosynthetic activity, delayed senescence, and increased source activity under drought stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27157" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CIN1 plants also presented a better control of production of reactive oxygen species and sustained membrane protection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27158" pm="."><plain>Those metabolic changes conferred by CIN1 overexpression were accompanied by increases in the concentrations of the senescence-delaying hormone trans-zeatin and decreases in the senescence-inducing ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the leaves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27159" pm="."><plain>Thus, cwInv critically functions at the integration point of metabolic, hormonal, and stress signals, providing a novel strategy to overcome drought-induced limitations to crop yield, without negatively affecting plant fitness under optimal growth conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27161" pm="."><plain>The prospect of global warming coinciding with the continuous increase in the human population is projected to have a significant impact on the demands imposed on contemporary agricultural production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27162" pm="."><plain>Abiotic stresses in general, and, more specifically, drought stress, have a strong negative impact on crop yield, because they create suboptimal growth conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27163" pm="."><plain>Therefore, drought tolerance has attracted much attention and investment from private, public, academic, and philanthropic sectors (Marris, 2008; Lybbert and Bell, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27164" pm="."><plain>There is an urgent need to generate plants that are optimized in terms of tolerance to reduced water quantity and quality to support growth and development (Lybbert and Bell, 2010), which most probably cannot be achieved using only traditional methods of plant breeding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27165" pm="."><plain>Drought stress leads to physiological modifications such as reduced photosynthesis, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of various genes, and osmolyte biosynthesis (Seki et al., 2007; Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27166" pm="."><plain>Classic genetic engineering approaches involved target genes that function in mechanisms used by plants to avoid and/or tolerate drought, such as stomatal conductance, ionic homeostasis, or osmolyte production (Hirayama and Shinozaki, 2010), which, however, typically resulted in a trade-off causing reduced fitness or yield penalties under normal growth conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27167" pm="."><plain>Such genes, frequently identified through expression profiling, include signalling components and downstream effector genes (Skirycz et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27168" pm="."><plain>However, the advances provided by modern plant molecular biology and genetics could identify a new class of target genes (Webster et al., 2012) linked to useful traits such as resistance to drought, salt, and other abiotic stress conditions, without negative impacts on plant fitness. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27169" pm="."><plain>Plant fitness is intrinsically linked to the ability to produce and consume carbohydrates in a tissue-specific manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27170" pm="."><plain>In higher plants, growth and metabolism of sink tissues is sustained by the carbohydrates synthesized in source leaves, which are transported mainly as sucrose through the phloem into the sink tissues (Koch, 2004; Roitsch and González, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27171" pm="."><plain>Source–sink relationships are dynamic and change during development and in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses (Roitsch, 1999; Balibrea et al., 2000 2003; Roitsch and González, 2004; Albacete et al., 2014b ). In general, under abiotic stress conditions, the competition between different physiological processes and sink organs for the limited carbon supplies leads to a reduction in the sink strength, affecting overall plant growth and crop yield (Cuartero and Fernández-Muñoz, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27173" pm="."><plain>The use of sucrose in the sink tissues requires cleavage of the glycosidic bond, catalysed by both sucrose synthase and invertases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27174" pm="."><plain>Three types of invertase isoenzymes are distinguished based on solubility, subcellular localization, pH optima, and isoelectric point: vacuolar invertase (vacInv), cytoplasmic invertase (cytInv), and cell wall-bound invertase (cwInv) (Roitsch and González, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27175" pm="."><plain>CwInv has been shown to play a crucial role in plant development by regulating sink strength, ensuring the steady supply of photoassimilates to sink tissues (Tang et al., 1999; Goetz et al., 2001; Roitsch et al., 2003; Weschke et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27176" pm="."><plain>Under water stress, differences in storage carbohydrate accumulation in drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant wheat were correlated with differences in sugar profiles, expression of cwInv genes, and levels of fructan biosynthesis in the anther and ovary (Ji et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27177" pm="."><plain>Also, Koonjul et al. (2005) reported that transitory water deficit in wheat during male meiosis selectively down-regulated the transcription of two genes encoding a vacuolar (Ivr5) and a cell wall (Ivr1) invertase isoform in the anthers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27178" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that pollen sterility, or the concomitant inhibition of starch accumulation in water-stressed rice plants, is unlikely to be caused by carbohydrate starvation per se. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27179" pm="."><plain>Instead, an impairment of enzymes of sugar metabolism and starch synthesis may be among the potential causes of this failure (Sheoran and Saini, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27180" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the physiological mechanisms involved in altered assimilate partitioning and tolerance towards abiotic stress by invertases remain unclear (Albacete et al., 2010 2011 2014b; Pérez-Alfocea et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27181" pm="."><plain>The increase of sink strength through cwInv activity is a general response under stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27182" pm="."><plain>In particular, expression of the CIN1 cwInv gene from C. rubrum has been reported to increase in response to a number of different stress-related stimuli (Roitsch and Ehness, 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27183" pm="."><plain>In suspension-cultured cells, the inducing effect of the fungal elicitor chitosan could be mimicked by phosphatase inhibitors and benzoic acid (Ehness and Roitsch, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27184" pm="."><plain>Mechanical wounding of source leaves of Chenopodium rubrum plants also resulted in increased CIN1 mRNA levels, showing the wide range of stress-related stimuli affecting CIN1 expression (Roitsch et al., 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27185" pm="."><plain>In addition, cwInv is regulated at transcriptional and post-translational levels by many different factors including sugars (Roitsch et al., 1995 2003; Roitsch, 1999), phytohormones (Roitsch et al., 2003; Balibrea et al., 2004; Roitsch and González, 2004), and proteinaceous inhibitors (Rausch and Greiner, 2004; Bonfig et al., 2010; McKenzie et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27186" pm="."><plain>Together, these mechanisms allow a fine-tuned regulation of the cwInv activity to control growth, development, and, therefore, plant adaptation under abiotic stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27187" pm="."><plain>CwInv thus works as a pivotal enzyme at the integration point of metabolic, hormonal, and stress signals (Proels and Roitsch, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27188" pm="."><plain>In this study, it is shown that overexpression of the cwInv gene CIN1 in tomato dramatically increases whole-plant water use efficiency (WUE) under water stress conditions, through a strategy of dehydration avoidance, providing a novel approach to overcome drought-induced limitations to crop productivity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27543" pm="."><plain>Although plant responses to drought stress have been intensively studied for many years, progress in the development of tolerant crops has been slow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27544" pm="."><plain>A number of genes, including those involved in the production of osmotic adjustment, detoxification of ROS, and transcription factors, have been employed to increase drought tolerance in transgenic plants (Munns and Tester, 2008; Faize et al., 2011; Skirycz et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27545" pm="."><plain>However, the success rate is typically very low, probably due to the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that are controlling growth under water stress conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27546" pm="."><plain>In general, adaptation or engineered tolerance to drought is accompanied by adverse effects on development and yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27547" pm="."><plain>Therefore, maintaining growth, photosynthesis, and metabolism are the major goals to minimize the impact of abiotic stress on crop yield. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27548" pm="."><plain>Here it is shown that ectopic expression of the CIN1 gene encoding a cwInv from C. rubrum resulted in various metabolic changes that improved tomato adaptation to drought stress conditions by increasing WUE. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27549" pm="."><plain>Many studies demonstrated that decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration under drought stress conditions is the main factor limiting photosynthesis (Chernyad’ev, 1997; Chaves et al., 2009; Galmés et al., 2011), and assimilate transport in phloem sets conditions for gas exchange (Nikinmaa et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27550" pm="."><plain>The present results show that CIN1 plants had limited whole-plant transpiration during drought stress, and importantly WUE increased (Fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27551" pm="."><plain>In fact, under control conditions, stomatal conductance was reduced in the CIN1 plants (Fig. 2E), leading to reduced water consumption during the drought period, while photosynthetic activity was maintained (Fig. 3A–C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27552" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increased stomatal conductance observed in the transgenic plants at the end of the drought period is explained by the higher water availability in the soil, compared with the WT plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27553" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it seems that CIN1 plants present a better control of stomatal closure explained by metabolic factors since it has been demonstrated that sugar levels and sucrolytic activities play important roles in guard cell function with impacts on WUE (Antunes et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27554" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been reported that vacuolar invertase activity was higher in guard cells than in other epidermal cells and it plays an important role in regulating stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis (Ni, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27555" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the increased cwInv activity (Fig. 1B) and hexose concentrations (Fig. 4D) observed in the leaves of CIN1 plants under normal watering regimes could provoke a reduction in the stomatal conductance retaining water for the drought period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27556" pm="."><plain>Similarly, it has been reported that overexpression of the Arabidopsis trehalase AtTRE1 gene, the only enzyme known in this species specifically to hydrolyse trehalose into glucose, leads to increased drought stress tolerance through an induction of stomatal closure (Van Houtte et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27557" pm="."><plain>Other trehalose enzymes and intermediates, such as trehalose-6-phosphate, have also been linked to abiotic stress tolerance in tomato (Delorge et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27558" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the lower stomatal conductance observed in the WT plants at the end of the drought period can be explained by the higher level of stress due to reduced soil moisture compared with CIN1 plants (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27559" pm="."><plain>After the initial assimilate accumulation under stress, photosynthesis may be inhibited by metabolic factors, stomatal-derived signals, and other regulatory mechanisms, while stress-induced leaf senescence limits whole-plant photosynthesis (Munns and Tester, 2008), as seems to be the case in the WT and the aphenotypic CIN1-8 line (Fig. 3A–C) due to the expected hexose accumulation (Fig. 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27560" pm="."><plain>Avoiding feedback inhibition of photosynthesis by co-ordinating the assimilate transport between source and sink tissues by invertases and/or partitioning of sugars towards starch accumulation may maintain photosynthetic activity under harmful environmental conditions (Stitt, 1991; Koch, 1996) and thus delay leaf senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27561" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that engineered drought tolerance in tomato is reflected in chlorophyll fluorescence emission signatures (Mishra et al., 2012), and similar changes were also observed in the CIN1 plants (Fig. 3A, B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27562" pm="."><plain>An increase in the concentrations of the invertase products fructose and glucose would be expected, as has been recently shown in rice plants that overexpress the cwInv gen GIF1 related to induced pathogen defence (Sun et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27563" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, despite higher cwInv activities (Fig. 1B), fructose and glucose contents in droughted leaves of CIN1 plants were lower than those in the WT, but similar to those of control leaves (Fig. 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27564" pm="."><plain>These results resemble the effect of ectopic expression of cwInv in delaying natural or light-induced senescence in transgenic tobacco plants (Balibrea et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27565" pm="."><plain>The unexpected finding that an increase in cwInv in CIN1 plants does not result in an increase in hexose steady-state concentrations would explain the maintenance of photosynthetic activity despite the activation of sink metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27566" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the delay of senescence induced by cwInv in CIN1 plants may be related to an activation of the metabolic carbohydrate flux. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27567" pm="."><plain>The resulting higher rate of sugar utilization causes a decrease of hexose levels in the transgenic plants (Balibrea et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27568" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite the activation of sink metabolism, it seems that the hexose concentration does not reach the threshold level that would result in the feedback inhibition of photosynthetic gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27569" pm="."><plain>This provides a mechanism to uncouple the usually observed inverse and co-ordinated regulation of source and sink metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27570" pm="."><plain>The apparent stimulation of carbohydrate fluxes is also reflected by the finding that the transgenic plants were able to maintain higher activities of additional key enzymes of primary carbohydrate metabolism under drought stress conditions, such as aldolase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Fig. 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27571" pm="."><plain>Those enzymes are involved in sucrose and starch biosynthesis from triose-phosphate resulting from the higher photosynthetic activity, thus increasing the source activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27572" pm="."><plain>For example, it has been demonstrated that aldolase, a key enzyme for energy production, plays important roles in the tolerance to drought and salt stress by activating glycolysis (Fan et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27573" pm="."><plain>Thus, CIN1 plants were able to maintain metabolic fluxes of primary carbohydrate metabolism in support of growth and energy production for stress tolerance compared with WT plants, also reflected by higher levels of the phosphorylated intermediates fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate (Table 3; Fig. 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27574" pm="."><plain>Evidence for carbon flux shortage under water stress in sink organs (nodules) has been shown in pea plants (Gálvez et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27575" pm="."><plain>Apparently, drought tolerance is related to a fine-tuned interaction and balance between extracellular hydrolysis by the cwInv and the metabolic flux of the sink cell to avoid the accumulation of carbohydrates under harmful conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27576" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the large starch grains in leaves from CIN1 plants (Fig. 3D) indicate that changing the cycle of starch synthesis and breakdown and thus metabolic channelling could be an additional mechanism to contribute to drought stress tolerance in CIN1 plants (Sulpice et al., 2009) in order to maximize carbon uptake and growth, while minimizing osmotic impacts on photo-inhibition and photo-oxidation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="27578" pm="."><plain>Photo-inhibition and photo-oxidation are caused by the impaired consumption of NADPH by the Calvin cycle, with the subsequent transfer of photosynthetic electrons from over-reduced ferredoxin to oxygen (Mehler reaction) producing ROS that damage cell structures (Stitt, 1991; Paul and Foyer, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27579" pm="."><plain>SOD and POX activities were maintained in CIN1 plants under drought stress (Table 1), especially apoplastic SOD, which agrees with the reported accumulation of superoxide radicals under salt stress conditions in this compartment (Hernández et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27580" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that glucose and CK agonistically regulate POX activity in Arabidopsis (Kushwah and Laxmi, 2014), thus explaining the higher and stable levels of this protein in the CIN1 plants (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27581" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, many reports indicate that the ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is an effective marker of cellular redox homeostasis and may be involved in ROS activity perception by plants under drought conditions (Labudda and Azam, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27582" pm="."><plain>In this way, GSH/GSSG play a direct or indirect key role in regulating and signalling at the transcriptional and/or post-translational level due to the interaction of these molecules with other cellular redox systems such as the aforementioned enzymes SOD and POX (Anjum et al., 2012), as well as with the hormonal balance (Miao et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27583" pm="."><plain>Maintaining the activity of these two ROS-scavenging enzymes, together with decreased concentrations of oxidized glutathione (Fig. 6A) and reduced electrolyte leakage (Fig. 6B), resulted in a better control of ROS levels and sustained membrane protection in drought-stressed CIN1 plants, such as reported in the senescence-regulated CK-overproducing (SARK2::IPT) tobacco plants in response to drought (Rivero et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27584" pm="."><plain>A possible link between antioxidants and carbohydrate metabolism could be the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is essential for maintaining the cellular redox balance and shown to be critically involved in salt and drought stress responses (Dal Santo et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27585" pm="."><plain>Possibly due to the post-translational regulatory mechanism involved in the activation of this enzyme, the measured activities do not reflect the in vivo situation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27586" pm="."><plain>Sugar and hormones such as CKs are fundamental to plants and regulate a number of similar processes agonistically (Kushwah and Laxmi, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27587" pm="."><plain>It has been recently reported that glucose induces CK biosynthetic (IPT3) and perception (AHK4) genes, while it represses some CK-degrading enzymes (CKX5) in Arabidopsis (Kushwah and Laxmi, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27588" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of CIN1 under the control of the senescence-associated promoter SAG12 increased source strength and delayed developmentally regulated leaf senescence in tobacco, and identified cwInv as an essential component of the CK-mediated delay of senescence (Balibrea et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27589" pm="."><plain>More recently, the extreme drought tolerance observed in tobacco plants overexpressing the CK biosynthesis gene IPT was also related to delayed senescence due to increased CK levels, without affecting ABA levels (Rivero et al., 2007), as it occurred in the CIN1 plants (Fig. 8D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27590" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, rice plants overexpressing the IPT gene showed increased water stress tolerance and grain yield due to CK-mediated source/sink modifications (Peleg et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27591" pm="."><plain>Therefore, delayed leaf senescence of CIN1 plants under drought stress could be explained by both higher cwInv activity (Fig. 1B) and higher tZ levels in CIN1 leaves (Fig. 8A), thus mimicking the IPT-overexpressing plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27592" pm="."><plain>Additionally, stressed CIN1 plants showed a significant decrease in the ethylene precursor ACC (Fig. 8B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27593" pm="."><plain>Ethylene has been long considered a stress-related hormone that mediates leaf senescence under abiotic stress conditions (Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004), probably by inhibiting cwInv (Ghanem et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27594" pm="."><plain>Because cwInv appears to activate metabolic carbohydrate fluxes (Balibrea et al., 2004) that repress ethylene biosynthesis (Mayak and Borochov, 1984), probably through glucose suppression of ACC oxidase activity (Hong et al., 2004), leaf senescence could additionally be delayed by the reduction of ethylene levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27595" pm="."><plain>Together these data indicate that the physiological changes conferred by CIN1 overexpression during the vegetative stage are closely connected with hormonal (CKs and ethylene, but not ABA) and sugar metabolism, suggesting that a causative effect of cwInv on the regulation of plant hormonal balance and function cannot be ruled out, as has been recently demonstrated in fruits of tomato plants subjected to salt stress (Albacete et al., 2014a ). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27596" pm="."><plain>Post-translational relief of invertase from inhibition by a proteinacous inhibitor has been implicated in abiotic stress tolerance (Ruan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27597" pm="."><plain>The in vivo functionality and the physiological significance of these inhibitors in plant growth, development and stress responses have been demonstrated only recently (Jin et al., 2009; Bonfig et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27598" pm="."><plain>Such post-translational regulation is particularly relevant to cwInv because these proteins are intrinsically stable due to their glycosylation (Rausch and Greiner, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27599" pm="."><plain>Increased invertase inhibitor activity in the CIN1 plants under control conditions probably reflects feedback regulation to decrease the ectopic transgenic cwInv activities and minimize negative impacts on phloem loading (Fig. 4E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27600" pm="."><plain>In contrast, drought stress resulted in a strong decrease of the invertase inhibition, thus linking the local induction and/or maintenance of the sink strength to stress responses by derepression of the invertase activity present. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p content-type="indent"><text><SENT sid="27601" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results show that although the promoter employed should confer predominantly expression in developing tomato fruits (Albacete et al., 2014a ), a weak vegetative CIN1 expression was already sufficient to confer tolerance towards drought stress without affecting plant fitness under optimal growth conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27602" pm="."><plain>A reduced water use and an increased source activity explained by changes in metabolic fluxes, and hormonal and redox status suggest that the physiological mechanisms regulated by cell wall invertase play a key role in abiotic stress adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27603" pm="."><plain>The results presented in this study are very promising because enhanced WUE and plant adaptation to drought stress would contribute to the development of new varieties with reduced yield penalties in the most economically important horticultural areas, where water resources are scarce. </plain></SENT>
