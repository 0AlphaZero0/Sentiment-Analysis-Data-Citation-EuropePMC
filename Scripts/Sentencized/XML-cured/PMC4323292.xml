</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="27700" pm="."><plain>During the time of World War II, antimicrobial agents were first widely utilized to treat bacterial infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27701" pm="."><plain>Since that time, antimicrobial agent use has gradually increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27702" pm="."><plain>In addition to huge use in the treatment of human illnesses, antibiotics are commonly used in veterinary medicine and usually added to the nourish of food producing animals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27703" pm="."><plain>Random use of antimicrobial agents may cause existing populations of microorganisms that are antimicrobial resistant or multi-drug resistant (MDR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27704" pm="."><plain>These microorganisms may be shed in faeces with following contamination of soil, food, and aquatic environments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27705" pm="."><plain>While antimicrobial agents have confirmed a successful way against bacterial contamination and infection, their widespread use has produced a reservoir of antimicrobial agents and MDR microorganisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27706" pm="."><plain>The occurrence and persistence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in such environments as sediment (Timoney et al., 1978), soil (Trevors, 1987), surface water (Bell et al., 1980; Wnorowski, 1993), municipal drinking water (Armstrong et al., 1981; Calomiris et al., 1984; Moffie and Mouton, 1988) and sewage (Altherr and Kasweck, 1982; Middleton and Ambrose, 2005; Murray et al., 1984; Walter and Vennes, 1985), is a growing public health concern. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27707" pm="."><plain>The appearance of MDR bacteria of animals, birds and human (Grobbel et al., 2007) is accompanied by co-contamination of the environment leading to a great health alarm (Martinez, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27708" pm="."><plain>In addition to the present detection of MDR bacteria in high human density sites (Cole et al., 2005), their incidence in more distant regions like high mountains or the arctic is more concern (Caprioli et al., 1991; Sjolund et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27709" pm="."><plain>The presence of bacteria of potential zoonotic importance among migrating and non-migrating wild birds has public health significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27710" pm="."><plain>Different of pathogenic bacterial species have been isolated from wild birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27711" pm="."><plain>Migrating and non-migrating wild birds can also act as reservoirs of coliform bacteria, such as E. coli, carrying antimicrobial-resistance genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27712" pm="."><plain>Water contact and acquirement by food seem to be the main factors of transmission of resistant bacteria from human or veterinary origin to wild animals (Cole et al., 2005; Kozak et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27713" pm="."><plain>Migrating and non-migrating wild birds or general wild animals could therefore serve as reservoirs of resistant bacteria and genetic factors of antimicrobial resistance (Dolejska et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27714" pm="."><plain>Antimicrobial resistance has been known as an emerging worldwide problem in both human and veterinary medicine, and antimicrobial use is considered the most important factor for the emergence, selection, and distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (Winokur et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27715" pm="."><plain>Enteropathogenic strains, such as the vero cytotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 strain, are the agent of colibacillosis and have been isolated from healthy or diseased wild birds, including migrants such as Ardea cinerea, B. canadensis, Cygnus columbianus, U. aalge, and Columba palumbus (Hubalek, 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27716" pm="."><plain>These migrating birds can become carriers of E. coli strains resistant to antimicrobial agents and can be responsible for the spread of R plasmids over the world (Kanai et al., 1981). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27717" pm="."><plain>Migratory waterfowl may serve as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance of thermotolerant faecal indicator organisms (Middleton and Ambrose, 2005). E. coli isolates originating from Arctic birds carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27718" pm="."><plain>The problem of antimicrobial resistance worldwide is one of the foremost issues that we face in the coming decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27719" pm="."><plain>We strongly believe that there is an urgent requirement for research on how to comprehensively address the problems of antimicrobial resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27720" pm="."><plain>The problem of resistance as a public health threat has increased significantly over the last decade and local solutions are needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27721" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to obtain detailed understanding of possible migrating and non-migrating wild birds carry and spread of drug-resistant Escherichia spp. in the environment which could form a potential hazard to human and animal health by transmission of antimicrobial-resistant strains to waterways and environmental sources through faecal deposits. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="27722" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this work was approached to isolate, characterize and verify the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia spp. in migrating and non-migrating wild birds with an attention on the detection of MDR bacteria. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28259" pm="."><plain>Binding of congo red dye by E. coli is associated with the pathogenicity of the organism (Styles and Flammer, 1991). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28260" pm="."><plain>The present results indicated that positive congo red binding of Escherichia spp. isolates was significantly higher in migrating birds and lower in non-migrating birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28261" pm="."><plain>Congo red binding has been used as a potential virulence marker, which indicated that these isolates were pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28262" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hemolysin production is presumed to be a virulence factor in extraintestinal, e.g. urinary tract, infections caused by E. coli (Hacker, 1983). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28263" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that hemolysin production of isolates was significantly higher in migrating birds and lower in non-migrating birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28264" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that these isolates showed one to two virulence factors (congo red binding and hemolysis). E. coli is one of the common microbial flora of gastrointestinal tract of birds, animals and human but may become pathogenic to both (Levine, 1987). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="28285" pm="."><plain>Due to indiscriminate exploitation of antimicrobial agents, such high prevalence of multi-drug resistance may apparently be occurred which may ultimately replace the drug sensitive microorganisms from antimicrobial saturated environment (Van de Boogard and Stobberingh, 2000). </plain></SENT>
