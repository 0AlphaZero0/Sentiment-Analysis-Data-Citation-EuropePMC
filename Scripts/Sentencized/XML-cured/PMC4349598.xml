<SENT sid="29487" pm="."><plain>In an effort to prevent degeneration of adjacent segments (ASDeg) due to loss of mobility at the operated level, cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) was introduced. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29509" pm="."><plain>Cervical degenerative disc disease is defined as complaints due to degenerative changes of the intervertebral disc and the intervertebral disc space. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29510" pm="."><plain>Herniation of the intervertebral disc itself or surrounding osteophytes cause radiculopathy due to compression of a nerve root, leading to pain and/or sensory and/or motor deficit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29511" pm="."><plain>It can also lead to compression of the spinal cord itself causing myelopathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29512" pm="."><plain>Surgery can be considered if there is insufficient relief of symptoms with conservative treatment options, such as physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or immobilisation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29513" pm="."><plain>Goal of surgery is relieving radiating arm pain in case of radiculopathy and prevention of progressive neurological deficits in case of myelopathy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29514" pm="."><plain>The most commonly performed procedure is the anterior cervical discectomy, which is being performed either with, or without fusion promoting methods (called ‘fusion’ and ‘simple discectomy’, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29515" pm="."><plain>Clinical results of these methods are similarly good. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29516" pm="."><plain>Both methods have a high rate of fusion, up to 80% in simple discectomy, and over 95% in fusion [1-4]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29517" pm="."><plain>There is much debate whether fusion is a contributing factor to accelerated degeneration of adjacent motion segments (adjacent segment degeneration, ASDeg) or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29518" pm="."><plain>When this degeneration causes complaints, it is called adjacent segment disease (ASDis). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29519" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of ASDis is reported to be 2.9% [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29520" pm="."><plain>It is not clear if fusion is in fact the culprit, or if it is just progression of degeneration in an ageing spine [6-9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29521" pm="."><plain>In an effort to prevent degeneration of adjacent segments due to loss of mobility at the operated level, cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) was introduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29522" pm="."><plain>In CDA, a mobile disc prosthesis is inserted during surgery to preserve mobility of the operated spinal segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29523" pm="."><plain>Short term clinical results for CDA are comparable to fusion, which’s results are comparable to simple discectomy [4,10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29524" pm="."><plain>Long term studies are necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in preventing ASDis [10,12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29525" pm="."><plain>Prevention of ASDis is based on the premise that mobile disc prostheses preserve cervical spine motion in a physiological way. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29526" pm="."><plain>Motion of the cervical spine is commonly measured by means of flexion-extension radiographs, which give information about the segmental range of motion (sROM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29527" pm="."><plain>It suffers from a high intra- and inter-individual variability, severely limiting its use as a tool for diagnosis and follow-up in the individual patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29528" pm="."><plain>The sequence in which motion segments contribute to the movement to maximum extension or flexion in the entire cervical spine has been reported to be a more consistent parameter in healthy controls [13-15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29529" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a randomized controlled study to investigate the influence of implanting a mobile disc prosthesis on motion in the cervical spine was designed, using analysis of the sequence of segmental contributions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29530" pm="."><plain>Primary objective of the study is to ascertain whether a mobile cervical disc prosthesis restores/preserves the sequence of segmental contributions that is present in healthy controls, in contrast to patients undergoing simple discectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29531" pm="."><plain>Secondary goal is to evaluate the clinical results of CDA with the prosthesis used, compared to simple discectomy, to determine if results are comparable to reported results for this type of surgery. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29622" pm="."><plain>The role of segmental fusion as a cause of ASDis, is widely discussed, and as the intended purpose of arthroplasty is prevention of ASDis, so is the indication for this type of treatment [6,9,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29623" pm="."><plain>Given the fairly low incidence of ASDis, which has been reported to be about 2.9% annually, large studies with long term follow up are necessary to be able to determine the efficacy of arthroplasty to in fact prevent ASDis [8,18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29624" pm="."><plain>As an alternative to these studies the authors decided to investigate the premise itself, that arthroplasty does in fact restore/preserve a normal sequence of segmental contributions in the cervical spine, while simple discectomy is likely to do not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29625" pm="."><plain>Although a fused segment (in any of the two groups) will have no significant contribution, the sequence of the remaining segments is still of use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29626" pm="."><plain>As this gives information about the influence of a fused segment on the rest of the cervical spine, and if there is a larger disturbance than simply a missing peak. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29627" pm="."><plain>Many studies investigating arthroplasty determine mobility of the target level by measuring sROM before and after surgery, which allows for the conclusion that there is mobility, but gives no information other than the quantity of mobility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29628" pm="."><plain>The authors therefore chose to use a method that was previously used in healthy controls to describe the dynamic process of cervical spine mobility in more detail, using the sequence of segmental contributions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29629" pm="."><plain>This sequence has been reported to be much more consistent than sROMs, which are limited by high intra- and inter-individual variability [13-15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29630" pm="."><plain>Since the results are more consistent, sample size can be lower. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29631" pm="."><plain>No results from a randomized controlled trial about the prosthesis used have been reported to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29632" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measures were therefore also included as secondary outcome measures, to evaluate if clinical results are in line with previous reports about other cervical disc prostheses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29633" pm="."><plain>As in almost all surgical studies, caregivers and X-ray analyses cannot be blinded, and patients report their own outcomes, therewith invoking risk of bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29634" pm="."><plain>This is a common weakness in this type of study, as blinding patients in these types of device studies is often regarded as not ethically appropriate, and most of the clinical outcomes are patient-reported outcomes [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29635" pm="."><plain>As a result, many of the outcomes may suffer from bias, although the differences that have been reported so far were usually small [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29636" pm="."><plain>The radiological outcome cannot be blinded completely since the prosthesis is clearly visible in the FFER, and although the motion analysis is performed by image recognition software, these analyses are checked manually to avoid errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29637" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome data are collected by a blinded caregiver; since the patient is not blinded the possibility of the caregiver receiving information about the surgery is therefore present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29638" pm="."><plain>Sample size is small in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29639" pm="."><plain>However, given the large expected difference in the amount of fusion between the groups, and the consistent findings when analysing sequence of segmental contributions, the authors expect to be able to draw conclusions about the primary outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29640" pm="."><plain>For the secondary outcomes the sample size will be too small. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29641" pm="."><plain>However, the authors’ haven previously shown that clinically relevant differences are not to be expected, and only aim to see if results are in line with those described in literature [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29642" pm="."><plain>The study is industry sponsored, as are most of the RCTs on this subject [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29643" pm="."><plain>This also can lead to bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29644" pm="."><plain>The influence of a conflict of interest on outcomes in trials investigating CDA has recently been investigated, which led to the conclusion that while there was no influence on quality of life outcomes, it was associated with lower reported complication rates [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29645" pm="."><plain>In the current study the sponsor has no influence on planning or conducting the study, no influence on data acquisition or analysis, or any aspect of the publication process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29646" pm="."><plain>The study has several strengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29647" pm="."><plain>First, the inclusion criteria are very strict. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29648" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of subjects with multiple degenerated segments would make it hard to distinguish between effects on the target level and adjacent levels due to the surgery, or due to pre-existent degenerative changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29649" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of only single level cases, without degenerative changes to the other levels, will therefore minimize confounding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29650" pm="."><plain>Second, the method of radiological analysis gives more information than the traditionally made function radiographs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29651" pm="."><plain>This allows for a more thorough analysis of mobility of the target level, as well as motion patterns of the cervical spine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29652" pm="."><plain>This enables a clearer conclusion if cervical spine motion can be defined as physiological after arthroplasty, when compared to simple discectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29653" pm="."><plain>As restoring normal mobility is the premise of the possible reduction of ASD through use of CDA, this method of analysis therefore allows for and earlier indication if a specific type of prosthesis might be able to reduce ASD in the future. </plain></SENT>
