<SENT sid="29720" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="29721" pm="."><plain>The Rho family of small (20–40 kDa) GTPases, which are monomeric G-proteins, belong to the Ras superfamily of GTPases containing more than 150 proteins [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29722" pm="."><plain>The Ras superfamily has been classified into 5 subfamilies based on their sequence similarity which are Ras, Rho, Rab, Ran, and Arf [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29723" pm="."><plain>The Rho family of GTPases are cell membrane-associated GTP-binding proteins that actively participate in cell signaling networks, which regulate actin organization, cell cycle progression and gene expression [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29724" pm="."><plain>Up to date, 20 members of Rho GTPases have been found in four main subclasses, namely, Rho, Rnd, Rac, and Cdc42 [2, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29725" pm="."><plain>Rho GTPases are the most fundamental regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, along with other crucial properties in the cell, such as cell adhesion, gene transcription and cell proliferation, cell motility, vesicular trafficking, phagocytosis, and cytokinesis [2, 4–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29726" pm="."><plain>Similar to other G-proteins and GTPases, Rho family proteins can serve as molecular switches, by binding to either GDP or GTP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29727" pm="."><plain>GTPases are active and are capable of transmitting cell signals to downstream proteins when they are bound to GTP and inactive when they are bound to GDP [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29728" pm="."><plain>Since nucleotide association and dissociation are normally slow, some regulators within the cell catalyze the process of cycling between GDP- and GTP-bound states of Rho GTPases [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29729" pm="."><plain>These regulators are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29730" pm="."><plain>GEFs stimulate the substitution of GDP for GTP to activate Rho GTPases, whereas GAPs inactivate Rho GTPases by stimulating the substitution of GTP for GDP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29731" pm="."><plain>GDIs avoid the dissociation of GDP from GTPases and retain them in their nonsignaling state [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29732" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide exchange occurs due to the conformational changes in Switch I and Switch II regions of GTPases, upon their contact with GEFs/GAPs [5, 11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29733" pm="."><plain>Owing to the important role of Rho GTPases in cell signaling events and several cellular functions, they are favored by many bacterial pathogens as targets to deliver cytotoxins [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29734" pm="."><plain>Bacterial effector proteins invade host cells via a specialized secretion system and regulate Rho GTPases by mimicking either GEF or GAP activity [10, 19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29735" pm="."><plain>Examples of such bacteria are Burkholderia, Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29736" pm="."><plain>These bacteria use type III secretion system to inject their effector proteins directly into the host cell via a needle complex extending from the bacterial membrane and cytosol [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29737" pm="."><plain>Bacterial proteins disorganize the actin cytoskeleton by depolymerization of actin stress fibers of the host cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29738" pm="."><plain>By rearranging actin dynamics, they disrupt cell shape and motility, phagocytosis, and cell division. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29739" pm="."><plain>Additionally, bacterial effector proteins can manipulate GTPase signaling mechanism and can transmit signals to downstream effector proteins [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29740" pm="."><plain>As a result, bacterial effector proteins can lead to many diseases, including infection and cancer [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29741" pm="."><plain>YopE also has been reported to weaken the immune system of the host cell by affecting cytokine production and cause bubonic plague [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29742" pm="."><plain>In this work, the bacterial protein toxin Yersinia outer protein E (YopE), which has been found to exert GAP activity towards RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 of GTPases in vitro, is investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29743" pm="."><plain>[25–27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29744" pm="."><plain>YopE has been reported to disrupt actin cytoskeleton, prevent phagocytosis, and weaken host cell's immune system by affecting cytokine production [28–31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29745" pm="."><plain>YopE, shown in Figure 1, is a monomeric protein of 219 amino acids, with a four antiparallel α-helix bundle, four small helices, and two β-strands [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29746" pm="."><plain>C-terminal domain of YopE between residues 90–219 is essential for its virulence since it comprises the bacterial GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29747" pm="."><plain>Similar to other GAP proteins, YopE has an arginine residue (Arg144) that is reported to be essential for GAP activity [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29748" pm="."><plain>In addition to Arg144, residues 182–184 are reported to be conserved among other bacterial GAP proteins, which are ExoS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and SptP of Salmonella spp. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29749" pm="."><plain>(22% sequence identity with ExoSGAP and 29% sequence identity with SptPGAP) [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29750" pm="."><plain>YopE interactions with G-proteins are investigated and important YopE residues that govern its activity are reported by several studies [1, 3, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29751" pm="."><plain>Residues Ile106, Leu109, Thr138, Gly139, Ser140, and Gln149 are observed to interact with Switch II region of the GTPases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29752" pm="."><plain>The key residue Arg144 along with Thr183, Ile184, and Gly185 is reported to contact the nucleotide and both of the switch regions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29754" pm="."><plain>Up to date, no cocrystallized or experimentally discovered ligands of YopE have been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29755" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of type III secretion system has been investigated by several studies [33–37], and 23 compounds that belong to a class of acylated hydrazones of different salicylaldehydes that prevent YopE secretion in vitro have been identified [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29756" pm="."><plain>Salicylidene acylhydrazides, which have been denoted as a class of antivirulence compounds, were also reported to obstruct type III secretion of other Gram-negative bacteria other than Yersinia [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29757" pm="."><plain>Although there were a number of mechanisms postulated, the inhibition mechanism and the target proteins of these salicylidene acylhydrazides were the focus of several studies [38, 40, 41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29758" pm="."><plain>Recently, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis proteins Tpx and WrbA, which take role in YopE secretion,were recognized as targets of these compounds, [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29759" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, other potential targets of salicylidene acylhydrazides remain unknown, whose identification is essential for the investigation and design of new therapeutic molecules against bacterial secretion mechanism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="29760" pm="."><plain>Here, we represent a hybrid virtual screening approach to identify molecules with inhibition potential against YopE, using computational drug discovery tools. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="29932" pm="."><plain>Proper functioning of GTPases is crucial for the regulation of signaling events within the cell, and therefore, drug design against GTPase inhibitors, such as YopE, is an important area of research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29933" pm="."><plain>Here, we used virtual screening to investigate potent drug-like inhibitors of YopE. </plain></SENT>
