This study investigates the conservation of the genes AtTZF1-5 at the level of their sequences and expression across plant species. The genomic sequences of the two RR-TZF genes TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B were isolated in durum wheat and assigned to chromosomes 3A and 3B, respectively.

In particular, analysis of plants with attenuated and overexpressed AtTZF3 indicate that AtTZF3 is a negative regulator of seed germination under conditions of salt stress. Finally, comparative sequence analyses establish that the RR-TZF genes are encoded by lower plants, including the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens and the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The regulation of the Physcomitrella AtTZF1-2-3-like genes by salt stress strongly suggests that a subgroup of the RR-TZF proteins has a function that has been conserved throughout evolution. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group><kwd>RR-TZF</kwd><kwd>CCCH zinc finger proteins</kwd><kwd>abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>germination</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic analysis</kwd><kwd>durum wheat</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic></kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Ministry for Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF)</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">NUTRIGEA and TERRAVITA Programmes</funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">Ministry for Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)</funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">AGROGEN</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="52"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="30925" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="30926" pm="."><plain>Zinc-finger proteins constitute one of the largest and most diverse families of plant regulatory proteins, and increasing evidenc indicates that they act as key factors in several biological processes, such as morphogenesis and responses to environmental stress (Hall, 2005; Lin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30927" pm="."><plain>These proteins are characterized by zinc-finger motifs that consist of cysteine and/or histidine residues that coordinate a zinc ion to form local peptide structures that are generally associated with specific molecular functions (Guo et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30928" pm="."><plain>The CCCH zinc-finger motif, in particular, identifies a specific zinc-finger family, members of which have been found in many species from yeast to human (Blackshear et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008; Kramer et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30929" pm="."><plain>The gene family for these CCCH zinc-finger proteins has also been studied in plants, and various members have been identified by genome-wide analysis and have been implicated in a broad range of developmental and adaptive processes (Wang et al., 2008; Chai et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Xu, 2014). <p><text><SENT sid="30930" pm="."><plain>A particular group of the plant CCCH protein family is characterized by an arginine-rich region that contains a CHCH motif (known as the RR region) that is linked to a tandem zinc-finger (TZF) domain, which is unique to plants (Wang et al., 2008; Pomeranz et al., 2010b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30931" pm="."><plain>Members of the RR-TZF subfamily have been identified in several higher plants, including Arabidopsis (AtTZF1-11) (Wang et al., 2008; Chai et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Xu, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30932" pm="."><plain>The functions of some of the RR-TZF Arabidopsis proteins have been defined in relation to responses to a number of stress stimuli and developmental processes. PEI1 (AtTZF6) is involved in embryogenesis (Li and Thomas, 1998), and AtTZF10 and AtTZF11 (which are also known as AtSZF2 and AtSZF1, respectively) have been described as positive regulators of salt tolerance (Sun et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30934" pm="."><plain>The overexpression of AtTZF2 and AtTZF3, which are two RR-TZF genes that are regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), conferred ABA hypersensitivity, reduced transpiration, enhanced drought tolerance, and delayed jasmonic-acid-induced senescence, whereas their attenuation showed reduced tolerance to salt stress (Lee et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30935" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of another member of the RR-TZF subfamily, AtTZF1, resulted in late flowering and enhanced tolerance to cold and drought stress, while concurrent down-regulation of the AtTZF1-3 genes by RNA interference (RNAi) caused early germination and phenotypes that were relatively stress-sensitive (Lin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30936" pm="."><plain>These studies have suggested a connection between AtTZF1 and ABA- and gibberellic-acid-mediated responses (Lin et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30937" pm="."><plain>The rice OsTZF1 gene is positively regulated by polyethylene glycol and ABA, and its overexpression in transgenic rice seedlings conferred hypersensitivity to ABA (Zhang et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30938" pm="."><plain>OsTZF1 has been reported to be involved in seed germination, seedling growth, leaf senescence, and oxidative-stress tolerance (Kong et al., 2006; Jan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30939" pm="."><plain>In transgenic Arabidopsis plants, overexpression of TaZnFP, a T. aestivum gene that is induced by cold, salt, drought, and ABA, enhanced the Arabidopsis drought and salt tolerance (Min et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30940" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data indicate a role for some of the RR-TZF proteins in ABA and gibberellic-acid pathway(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30941" pm="."><plain>Indeed, it has been established that the Arabidopsis SOMNUS (AtTZF4/SOM) protein acts as a negative regulator of light-dependent seed germination, and som-mutants are characterized by reduced levels of ABA and elevated levels of gibberellic acid, which appears to be due to changes in the expression of the ABA and gibberellic-acid metabolic genes (Kim et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30942" pm="."><plain>AtTZF4/SOM is positively regulated by the phytochrome-interacting factor-3-like 5 (PIL5) and ABA insensitive 3 (ABI3) transcription factors, which together bind to the AtTZF4/SOM promoter (Kim et al., 2008; Park et al., 2011). <p><text><SENT sid="30943" pm="."><plain>A putative RR-TZF gene was previously identified in durum wheat as a cold-responsive EST (EST002H8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30944" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the expression of this RR-TZF gene was also modulated by drought in a developmental- and genotype-dependent manner (Mastrangelo et al., 2005; De Leonardis et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30945" pm="."><plain>To gain further insight into this putative RR-TZF gene and its regulation, we identified and characterized two homeologous genes, named TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B that correspond to EST002H8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30946" pm="."><plain>Based on the sequence similarity, gene structure, and expression analysis, we established that AtTZF1, AtTZF2, and AtTZF3 (indicated as AtTZF1-2-3) are putative orthologs of the durum wheat TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B genes. In addition, we showed that AtTZF3 is a negative factor in the control of Arabidopsis seed germination in the presence of salt. Finally, an evolutionary computational analysis indicated the presence of highly conserved AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins in phylogenetically distant species, such as the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. Similar to the Arabidopsis AtTZF1-5 and durum wheat TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B genes, the Physcomitrella TZF genes were shown to be regulated by salt stress. Taken together, our data suggest that the function of the AtTZF1-2-3-like proteins in the regulation of seed germination has emerged from their roles in pre-existing NaCl-stress signaling pathways that control growth and development in lower plants. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title><text><SENT sid="30950" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>

TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B are 1,630-bp and 1,633-bp long, and they contain open-reading frames of 1,155 and 1,164 bp, respectively.

As shown in Figure 1, the entire RR-TZF region is very well conserved between the Arabidopsis and wheat RR-TZF proteins. However, the conservation is particularly high both in the region upstream of the CCCH domains and in the CCCH domains themselves. Therefore, to establish the evolutionary conservation of this gene family across the plant kingdom, we used the AtTZF3 sequence IDAYSCDHFRMYDFKVRRCARGRSHDWTECPYAH, which includes the CHCH motif and some upstream amino acids, as the query in BLASTP searches to find the most similar sequences from several plant species. The sequences obtained were filtered using the presence of both the CHCH motif and the TZF CCCH domains. Through this, we defined 461 RR-TZF sequences, including several in lower plants and algae.

<SENT sid="31232" pm="."><plain>The conservation of the gene expression response to salt stress suggests a function for the RR-TZF II proteins in assisting plants to cope with environmental stress, a common challenge to phylogenetically distant plant species. Interestingly, we observed very similar expression patterns for the Arabidopsis (i.e., AtTZF2, AtTZF3) and durum wheat (i.e., TdTZF1-A, TdTZF1-B) genes during the germination process in the presence of NaCl. The conservation of salt-stress regulation during germination is intriguing considering the physiological diversity of the process across these two species, due to the different morpho-physiological features of Arabidopsis and durum wheat seeds. Remarkably, the attenuation and overexpression of AtTZF3 in plants showed altered germination ability exclusively in the presence of NaCl and ABA, which thus suggests that the activity of the AtTZF3 protein is dependent on salt-induced stress and/or on the ABA levels. Previous studies have provided evidence for roles of the other Arabidopsis RR-TZF II genes in the germination process; however, in those cases, the germination appeared to correlate inversely to the level of expression of the selected genes. For instance, the concurrent suppression of AtTZF1-3 by RNAi was characterized by early germination and relatively stress-sensitive phenotypes. Also, rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 showed delayed seed germination and growth delay at the seedling stage, whereas RNAi knock-down OsTZF1 lines showed early seed germination and enhanced seedling growth (Jan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>

Later, in higher plants, the RR-TZF II proteins might have acquired new regulatory functions that are connected to the germination process. However, ABA represents a common factor that links together salt stress and germination. ABA has an ancient origin and conserved functions in the life of plants, as it affects growth and differentiation, increases dehydration stress tolerance in bryophytes, and induces accumulation of soluble sugars (such as compatible solutes) in association with enhancement of freezing tolerance in P. patens protonemata (Nagao et al., 2005, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31244" pm="."><plain>The core network that mediates ABA signaling is evolutionarily conserved between P. patens and angiosperms (Takezawa et al., 2011), and the mechanisms of regulation of ABA-mediated salt-stress responses are very similar in P. patens and in seed plants (Richardt et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>

This hypothesis is also supported by the conservation of certain regulatory elements that are linked to the responses to ABA and to abiotic stress, and that are located within the promoters of the AtTZF1-5 genes and their homologs in durum wheat and P. patens (data not shown). </plain></SENT>

As TdTZF1-A and TdTZF1-B are characterized by similar expression profiles, this strongly suggests a conserved function for these two genes in the diploid progenitors of durum wheat that was retained after the polyploidization event, probably because of their importance in stress responses and seed germination. A similar explanation can be proposed for the RR-TZF-IIa genes in Arabidopsis, which have highly conserved expression profiles across duplicated genes. This is consistent with the ‘functional buffering’ hypothesis that stipulates that genes with crucial functions tend to be retained to ensure that the essential functions can be carried out in the event of inactivation of one of the duplicates (Chapman et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>

Although Arabidopsis shares some dormancy pathway components with cereals (e.g., ABI3, VP1), there are also major differences in terms of the responses to light, as well as to other environmental cues (Simpson, 1990; Goggin et al., 2008; Gubler et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31258" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, however, a model for temperate cereals, Brachipodium distachyon, shows phytochrome regulation of seed dormancy and germination (Barrero et al., 2011), even though it lacks any of the RR-TZF-IIb genes. <p><text><SENT sid="31259" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these data suggest that the expansion of the RR-TZF-II genes might have been related to the divergence between the monocot and dicot lineages, rather than to a specialized functional response to light stimuli. Among other possibilities, it appears reasonable to hypothesize that once the AtTZF4 gene acquired phytochrome-mediated control, its product became a crucial factor in light-regulated germination, because of its intrinsic function as a negative regulator of this process, which is a feature that it shares with other members of the RR-TZF-II family. </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="31261" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="31262" pm="."><plain>The present study provides a complete survey and classification of the RR-TZF genes in plants for which the genomic information is available. This analysis has allowed us to compile a detailed description of the structural features of the RR-TZF motifs in relation to the evolution of this gene family. The strong conservation in terms of their sequence and structural features that is shown here across phylogenetically distant species, together with the similar expression profiles of the RR-TZF genes in response to salt stress in Arabidopsis, durum wheat, and the moss P. patens, have allowed us to hypothesize that these genes emerged as key regulators of stress responses very early during plant evolution. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="COMP_INT"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="31265" pm="."><plain>Conflict of Interest Statement </plain></SENT>
