</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32261" pm="."><plain>In the kidneys, amino acids in the blood are filtered at the glomeruli and absorbed through the PTs of nephrons [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32262" pm="."><plain>PT epithelial cells contain on their apical surface a brush border of actin-filled microvilli that increase the surface area and are required for maintenance of cell polarity; the brush border is the site of amino acid reabsorption [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32263" pm="."><plain>Multiple transporter systems mediate the uptake of single amino acids across the luminal membrane [1–3,5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32264" pm="."><plain>The broad scope B0 transport system is responsible for the Na+-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids in both kidney and intestine [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32265" pm="."><plain>The major apical AATer is B0AT1 (SLC6A19), which transports all neutral amino acids to different degrees with preference for leucine, isoleucine, valine and methionine [1,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32266" pm="."><plain>Mutations in B0AT1 are associated with Hartnup disorder, an aminoaciduria associated with a skin rash and cerebellar ataxia [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32267" pm="."><plain>The B0AT1-related transporter SIT1 is a B0-type high-affinity L-imino acid (proline and related compounds including hydroxyproline, betaine, N- methylaminoisobutyric acid and pipecolic acid) transporter expressed in epithelial cells of intestine and kidney [10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32268" pm="."><plain>SIT1 is the predominant proline transporter in OK 3B/2 cells [12,13], although the sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2) mediates proline transport during amino acid deprivation [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32269" pm="."><plain>In OK 3B/2 cells, SIT1 is also a low-affinity Na+-dependent neutral AATer, which may also describe its function in humans [4,10,12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32270" pm="."><plain>Localization studies in murine kidney indicate that B0AT1 is expressed mainly in the early part of the PT, whereas SIT1 is expressed along all segments of the PT [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32271" pm="."><plain>The localization of both transporters at the luminal brush border depends on the membrane protein collectrin (Tmem27), which shares sequence similarity with the non-catalytic extracellular, transmembrane and cytosolic domains of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32272" pm="."><plain>Mice lacking collectrin have fewer AATers including B0AT1 and SIT1 at their renal APM and exhibit severe leakage of nearly all amino acids [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32273" pm="."><plain>Collectrin associates with Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) complexes, which mediate vesicular fusion events, suggesting that collectrin mediates the intracellular trafficking of AATers and their fusion with the APM [17,18]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32274" pm="."><plain>The actin cytoskeleton interacts with membrane channels, receptors and transporters either directly or indirectly to support their intracellular trafficking [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32275" pm="."><plain>Actin-binding proteins regulate the actin cytoskeleton by mediating actin assembly, structure and function [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32276" pm="."><plain>In particular, myosins constitute a superfamily of actin-associated molecular motor proteins that convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis into movement and force [21,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32277" pm="."><plain>Their functions include intracellular transport of membrane-bound vesicles, regulation of membrane tension, anchoring of membrane-bound organelles, and tethering of membrane-bound proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32278" pm="."><plain>Twelve classes of myosins are expressed in humans [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32279" pm="."><plain>The membrane-associated class I myosins are the most diverse with 8 different subclasses, Myo1a-h [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32280" pm="."><plain>The best known is Myo1a, whose expression is restricted to intestine [25], where it links the core bundle of actin filaments in microvilli to the microvillar membrane [26,27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32281" pm="."><plain>Myo1a binds and localizes sucrase-isomaltase [28], and it supports the movement of membrane along microvillar actin bundles resulting in the release of vesicles from microvillar tips [29]. Myo1a-null mice have fewer CFTR channels and reduced ion transport [30]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32282" pm="."><plain>Myo1b, a close relative of Myo1a, is found in membrane protrusions including lamellipodia, filopodia and ruffles, and is associated with intracellular organelles [31–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32283" pm="."><plain>Myo1b binds the phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) with high affinity through a putative pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in the carboxyl-terminal tail domain [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32284" pm="."><plain>Biochemical studies with tissue-purified and expressed proteins show that the interaction of Myo1b with actin is kinetically slow and biphasic [38]; moreover, single molecules of Myo1b interact with actin in two sub-steps, which may be coupled to Pi followed by ADP release [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32285" pm="."><plain>These observations and studies showing that the rate of detachment of single Myo1b molecules from actin decreases significantly under tension [40] suggest that the interaction of Myo1b with actin is strain dependent: release of strain allows ADP to dissociate from Myo1b in order for Myo1b to complete its power stroke [38,41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32286" pm="."><plain>Together, the available data suggest that Myo1b holds actin filaments in place at membranes [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32287" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with studies showing that cortical tension increases in cells expressing myosins I including Myo1b [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32288" pm="."><plain>Other studies show that expression of Myo1b affects the distribution of endocytotic compartments suggesting a role in endocytosis [36], and Myo1b couples actin assembly to organelles and controls membrane remodeling at the trans-Golgi network [43]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32289" pm="."><plain>To date, no physiological role for Myo1b has been described. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32290" pm="."><plain>We found that Myo1b localized at the apical brush border of renal PTs and in the patched microvilli on the APM of OK 3B/2 cells where it colocalized with SIT1-V5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32291" pm="."><plain>In OK 3B/2 cells expressing Myo1b-specific shRNA, which reduces the amount of expressed Myo1b, less SIT1-V5 localized at the APM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32292" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, AAT was inhibited in Myo1b-kd cells as determined by transport assays with radiolabeled isoleucine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32293" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Myo1b kd had no effect on the gross structure of the apical microvilli or inorganic phosphate transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32294" pm="."><plain>The data support a model in which Myo1b modulates renal AAT by tethering AATers to the APM. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="32467" pm="."><plain>However, although [3H]isoleucine transport increased in both control and Myo1b-kd cells expressing exogenous collectrin, the amount of [3H]isoleucine transport in Myo1b-kd cells expressing exogenous collectrin was still less than that of controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32468" pm="."><plain>That collectrin expression increases the number of AATers at the APM of Myo1b-kd cells, but not AAT, suggests that without Myo1b the AATers may not be properly inserted into the membrane, and hence, are nonfunctional. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32469" pm="."><plain>Although we can successfully biotinylate SIT1-V5 in LLC-PK1-Cl4 cells, we have been unable to use cell surface biotinylation assays in OK cells to determine whether (i) the amount of properly exocytosed SIT1-V5 is reduced by Myo1b kd, and (ii) the SIT1-V5 appearing at the membrane in OK Myo1b-kd cells expressing exogenous collectrin is actually inserted into the membrane. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32470" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that Myo1b supports exocytosis of SIT1 by mediating membrane fusion of vesicles containing SIT1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32471" pm="."><plain>Membrane binding of Myo1b [33] and its exquisite sensitivity to force [40] suggest that Myo1b contributes to the force required for membrane fusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32472" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, Myo1b mediates trafficking of AATers to the APM and/or tethers AATers at the APM so that they function properly. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32473" pm="."><plain>Collectrin knockout causes a reduction in protein expression of collectrin-dependent AATers including SIT1 [15]; however, we found no reduction in SIT1-V5 expression in Myo1b-kd cells whether or not exogenous collectrin was coexpressed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32474" pm="."><plain>In fact, we noted a small increase in SIT1-V5 expression especially in OK Myo1b-kd cells not expressing exogenous collectrin (Fig 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32475" pm="."><plain>This increase might be a compensatory mechanism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32476" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, the localization of SIT1-V5 shifted from the apical microvilli to the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32477" pm="."><plain>The accumulation of SIT1-V5 in the cytoplasm of Myo1b-kd cells (Fig 7H) is evidence that Myo1b is necessary for the association of SIT1-V5 with the APM perhaps by supporting fusion of SIT1-V5-containing vesicles, or alternatively, tethering SIT1-V5 once it is inserted into the membrane. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32478" pm="."><plain>How Myo1b associates with SIT1 is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32479" pm="."><plain>Attempts to co-immunoprecipitate myc-Myo1b and SIT1-V5 with anti-myc or anti-V5 antibodies failed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32480" pm="."><plain>Several reasons can account for this result. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32481" pm="."><plain>For one, SIT1 is a membrane protein, and conditions that extract SIT1 from the membrane are likely also to disrupt the interaction between SIT1 and its possible binding partner Myo1b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32482" pm="."><plain>The extraction conditions might be particularly critical if Myo1b binds indirectly to SIT1 such that multiple interactions must remain intact for successful immunoprecipitation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32483" pm="."><plain>In addition, the interaction of Myo1b with SIT1 might be direct, but weak or transient. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32484" pm="."><plain>The effect of Myo1b on collectrin-dependent AATers suggests a relationship among AATers, collectrin and Myo1b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32485" pm="."><plain>Collectrin colocalizes with several different AATers at the brush border suggesting that it forms a complex with them; however, whether collectrin binds directly to AATers or interacts with AATers through a linker protein is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32486" pm="."><plain>Our work suggests that Myo1b may be another component of AATer-collectrin complexes; however, confirmation of this model and the nature of the putative AATer-collectrin-Myo1b complex await further investigation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32487" pm="."><plain>Collectrin associates with SNARE proteins [17,18], which mediate vesicle fusion and intracellular trafficking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32488" pm="."><plain>Curiously, Myo1b associates with several intracellular compartments [32,34] and is also implicated in intracellular trafficking [36,37,43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32489" pm="."><plain>It is possible that Myo1b modulates the fusion of collectrin-dependent AATers with the APM, a role previously reported for Myo1c and GLUT4-containing vesicles at the adipocyte plasma membrane [67]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32490" pm="."><plain>Myo1b and AATers may be trafficked together following their synthesis in the ER; however, when Myo1b first associates with AATers has not yet been determined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32491" pm="."><plain>Myo1b kd does not eliminate all isoleucine transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32492" pm="."><plain>This could be due to the presence of collectrin-independent neutral AATers in OK 3B/2 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32493" pm="."><plain>In addition, Myo1b kd could provoke increased expression of collectrin-independent transporters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32494" pm="."><plain>Expression of some AATers increases in collectrin-knockout mice [16], compensating for the loss of collectrin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32495" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, small amounts of Myo1b remaining after RNAi treatment could be responsible for the remaining AAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32496" pm="."><plain>In addition, other class I myosins could compensate for Myo1b in OK 3B/2 Myo1b-kd cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32497" pm="."><plain>For example, Myo1d redistributes along the length of intestinal microvilli in Myo1a-null mice[68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32498" pm="."><plain>Myo1c and Myo1d are found in renal brush borders of PTs by proteomic analyses [69], and all class I myosins are identified in kidney by transcriptomic analyses [70,71]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32499" pm="."><plain>The amino-terminal motor domain of class I myosins contains nucleotide- and actin-binding sites, whereas the carboxyl-terminal tail domain contains sites for membrane binding and presumably binding sites for other molecules termed “cargo”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32500" pm="."><plain>We previously determined that Myo1b binds PIP2 and PIP3 specifically and with high affinity through a putative PH domain in the tail domain [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32501" pm="."><plain>The tail region is critical to the proper localization of Myo1b in protrusions at the plasma membrane, and instead of localizing to membrane protrusions, Myo1b mutant in the putative PH domain is cytoplasmic [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32502" pm="."><plain>One idea is that Myo1b associates indirectly with AATers to tether them to the APM through its membrane-binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32503" pm="."><plain>A role for Myo1b in tethering AATers to the APM is consistent with that previously proposed for class I myosins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32504" pm="."><plain>In particular, Myo1a anchors sucrase-isomaltase [28] and possibly CFTR channels [30] in the intestinal microvillar membrane; Myo1c tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles in muscle cells [72] and mediates their fusion with the adipocyte plasma membrane [67,73]; and recent results from our laboratory show that Myo1c stabilizes E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact in polarized MDCK epithelial cells [74]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32505" pm="."><plain>Together, the studies support the idea that class I myosins tether membrane-associated proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32506" pm="."><plain>Myo1b is widely expressed [31], and collectrin has been found in a few different tissues [14,75,76], so it is possible that the interplay of Myo1b and collectrin affects other cellular processes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32507" pm="."><plain>The studies reveal a new physiological role for Myo1b in renal microvilli, that of supporting AAT by tethering AATers to the APM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32508" pm="."><plain>In intestine Myo1a regulates polarization and differentiation of colorectal cancer cells, is mutated in colorectal cancers, and has tumor-suppressor activity [77] suggesting that equally important physiological roles for Myo1b in humans will ultimately be found. </plain></SENT>
