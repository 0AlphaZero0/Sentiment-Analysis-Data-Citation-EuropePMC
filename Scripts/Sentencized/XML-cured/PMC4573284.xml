</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32856" pm="."><plain>Blastocystis is a single-celled intestinal protist, taxonomically placed within the Stramenopiles, which colonizes an estimated 1,000,000,000 people globally and a variety of animal species [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32857" pm="."><plain>Although Blastocystis is also detected in asymptomatic humans [2], some studies link this organism with intestinal and extra-intestinal disease [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32858" pm="."><plain>To date, despite Blastocystis being the most frequently isolated protist from diarrheal patients in the developed world, a causal link has not yet been established conclusively [5]. Blastocystis is genetically diverse and based on small subunit rRNA gene analysis (SSU rDNA), at least 17 subtypes (STs) have been identified in humans, other mammals, and birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32859" pm="."><plain>Among these subtypes, ST1-ST4 collectively account for 90 % of human carriage [6], while the ST5-ST9 account for the remaining 10 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32860" pm="."><plain>To date ST9 has only been isolated from humans [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32861" pm="."><plain>To better understand the genetic diversity and determine the prevalence of Blastocystis subtypes around the world, further research is required [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32862" pm="."><plain>The introduction of molecular screening assays such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has demonstrated that the prevalence of Blastocystis is much higher than previously reported on the basis of detection by conventional microscopy, in both developed [2, 9, 10] and developing [6] countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32863" pm="."><plain>Studying the genetic diversity of Blastocystis in different hosts, age groups and genders, and in different regions of the world, is essential to further our knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical relevance of this organism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32864" pm="."><plain>In the past decade, Qatar has seen a fast-paced transformation in the standards of living of its citizens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32865" pm="."><plain>This tremendous growth has spawned building and modernization programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32866" pm="."><plain>There has been a large influx of migrant workers into Doha to complete very ambitious and large-scale construction projects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32867" pm="."><plain>These workers mostly originate from states in the Middle-East, Asia and Africa, the latter two being regions where intestinal parasites are particularly common [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32868" pm="."><plain>Economic growth has been accompanied by rapidly expanding domestic services in the city, which are also dependent on an immigrant labour force. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32869" pm="."><plain>Improvements in the infrastructure have not kept pace with this transformation, particularly the housing and sanitation available for workers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32870" pm="."><plain>The immigration policy in Qatar applies a quota system to control the number of workers entering Qatar each year according to their country of origin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32871" pm="."><plain>This creates a dynamic population of workers that changes from year to year and therefore requires continuous monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32872" pm="."><plain>On arrival in Qatar and before they can obtain work permits, all new immigrants are obliged to report to the Medical Commission for thorough medical inspections but fecal examinations of all immigrant workers seeking employment in the food industries and/or as housemaids were abandoned following the introduction of compulsory treatment with albendazole, which is effective mainly against helminths and not most protozoa (although it does have activity against Giardia [13]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32873" pm="."><plain>No specific treatment is given for protozoan infections, so in contrast to helminth infections these are not eradicated from infected immigrants on arrival in Qatar. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32874" pm="."><plain>Once a worker has been issued a work permit they are then not obliged to undergo further health inspections unless they work in the food industry, in which case annual re-examination is mandatory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32875" pm="."><plain>As foreign workers form an integral part of the food industry in Qatar, it is imperative to determine their status as a potential reservoir and source of infection for enteric pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32876" pm="."><plain>The same is true for housemaids, who not only handle the food served to families, but also infants and children, who are generally more susceptible to infection than adults. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32877" pm="."><plain>As prevention is far more effective in the long-term than cure, the identification of carriers and facilitation of the medical management of individuals who shed these pathogens can be improved through the application of sensitive screening methods, thereby minimizing the risk of infection spreading to other sectors of the community. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32878" pm="."><plain>In this paper we report on the implementation of a molecular screening assay (MSA) based on real-time PCR for the detection and subtyping of Blastocystis in samples collected from migrant workers newly arriving in Qatar, and we compare the detection rate with that achieved by conventional microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32879" pm="."><plain>We examine prevalence data for evidence of regional variation, while controlling for age and sex effects, and in a subset of the data we test whether the prevalence of the different STs of Blastocystis differs between regions of origin of the carriers or is influenced by host intrinsic factors, sex and age. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="32909" pm="."><plain>Analysis comprised three stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32910" pm="."><plain>In the first we compared detection of Blastocystis using the PCR method with conventional detection by routine microscopy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32911" pm="."><plain>In the second step, we analyzed the factors affecting prevalence of Blastocystis, based on detection of infected subjects by PCR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32912" pm="."><plain>For this analysis we used maximum likelihood techniques based on log linear analysis of contingency tables in the software package IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 (IBM Corporation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32913" pm="."><plain>Initially, full factorial models were fitted, incorporating as factors region of origin of subjects (REGION - 3 levels), sex of subjects (SEX, 2 levels, male and female), and age of subjects (AGE, 3 levels). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32914" pm="."><plain>The subjects (n = 608) originated from 18 countries, but for statistical analysis were assigned to three regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32915" pm="."><plain>Region 1, Africa comprised subjects from Cameroon (n = 1), Egypt (2), Eritrea (3), Ethiopia (34), Ghana (3), Kenya (27), Nigeria (15), Sudan (2), Chad (1) and Uganda (1). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="32918" pm="."><plain>Subjects were allocated to three age classes (age class 1 = 18–29 years old, age class 2 = 30–39 years old and age class 3 = 40–58 years old). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32919" pm="."><plain>The presence / absence of Blastocystis (INFECTION) was fitted as a binary factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32920" pm="."><plain>These explanatory factors were fitted initially to all models that were evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32921" pm="."><plain>For each level of analysis in turn, beginning with the most complex model, involving all possible main effects and interactions, those combinations that did not contribute significantly to explaining variation in the data were eliminated in a stepwise fashion beginning with the highest level interaction (backward selection procedure). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32922" pm="."><plain>A minimum sufficient model was then obtained, for which the likelihood ratio of χ2 was not significant, indicating that the model was sufficient to explain the data. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32963" pm="."><plain>The results of our study show clearly that there is an enormous difference in the detection of Blastocystis in stool samples by microscopy vs PCR methodology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32964" pm="."><plain>Based on PCR methodology we concluded that 71.1 % of the samples contained Blastocystis DNA, whilst conventional microscopy detected only 42 positive samples, giving a prevalence of just 6.9 %. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32965" pm="."><plain>Higher detection rates of intestinal protozoa, including Blastocystis, by PCR compared with conventional microscopy have also been recently reported in asymptomatic individuals from Brazil [18], where microscopy detected 10 infected subjects out of 126 (prevalence = 7.9 %) whereas PCR detected 43 infections in the same subjects (prevalence = 34.1 %). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32966" pm="."><plain>This difference in sensitivity of the two assays raises questions about the utility of continuing to employ conventional microscopy, when this method has such a high failure rate in detecting the presence of this parasite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32967" pm="."><plain>In this study, as in our earlier work from Qatar, the stool samples were all screened by highly trained medical laboratory technicians and it is unlikely that any further improvement is possible in the accuracy of detection by microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32968" pm="."><plain>On this basis, we can confidently conclude that earlier estimates of the prevalence of Blastocystis in Qatar, which were all entirely based on microscopy [14], were very heavily underestimated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32969" pm="."><plain>Clearly, diagnostic microscopy of Blastocystis infections is generally less sensitive than PCR-based methodology, resulting in marked underestimation of the true prevalence of Blastocystis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32970" pm="."><plain>Our data showed that there was no difference in prevalence between males and females both having similarly high values for prevalence, although others have found significant differences in prevalence between the sexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32971" pm="."><plain>Higher prevalence of Blastocystis in male compared with female subjects has been observed, for example, in Libya [19] and in China [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32972" pm="."><plain>Participation in outdoor activities by the adult males, with the associated higher risk of contamination by the faecal-orally transmitted cysts of the parasite, has been proposed as the underlying explanation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32973" pm="."><plain>However, there are examples also of bias in the opposite direction with higher prevalence among female subjects, as for example in Spain [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32974" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in prevalence between the age classes in our data, although there was a consistent, if marginal, drift downwards with increasing age, which was not statistically significant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32975" pm="."><plain>Some earlier studies concur with our results in failing to find any age effects on the prevalence of Blastocystis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32976" pm="."><plain>For example, no significant associations were found between infections with any of the observed Blastocystis STs and age classes in Libya [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32977" pm="."><plain>However, other studies have found significantly higher infection rates in adults compared with children, with the highest prevalence rate among asymptomatic young adults aged between 18 and 30 years [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32978" pm="."><plain>Trends in the opposite direction, with a higher prevalence rate in children compared to adults, have also been reported, as for example in the Philippines [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32979" pm="."><plain>In support of the latter, a recent study in Thailand has also reported a significant reduction in the Blastocystis infection with increasing age, the prevalence rate peaking in the younger children in the study [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32980" pm="."><plain>These contrasting findings suggest that the distribution of Blastocystis infection among host populations shows spatial heterogeneity with respect to host age and sex, and these inconsistencies are most likely attributable to local factors such as the environmental conditions that influence locally the extent of, and the efficiency of, the faecal-oral route of transmission among host sectors of varying age, and between the two sexes [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32981" pm="."><plain>The most prominent source of variation in prevalence of Blastocystis that we detected was in the region of origin of the subjects, with immigrants from Africa showing the highest prevalence and those from Eastern Asia, comprising Indonesia and the Philippines, the lowest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32982" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Blastocystis infection is known to vary from country to country, as well as within countries [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32983" pm="."><plain>However, it has been reported that a higher prevalence occurs in developing countries than developed countries [26–28]. Blastocystis is transmitted through the faecal-oral route and among the most obvious risk factors are poor personal and community hygiene, culture, and lifestyle of a population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32984" pm="."><plain>All of these vary from country to country, partially depending on the economic status and standard of living, but also on the geographical location and climatic factors [29]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32985" pm="."><plain>Because we used a PCR-based methodology for detection and successfully sequenced the PCR products, we were also able to distinguish between different STs of Blastocystis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32986" pm="."><plain>Our results revealed some interesting trends with respect to the influence of the region of origin on the prevalence of STs but the only ST that was shown statistically to vary in relation to where the carrier originated from was ST2, which was completely absent in the 64 subjects from W. Asia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32988" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that only four samples in total were classified as this ST, and therefore we have to reserve judgement as to whether the conclusion of a regional influence on the prevalence of this ST is robust. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32989" pm="."><plain>Clearly further work must include a considerably larger sample size, to consolidate or refute this finding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32990" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of ST3 in our study population, especially among immigrants from Western Asia, is consistent with other reports in the literature, as for example in Thailand [30], Egypt [31], Singapore [26], Turkey [32, 33], Germany [34], France [35], Malaysia [36], and Lebanon [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32991" pm="."><plain>In a recent study of the distribution of Blastocystis subtypes in three African countries (Libya, Nigeria and Liberia) by Alfellani et al. [6], four subtypes were detected in the Libyan population with ST1 (50.0 %, 19/38) showing the highest prevalence, followed by ST3 (39.5 %, 15/38), ST2 (7.9 %, 3/38) and ST7 (2.6 %, 1/38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32992" pm="."><plain>Other studies have also identified ST1 as dominant among the examined outpatients [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="32993" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the most interesting finding from our study, was the marked sex-difference in the prevalence of ST1 and ST3, with ST1 being far more common among female subjects and subtype 3 more common among infected males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32994" pm="."><plain>Our finding of female bias with ST1 agrees with a study in Libya where Blastocystis ST1 infection was also significantly associated with females but was linked also to a low educational level [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32995" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, female sex-bias has not been detected in all studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32996" pm="."><plain>No significant associations between sex and subtypes of Blastocystis were found in Turkey [33, 34, 38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32997" pm="."><plain>The reasons for these marked differences in the relative proportions of subtypes between the sexes in affected populations are not currently understood, but they most likely relate to differences between the sexes in cultural/traditional patterns of behaviour and hence to different exposure rates to the sources of transmission [39]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="32999" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our results, we recommend that stool screening via microscopy for the presence of Blastocystis should be largely abandoned since it is extremely insensitive even in the hands of the most experienced technicians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33000" pm="."><plain>In future, the detection of Blastocystis infections should be based on PCR methodology and we predict that in the years ahead diagnostic PCR will become the tool of choice [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33001" pm="."><plain>Our results have raised a number of interesting issues that will be addressed in future work, notably the underlying reasons for the regional trends in the prevalence of the three STs of Blastocystis that we detected in our study population, and for the sex bias in the prevalence of ST1 and ST3. </plain></SENT>
