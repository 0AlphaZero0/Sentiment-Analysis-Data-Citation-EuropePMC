<SENT sid="33071" pm="."><plain>Animals have to compromise between growth and survival in response to limited food sources. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33072" pm="."><plain>The nematode C. elegans provides an excellent model system to study the conserved regulatory circuits that link nutrient availability, starvation response, and longevity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33073" pm="."><plain>In its natural environment C. elegans can experience conditions of both feast and famine (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33074" pm="."><plain>Within the 3 to 4 day life cycle of the nematode, embryogenesis is supported by maternally provided nutrients and occurs in the absence of food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33075" pm="."><plain>Larval development, however, requires feeding and progresses through four developmental stages (L1-L4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33076" pm="."><plain>The effect of starvation varies at these different developmental stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33077" pm="."><plain>Hatching of L1 stage larvae in the absence of food leads to a starvation response without overt morphogenesis that allows for ∼2 weeks of survival (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33078" pm="."><plain>Mid- and late-stage L4 larvae, upon starvation, develop into adults but preserve resources by reducing germ cell proliferation and thereby holding a limited number of embryos (3, 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33079" pm="."><plain>Conserved genetic pathways have been identified that link nutrient availability to metabolic remodeling, stress resistance pathways, and enhanced life span. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33080" pm="."><plain>Many of these pathways overlap and include TOR, AMPK, autophagy, and insulin/IGF-1 signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33081" pm="."><plain>PHA-4 is a FOXA transcription factor downstream of TOR kinase that is inactivated in the fed state (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33082" pm="."><plain>Upon starvation, inhibition of TOR leads to de-repression of PHA-4 activity and the regulation of transcription important for starvation stress survival (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33083" pm="."><plain>Insulin and insulin-like signaling also plays a role in starvation responses and converges on the DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor, which in the absence of food activates stress resistance and related longevity pathways (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33084" pm="."><plain>Other pathways, including the AMP kinases (8) and AP1 (Jun/Fos)-dependent transcriptional control are also linked to metabolic remodeling and longevity (9–12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33085" pm="."><plain>Also, DAF-16 and the nematode Rb homolog (LIN-35) globally affect transcription upon starvation at the L1 developmental stage (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33086" pm="."><plain>However, the effect of starvation on chromatin remodeling has not been examined previously. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33087" pm="."><plain>Quantitative, proteome-wide changes in response to acute starvation have not previously been documented in detail in any organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33088" pm="."><plain>Using Drosophila, larval fat bodies were studied in response to amino acid starvation (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33089" pm="."><plain>Another study analyzing ∼700 proteins reported changes occurring in the fly hemolymph, showing that yolk, storage, and fat body proteins are down-regulated in response to starvation (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33090" pm="."><plain>A study on rodents focused on ∼200 selected proteins involved in metabolism and insulin signaling that were extracted from mouse livers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33091" pm="."><plain>This analysis of livers derived from mice that were fed on either a normal or high fat diet and both then compared in response to starvation revealed differences in protein levels that were dependent on the genetic background of the mouse strains analyzed (16). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33092" pm="."><plain>We have used the stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach for quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics (17) and improved on the efficiency of previous nematode SILAC studies (18, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33093" pm="."><plain>The focus of this study is on changes in protein abundance, which is particularly important when the major regulatory mechanisms involved are unknown (20–22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33094" pm="."><plain>We have characterized specific sets of proteins whose abundance levels are either up- or down-regulated in response to starvation, thereby identifying metabolic and signaling pathways responding to starvation stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33095" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also detect specific histone variants and posttranslational modifications that are regulated in response to starvation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33373" pm="."><plain>A striking observation in this study was that a number of chromatin-associated proteins, including linker histones, high mobility group proteins, and histone H3.3, rapidly increased in abundance after starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33374" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of acute starvation of a model organism regulating the abundance of chromatin-associated proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33375" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a recent proteome analysis of aging in C. elegans showed that histone H3.3 (HIS-71) protein abundance was ∼ threefold higher in old (5 days) versus young adult nematodes (37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33376" pm="."><plain>Our own preliminary experiments indicate that the HIS-71 H3.3 variant is indeed important for survival following starvation and is also needed for nematodes to achieve a normal lifespan (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33377" pm="."><plain>Together, these data indicate it will be important to analyze the role of HIS-71 and other chromatin-associated proteins in more detail in future studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33378" pm="."><plain>Histone variants, unlike canonical histones that predominantly function to facilitate DNA-packaging, have roles in diverse processes, including chromosome segregation, DNA repair, and recombination and transcriptional silencing and activation (38). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33379" pm="."><plain>Alterations in these chromatin proteins have the potential to modulate chromatin structure and thus to affect transcription rates and cause large-scale changes in gene transcription across the genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33380" pm="."><plain>Our finding that acute starvation results in decreased acetylation of H4 at lysine residues K5 and K8, has profound implications for potential mechanisms that could allow food deprivation to elicit epigenetic changes in gene expression with possible long-term consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33381" pm="."><plain>These histone acetylations have previously been associated with transcriptional activation and act as an epigenetic mark to allow for rapid transcriptional activation after mitosis (39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33382" pm="."><plain>A recent study showed that starvation stress can influence subsequent generations through a small RNA-mediated mechanism (40). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33383" pm="."><plain>Our present findings suggest that the nematode may provide a useful model system to dissect mechanisms linking nutritional status with downstream epigenetic effects on gene expression and viability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="33384" pm="."><plain>Metabolic Pathway Responses to Starvation </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33385" pm="."><plain>This analysis highlighted the dramatic abundance changes occurring to lipid metabolic enzymes after acute starvation stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33386" pm="."><plain>This showed the remodeling of these pathways to minimize energy expenditure and maximize energy production. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33387" pm="."><plain>Another aspect to this response is the need to minimize further stress to the animal, such as from reactive oxygen species (ROS) and infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33388" pm="."><plain>An interesting pathway that may be exploited by nematodes to achieve protection from ROS production is the up-regulation of the glyoxylate pathway after starvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33389" pm="."><plain>The glyoxylate pathway exists in plants, bacteria, fungi, and nematodes and converts acetyl-CoA to succinate (a substrate of complex II in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) via a by-pass of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, involving the multifunctional enzyme GEI-7/ICL-1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33390" pm="."><plain>Use of this pathway yields less NADH (a substrate of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain) per cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33391" pm="."><plain>Complex II has been reported to function with less electron leakage and superoxide production when compared with complex I (41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33392" pm="."><plain>This may explain why we observed a marked increase in ICL-1 abundance after only 4 h of starvation stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33393" pm="."><plain>Because, at the expense of energy production, there is a survival advantage to reduce ROS levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33394" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, ICL-1 protein has been shown to be up-regulated in insulin receptor (daf-2 null) mutant nematodes, and this up-regulation depends on the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16; also the longevity phenotype of daf-2 null mutants is partially suppressed by ICL-1 depletion (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33395" pm="."><plain>The up-regulation of ICL-1 protein we observe in this study may also contribute to the enhanced longevity of transiently starved nematodes (43). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33396" pm="."><plain>Few studies to date have used large-scale, quantitative protein measurements to analyze the acute starvation response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33397" pm="."><plain>One previous report on caloric restriction (not acute starvation) of nematodes identified a number of proteins that change upon calorie reduction with limited proteome resolution (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33398" pm="."><plain>The regulation of several proteins characterized in that study, where calorie restriction was conferred by the eat-2 mutation, is in agreement with our present data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33399" pm="."><plain>In addition, previous studies on the effect of starvation on proteins in mice and flies, albeit only encompassing analysis of either a small proportion of the proteome or else focused on specific pathways through targeted-MS approaches (14–16), overall are consistent with our data indicating that acute starvation inhibits fatty acid synthesis and increases beta-oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33400" pm="."><plain>In contrast, previous studies that have measured mRNA abundance changes resulting from starvation in nematodes show many differences with respect to the reported effects of starvation stress on gene expression (45, 46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33401" pm="."><plain>These differences, which affect the conclusions as to how genes respond to starvation, were particularly evident, for example, in the response of genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33402" pm="."><plain>Thus, for both acetyl-CoA carboxylase (POD-2) and the majority of the acyl-CoA desaturases (FAT genes), which are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, the reported changes in mRNA abundance levels was very different from our findings regarding changes in protein abundance poststarvation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33403" pm="."><plain>Given our current data on the effect of starvation on the proteome, combined with the fact that proteins are likely to be both the major mediators and targets of most regulatory and signaling pathways involved in the response to starvation stress, we propose that it is important in future to focus on directly evaluating changes in protein abundance, PTMs, and other protein properties in preference to exclusively measuring mRNA levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33404" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study in C. elegans provides the first comprehensive analysis of the starvation response at a proteome-wide level, documenting changes in both protein abundance levels and PTMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33405" pm="."><plain>The large-scale dataset described here provides a valuable resource for future studies, both in the nematode system and in other model organisms, including humans. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33406" pm="."><plain>It will be very interesting to determine which of the effects detected in nematodes are conserved in evolution, both in terms of the targets regulated by acute starvation and the signaling mechanisms involved in mediating these responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33407" pm="."><plain>We envision that with the continuing improvement of proteomics instrumentation and data analysis technologies, such as global analyses of proteome-level responses during development, aging, and in response to environmental stress will increasingly provide a valuable resource for biologists to understand the control of fundamental biological responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33408" pm="."><plain>Such studies can also be extended in future to include additional proteomic dimensions, such as the parallel analysis of changes in the subcellular localization of the proteome, changes in protein complexes, and more comprehensive analyses of a wide range of PTMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33409" pm="."><plain>An important future goal will be to ensure that such data provide maximum impact to the research community through the development of effective resources for open data sharing, as shown here with the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics. </plain></SENT>
