</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33608" pm="."><plain>The incidence of intracranial aneurysm (IA) in general population has been reported to be approximately 2% and the annual risk of IA rupture causing subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was 1.9%.1,2 Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) constitutes about 85% of overall SAH, which accounts for 5% of all cases of stroke.3 Despite the development of intensive care and neurosurgical therapy, mortality of aSAH remains 27% to 50%3–5 and only around 60% of survival can be cured without disability.6 The high morbidity and mortality of aSAH make it a major public health problem. Yet, the main cause of IA remains obscure. Previous epidemiological studies have revealed innate (heritable connective tissue disorders, familial predisposition, and female gender) and postnatal (smoking and hypertension) factors of IA formation.7,8 At the same time, pathophysiology researches also showed that hemodynamic factors, inflammatory factors, and elevated arterial blood pressure played important roles in the pathogenesis of IAs.8–10 In the past decades, with the improvement of genetics and molecular biology, gene factors of IA were intensively investigated and polymorphisms of eNOS were one of the focuses. <p><text><SENT sid="33611" pm="."><plain>Nitric oxide (NO), also known as “endothelial-derived relaxing factor,”11 is mostly produced by the catalyzing action of the 3 nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family enzymes via the conversion of L-arginine.12 It is a multifunctional molecule and participates in a large number of biological reactions, for example, active biological mediator in relaxing vascular smooth muscle in response to vasoactive substances and shear stress,11 vasodilatation maintenance the structure of the vessel wall,13 inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation,14 and platelet and monocyte adhesion.15,16 A substantial part of NO functions may participate in the mechanism of aneurysms formation and downregulation of NO level has been reported to be associated with several vascular diseases.17 <p><text><SENT sid="33612" pm="."><plain>The 3 members of NOS family are neuronal (nNOS/NOS1), inducible (iNOS/NOS2), and endothelial (eNOS/NOS3).18 eNOS that is found primarily in the endothelium continuously generating NO serves to maintain basal vascular tone and cerebral blood flow, and its dysregulation may participate in the early development of aneurysms.19 eNOS is encoded by gene located on chromosome 7q35–36 that has 26 exons that span &gt;21 kb of the genome (GenBank D26607).20 There are many functional polymorphisms in different regions of eNOS gene and several studies have been done to elucidate the relationships between polymorphisms and susceptibility of IAs. The T786C (rs2070744) is an important point mutation of thymine to cytosine at coden-786 in the 5′-flanking region of the eNOS gene, which could significantly reduce eNOS gene promoter activity and serum NO level21; G894T (Glu298Asp, rs1799983) corresponds to a Glu-Asp change at nucleotide 298 in exon 7 that demonstrated a trend for a reduced eNOS enzyme activity,22 and 27-bp-VNTR that is a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs, 27 bp) in intron 4 accounts influencing basal plasma NO generation.23 T786C, G894T, and 27-bp-VNTR were the 3 most clinically relevant IA-associated polymorphisms in the eNOS gene that have been reported. From 2003, these 3 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with IA risk in a number of case–control studies with conflicting conclusions.24–36 In this study, we performed meta-analyses and corresponding stratified analyses using currently available data to clarify the effects of eNOS T786C, G894T, and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms on the risk of IAs. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="33615" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>

To evaluate the relationship between eNOS polymorphisms (T786C, G894T, 27-bp-VNTR) and risk of IAs, crude odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied. Three genetic models, for example, codominant, dominant, and recessive models, were used to determine the pooled OR. For T786C polymorphism, the codominant model was represented by heterozygous comparison of TC vs TT and homozygous comparison of CC vs TT, the dominant model was CC + TC vs TT and the recessive model was CC vs TC + TT. For G894T, the codominant model was heterozygous comparison of TG vs GG and homozygous comparison of TT vs GG, the dominant model was TT + TG vs GG and the recessive model was TT vs TG + GG. For 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism, the codominant model was represented by heterozygous comparison of ab vs bb and homozygous comparison of aa vs bb, the dominant model was aa + ab vs bb and the recessive model was aa vs ab + bb. Since the frequency of mutation homozygous genotype was equal to zero, studies by Song et al29 for T786C polymorphism and Kim et al32 for G894T polymorphism were excluded in recessive model and homozygous comparison of codominant model.37 <p><text><SENT sid="33636" pm="."><plain>Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated by Q test and I2 statistic.

<SENT sid="33683" pm="."><plain>However, significant heterogeneity in G894T polymorphism (homozygous comparison of codominant model: Ph = 0.023, I2 = 56.7%; dominant model: Ph = 0.026, I2 = 54.2%; and recessive model: Ph = 0.036, I2 = 53.4%), and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism (homozygous comparison of codominant: Ph = 0.001, I2 = 73.5%; dominant model: Ph = 0.001, I2 = 71.1%) (Table 3) was observed. To explore the potential sources of heterogeneity across studies, we assessed the pooled ORs under all comparisons via subgroup and sensitivity analyses. In the subgroup analysis by race, the heterogeneity of G894T was significant in the Asian studies. When stratified by source of control and endpoint of cases, heterogeneity of G894T in population-based studies and RIA cases group was significant in all models except heterozygous comparison of codominant models (Table 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33687" pm="."><plain>It is interesting that when we excluded the Asian population-based controls study with RIA cases by Xu,35 the heterogeneity was significantly decreased in all genetic models. So we can say that the study by Xu35 contributed to substantial heterogeneity of G894T polymorphism. In the stratified study of 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism, heterogeneity was significant in Caucasian and population-based studies when subgrouped by racial and source of control. Similarly, when we excluded a study with Caucasian subjects and population-based controls by Khurana et al,25 the heterogeneity of homozygous comparison of codominant and dominant models for 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism was obviously reduced. So the study by Khurana et al25 may contribute to heterogeneity of 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the results by excluding 1 single study at a time. The overall association between T786C polymorphism and IA risk was significantly influenced by the study of Staalsø et al.34 When excluding the study by Staalsø et al, an increased risk of significance was associated with T786C polymorphism in heterozygous comparison of codominant model (OR = 1.266, 95% CI = 1.050–1.526) and dominant model (OR = 1.255, 95% CI = 1.049–1.503) (Figures 4 and 5). </plain></SENT>

After that, 9 studies from 8 articles had been done,26–30,32–34 and the result of 5 studies was negative.27,30,32–34 The other 4 Asian studies have analyzed genotype of cases and controls but did not conclude the association.26,28,29 For G894T, 3 of 9 studies showed significant associations with IA risk,31,33,35 and the other 6 got inverse result.25,27,28,30,32,34 Seven studies investigated 27-bp-VNTR and the risk of IA, and significant association was found in 3 of them,25,34,36 but was not found in the remaining 4.27,28,30,32 <p><text><SENT sid="33724" pm="."><plain>A meta-analysis study focusing on the relationship between the 3 eNOS polymorphisms and risk of IA was performed in 2010.42 In that meta-analysis, T786C polymorphism was significantly associated with IA risk, but neither G894T nor 27-bp-VNTR showed significant association. After that, several articles holding different viewpoints about that topic have been published. Here, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to shed light on the role of eNOS polymorphisms in IA risk. <p><text><SENT sid="33727" pm="."><plain>One thousand eight hundred nineteen cases and 1893 controls from 10 studies in 9 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis and no evidence for the association between eNOS T786C polymorphism and IA susceptibility was found in the overall result. However, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant association was found in Asians in heterozygote comparison (OR = 1.294, 95% CI = 1.025–1.634) and the dominant model (OR = 1.277, 95% CI = 1.019–1.600), but not in Caucasians. Given that people in different region share little in environmental backgrounds and lifestyles, this discrepancy in the results between Asians and Caucasians suggested that eNOS T786C polymorphism may play a penetrance role in IA susceptibility in an ethnicity-specific manner. In fact, differences in the distribution of eNOS polymorphisms in Asians and Caucasians have been reported by Tanus-Santos et al.44 In sensitivity analysis, when we deleted 1 Caucasian study by Staalsø et al,34 significant association was observed in heterozygous comparison (OR = 1.266, 95% CI = 1.050–1.526) and dominant model (OR = 1.255, 95% CI = 1.049–1.503). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33731" pm="."><plain>The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that the main meta-analysis may be influenced powerfully by the study of Staalsø et al for its Caucasian subjects and biggest sample size (case = 331, control = 498), as well as the relatively small simple size of the whole study. Therefore, this finding make the result of overall analysis should be explained carefully and confirmed in future studies. <p><text><SENT sid="33733" pm="."><plain>For eNOS G894T and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms, there were 9 studies containing 1393 cases vs 1508 controls and 7 studies about 1281 cases vs 1406 controls eligible. We found no significant association between both of the polymorphisms and IA risk, which were consistent with the majority but not all previous studies.25,27,28,30–36 The studies by Özüm et al,31 Xu,35 and Liu et al33 found association between increased risk of IA and G894T polymorphism. Studies by Khurana et al25 and Kim et al32 found association between increased risk of IA and 27-VNTR polymorphism. The inconsistency of these studies may be explained by differences in population background, source of controls, sample size, and also by chance. In the subgroup according to study design, race, and endpoint of IAs, similar trends with overall results were observed. In sensitivity analysis, our results were not meaningfully influenced by any individual study in all models of G894T and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms. <p><text><SENT sid="33739" pm="."><plain>For the 3 polymorphisms of eNOS, 2 studies28,43 tried to investigate their effect to the rupture risk of IAs. The study by Khurana et al43 found evidence of association between all of the 3 polymorphisms and rupture risk of IAs but inverse result was found by Krischek et al.28 In our present meta-analysis, RIA was applied in 7 studies and mixed RIA and UIA in 6 studies (Table 1), and no study involved the UIA. To explore the potential influence of different endpoint, subgroup analysis by different endpoint was performed, and significant association was found in neither of the group in different models of the 3 eNOS polymorphisms. <p><text><SENT sid="33742" pm="."><plain>Heterogeneity was observed in G894T polymorphism (homozygous comparison of codominant model: Ph = 0.023, I2 = 56.7%; dominant model: Ph = 0.026, I2 = 54.2%; and recessive model: Ph = 0.036, I2 = 53.4%), and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism (homozygous comparison of codominant: Ph = 0.001, I2 = 73.5%; dominant model: Ph = 0.001, I2 = 71.1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33743" pm="."><plain>The heterogeneity might arise from different characteristics of selected studies, such as study design, sample sizes, inclusion criteria, ethnicity, endpoint of IAs, and different genotyping methodologies. In the stratification and sensitivity analyses, we found that the study by Xu35 did contribute to potential heterogeneity of G894T polymorphism and the study by Khurana et al25 produced heterogeneity of 27-bp-VNTR polymorphism, whereas influence analysis suggested that the pooled ORs for the G894T and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms were not influenced by the 2 studies. In this view, the results of our meta-analysis were reliable. <p><text><SENT sid="33746" pm="."><plain>Evidence of publication bias was observed in codominant model heterozygous comparison and dominant model for both T786C and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms in the Begg and the Egger tests. To some extent, the publication bias was inevitable for this study because of the limited databases searched, the little number of eligible studies, and only English and Chinese publications included. Therefore, some unpublished and published studies in other databases or in other languages that may meet the inclusion criteria were likely to be missed. <p><text><SENT sid="33749" pm="."><plain>Some limitations should be admitted when explaining the results of our meta-analysis. First, the number of eligible studies and subjects of studies was not large enough for an integrated analysis, especially for subgroup analyses. Therefore, our results should be explained with caution. Second, some inclusion studies25,28,31,34 whose genotype distribution in control group was not consistent with HWE may do contribute to the bias of the meta-analysis, although the results were not affected by these studies in sensitivity analysis. Finally, our results were based on single-factor estimates without adjustments for other risk factors. Further evaluation of IA risk should pay more attention to the potential interactions among gene–gene, gene–environment, and even different polymorphism loci of the same gene. <p><text><SENT sid="33755" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicates that eNOS T786C polymorphism is associated with elevated IA risk among Asians but not in Caucasians, whereas G894T and 27-bp-VNTR polymorphisms might have no influence on the susceptibility of IA. However, large well-designed studies are needed to be performed using standardized genotyping methods, homogeneous cases, and well-matched controls. In addition, further studies investigating the effect of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions may eventually lead to our better, comprehensive understanding of the association between the eNOS polymorphisms and IA risk. </sec></SecTag></body><back><fn-group><SecTag type="ABBR"><fn fn-type="abbr"><p><text><SENT sid="33758" pm="."><plain>Abbreviations: aSAH = aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, eNOS = endothelial nitric oxide synthase, IA = intracranial aneurysm, SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage. </fn></SecTag><SecTag type="COMP_INT,ACK_FUND"><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><text><SENT sid="33759" pm="."><plain>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose. </fn></SecTag></fn-group><SecTag type="REF"><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><text><SENT sid="33760" pm="."><plain>1.RinkelGJDjibutiMAlgraAPrevalence and risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review.
