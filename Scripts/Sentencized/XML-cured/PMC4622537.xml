</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33829" pm="."><plain>The concept of dual targeting, either with antibody combinations or bispecific antibodies, is based on the targeting of multiple disease modifying factors with one drug.1-6 Advancement in molecular engineering and expression technologies now allows efficient production of bispecific antibodies, which generally offer a simpler development path because pre-clinical and clinical testing can be done with one molecule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33830" pm="."><plain>Extensive knowledge and infrastructure on developing therapeutic monospecific immunoglobulins (IgGs) have created a trend for IgG-like bispecifics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33831" pm="."><plain>These molecules are either symmetrical or asymmetrical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33832" pm="."><plain>The main difference between the 2 is that the former is bivalent, while the latter is monovalent, for each target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33833" pm="."><plain>The concept of monovalent bispecific IgG is thought to have a unique therapeutic niche 7,8 in that they (i) do not cause receptor homodimerization, (ii) potentially have reduced toxicity on non-target tissues due to loss of avidity for each antigen, and (iii) have better selectivity when both antigens are either selectively restricted or abundantly expressed on target cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33834" pm="."><plain>Asymmetric bispecific molecules are relatively hard to make because they involve heterodimerization of 2 distinct heavy chains and correct pairing of the cognate light chain (LC) and heavy chain (HC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33835" pm="."><plain>Heterodimerization of the HCs has been addressed by several techniques, such as knobs-into-holes (KIH),9 electrostatic steering of CH3,10 CH3 strand exchanged engineered domains,11 and leucine zippers,12 The pairing of the correct light and heavy chains has been ensured by using one of these HC heterodimerization techniques along with the use of a common light chain,13 domain cross-over between CH1 and CL,14 coupling of the heavy and light chains with a linker,15 in vitro assembly of HC-LC dimers from 2 separate monoclonals,16,17 or interface engineering of the entire Fab domain.18 A recent report about an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and IGFR targeted bispecific antibody employed a single-chain Fab arm where one LC is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by a 32 amino acid linker peptide.19 Some of these approaches 15,19 deviate significantly from the natural IgG architecture, while the general applicability of others18 is not yet completely known. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33836" pm="."><plain>The only approach that does not face chain pairing problems and yet yields a natural human IgG-like bispecific is the “two-in-one” technology.20 However, since it requires extensive engineering of the complementarity-determining regions (CDR), the 2-in-one technology is not a generic design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33837" pm="."><plain>Moreover, introducing 2 different specificities into the CDRs of one antibody is not only technically challenging but can lead to bivalency for each target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33838" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is an increasing trend toward development of general and robust approaches for the generation of monovalent bispecific antibodies with native chain structure.21 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="33839" pm="."><plain>Utilizing the power of the KIH technology for HC heterodimerization, we developed a new technology for enhanced cognate HC and LC pairing for making monovalent bispecific IgGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33840" pm="."><plain>The approach, called DuetMab, replaces the native interchain disulfide bond within one of the 2 CH1-CL interfaces with an engineered interchain disulfide bond. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33841" pm="."><plain>The DuetMab molecules maintain the structure and developability properties of natural IgGs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33842" pm="."><plain>We provide herein a comprehensive biochemical, biophysical and functional analysis of one DuetMab directed against EGFR and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2 and another DuetMab against CD4 and CD70 to validate the platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33843" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time, using these 2 different DuetMabs, binding to both antigens on the surface of the same cell. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="33846" pm="."><plain>A set of 3 different positions in the CH1-CL interface were identified by structural modeling and predicted to favor the formation of a disulfide bond by introduction of a pair of cysteines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33847" pm="."><plain>The idea was to replace the native disulfide bond in one of the 2 CH1-CL interfaces with the engineered disulfide bond while leaving the wild type disulfide bond in the other Fab arm unchanged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33848" pm="."><plain>Three different position pairs were tested for engineering the new disulfide bond. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33849" pm="."><plain>One of the 3 was found to promote nearly 100% monovalent bispecific IgG formation (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33850" pm="."><plain>This variant had F126 in the HC and S121 in the LC substituted to cysteine (HC: F126C/LC: S121C) and was selected for making monovalent bispecific IgGs termed DuetMabs (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33851" pm="."><plain>The HCs and LCs used for this study were specific for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33852" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of correct heavy and light chain pairing was determined by AlphaLISA using reference standard and benchmark bispecific samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33853" pm="."><plain>When wild-type anti-RAGE and anti-IL-6 antibodies are co-transfected and co-expressed, 4 different IgGs should in theory be formed, all of which can be purified by a protein A affinity matrix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33854" pm="."><plain>Our reference standard was the material that theoretically should have about 12.5% correctly assembled monovalent bispecific IgG.4 When this reference standard was sequentially purified using an IL-6 and RAGE affinity matrix, we got a pure preparation of monovalent bispecific IgG. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33855" pm="."><plain>This material served as our benchmark, and the AlphaLISA signal obtained with it was used to set a reference of nearly 100% bispecificity (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33856" pm="."><plain>Therefore, cysteine-engineered variants that showed improved AlphaLISA signal over the reference standard and approaching that of the benchmark indicated better pairing of cognate heavy and light chains.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34036" pm="."><plain>DuetMab is a monovalent bispecific design consisting of 2 different heavy and light chains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34037" pm="."><plain>Pairing of cognate chains is ensured by replacing the native CH1-CL interchain disulfide bond of one of the Fab arms with an engineered disulfide bond and combining this in the context of KIH in the CH3 domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34038" pm="."><plain>We showed that DuetMab preserves the major properties of natural IgG and, further, by binding to 2 targets on the same cell, it compensates for the loss of avidity that can arise because of monovalency for each antigen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34039" pm="."><plain>The DuetMab composed of 2 marketed mAbs, anti-EGFR (cetuximab) and anti-HER2 (trastuzumab), descri-bed here demonstrates the feasibility of the platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34040" pm="."><plain>Targeting both antigens is important because co-expression of EGFR and HER2 in cancers confers a poor prognosis,27,28 and the 2 pathways are known to be bypassed in monotherapy.29 A growing number of in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dual inhibition of these receptors have therapeutic benefits.30-32 Through a variety of biophysical, biochemical and biological assays, we conclude that the EGFR-HER2 DuetMab exhibits properties similar to trastuzumab and cetuximab or a combination of the 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34041" pm="."><plain>This is valuable because developing a single drug substance such as a DuetMab is generally simpler than a cocktail of 2 antibodies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34042" pm="."><plain>Through two examples we demonstrate that the selectivity of the DuetMab for its target cell is determined by simultaneous engagement of both antigens on the surface of the same cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34043" pm="."><plain>This creates an avidity effect such that, at low concentrations, DuetMabs show high specificity for double-expressing cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34044" pm="."><plain>While this would be expected to be true for other monovalent bispecific antibodies, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to demonstrate concurrent binding of a monovalent bispecific antibody to both antigens on the same cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34045" pm="."><plain>Because EGFR and HER2 are expressed separately on several normal tissues, a combination treatment with cetuximab and trastuzumab can have toxicities as seen in monotherapy with each antibody.33,34 Because DuetMab exhibits better selectivity for cells expressing both the antigens compared to cells expressing one or the other antigen, we expect EGFR-HER2 DuetMab to have a favorable toxicity profile compared to a combination of cetuximab and trastuzumab. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34046" pm="."><plain>However, this can only be evaluated through further studies in non-human primates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34047" pm="."><plain>Finally, although in this study we have demonstrated the principle of the DuetMab technology using antibodies directed against 2 different pairs of membrane receptors, we have so far generated 32 other DuetMabs against soluble targets and combinations of membrane and soluble targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34048" pm="."><plain>Most of these DuetMabs comprised of either Vκ or Vλ on both Fab arms or combinations of Vκ and Vλ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34049" pm="."><plain>In total 16 different germlines for VH and 15 different germlines for VL have been tested in the DuetMab format. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34050" pm="."><plain>Also a few of the DuetMabs were made with mouse VH and Vκ belonging to 3 different germline genes for each chain (Table S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34051" pm="."><plain>In each case the expression levels, biophysical and biochemical properties were similar to the parental antibodies, much like what we have seen with the EGFR-HER2 and CD4-CD70 DuetMabs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34052" pm="."><plain>The combined results from all the studies lead us to conclude that, because the DuetMab platform (i) does not involve V-domain engineering and is applicable over a wide range of different germline genes, (ii) reliably creates HC-LC heterodimerization when coupled to a HC dimerization technology such as KIH and (iii) is compatible with κ and λ isotypes it should be a generic platform that can be widely applied to other antibodies for bio-pharmaceutical development of molecules where monovalent binding to targets offer distinct advantage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34053" pm="."><plain>Although the studies presented here are done with transiently expressed DuetMab, we have preliminary positive results indicating that when the expression of the different chains are balanced, DuetMab antibodies can be produced from engineered stable cell lines at yields comparable to those of conventional IgG antibodies and we hope to report on this in the future. </plain></SENT>
