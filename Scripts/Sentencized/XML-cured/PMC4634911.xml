</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34269" pm="."><plain>Thousands of genes are known to exert specific phenotypic effects when mutated individually and are referred to as ‘Mendelian’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34270" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic consequences of mutations in Mendelian genes involve virtually every known aspect of human physiology and anatomy [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34271" pm="."><plain>Embryonic lethality sometimes represents the severe end of the phenotypic expression of Mendelian genes that are otherwise better known for their postnatal phenotypic consequences [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34272" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, embryonic lethality may be the only phenotypic expression of genes that play a fundamental role in early development [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34273" pm="."><plain>Identifying these genes, therefore, can provide novel insights into basic biological processes during development [1, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34274" pm="."><plain>The fraction of Mendelian genes in humans that are ‘embryonic lethal’ is unknown but extrapolation from model organisms, for example, 19 % of yeast genes and 30 % of mouse genes are embryonic lethal when knocked out, suggests that they are at least in the hundreds [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34275" pm="."><plain>Consanguineous families facilitate the occurrence of autosomal recessive Mendelian diseases by virtue of rendering founder mutations homozygous through autozygosity, and have greatly aided the discovery of novel Mendelian genes through autozygosity mapping [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34276" pm="."><plain>More recently, combining autozygosity mapping with genomic sequencing has markedly accelerated novel disease gene discovery [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34277" pm="."><plain>Due to practical reasons, the entry phenotypes in these studies is almost always a postnatal recognizable pattern rather than embryonic lethality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34278" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that consanguineous families that segregate embryonic lethal phenotypes provide an exceptionally high yield for novel gene discovery where seven novel genes were identified from a study of less than 20 families [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34279" pm="."><plain>However, embryonic lethality in that study was limited to late first trimester and beyond, such that very early embryonic lethal events could not be assessed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34280" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report the identification of the genetic cause of the earliest known embryonic lethal phenotype through the study of consanguineous families that segregate female-limited infertility and failure of embryonic development beyond the zygote formation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34382" pm="."><plain>Maternal genes play a critical role in the very early stages of embryonic development because of the lag in transcribing genes derived from the male pronucleus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34383" pm="."><plain>Although maternal effect genes are very well studied in other model organisms, little is known about them in mammalian oocytes due to practical limitations [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34384" pm="."><plain>Recently, TLE6 was identified as an essential member of the four-protein, murine SCMC along with MATER, Filia, and FLOPED [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34385" pm="."><plain>Mice that are knocked out for Tle6 exhibit complete infertility that is female-specific, which places TLE6 as one of the less than 30 maternal effect genes identified to date in mammals [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34386" pm="."><plain>In sheep, expression of the four homologous proteins was recently linked to oocyte development potential [24]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34387" pm="."><plain>The phenotypic overlap between our patients with TLE6 mutation and the corresponding mouse model is noteworthy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34388" pm="."><plain>Ovulation proceeds normally in Tle6 mutants and the retrieved oocytes appear normal just as we observed in our three patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34389" pm="."><plain>The infertility phenotype in Tle6 mutants specifically involves the zygote stage and beyond. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34390" pm="."><plain>While a comparable number of one-cell zygotes was retrieved from Tle6 mutant females following hormonal stimulation and natural mating, there was a protracted delay in undergoing the first cleavage and the few that did, succumbed to disintegration and never formed morula, a phenotype similar to that observed in the few zygotes from our patients with homozygous TLE6 mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34391" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we note that zygote formation, which appears to have occurred normally in the mouse model, was severely impaired in the human patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34392" pm="."><plain>The human homologues of the four SCMC proteins (NLRP5, OOEP, KHDC3L and TLE6) share 39–46 % identity with their mouse counterparts [20], so the mechanism for this difference may lie in interspecies divergence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34393" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, these observations suggest that the phenotype is not caused by an impaired receptor mediated sperm-egg physical interaction as shown for Juno mutants but rather a maternal gene that exerts its effect after the introduction of the sperm [25]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34394" pm="."><plain>The mechanism through which TLE6 exerts its maternal effect is not completely understood. Tle6−/− oocytes lack the normal subcortical distribution of the SCMC despite normal abundance of RNA from their component genes, which clearly shows an essential role for TLE6 in stabilizing this complex [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34395" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the Tle6 mutant phenotype is very similar to that observed in knockouts of the other SCMC components indicating that stabilized SCMC is necessary for the very early stages of embryonic development [22, 26, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34396" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this early developmental role of TLE6 was independently discovered through a study that examined the dynamic function of PKA in meiotic maturation of mammalian oocytes [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34397" pm="."><plain>Suppressing PKA resulted in oocytes that were blocked in meiosis II and TLE6 was found to be a major substrate of PKA in this process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34398" pm="."><plain>TLE6 phosphorylation occurs in a very narrow window within meiosis II and when this was blocked, oocytes failed to mature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="34399" pm="."><plain>Our data, based on patient cells as well as the mutant Flag-TLE6 plasmid, demonstrate that the S510Y mutation results in markedly reduced phosphorylation of TLE6 and that this phosphorylation is mostly catalyzed by PKA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34400" pm="."><plain>Mutant TLE6 also exhibits impaired binding ability to at least two SCMC component proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34401" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data reveal two, potentially related, phenotypic mechanisms: reduced potential for PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation and reduced potential to bind SCMC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34402" pm="."><plain>Although it is unclear whether the patient phenotype is due to the absence of phosphorylation of S510, or its substitution with tyrosine, we note that both PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation and binding to SCMC have been proposed in the literature to explain the critical role of maternal TLE6 in supporting peri-implantation embryogenesis [18, 20, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34403" pm="."><plain>Since serine is a canonical phosphorylation site, it is difficult to separate the two roles and, in fact, our data suggest they are related. </plain></SENT>
