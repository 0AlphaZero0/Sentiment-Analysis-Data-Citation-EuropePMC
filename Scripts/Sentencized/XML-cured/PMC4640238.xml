</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34469" pm="."><plain>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34470" pm="."><plain>Validated predictive or prognostic biomarkers in metastatic CRC (mCRC) are limited to RAS and BRAF mutations [2, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34471" pm="."><plain>There is therefore a dire need for a deeper characterization of CRC biology and for the identification of innovative therapeutic targets. <p><text><SENT sid="34472" pm="."><plain>Epigenetics offers a different perspective to understand cancer biology, complementing the conventional genetic approach [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34473" pm="."><plain>Polycomb Group genes (PcGs) represent some of the most studied components of the epigenetic machinery. PcGs are organized in two major Repressive Complexes (PRCs) and induce gene silencing through histone post-translational modifications [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34475" pm="."><plain>Most PcGs have been involved in the initiation and promotion of cancer and contribute to drug resistance in both haematological and solid malignancies [6]. <p><text><SENT sid="34476" pm="."><plain>EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of PRC2, which catalyzes histone H3 trimethylation on lysine 27 (H3K27me3), thereby promoting selective gene silencing in normal stem cells and cancer cells. This epigenetic modification is responsible for several key events in tumor development, including the occurrence of distant metastases and angiogenesis [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34478" pm="."><plain>We have recently investigated the role of EZH2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab: the C/C genotype for the rs3757441 SNP was associated with worse prognosis in terms of progression-free and overall survival [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34479" pm="."><plain>This finding was subsequently confirmed in patients treated with chemotherapy alone, an evidence suggesting a prognostic significance of this SNP in mCRC [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34480" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the C/C genotype would create a transcription factor-binding site, thereby increasing the expression of the oncogenic EZH2 protein [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34481" pm="."><plain>However, a definitive characterization of rs3757441 is still missing, since correlation between the SNP variants and EZH2/H3K27me3 protein expression in CRC samples has not been reported. <p><text><SENT sid="34482" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed EZH2 rs3757441 genotype, EHZ2/H3K27me3 expression and pathological and molecular characteristics of 119 primary CRC samples. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="34483" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>

All patients provided written informed consent for sample collection and analysis.

A total of 119 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of primary CRCs were used for DNA extraction. DNA used for SNP analysis was extracted from normal colonic tissue, while tumor DNA was sequenced for KRAS and BRAF analyses.

<SENT sid="34497" pm="."><plain>Involved pathologist carefully reviewed all CRC samples and selected tumor sections which were most representative of each tumor. Briefly, 5 μm-thick tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded ethanol series. Slides were stained using a diaminobenzidine detection system preceded, only for EZH2, by heat-induced epitope retrieval involving immersion of tissue sections in a pre-warmed buffer solution (Target Retrieval Solution, DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA) and maintaining heat in a steamer at 988 °C for 50 min. To reduce nonspecific staining caused by endogenous biotin, the Endogenous Biotin Blocking Kit (Ventana Medical Systems, SA, Illkirch, Cedex, France) was employed, according to Manufacturer’s instructions. EZH2 and H3K27me3 immunostaining was performed using monoclonal antibodies by Abcam (1:100 dilution and 1:50 dilution, respectively). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34542" pm="."><plain>Potential mechanisms by which the rs3757441 SNP may affect EZH2 expression have been proposed elsewhere [8]. <p><text><SENT sid="34543" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we also observed a strong association between the C/C genotype and increased expression of H3K27me3, which is the functional readout of EZH2 methylating activity. This result indicates that carriers of the C/C genotype display higher EZH2 activity. In keeping with these findings, our data suggest that higher EZH2 expression results in increased EZH2 activation, as measured by H3K27me3 expression, which is higher in EZH2 3+ cases. <p><text><SENT sid="34546" pm="."><plain>Among the investigated clinico-pathological features, we observed a higher percentage of H3K27me3 cases among left colon tumors, compared with right colon or rectal cancers. This association was not significant for EZH2, even though EZH2 3+ samples were more frequent among left-sided tumors. It is known that right- and left-sided CRCs differ from biological and clinical perspectives [14, 15]: however, the small sample size of our series suggests caution in deriving any conclusion. <p><text><SENT sid="34549" pm="."><plain>Finally, we investigated if KRAS/BRAF mutations were associated with the EZH2 pathway, finding no significant correlation. Therefore, the suggested prognostic value of EZH2 expression and SNP appears to be independent of the KRAS and BRAF status: EZH2 genotyping may therefore add additional information to the conventional molecular profile of CRC cases. <p><text><SENT sid="34551" pm="."><plain>In the present series, we did not investigate the association between the EZH2 SNP or the EZH2/H3K27me3 expression and survival outcome: patient heterogeneity in terms of disease stage, adjuvant treatments and length of follow up might have affected the results, leading to inconclusive or confounding findings. <p><text><SENT sid="34552" pm="."><plain>Our study has several limitations that should be taken into account in the interpretation of the results. First, we retrieved only 5 patients with the C/C genotype for the EZH2 rs3757441 SNP: therefore, our findings cannot be considered definitive and further analyses should be conducted in larger patient cohorts to confirm the association between EZH2 SNP variants and protein expression. Notably, the results described in the present manuscript are in line with our previous report about mRNA analysis on peripheral lymphocytes from CRC patients [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34555" pm="."><plain>This investigation revealed that EZH2 mRNA expression is higher in homozygous C allele carriers, with no difference between C/T and T/T subjects [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34556" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, these two investigations support further evaluation of this SNP in CRC and possibly in other malignancies. Indeed, other researchers have recently suggested the relevance of the rs3757441 EZH2 SNP in hepatocellular carcinoma: Yu et al. reported that patients who carried at least one C allele have a higher lymph-node-metastasis risk than did patients carrying the wild-type allele [16], thus confirming the potential functional relevance of this SNP in cancer cells. Secondly, a standardized score to evaluate EZH2 (and H3K27me3) positivity by immunohistochemistry is lacking: future studies should thus clarify which is the preferred method to assess this parameter (i.e. the percentage of positive cells, the intensity of staining or a combination of both, as for the SI proposed by other authors [13]). </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title><text><SENT sid="34559" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="34560" pm="."><plain>To conclude, we characterized the EZH2 rs3757441 SNP, showing that the C/C variant is associated with higher EZH2 expression and activity in the neoplastic tissue. This SNP genotype has been linked with worse prognosis among mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy with or without an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody: our data confirm in primary tumors that the C allele is linked with increased EZH2 expression and activity, thus providing additional evidence for a functional relevance of this SNP in CRC biology. As anti-EZH2 drugs are under development and early clinical evaluation [17], this SNP may serve as a potential predictive biomarker for such agents in CRC patients. </sec></SecTag></body><back><SecTag type="APPENDIX"><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional file</title><p>
