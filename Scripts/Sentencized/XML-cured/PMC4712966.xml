<SENT sid="34908" pm="."><plain>FANCD2, a central factor of the FA pathway, is essential for the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) generated during fork collapse at ICLs. While lesions different from ICLs can also trigger fork collapse, the contribution of FANCD2 to the resolution of replication-coupled DSBs generated independently from ICLs is unknown. Intriguingly, FANCD2 is readily activated after UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent that generates predominantly intra-strand crosslinks but not ICLs. Hence, UV irradiation is an ideal tool to explore the contribution of FANCD2 to the DNA damage response triggered by DNA lesions other than ICL repair.

<SENT sid="34923" pm="."><plain>Initial signs of FA include bone or skeleton defects, renal dysfunction, short stature and very frequently abnormal hyper- and hypo-pigmentation of the skin and café_au_lait spots [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34924" pm="."><plain>FA is characterized by bone marrow failure and high risk of developing myeloid leukemias and squamous cell carcinomas [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34925" pm="."><plain>Cells derived from FA patients are strikingly sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), i.e. cross-links between two DNA strands. Consequently, much of our current understanding of FA comes from studies that utilize ICL-causing agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane or cisplatin, as sources of DNA damage [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34927" pm="."><plain>To date, 17 genes with described mutations in patients were defined as components of the FA pathway that are all required for ICL repair [5]. <p><text><SENT sid="34928" pm="."><plain>ICL removal is generally accomplished when the replication fork abuts the DNA lesion. ICL-stalled replication forks undergo a programmed collapse, which is regulated by all FA proteins [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34930" pm="."><plain>Firstly, FANCD2 is loaded onto the ICL, a process that requires the FA core complex, the D2 partner FANCI and D2 monoubiquitination [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34931" pm="."><plain>Indeed, FANCD2-FANCI bind preferentially to a variety of branched DNA structures formed by ICL repair intermediates [8,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34932" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the crystal structure of FANCI with DNA suggests that the ID2 complex could accommodate the X-shaped DNA structures formed by replication forks that collide with ICLs [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34933" pm="."><plain>Secondly, FANCD2 recruits the XESS nuclease complex (including the nucleases XPF-ERCC1 and SLX1 and the scaffold protein SLX4) and the FAN1 and SNM1A nucleases [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34934" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, these enzymes co-ordinately incise the DNA 3´and 5´of the lesion, thus unhooking the ICL. Finally, FANCD2 masters the resolution of such DNA repair intermediate by coordinating the activation of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), homologous recombination repair (HRR) and possibly Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) [1,2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34936" pm="."><plain>Collectively, solid evidence demonstrates that FANCD2 is crucial to ICL repair. <p><text><SENT sid="34937" pm="."><plain>Upon γIR, a source of replication-independent DSBs, ATM activates FANCD2 by phosphorylation [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34938" pm="."><plain>However, FANCD2-deficient cells are only moderately sensitive to γIR and X-rays, another source of replication-independent DSBs [12–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34939" pm="."><plain>In addition, FANCD2 does not play a predominant role in the repair of DSBs generated by restriction enzymes, but it is key to the resolution of ICL-dependent replication-coupled DSBs [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34940" pm="."><plain>These results led to the assumption that FANCD2 is specifically required for the resolution of all replication-coupled but not direct DSBs. However, it is yet unclear whether FANCD2 resolves DSBs generated at replication forks stalled by lesions others than ICLs. <p><text><SENT sid="34942" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that the activation of FANCD2 during unperturbed S phase [17] suggests that FANCD2 participates in mechanisms unrelated to DSB repair. Indeed, FANCD2 prevents the nucleolytic degradation of nascent DNA triggered by hydroxyurea (HU) or aphidicolin (APH) and promotes fork restart immediately after drug removal [18–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34944" pm="."><plain>Hence, FANCD2 not only promotes DSB repair by HRR but also attenuates DSB formation by protecting persistently stalled replication forks and promoting their reactivation. <p><text><SENT sid="34945" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, FANCD2 is activated by UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent which rarely causes ICL accumulation [23,24] with no persistent stalling of replication forks at doses of 20 J/m2 or lower [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34946" pm="."><plain>In contrast to ICL repair, the removal of UV-induced lesions does not require coordination between TLS and NER as both processes can occur independently from each other in UV-treated cells [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34947" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NER efficiency is not altered in FA-defective backgrounds [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34948" pm="."><plain>Importantly, FANCD2-deficient cells show normal spontaneous and UV-C-induced point mutation frequency [29] and null or very low sensitivity to UV-light [30–33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34949" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, it is intriguing that the hypo/hyperpigmentation and the café_au_lait spots that characterize the FA disease are skin-associated defects. We thus reasoned that the function of FANCD2 after UV irradiation could be revealed by exploring processes that may not necessarily trigger cell death. We found that the UV irradiation of FANCD2-depleted cells with doses as low as 1.5 J/m2 cause a striking increase of genomic instability markers, such as aberrant chromatid exchanges and micronuclei (MN) formation. The generation of both aberrations require DSBs [34,35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34953" pm="."><plain>While UV irradiation is not expected to directly cause DSBs, replication-associated one-ended DSBs (also known as double strand ends–DSEs) could accumulate when elongating forks encounter UV lesions [36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34954" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that FANCD2 does not majorly modulate DSB accumulation. On the contrary, FANCD2 guarantees the correct processing of replication-coupled DSBs after UV irradiation. In particular, FANCD2 promotes the recruitment of the HRR factor RAD51 to UV-damaged DNA and the resolution of replication-associated DSBs by HRR. When FANCD2 is depleted, unleashed non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) increases genomic instability after UV irradiation. Hence, FANCD2 operates beyond ICL processing, and such function might apply to all replication-coupled DSBs generated after different genotoxic insults. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="RESULTS"><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title><text><SENT sid="34959" pm="."><plain>Results <sec id="sec003"><title><text><SENT sid="34960" pm="."><plain>FANCD2 preserves genomic stability after UV irradiation <p><text><SENT sid="34961" pm="."><plain>As reported by others [23,38], UV irradiation induces focal organization (S1A and S1B Fig) and monoubiquitination (S1C and S1D Fig) of FANCD2, both in U2OS and PD20 cells expressing FANCD2 (PD20+D2). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34978" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, when depleting FANCD2, the frequency of MN increased in UV-irradiated U2OS (Fig 2A and 2B) and in PD20 cells, when compared to control GM00637 fibroblasts or PD20 reconstituted counterparts, respectively (Fig 2C and 2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34979" pm="."><plain>MN are formed when DSB are processed in a manner that excludes fragments of chromosomes from nuclei during/ after karyokinesis and before cytokinesis [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34980" pm="."><plain>Although not widely accepted, UV irradiation has been reported as a source of DSB formation [39–41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34981" pm="."><plain>We therefore inferred that the increase in MN in UV-treated FANCD2-depleted cells results from an increase in the number of DSBs and/or because of aberrant DSB processing. After UV irradiation, the most likely sources of DSBs are replication-coupled, one-ended double-strand ends generated at collapsed replication forks. The deficient resolution of replication-coupled DSBs increases replication-derived chromatid aberrations, which are specifically generated in S phase [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34984" pm="."><plain>Thus, we evaluated the role of FANCD2 on chromatid aberrations after UV irradiation. We first determined the lowest dose required to upregulate these aberrations in control samples (1.5 J/m2, Fig 2E and 2F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34986" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite modest FANCD2 ubiquitination at low UV doses (S1F Fig), chromatidic breaks/gaps were upregulated in such conditions when FANCD2 was depleted (Fig 2E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34987" pm="."><plain>Moreover, aberrations such as chromatid exchanges (mono and poly-radial chromosomes), which have been exclusively associated to replication-coupled DSBs [35,42] robustly increased in FANCD2-depleted but not in control cells (Fig 2F). </plain></SENT>

To explore the first possibility, we first analyzed PCNA monoubiquitination and Pol η recruitment to replication factories, two hallmarks of UV-triggered TLS, a well-characterized mechanism that aids DNA replication across UV-triggered DNA lesions and could thus prevent UV-induced DSB formation [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35000" pm="."><plain>[43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35001" pm="."><plain>It has been previously demonstrated that FA core components [29,44] but not FANCD2 [29] promote TLS events after UV irradiation. However one report indicates that FANCD2 depletion reduces the ratio of Pol η focus formation over total Pol η signal in UV-irradiated (20 J/m2) Hela cells [45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35003" pm="."><plain>Based on these previous reports, we reasoned that the depletion of FANCD2 could modulate TLS markers in our settings. When analysing PCNA ubiquitination in FANCD2-depleted samples and PD20 cells (Figs 3A and S3A), alterations were not evident at time points (6 hours) in which TLS events are expected to be fully active [46] or at later (24hrs) time points at doses used in MN formation and induction of chromosomal aberrations (≤5 J/m2 –Figs 1 and 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35005" pm="."><plain>To further explore a potential modulation of TLS activity after FANCD2 knockdown we also evaluated the recruitment of TLS Pol η to replication factories, which is another parameter of TLS activation [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35006" pm="."><plain>Here we observed that the proportion of cells with Pol η foci was not modulated by FANCD2 depletion in our experimental settings at 5 J/m2 (Fig 3B). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="35103" pm="."><plain>Remarkably however, we have unveiled a function of FANCD2 after UV irradiation. In particular, we show that FANCD2 preserves genomic stability by modulating the correct processing of DSBs generated during the replication of UV-damaged DNA.

<SENT sid="35106" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we demonstrate herein that DSBs are formed at UV doses of ≤5 J/m2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35107" pm="."><plain>For example, UV doses as low as 1.5 J/m2 induce SCE in control samples and complex aberrations (radials) in FANCD2-depleted samples. The formation of SCEs, aberrant chromatid exchanges and MN in binucleated cells require not only DSBs, but also DNA replication [69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35109" pm="."><plain>Therefore, UV-triggered DSBs are most likely generated as a consequence of DNA replication across damaged DNA. In fact, ATM phosphorylation after UV irradiation takes place predominantly in S phase [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35111" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 53BP1 foci and MN in FANCD2-depleted cells accumulated almost exclusively in cells transiting S-phase at the time of UV irradiation (see S5 and S7 Figs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35112" pm="."><plain>Thus, UV irradiation generates DSBs, most likely at collapsed replication forks. It should be noted that occasional ICLs, which depend on an alternative conformation of DNA that approximates pyrimidines from different strands, were also reported after UV irradiation [70–72]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35114" pm="."><plain>In fact, when irradiating plasmidic DNA in vitro, a dose of 1000 J/m2 (260 nm) was required to accumulate ~0.07 ICLs/kbp [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35115" pm="."><plain>While we cannot formally discard their contribution, it is unlikely that such a sporadic event could predominate over other types of fork collapses (at frequent UV lesions such as unrepaired cyclobutane pyrimide dimers and 6–4 photoproducts). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35116" pm="."><plain>Moreover, FANCD2 differentially contributes to the replication of UV- and MMC-damaged DNA (see next section), thus reinforcing a difference in the fork-collapsing event after both treatments. <p><text><SENT sid="35117" pm="."><plain>Despite their increased genomic instability, FANCD2-depleted cells did not show increased DSB levels. In fact, PFGE did not reveal substantial changes in the accumulation of DSB in FANCD2–depleted samples. Consistently, KAP1 phosphorylation (a DSB marker) was not upregulated, and ATM and Chk1 phosphorylation were transiently downregulated. These results indicate that FANCD2 might process DNA repair intermediates at collapsed forks, generating substrates for ATM and Chk1 activation. Such speculation is supported by recent results indicating that after ICLs, DNA ends are resected into HRR-proficient substrates that promote robust ATM activation [73]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35122" pm="."><plain>While we cannot further speculate on the signals leading to impaired ATM and Chk1 activation in UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted samples, it is evident that in agreement with our PFGE results, the lack of upregulated phosphorylation of KAP1, ATM and Chk1 argues against a role of FANCD2 in the prevention of DSB accumulation after UV irradiation. </sec><sec id="sec009"><title><text><SENT sid="35123" pm="."><plain>Differential contribution of FANCD2 to the replication of UV- and MMC-damaged DNA <p><text><SENT sid="35124" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the main role of FANCD2 after UV irradiation is to direct DSBs into HRR repair (Figs 2 and 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35125" pm="."><plain>This implies that FANCD2 may be crucial to the repair of replication-coupled DSBs that arise from sources other than ICLs. Indeed, our results suggest that the functions of FANCD2 in the cellular response to UV irradiation and ICL accumulation partially overlap. However, the responses are not equivalent. This conclusion is supported by the following observations: A) FANCD2 depletion does not trigger cell death after UV irradiation, which is strikingly different from the significant increase in cell death observed after MMC treatment in FANCD2-depleted cells. Moreover, while NHEJ deficiency either rescues or exacerbates cell death in FANCD2 deficient samples treated with ICL inducers [74–76], we revealed an insignificant effect of XRCC4 depletion in the survival of UV-irradiated FANCD2-depleted cells. B) NHEJ depletion abrogates all the chromatid aberrations caused by UV irradiation in FANCD2-depleted cells. While similar results were reported in other systems using MMC [74,75], the simultaneous elimination of FANCD2 and KU80 after MMC and cisplatin treatments in mammalian cells not only fails to abrogate, but instead further increases chromosomal instability [76]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35132" pm="."><plain>Hence, while in response to UV- and ICL-damaged DNA FANCD2 facilitates HRR, the quality and/or quantity of DSBs may not be equivalent in both scenarios. In fact, HRR most likely takes place after the convergence of two opposite replication forks at the ICL [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35134" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the HRR substrate during ICL repair may resemble a canonical double-ended DSB, which could be repaired by NHEJ without causing a massive chromosomal rearrangement. In contrast, fork collapse induced by UV irradiation may generate DSEs which, in FANCD2-depleted backgrounds, may induce gross chromosomal rearrangements when processed by NHEJ. Alternatively, different nucleases may be recruited to DSBs after UV irradiation or ICLs. In this respect, it should be mentioned that FANCD2 not only recruits nucleases to ICLs but also to DNA lesions generated by HU [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35138" pm="."><plain>While the nuclease in charge of the processing of UV-triggered DSBs remains unidentified, we postulate that FANCD2 mediates the processing of collapsed forks into HHR-proficient substrates.

Patel has elegantly shown that aldehydes are an endogenous source of ICLs [77] and that the enzyme Aldh2 is essential to prevent the accumulation of aldehyde-derived ICLs [78]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35144" pm="."><plain>Tissues with low levels of Aldh2, e.g. the hematopoietic linage, rely heavily on the FA pathway to process ICLs generated from endogenous aldehydes [79,80]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35145" pm="."><plain>Hence, endogenous ICLs represent important triggers for oncogenesis in FA patients. But whether they represent the sole trigger for genomic instability in FA patients is still unresolved. While previous studies have proposed that the contribution of FANCD2 to the resolution of DSBs might be specifically linked to inter-strand ICLs [12,14,16,81], our report demonstrates that replication-coupled DSBs unrelated to ICLs may require FANCD2 for their repair through the HRR pathway. <p><text><SENT sid="35148" pm="."><plain>In addition, unanticipated HRR-independent functions of FANCD2 have been recently identified. Pioneer work from K. Schlacher and M. Jasin showed that FANCD2 and BRCA2/FANCD1 prevent degradation of nascent DNA in HU-treated cells [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35152" pm="."><plain>It has also been shown that after HU, and in a core-independent manner, FANCD2 in concert with the Bloom helicase (BLM) restart stalled replication forks while suppressing origin firing [20,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35153" pm="."><plain>In FANCD2 depleted samples, increased aberrant rearrangements of chromosomes were reported in [18,19] and increased frequencies of MN where reported in [20,22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35154" pm="."><plain>It is therefore possible that the defects in chromosomal integrity observed after UV irradiation are the indirect consequence of DSB-independent functions of FANCD2 at replicating DNA after UV irradiation. However, a number of evidences disfavour such hypothesis. First, the DSBs-independent contribution of FANCD2 after HU has been associated with persistent fork stalling [19], which is not frequent event after UV irradiation doses used in this study [25,26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35157" pm="."><plain>Second, the chromosomal integrity of FANCD2-depleted cells after UV is restored when NHEJ is silenced, therefore suggesting that the main function of FANCD2 is related to the processing of DSBs rather than to DNA replication events taking place prior to DSB formation. Third, the events taking place prior to DSBs processing after HU are independent of FANCD2 ubiquitination [82] whereas the UV-triggered events, which take place after DSB formation, are dependent on FANCD2 ubiquitination (see S7 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35159" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is also reasonable to speculate that after HU treatment, the accumulation of at least some aberrations in FANCD2-depleted cells, e.g. the non-homologous exchanges [19] require the elimination of the FANCD2-mediated facilitation of DSB resolution by HRR (in addition to the disruption of FANCD2 functions at nascent DNA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35160" pm="."><plain>Hence, while it is conceivable that during the replication of UV-damaged DNA FANCD2 participates in more than one (HRR-dependent and independent) process, results in Fig 6 demonstrate that the inhibition of NHEJ is a function of FANCD2, which must obligatorily be disrupted to generate many -if not all- the chromosome aberrations observed after UV irradiation. Remarkably, uncontrolled NHEJ at replication-coupled DSBs might also be the source of the chromosomal abnormalities reported in FANCD2-depleted samples subjected to replication-stressing agents such as HPV 16 E6/E7 expression [83], HU/APH treatments [19,21,84], PARP inhibition [85], R-loop accumulation [86], and dysregulated Pol κ recruitment to replication forks [87]. <p><text><SENT sid="35162" pm="."><plain>It is unclear to us why genomic stability but not cell survival is affected by FANCD2 depletion after UV irradiation. Similar results were reported after HU treatment [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35164" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the DSBs generated by UV irradiation and HU are infrequent and therefore only tangentially contribute to cell death. Alternatively, while unresolved DSBs could be extremely toxic, their resolution, even when aberrant (e.g. in a FANCD2 depleted sample), may suffice to prevent cell death. Indeed, our data reveals multiple backup mechanisms that promote resolution of DSBs. Hence, when forks collapse, resolution mechanisms that promote cell survival may prevail even when genomic stability is compromised with multiple rearrangements. Our results suggest that low levels of replication-associated DSBs may be an important oncogenic factor if FANCD2 is not available to direct them into an error free pathway. FANCD2 is also required for the spontaneous levels of SCEs in uveal melanoma [88], thus we speculate that even during unperturbed replication FANCD2 regulates the pathway choice for DSBs repair. We propose a surveillance role for FANCD2 that is required to resolve replication-associated DSBs arising from any stress source and which might be relevant for the etiology of cancer in FA patients. </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title><text><SENT sid="35171" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods <sec id="sec012"><title><text><SENT sid="35172" pm="."><plain>Cell culture, transfection, and UV irradiation <p><text><SENT sid="35173" pm="."><plain>The following cells were used: U2OS cells (ATCC), GM00637 (Coriell Repositories), FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells (GM16633—Coriell Repositories) and two reconstituted counterparts, PD20 + D2 (GM16634—Coriell Repositories, a microcell hybrid expressing low levels of wt FANCD2) and PD20 + D2O (PD20 cells expressing full-length FANCD2 cDNA), and PD20 K561R (overexpressed FANCD2 mutant with mutated K561 lysine). </plain></SENT>
