</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36631" pm="."><plain>WRKY transcription factors, defined by the presence of the conserved WRKY domain of approximate 60 amino acids, play an essential regulatory role in plant growth, development, metabolism, and biotic and abiotic stress responses [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36632" pm="."><plain>Since the first WRKY-encoding gene was isolated from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) [4], its homologs have been found in a wide range of plants and several non-plant species including Giardia lamblia, Dictyostelium discoideum, diplomonads, social amoebae, fungi incertae sedis and amoebozoa [5,6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36633" pm="."><plain>Compared with low and non-plants, the WRKY genes in high plants were shown to be highly expanded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36634" pm="."><plain>For example, there are 57 members in cucumber (Cucumis sativus), 58 in physic nut (Jatropha curcas), 59 in grapevine (Vitis vinifera), 72 in Arabidopsis thaliana, 103 in white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), 105 in poplar (Populus trichocarpa), 105 in foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and more than 100 in rice (Oryza sativa) [7–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36635" pm="."><plain>WRKY proteins contain one or two WRKY domains, comprising the highly conserved WRKYGQK heptapeptide at the N-termini and a novel zinc finger motif (Cx4–7Cx22–23HxH/C) at the C-termini [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36636" pm="."><plain>Both of these two motifs are vital for the high binding affinity of the WRKY proteins to the consensus cis-acting element termed the W box (TTGACT/C) [15,16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36637" pm="."><plain>According to the number of WRKY domains and the features of their zinc finger motifs, WRKY proteins can be categorized into three main groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36638" pm="."><plain>The group I members have two WRKY domains and feature the zinc finger motif of C2H2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36639" pm="."><plain>Both groups II and III members contain a single WRKY domain, and the group III members possess the C2HC zinc finger motif which is different from C2H2 as observed in groups I and II members. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36640" pm="."><plain>Base on the evolutionary relationship and certain amino acid motifs present outside the WRKY domain, the group II can be further divided into 5 subgroups (a–e) [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36641" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the presence of a conserved PR intron located after the codon encoding arginine (N terminal to the zinc finger motif) of subgroups c-e as seen in the group III and the C-terminal WRKY domain of the group I, members of subgroups a and b harbor a VQR intron in the zinc finger motif instead [6,10,17]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36642" pm="."><plain>Castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), a tropical perennial shrub that belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, is one of the most important non-food oilseed crops cultivated for industrial, medicinal and cosmetic purposes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36643" pm="."><plain>Although native to Africa, the economic importance of castor bean oil and its well-adaptation to unfavorable conditions has prompted its wide-domestication to many tropical, subtropical and warm temperate regions around the world [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36644" pm="."><plain>Given the crucial role of WRKY transcription factors in plant adaptation, two independent groups performed the homology search against the recently available castor bean draft genome [20] for the RcWRKY genes [17,21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36645" pm="."><plain>The study performed by Li et al. [21] focused on the expression analysis of the 47 identified RcWRKY genes in roots, stems, leaves, male flowers, female flowers and fruits at different developmental stages (i.e. 7, 15, 30 and 45 days post-anthesis) by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36646" pm="."><plain>Another study carried out by Zou [17] described the identification of nine more family members (i.e. 56 RcWRKYs) based on the automatic annotation of the castor bean genome, mainly focusing on the analysis of the evolutionary relationships between RcWRKY members by using the conserved WRKY domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36647" pm="."><plain>However, when compared with physic nut, another Euphorbiaceae plant species without the occurrence of any recent whole-genome duplication as castor bean [20,22], the family number of castor bean [17] seems to be relatively small and several physic nut WRKY genes [7] have no counterparts in castor bean. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36648" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the RcWRKY genes have not been fully identified or the loss of specific genes has occurred in the castor bean genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36649" pm="."><plain>Thereby, rechecking the RcWRKY gene family is still needed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="36650" pm="."><plain>Along with the 4.6 × draft genome of castor bean, as of Apr 2015, 88212 nucleotides and 62629 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been deposited in NCBI GenBank. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36651" pm="."><plain>In addition, RNA sequencing data from several tissues such as root, leaf, flower, seed and endosperm is also available in NCBI SRA, which includes 1,138,884 Roche 454 reads and 386,847,526 Illumina reads [23–26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36652" pm="."><plain>These datasets provide a good chance to analyze the castor bean WRKY gene family from a global view. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36653" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we take advantage of the genome sequences and available transcriptome data to identify the complete set of the RcWRKY genes and conduct the expert revision of their gene structures via mapping the ESTs and RNA sequencing reads against the scaffolds. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="36687" pm="."><plain>The homology search resulted in 58 loci putatively encoding WRKY genes from 41 scaffolds of the castor bean genome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36688" pm="."><plain>Among them, 57 loci were predicted by the genome annotation [20] and further annotated by the PlantTFDB which used the released gene models for the annotation of RcWRKY genes [37], whereas one more loci encoding 117 residues was identified from the scaffold28842 (Table 1) and its ortholog was also found in physic nut [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36689" pm="."><plain>Since the gene models of RcWRKY genes were the result of an automatic annotation due to the lack of transcriptome data at that time, an expert revision of their gene structures was conducted via mapping the ESTs and reads against the scaffolds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36690" pm="."><plain>Interestingly enough, the results showed that 20 out of the 57 predicted gene models seem not to be properly annotated (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36691" pm="."><plain>The locus 29929.t000090 was predicted to encode 609 residues which is relatively shorter than its ortholog in physic nut (JcWRKY10, 740 residues) [7], however, hundreds of RNA sequencing reads indicated that the “TTNNNTTGAC” sequence was misassembled into its first exon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36692" pm="."><plain>Thereby, this locus is promised to harbor four introns putatively encoding 711 residues (see S1 File). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36693" pm="."><plain>The locus 29820.t000050 was predicted to encode 558 residues, however, read mapping indicated that partial sequences of its second and third exons were annotated as the second intron, thus this locus is promised to encode 598 residues (see S2 File) which is similar to that of its physic nut ortholog (JcWRKY08, 576 residues) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36694" pm="."><plain>As for the locus 29635.t000028, though both the predicted and identified CDSs encode 510 residues, read mapping indicated that the “GCAA” sequence of the second intron was annotated as the second exon and the “GCAG” sequence of the third exon was annotated as the second intron (see S3 File). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="37918" pm="."><plain>The WRKY domain pattern was characterized as WRKYGQ/KKx13Cx4-7Cx22-23HxH/C. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37919" pm="."><plain>Compared with Arabidopsis that feathers a high number of duplicate genes, few gene pairs were identified in the RcWRKY gene family, corresponding to no recent whole-genome duplication event occurred in castor bean. </plain></SENT>
