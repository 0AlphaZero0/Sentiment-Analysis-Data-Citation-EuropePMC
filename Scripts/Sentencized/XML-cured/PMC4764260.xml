Here, we integrated DNaseI footprinting data with sequence-based transcription factor (TF) motif models to predict the impact of a genetic variant on TF binding across 153 tissues and 1,372 TF motifs. Each annotation we derived is specific for a cell-type condition or assay and is locally motif-driven. We found 5.8 million genetic variants in footprints, 66% of which are predicted by our model to affect TF binding. Comprehensive examination using allele-specific hypersensitivity (ASH) reveals that only the latter group consistently shows evidence for ASH (3,217 SNPs at 20% FDR), suggesting that most (97%) genetic variants in footprinted regulatory regions are indeed silent. Combining this information with GWAS data reveals that our annotation helps in computationally fine-mapping 86 SNPs in GWAS hit regions with at least a 2-fold increase in the posterior odds of picking the causal SNP. The rich meta information provided by the tissue-specificity and the identity of the putative TF binding site being affected also helps in identifying the underlying mechanism supporting the association. As an example, the enrichment for LDL level-associated SNPs is 9.1-fold higher among SNPs predicted to affect HNF4 binding sites than in a background model already including tissue-specific annotation. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title><text><SENT sid="38079" pm="."><plain>Author Summary <p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="38080" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of genetic variants that have been associated with complex traits are found outside of protein coding genes and likely affect gene regulation. Many experimental efforts have been dedicated to mapping regulatory regions in the genome but there are not many systematic methods that integrate functional data and regulatory sequences to predict the potential effect of any genetic variant on any given tissue and motif. Here we present a tissue and factor specific annotation that provides a predicted functional effect for both common and rare genetic variants. These predictions, certain of which are validated experimentally, show that the majority of genetic variants in gene regulatory regions are actually silent. Annotating those that are not silent allows us to investigate the molecular basis for the genetic architecture of many common traits and also to study the evolutionary properties that different types of regulatory sequences have across tissues or transcription factors. Overall, our study supports the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites for distinct classes of transcription factors has been a major target of evolutionary forces contributing to disease risk and complex trait variation in humans. </p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov/">http://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>) grant 1R01GM109215-01 to RPR and FL and by the American Heart Association (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.heart.org/">http://www.heart.org/</ext-link>) grant AHA14SDG20450118 to FL.

For example, large numbers of genetic variants associated with disease and normal trait variation have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [3]; yet a formidable challenge remains in determining the specific molecular mechanisms underlying association signals in non-coding regions. Similar challenges also arise when exploring the evolutionary functional significance of non-coding variants, for example through analysis of differences in genotype distribution across populations [4, 5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38090" pm="."><plain>This is also complicated by the fact that GWAS hits and signals of selection are usually found in large regions of association and do not directly pinpoint the true causative variants. In general, we do not know in which cell types/tissues these variants may have a functional impact. <p><text><SENT sid="38092" pm="."><plain>Computationally and experimentally derived annotations for regulatory regions have been used to functionally characterize GWAS hits [1, 6–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38093" pm="."><plain>However, a simple positional overlap between a genetic variant and regulatory regions is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to demonstrate an impact on TF binding. Many experimentally derived annotations are very useful to identify broad genomic regions across many cell-types, but lack the resolution necessary to pinpoint the regulatory sequences. High resolution functional assays like DNase-seq and ATAC-seq combined with computational methods that integrate sequence motif models [8, 9, 13, 14] can effectively dissect the regulatory elements; yet the motif models for transcription factor (TF) binding are generally not sufficiently well calibrated to predict the binding impact of a sequence change. Alternative ChIP based approaches (such as ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo), may provide increased TF and regulatory element specificity, but rely upon the availability of antibodies to target specific TFs or tagged TFs [15, 16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38097" pm="?"><plain>The consequence is that we cannot provide a satisfactory answer to the following questions: Which genetic variants are more likely to impact binding of specific TFs? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38098" pm="?"><plain>What is the fraction of genetic variants in regulatory regions that are not neutral? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38099" pm="?"><plain>If we can adequately answer these questions, we may further ask: Did polygenic adaptation occur at binding sites for the same TF? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38100" pm="?"><plain>Do variants in certain types of TF footprints and tissues contribute to variation in specific complex traits? <p><text><SENT sid="38101" pm="."><plain>To help answer these questions, we have extended the CENTIPEDE approach to generate a catalog of regulatory sites and binding variants encompassing more than 600 experimental samples from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects with DNase-seq data, and recalibrated sequence motif models for more than 800 TFs. We then incorporated ASH information to provide additional empirical evidence, to validate the accuracy of the computational predictions and to estimate the fraction of genetic variants in regulatory regions that are not neutral. Importantly, our annotation is specific at the motif level (i.e., TF-specific) and at the sample level (i.e., tissue-specific). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38104" pm="."><plain>We then compare our results with the only alternative TF-centric annotation that has been recently published [17], but we also compare with non TF-centric SVM derived annotations [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38105" pm="."><plain>Using our new catalog, we then examined genomic properties of the annotations, identifying characteristics that predict variants that disrupt binding, and demonstrated the action of natural selection on TF binding sites. Finally, we annotated and interpreted variants associated with complex traits, and we validated their allele-specific enhancer activity by reporter gene assays. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="RESULTS"><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title><text><SENT sid="38107" pm="."><plain>Results <sec id="sec003"><title><text><SENT sid="38108" pm="."><plain>Computational prediction of functional variants in regulatory sequences <p><text><SENT sid="38109" pm="."><plain>The CENTIPEDE approach allows to predict TF activity by integrating sequence motif models together with functional genomics data, and gains the most information from high-resolution data such as DNase-seq or ATAC-seq [19]. </plain></SENT>

However, many sequence models in existing databases were created with very few instances of known TF binding sites and do not represent the full spectrum of sequence variation that can be tolerated without affecting binding.

<SENT sid="38134" pm="."><plain>Each of the nested SNP functional categories have marked differences in p-value distribution (Fig 2A) for the QuASAR test of ASH.

Furthermore, these enrichments for lower p-values are much higher than those of DHS-hSNPs (4x) and footprint-hSNPs (6x), indicating that identifying SNPs in DHS regions and/or footprints alone is not enough to predict functional effects on binding.

Our strategy integrates sequence information with functional genomics data to predict the impact of single nucleotide changes on tissue-specific TF binding. This is achieved while integrating footprint information that preserves the identity of the underlying factor with high specificity. By borrowing data from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics, we generated one of the most comprehensive catalogs available to date annotating regulatory regions and functional genetic variants across the genome. <p><text><SENT sid="38301" pm="."><plain>Thus far, most common approaches for identifying regulatory variants from functional genomics data assume that each SNP in a regulatory region is equally likely to be functional. A key finding in this study is that genetic variants in active regulatory sequences, as defined by DNase I sensitivity and footprinting, are mostly silent; only 2.1% of SNPs in DHS regions and 3.1% of SNPs in CENTIPEDE footprints are estimated to have ASH. This is analogous to SNPs in coding regions, where most genetic changes are synonymous and do not result in an amino acid change [29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38304" pm="."><plain>The sequence model developed in this study provides a very useful filter for non-coding genetic variants that are not functional, resulting in a tissue-specific and motif-specific annotation of effect-SNPs (56.5% of which are estimated to have an impact on ASH). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38305" pm="."><plain>This is crucial information to take into account when we attempt to understand the molecular mechanism behind GWAS hits and evolutionary signals of selection. As additional functional genomics studies are performed, across larger sample sizes, tissue types and cellular conditions, it will be important to further determine the functional subset of regulatory variants within binding sites to achieve greater power in functionally annotating genetic variants associated with complex traits. <p><text><SENT sid="38307" pm="."><plain>We find that genetic variants that are predicted to impact TF binding are depleted in the core promoter regions, exhibit higher sequence conservation in closely related species, tend to have low allele frequency and are enriched in tissue-specific footprints. These properties largely reflect the family-wise characteristics of motifs, which are further reflected in signals of selection. Future studies could incorporate tissue breath, conservation and distance to TSS as features to further filter effect-SNPs that may not show ASH. It should also be noted that our definition of functional regulatory variants is connected to the predicted effect on binding in the specific subset of cell-types/conditions that were available. Analyzing the allelic effects of non-coding variants in the context of other tissue types, conditions and functional genomic assays may potentially identify a functional role for some of the sites here defined as silent. In this study, we treated each TF separately, but future work should further explore the combinatorial grammar that different groups of motifs may define by cooperative binding to determine tissue specific binding sites. This will probably require more complex sequence models (e.g., SVMs [18, 54] or deep neural networks [55, 56]) than the PWMs used here. Here we show that the footprint information helps in predicting functional variants by further identifying the underlying TF compared to a sequence-fits-all model. More sophisticated footprint models [57] may also offer additional improvements to dissect the complexity of the regulatory grammar. <p><text><SENT sid="38316" pm="."><plain>As not all genetic variants that have an impact on binding may lead to changes in gene expression and ultimately an organismal phenotype, combining these predictions with eQTL data across several tissues or environmental conditions would be important to further refine this annotation. As an example, Wen et al. [33], using an early release of this annotation in lymphoblastoid cell-lines demonstrates that effect-SNPs are 1.49 fold (with 95%CI[1.38, 1.63]) more likely than baseline SNPs (SNPs that are not located in a footprint) to be eQTLs (p = 4.93 × 10−22); in contrast, silent footprint-SNPs are 1.15 fold (with 95%CI[1.04, 1.27]) enriched in eQTLs, comparing to baseline SNPs (p = 0.0035). <p><text><SENT sid="38318" pm="."><plain>A key feature of our annotation is that it spans a large collection of tissues and transcription factor motifs. This allowed us to trace some of the evolutionary history of TF binding and identify evolutionary constraints on specific molecular functions, which may reflect selective pressures during human history. For example, we observed that immune TFs are enriched for ASH sites, which supports the hypothesis that this may be a consequence of human adaptations to pathogen exposures [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38321" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, we identified neural development TFs that may have undergone positive selection in humans. The large number of regulatory variants predicted in our study, together with previously reported eQTL signals [59–61], and the overall relevance that they have in explaining complex traits provide further support for polygenic models of complex traits in humans. By taking advantage of the factor-specific annotations in our study, we identified motifs that are enriched for regulatory variants associated with relevant GWAS traits and we provide examples of molecular mechanisms behind the association signals; e.g., immune TFs in the lipids study, and developmental TFs for height. Finally, we show how regulatory annotations improve the identification of potential causal SNPs in GWAS. Overall, the GWAS meta-analysis and selection signals in our study support the concept that polygenic variation in binding sites has been a major target of evolutionary forces and a key contributor to disease risk and complex phenotypes in human populations. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title><text><SENT sid="38326" pm="."><plain>Methods <sec id="sec011"><title><text><SENT sid="38327" pm="."><plain>Identification of active regulatory sites and motif recalibration <p><text><SENT sid="38328" pm="."><plain>We used 1,949 PWM sequence models (motifs) from the TRANSFAC [62] and JASPAR [63] databases to scan the genome for a set of representative motif matches (Section 3.1 in S1 Text). </plain></SENT>
