However study of relationships between chromatin features and TF–TF co-occupancy remains limited. Here, we revealed the relationship by first illustrating distinct profile patterns of chromatin features related to different binding events, including single TF binding and TF–TF co-occupancy of 71 TFs from five human cell lines. We further implemented statistical analyses to demonstrate the relationship by accurately predicting co-occupancy genome-widely using chromatin features including DNase I hypersensitivity, 11 histone modifications (HMs) and GC content. Remarkably, our results showed that the combination of chromatin features enables accurate predictions across the five cells. For individual chromatin features, DNase I enables high and consistent predictions. H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac are more reliable predictors than other HMs. Although the combination of 11 HMs achieves accurate predictions, their predictive ability varies considerably when a model obtained from one cell is applied to others, indicating relationship between HMs and TF–TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent. GC content is not a reliable predictor, but the addition of GC content to any other features enhances their predictive ability. Together, our results elucidate a strong relationship between TF–TF co-occupancy and chromatin features. </p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>18 March 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title><text><SENT sid="38700" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38701" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional regulation exists at both genetic and epigenetic levels. Binding of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences is a pivotal step in the control of gene expression. Studies of sequence-associated TF binding preferences have led to the development of sequence-specific Position Weighted Matrix (PWM) (1) and position-specific affinity matrices (2) approaches for identification of TF binding sites (TFBSs). <p><text><SENT sid="38704" pm="."><plain>Epigenetic regulation refers to the alteration of DNA accessibility to TFs coordinately with chemical modifications of chromatin (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38705" pm="."><plain>This process may involve in multiple factors, such as DNA shape, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications (HMs), nucleosome positions and other chromatin variants (4–9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38706" pm="."><plain>Analyses of experimental data show that distinct HM patterns appear around TFBSs, and ChIP-Seq signals of TF bindings and HMs are highly predictive of each other (10–14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38707" pm="."><plain>Specifically, previous studies depicted that chromatin features, such as HMs and DNA shape, are highly correlated with the quantitative changes of TF binding affinities (14,15). <p><text><SENT sid="38708" pm="."><plain>TFs tend to work with others for accurately regulating expression of their target genes by binding to the same regulatory regions (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38709" pm="."><plain>These TFs can act either collaboratively or competitively (17–20), and are tightly associated with modeling of cell-specific cis-regulatory modules (21,22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38710" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies of possible TF–TF interactions with either systematic assays or ChIP-Seq in various organisms, such as Escherichia coli, yeast, the Drosophila embryo and human cell lines (17,23–27), revealed a great number of co-localization hotspots (28), and co-localization patterns that are related to regulatory functions (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38711" pm="."><plain>For instance, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a TF and widely binds to thousands of loci in genome (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38712" pm="."><plain>CTCF performs myriad functions by controlling binding affinities with its partners (30), such as yin yang 1 (YY1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38713" pm="."><plain>The cooperative role of CTCF and YY1 was originally seen in trans-activating Tsix ncRNA during X-chromosome inactivation (31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38714" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide analysis depicted their global co-localizations in human cells (23), and their interactions are, at least in part, associated with the evolutionary stability of CTCF genomic occupancy (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38715" pm="."><plain>Even for the same TF, if two binding sites are close to each other, the binding of the TF to one site is likely to interfere its binding to another one (32). <p><text><SENT sid="38716" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence and chemical modifications of chromatin can affect not only binding of an individual TF but also a cluster of TFs (23,33–35). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38717" pm="."><plain>Although a large amount of works have been done in investigating the associations of chromatin features with bindings of individual TFs (10–15), a few of studies have devoted to explore the relationships between chromatin features and TF–TF co-occupancy/interactions. This may shed light on a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between TF–TF interactions and chromatin features, as well as their regulatory mechanisms. <p><text><SENT sid="38719" pm="."><plain>In this work, we firstly illustrated the distinct profiling patterns of chromatin features for two types of genome binding events, including the regions solely bound by an individual TF and others bound by this TF and its partners simultaneously. We aligned and compared the profiles of DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase I), HMs and TF binding events by taking advantage of the wealth of data from the ENCODE project (23). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38721" pm="."><plain>Statistical tests showed a strong correlation between binding events and chromatin features across five human cell lines, including A549, GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38722" pm="."><plain>To further demonstrate the relationship between binding events and chromatin features, we then examined predictive ability of chromatin features for TF–TF co-occupancy through a computational model. Our results showed that chromatin features are able to accurately predict the TF–TF co-occupancy genome-widely. By constructing computational models with different chromatin features, we found that both DNase I and combined 11 HMs achieve similar predictive powers. In general, the predictive ability of a single HM is weak; 4 out of 11 HMs, including H3K27ac, H3K4me 2, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, are more reliable predictors than others. Although GC content itself is not an accurate predictor, addition of GC content improves the predictive ability of DNase I or HMs. We consequently applied the models obtained from one cell line to other cells, and found that the prediction accuracy of the combined chromatin features, including DNase I, 11 HMs and GC content, is maintained consistent across cell lines. Prediction accuracies of the models with individual or the combined 11 HMs receive considerable variances across cell lines, indicating the correlation between HMs and TF–TF co-occupancy is cell type dependent. Models using DNase I on the other hand obtain more consistent predictions across all of cell lines. Taken together, our analyses depict a potential role of chromatin features as determinants in the prediction of TF–TF co-occupancy. This study will contribute to our understanding of the interplay between genetic and epigenetic regulations of gene expression. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title><text><SENT sid="38732" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38794" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used CTCF and SP1 as the key experimental TFs, and analyzed their co-occupancy with other TFs.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="38903" pm="."><plain>The accurate regulation of gene expression involves in a complicated interplay between TF, histone modifying enzymes and other factors. The relative importance of epigenetic modification and TF bindings in the regulation of gene expression is still under debate. Statistics analysis has revealed that these two factors regulate gene transcription in a highly coordinate manner (34), and are redundant for predicting gene expression (55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38906" pm="."><plain>Several studies have described direct interactions between histone modifying enzymes and TFs (56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38907" pm="."><plain>Co-occupancy of a binding site by multiple TFs plays a critical role in fine regulation of gene expression (57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38908" pm="."><plain>Certain patterns of histone marks have been observed around co-binding sites of some TF pairs, such as FOXA1-FOXA3 (57), YY1-MYC and CTCF-NF-Y (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38909" pm="."><plain>However, there are no approaches available currently for computationally identifying TF–TF co-occupying sites using chromatin features and quantitatively modeling the correlation between them. We here introduced chromatin features, that are always cell-type specific, to refine the description of TF–TF co-occupancy, and observed a strong correlation of TF–TF co-occupancy with chromatin features. This relationship was further confirmed by quantitative predictions of TF–TF co-occupancy using multiple or individual chromatin features. <p><text><SENT sid="38912" pm="."><plain>Experimental techniques such as ChIP-Seq have been used to identify TF–TF co-occupancy (23,32,58–60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38913" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, these experimental methods are always expensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, computationally predicting models using sequence-based PWM methods (61–63) or combing ChIP-Seq data and PWMs (64) have also been developed to detect the co-occurring TFs (63) and their binding motifs (64–66). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38915" pm="."><plain>However, prediction of the putative TFBSs using the predefined PWM suffers from a high rate of false positive discovery (67). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38916" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these approaches ignore the influence from cell conditions, which are crucial for epigenetic modifications, chromatin accessibility, TF binding and consequently gene regulation (11,14,17,34,42,68). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38917" pm="."><plain>As a result, the prediction accuracy could vary greatly across cell types. For instance, the cobindR software (69) uses PWMs to identify the co-occurring TFs and their binding sites. This sequence-based approach can detect 6,444 CTCF–YY1 co-occupying sites (PWMs obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jaspar.genereg.net">http://jaspar.genereg.net</ext-link> (70)), which cover 49, 20, 31, 19 and 26% sites obtained from the ChIP-Seq data (Supplementary Table S1) in the A549, GM12878, H1-hESC, HepG-2 and K562 cells, respectively. As a comparison, our method used cell type-specific chromatin features as predictors, which largely improve predictive accuracy for cell type-specific TF–TF co-occupying sites (Supplementary Table S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38921" pm="."><plain>Of noting, the most importance is that our study illustrated the correlation between chromatin features and TF–TF co-occupancy, which is the main aim of this study and can improve our understanding of the interactions between epigenetic and genomic regulation. <p><text><SENT sid="38922" pm="."><plain>The co-occupied TFs may have different regulation functions from solely bound TF. For example, co-localizations of CTCF and YY1 can enhance transcriptional activity of genes that they are co-occupied (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38924" pm="."><plain>Analysis showed that the binding intensities of CTCF at regions co-occupied by YY1 are significantly greater than those bound by only CTCF (Student's t-test P &lt; 1e-17 in the five cell lines; Supplementary Figure S23), indicating their differentially functional effects. By profiling co-occupancy of CTCF–YY1 and other TF–TF pairs with chromatin features, we demonstrated the important roles of chromatin modifications in gene regulation and the strong associations between genetic and epigenetic regulations. <p><text><SENT sid="38926" pm="."><plain>Our analysis further illustrated the generalization of this correlation across cell types, which led to the possible application of a prediction model trained from one cell line using combination of chromatin features to other cells for accurate predictions of TF–TF co-occupancy. When applied individual chromatin features in our models, the associations of DNase I with TF–TF co-occupancy were very conserved, and the cross-cell type applications of models with DNase I did not result in dramatically changes of prediction accuracy. This observation suggested that, although DNase I shows distinct profiling patterns in different cell types (68), these patterns may coordinately change with TF–TF interactions regardless of cell conditions. In contrast, the associations of individual or the combined 11 HMs are less conserved among cell lines. This may be explained by the reported cell-specific correlations between HMs and individual TF binding affinities (14). <p><text><SENT sid="38931" pm="."><plain>TF–TF co-occupancy may have an effect on transcriptional output. Comparisons of the expression levels for RefSeq genes showed that the genes overlapped YY1-only binding events are significantly more highly expressed, followed by genes overlapped with CTCF–YY1 binding events, in contrast to genes overlapped CTCF-only binding events (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P-values &lt; 10e-8; Supplementary Figure S24A), consistent with the previous findings (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38933" pm="."><plain>This observation indicates the different functions of CTCF–YY1 co-occupying regions compared to others. <p><text><SENT sid="38934" pm="."><plain>We further tested whether transcriptional output has relationship with both TF–TF co-occupancy and chromatin features, such as DNase I. Comparisons showed that, although either CTCF–YY1 co-occupancy or DNase I is associated with transcriptional activity (17,19,68), the combination of CTCF–YY1 and DNase I did not necessarily lead to higher transcriptional outputs (Supplementary Figure S24B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38936" pm="."><plain>Indeed, even if CTCF–YY1 and DNase I occurred in the same genomic regions, such as gene promoters, the transcriptional output varied from gene to gene (Supplementay Figures S24C, D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38937" pm="."><plain>This may be explained by the complicated correlation between DNase I and gene expression. For instance, Wang et al. showed that, even for the similarly expressed genes, the distribution of DNase I may differ among different chromosomes (71). <p><text><SENT sid="38939" pm="."><plain>DNA methylation is another type of epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell growth and disease development (6,72). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38940" pm="."><plain>Early studies reported that DNA methylation is related with TF binding (73), but it alone is not sufficient to prevent protein binding (74–76), or had a weak correlation with individual TF binding affinity (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38941" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationship between DNA methylation (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section) and TF–TF co-occupancy. We selected the methylation level of CpG site(s) mapped into the 100-bp bin centered at each TFBS to compute methylation level at that binding site. Most of TFBSs do not have methylated CpG site(s). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38944" pm="."><plain>In the GM12878 cell lines, 5583 out of 40 247 CTCF binding sites have ≥1 CpGs, including 2,415 CTCF–YY1 and 3148 CTCF-only sites. We constructed SVM classifier with DNA methylation and/or other chromatin features. The results showed that DNA methylation has very fair predication ability, with accuracies ∼0.57 in the five human cell lines. Moreover, the combinations of DNA methylation with any other chromatin features led to nearly same predictive performances (Supplementary Figure S25). <p><text><SENT sid="38948" pm="."><plain>TFs prefer working together to regulate gene expression by targeting the same genomic regions, namely TF hotspots (21,22,28,77). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38949" pm="."><plain>These regions are usually cell type specific, represented by active histone marks and reflect certain chromatin states (77,78). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38950" pm="."><plain>We therefore examined the correlation between chromatin states and TF–TF co-occupancy. Since the CTCF ChIP-Seq has been used by the ChromHMM for the determination of chromatin state segmentation, we selected the SP1-TF pairs as the testing examples. TFBSs were mapped into the 15 chromatin states with different distributions and the association of SP1-TF co-occupancy with all 15 chromatin states were assessed (Supplementary Figure S26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38953" pm="."><plain>In general, the models using the chromatin state segmentation gave predictive outcomes with accuracies lower than the ones using the combination of all chromatin features or the 11 HMs (Supplementary Figures S27A, B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38954" pm="."><plain>This suggested that TF–TF co-occupancy is not only reflected by chromatin states or those HMs used for chromatin state determination, but other chromatin features, such as DNase I and GC components. As well, the adding of chromatin state segmentation to any other chromatin features did not significantly change the predictive outcomes (Supplementary Figure S27A, C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38956" pm="."><plain>This may be because that, during the prediction of chromatin state segmentation with the ChromHMM model, 8 of the 11 HMs from our study have been used as the inputs, and therefore the information from the chromatin state segmentation is partially overlapped with the one from the 11 HMs. <p><text><SENT sid="38957" pm="."><plain>In summary, we have presented a statistical and computational approach to investigate the complicated interplays between genetic and epigenetic regulations of gene expression. Although our analysis cannot demonstrate the relative importance or causative role of TFs or chromatin features in transcriptional regulation, we have elucidated a strong relationship between TF–TF co-occupancy and various chromatin features through a large-scale statistical and computational experiments, which will help us in understanding the mechanisms of combinational regulatory landscape. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SEC5"><title><text><SENT sid="38959" pm="."><plain>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA </plain></SENT>
