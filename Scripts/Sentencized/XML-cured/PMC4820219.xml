</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39127" pm="."><plain>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major health challenges of the next decades and is currently estimated by Global Burden of Disease studies as the third leading cause of death worldwide.1 It is a chronic disease characterized by airflow limitation which is progressive, not fully reversible and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles and gases.2–4 The high burden of COPD resulting from its respiratory symptoms is further enhanced by recurrent exacerbations,5,6 which are triggered mainly by the acquisition of new strains of respiratory pathogens or an increase in the concentration of bacteria colonizing the lower airways.7–9 Known to drive progressive lung function decline and physical inactivity, these acute events contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality, and the resulting hospitalizations impose a significant strain on health care resource utilization.10,11 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39128" pm="."><plain>Although the spectrum of available COPD treatments reduces the frequency of exacerbations by approximately 20%–30%,12–15 they are insufficient as many patients still experience at least one exacerbation a year of which one-quarter requires hospitalization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39129" pm="."><plain>A recent large European audit on COPD exacerbations in hospitalized patients revealed that these events were associated with 12% mortality and 35% risk of readmission within 3 months after discharge.16 It is needless to argue that our current acute interventions are lacking effectiveness in a substantial proportion of the COPD admissions and that new interventions in this particular subset of patients are warranted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39130" pm="."><plain>Bacterial infections are responsible for around half of the acute exacerbations (AEs) of COPD.17 Current guidelines therefore recommend antibiotic therapy for patients with more severe symptoms, with treatment typically lasting 5–7 days. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39131" pm="."><plain>Although such intervention has shown to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations, relapse is common with some patients remaining at high risk for recurrent episodes for several weeks after the initial event. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39132" pm="."><plain>Failure may be related to inadequate antibiotic efficacy, but even with effective bacterial eradication, or in case of noninfectious events, increased airway inflammation may persist for a prolonged period after discharge and will likely promote recurrence.9 Epidemiological data confirm that the risk for subsequent events peaks drastically during 90 days after discharge and clearly increases with every following hospital admission.18 Disrupting the vicious cycle of one severe exacerbation introducing a subsequent one is therefore a promising interventional strategy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39133" pm="."><plain>Several randomized clinical trials have shown benefits of long-term macrolide treatment in a variety of chronic respiratory diseases, particularly in diffuse panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome post-lung transplantation, and bronchiectasis.19–23 The potential of long-term macrolide treatment for preventing COPD exacerbations has been recently confirmed in a large randomized controlled trial showing that chronic azithromycin therapy over 1 year, on top of standard inhalation therapy, reduced the risk of exacerbations by ∼30%.24 However, the long-term use of this class of antibiotics is not recommended in all patients with COPD as it is inevitably associated with bacterial resistance and carries the risk for side effects such as hearing loss and life-threatening arrhythmias by the prolongation of the QT interval.25 Despite its potent effects and its proof of concept, uncertainty remains about the specific patient population that is most likely to benefit and also about the optimal dose and duration of the macrolide treatment.26 For these reasons, a recent update of the international treatment recommendations for COPD by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) still did not incorporate azithromycin in its therapeutic arsenal.4 Reducing the dose and time course of the azithromycin intervention, as well as restricting the treatment to a subgroup of patients with COPD with the highest risk for future exacerbations, may overcome some of these concerns, and would therefore be a major step forward to a targeted clinical use.25,27 Additionally, short courses of macrolides were shown to facilitate the weaning process in ventilator-associated pneumonia and to shorten the time to resolution of pneumonia by approximately 40%.28 In AEs of asthma, 10 days of neomacrolides resulted in a significant symptom improvement compared to placebo.29 In line with these immediate therapeutic benefits for other acute respiratory diseases, azithromycin therapy, initiated at the onset of acute COPD exacerbations requiring hospital admission, may also improve short-term outcomes of hospitalization and prevent early relapse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39134" pm="."><plain>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the main aim is to assess whether a targeted course of low-dose azithromycin for 3 months, initiated at the onset of a severe AE requiring hospitalization, might be effective and safe in the highest risk period, that is, during and immediately after the acute event. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="39158" pm="."><plain>Within 48 hours after hospital admission, a 3-month treatment phase with azithromycin or placebo is initiated at an uploading dose of 500 mg once a day for 3 days and subsequently administered at a lower maintenance dose of 250 mg every 2 days for the remainder of the 90-day treatment period. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="39161" pm="."><plain>Rationale for duration and dose of azithromycin </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39162" pm="."><plain>In 2011, Albert et al showed that azithromycin reduces the risk of future COPD exacerbations by ∼30% on top of standard inhalation therapy when given chronically for over a year at a dose of 250 mg once daily. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39163" pm="."><plain>Careful observation of the data revealed that a major part of the reduction in exacerbations is already obtained within 90 days after treatment onset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39164" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the curves representing the proportion of patients free from AEs may still diverge, whereas after 6 months of treatment, a more steady and equal decline for both the placebo and intervention arm are reached.24 Remarkably, in the study by Wong et al on the reduction of exacerbations in bronchiectasis, in which azithromycin was stopped after 6 months of treatment, benefits persisted for another 6 months of follow-up.23 It indicates that the withdrawal of azithromycin after prolonged intake of 3–6 months is reasonable to consider and sufficient for interrupting the circle of inflammation, infection, and relapse. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39165" pm="."><plain>In addition to the optimal duration for the azithromycin intervention, uncertainty remains about the ideal dose to target therapeutic serum and tissue levels.26 Earlier pharmacokinetic studies have found that a dose of 500 mg corresponded to serum peak levels of 0.4 μg/mL with a half-life of 40–68 hours. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39166" pm="."><plain>With repeated administration, lung tissue levels increased 75-fold and persisted even after serum levels declined.34,35 Therefore, several experts believe that 250 mg of azithromycin three times weekly is probably sufficient to obtain all therapeutic benefits while reducing potential side effects, although there are no specific data to support this in COPD.25,36 </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39170" pm="."><plain>The primary clinical efficacy endpoint is the time-to-treatment failure and will be evaluated within the period from randomization (day 1, from 1 hour after the first intake of study drug) until the end of intervention (day 90, 24 hours after the last intake of study drug). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39171" pm="."><plain>By using this endpoint, the potential short-term benefits of acute macrolide treatment, as well as the long-term benefits of prolonged treatment, are utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39172" pm="."><plain>The combined endpoint is defined as either death, the admission to intensive care or the requirement of additional systemic steroids or new antibiotics for respiratory reasons, or the diagnosis of a new AE of COPD after discharge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39173" pm="."><plain>Each of the components in the combined endpoint bears the same weight; once one is fulfilled, the primary endpoint is met. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39174" pm="."><plain>The use of this combined endpoint of treatment failure in the first 3 months is in line with earlier studies on the efficacy of systemic steroids during the AE37 and will avoid arbitrary clinical decisions on whether recurrent symptoms or therapy needed is related to an incomplete resolution or to a new acute event. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39175" pm="."><plain>Key secondary endpoints are the number of clinical failures at day 90, symptom COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score at day 90, and total days of steroid use at day 90. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="39244" pm="."><plain>This randomized placebo-controlled trial aims to establish an appropriate but more restricted use of azithromycin during and immediately after hospital admission for a severe exacerbation of COPD to overcome the highest risk period for treatment failure, relapse, and death. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39245" pm="."><plain>The proposed intervention will deal not only with short-term in-hospital outcomes but also with the relapse rate during the 3 months after discharge, a period known to have the highest risk for deterioration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="39246" pm="."><plain>By reducing the dose and the duration of treatment with azithromycin and by targeting the treatment to acute periods with the highest risk for treatment failure, benefits may counterbalance potential side effects of macrolides, which may result in a new treatment strategy for severe AE of COPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39247" pm="."><plain>If proven to be safe and effective, a breakthrough in the acute treatment setting will be obtained and the chronic use of high-dose azithromycin in a large and poorly defined population of patients with COPD, with inherent risks and side effects, will be reserved for well-defined subgroups. </plain></SENT>
