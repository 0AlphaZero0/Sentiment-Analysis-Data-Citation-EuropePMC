</text></title><p id="P5"><text><SENT sid="40232" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the most common therapy for the treatment of anemia in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40233" pm="."><plain>An estimated 70% of VLBW infants receive at least one transfusion within the first 4 weeks of life (1), with ~80% receiving ≥1 RBC transfusions during their hospital stay (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40234" pm="."><plain>RBC transfusions, although lifesaving, can lead to immediate and delayed adverse transfusion reaction (3) and have been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (4), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5), retinopathy of prematurity (6) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (7). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P6"><text><SENT sid="40235" pm="."><plain>The practice of administering RBC transfusions is largely governed by the degree of prematurity and severity of illness of the infant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40236" pm="."><plain>Few studies have examined the clinical characteristics of VLBW infants that require RBC transfusions (8-10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40237" pm="."><plain>These studies have either been in subsets of infants weighing less than 1000 g or of small sample size. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40238" pm="."><plain>As the survival rate among VLBW infants continues to improve and clinicians become more cognizant of the risks associated with RBC transfusions, it is important to reexamine the clinical predictors and trends of RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40239" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that doing so would identify important, potentially modifiable factors that would enable reducing exposure to RBC transfusions among VLBW infants. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P7"><text><SENT sid="40241" pm="."><plain>Of the 1,825 VLBW infants who met inclusion criteria, 35 were excluded from the analysis because they had been enrolled in a research trial in which RBC transfusion criteria was prescribed (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40242" pm="."><plain>Seven infants were excluded because they had received an exchange blood transfusion, and 33 were excluded due to incomplete data (i.e., discrepant number of RBC transfusions, incomplete documentation of number of days on mechanical ventilation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40243" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of the 1,750 VLBW infants available for analyses changed over epochs (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40244" pm="."><plain>Birthweight (BW), gestational age (GA), length of stay and the incidence of NEC increased over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40245" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 66.7% of infants received ≥1 RBC transfusions (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40246" pm="."><plain>There was no difference across epochs in the unadjusted number of RBC transfusions administered per infant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P8"><text><SENT sid="40247" pm="."><plain>To assess independent clinical predictors of ≥1 RBC transfusions, multivariable logistic regression analysis (Table 3) revealed that the likelihood of receiving ≥1 RBC transfusions decreased with each 1.0 g/dL increment of initial hemoglobin concentration (Hgb) after birth (aOR 0.70, CI 0.65–0.75), female sex (aOR 0.64, CI 0.47–0.87), and with 100 g birth weight increments (aOR 0.71, CI 0.65–0.76). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40248" pm="."><plain>The clinical factors that independently increased the likelihood of any transfusion included non–lethal congenital anomaly requiring surgery (aOR 6.97, CI 1.57–30.89), time spent mechanically ventilated, (1–7 days [aOR 1.79, CI 1.25–2.57], 7–28 days [aOR 8.33, CI 4.78–14.51], and ≥28 days [aOR 67.41 CI 8.79–517.00]), and each incremental hospital day (aOR 1.04, CI 1.03–1.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40249" pm="."><plain>Every infant who developed NEC received at least one RBC transfusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40250" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of the nursery neurobiologic risk score (NBRS) as an additional predictor or a replacement for assisted ventilation duration in the multivariable logistic regression model did not improve the model fit; therefore, time spent on mechanical ventilation was utilized as a proxy for illness severity throughout the entire hospital stay. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P9"><text><SENT sid="40251" pm="."><plain>In assessing RBC transfusion trends, compared with Epoch 3, the likelihood of receiving ≥1 RBC transfusions was greater in Epoch 1 (aOR 2.39, CI 1.56–3.65) and Epoch 2 (aOR 2.81, CI 1.90–4.15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40252" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean (SEM) number of RBC transfusions per subject derived from the Poisson regression analysis was 2.05 (0.12) in Epoch 3, compared with 2.40 (0.14) in Epoch 1 and 2.58 (0.15) in Epoch 2. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P10"><text><SENT sid="40253" pm="."><plain>The adjusted probability of receiving ≥1 transfusions for any initial Hgb decreased in Epoch 3 compared to Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 is shown in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40255" pm="."><plain>The predicted probability of receiving ≥1 RBC transfusions, as estimated by the effect probability plot, in the most recent epoch was 50% for an initial Hgb of ~16.5 g/dL and was less than 50% for higher initial Hgb values. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="P11"><text><SENT sid="40258" pm="."><plain>Of the examined clinical predictors of RBC transfusions in VLBW infants in this single center retrospective study, initial Hgb following delivery was found to have a major effect on the likelihood of administering ≥1 RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40259" pm="."><plain>Each 1 g/dL increment in initial Hgb decreased the adjusted likelihood of receiving ≥1 RBC transfusions by 30%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40260" pm="."><plain>For an initial hemoglobin concentration of ~16.5 g/dL, the predicted probability of being transfused was 50%, and this probability declined as the initial Hgb increased. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40261" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that modest increments in initial Hgb achieved by placentofetal transfusion at birth might yield clinically meaningful reductions in the need for RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P12"><text><SENT sid="40262" pm="."><plain>Of the other clinical predictors, several have been reported previously and thus were expected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40263" pm="."><plain>Also, given that ventilator support is included in our institutional RBC transfusion guideline, we expected it to be predictive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40264" pm="."><plain>However, female sex was an unexpected independent predictor that decreased the adjusted likelihood of ≥1 RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40265" pm="."><plain>Female sex was also associated with a reduced Hgb concentration that predicted a 50% likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion when compared to males. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P13"><text><SENT sid="40266" pm="."><plain>Three prior observational studies have reported a similar relationship between higher initial Hgb and reduced administration of RBC transfusions to preterm infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40267" pm="."><plain>However, two examined only extremely low birth weight infants, the majority of whom received concurrent erythropoietin therapy, thus confounding direct comparison with the present study (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40268" pm="."><plain>The third study reported only p values without effect size (10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P14"><text><SENT sid="40269" pm="."><plain>Randomized clinical trials on placentofetal transfusion in preterm infants have reported larger blood volumes (12), higher Hgb concentration after birth (13-15), and fewer overall RBC transfusions in infants exposed to delayed cord clamping or umbilical cord milking (16-18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40270" pm="."><plain>In addition, improved neurodevelopmental status at 7 months (19) and 4 years (20) have been reported in some longitudinal studies of term infants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40271" pm="."><plain>A Cochrane review examining delayed cord clamping or cord milking vs. immediate cord clamping found fewer transfusions of packed RBCs, better circulatory stability, less IVH (all grades), decreased oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected GA and lower risk for NEC with delayed cord clamping or cord milking (21). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P15"><text><SENT sid="40272" pm="."><plain>However, disruption of timely resuscitation, the ideal duration of time to delay cord clamping, and whether umbilical cord milking is a safe and effective alternative to delayed cord clamping (22, 23) remain concerns requiring further study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40273" pm="."><plain>Also, there continues to be a need for clinical data on the long–term neurodevelopmental implications of these strategies in preterm infants (23, 24). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P16"><text><SENT sid="40274" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify female sex as an independent protective factor for requiring RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40275" pm="."><plain>In the reviewed literature, there does not appear to be any direct relationship between male sex and decreased red cell mass, erythropoietin production, impaired bone marrow function or increased RBC senescence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40276" pm="."><plain>However, it has been suggested that when compared to females, males carry an unexplained intrinsic risk for adverse neonatal outcomes overall (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40277" pm="."><plain>Males have higher rates of neonatal mortality, respiratory morbidities, and adverse neurologic outcomes, even after adjusting for maternal factors, GA and BW (26). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P17"><text><SENT sid="40278" pm="."><plain>The other observed factors in the present study that contributed to the likelihood of RBC transfusions relate to the degree of prematurity and the severity of illness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40279" pm="."><plain>Non–lethal congenital anomalies requiring surgery, time spent on mechanical ventilation, NEC and per day increments of length of hospital stay were all significantly associated with an increased likelihood of requiring ≥1 RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40280" pm="."><plain>These factors are difficult to modify given current neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40281" pm="."><plain>Together and individually they reflect the severity of illness of the infant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40282" pm="."><plain>As such, they commonly necessitate frequent blood sampling for close clinical monitoring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40283" pm="."><plain>It is common for the cumulative phlebotomy loss for laboratory analysis during the first weeks of life to equal or exceed the infant’s total circulating blood volume (27); estimates of laboratory phlebotomy loss among preterm infants vary from 1.1 to 3.5 mL/kg/d in the first few weeks of life (28-30). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40284" pm="."><plain>Techniques for reducing phlebotomy losses, such as utilizing placental blood at birth for initial laboratory analyses (31) and inline analyzers/point-of care blood test analyzers have been shown to reduce phlebotomy losses in the first week of life by 25% and to reduce the exposure to RBC transfusion by 33%–48% without any adverse short- or long–term outcomes (27,32). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P18"><text><SENT sid="40285" pm="."><plain>The secondary aim of this study was to evaluate the temporal trend in RBC transfusions in VLBW infants over the 14-year study period. Figure 1 depicts this trend clearly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40286" pm="."><plain>Each curve represents the probability of being transfused by epoch based on the initial Hgb after birth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40287" pm="."><plain>At any level of starting hemoglobin the probability of being transfused was decreased in epoch 3 when compared to epoch 1 and 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40288" pm="."><plain>The adjusted likelihood of exposure to ≥1 RBC transfusions and the adjusted mean number of RBC transfusions both decreased in the most recent epoch compared with earlier epochs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40289" pm="."><plain>This occurred despite the lack of change in institutional RBC transfusion guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P19"><text><SENT sid="40290" pm="."><plain>From the same NICU, we previously reported a significant decrease in the unadjusted number of transfusions per infant compared at three different years: 1982, 1989 and 1993 (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40291" pm="."><plain>The percent of VLBW infants transfused during hospitalization in 1982 and 1993 were 88% and 62% respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40292" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted number of transfusions (mean ±SD) per infant was 7.0 ± 7.4 in 1982 and 2.3 ± 2.7 in 1993. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40293" pm="."><plain>However, major changes occurred over the study period that influenced transfusion practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40294" pm="."><plain>These included the identification of human immunodeficiency virus, improved practice of administering maternal corticosteroids, administration of pulmonary surfactant to infants with respiratory distress syndrome, and adoption of stricter RBC transfusion criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40295" pm="."><plain>In the current study timeframe, a comparable proportion of VLBW infants, 66.7%, received one or more RBC transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40296" pm="."><plain>There was no difference across epochs in the unadjusted number of RBC transfusions per infant, but the adjusted mean number of transfusions decreased. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P20"><text><SENT sid="40297" pm="."><plain>We speculate that the reduced adjusted mean number of transfusions in the most recent epoch may be due to clinicians being more conservative in prescribing transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40298" pm="."><plain>They may not be following the transfusion guideline strictly but using clinical judgment to decide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40299" pm="."><plain>In addition, and of minor effect, is the influence of the research trial in which RBC transfusion criteria was prescribed (11) in which our institution became a part of in 2013. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40300" pm="."><plain>Infants not enrolled in the trial may be placed at a transfusion threshold closer to the restrictive threshold, thus reducing overall transfusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40301" pm="."><plain>However, compliance to institutional transfusion guideline was not available; therefore, we cannot ascertain if less stringent adherence to institutional transfusion guideline accounts for the reduced transfusion numbers in the most recent epoch. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="P21"><text><SENT sid="40302" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize other strengths and weaknesses of the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40303" pm="."><plain>Although the study includes a large and robust dataset, allowing for adjustment for many predictors of transfusion, we are limited by its observational nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40304" pm="."><plain>Thus we may not have identified and studied all predictors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40305" pm="."><plain>In addition it is a single center study, limiting its generalizability to other centers. </plain></SENT>
