</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40662" pm="."><plain>The Baltic Sea is the world's second largest brackish water body. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40663" pm="."><plain>It is connected to the North Sea by several narrow straits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40664" pm="."><plain>A horizontal salinity gradient ranging from 2 to 30 traverses the Baltic Sea and parts of the North Sea in a Northeast–Southwest (NE-SW) direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40665" pm="."><plain>This gradient is maintained by sporadic inflows of saline deep water in the south, in combination with freshwater input from rivers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40666" pm="."><plain>A strong halocline at 60–80 m depth restricts vertical mixing in the Baltic Proper, and large areas of the deeper waters are hypoxic or anoxic (Carstensen et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40667" pm="."><plain>The intermediate salinity and subarctic conditions constrain the macrobial biodiversity in the Baltic Sea, and its multicellular species are fewer and typically genetically impoverished compared to the populations of the NE Atlantic (Johannesson and André, 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40668" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bacterioplankton diversity does not appear to decrease at intermediate salinities (Herlemann et al., 2011), and for protists it has even been suggested that species richness is actually highest in the horohalinicum region (salinity 5–8; Telesh et al., 2011a, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40669" pm="."><plain>Unicellular plankton play key roles in global biogeochemical cycles and form the basis of marine food webs (Falkowski et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40670" pm="."><plain>In the Baltic Sea, diatoms and dinoflagellates (&gt;10 μm) dominate primary production in spring, while smaller eukaryotic phytoplankton and cyanobacteria (&lt;3 μm) dominate primary production over the rest of the year (Johansson et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40671" pm="."><plain>Heterotrophic bacteria play key roles in taking up dissolved organic matter stemming from primary production within the ecosystem and from terrestrial runoff-water (Azam and Malfatti, 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40672" pm="."><plain>Bacteria also mediate most transformations in the cycling of nitrogen, phosphorus, trace metals, and other nutrients (Falkowski et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40673" pm="."><plain>Energy and nutrients are propagated to higher trophic levels through grazing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40674" pm="."><plain>Large phytoplankton are primarily grazed upon by mesozooplankton (e.g., copepods) but also by micro-zooplankton, i.e., heterotrophic protists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40675" pm="."><plain>The current view is that picoplankton (bacteria and picoeukaryotes; 0.2–2 μm) are predated upon by nanoplankton (nanoflagellates and small ciliates; 2–20 μm), while the nanoplankton are eaten by larger zooplankton (copepods, rotifers, larger ciliates and dinoflagellates) (Samuelsson et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40676" pm="."><plain>The grazing on heterotrophic bacteria brings the organic matter leaked by phytoplankton during photosynthesis back to the traditional food chain, closing what is called the microbial loop (Azam et al., 1983). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40677" pm="."><plain>Finally, the larger zooplankton are predated upon by fish; in the pelagic Baltic Sea, mainly by sprat and herring. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40678" pm="."><plain>In this way, all elements of the pelagic ecosystem are interconnected, leading to cascade effects between different levels of the food web. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40679" pm="."><plain>For instance loss of top predators could be propagated all the way down to affect picoplankton community composition and function (Casini et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40680" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of phyto- and zooplankton serves to estimate the environmental state and to detect changes regarding eutrophication, biodiversity, harmful algal blooms etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40681" pm="."><plain>This is today largely based on microscopic techniques (Hällfors, 2004; Olenina et al., 2006), which are time-consuming (~4 h/sample) and rely heavily on the skills of taxonomists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40682" pm="."><plain>Cross-comparison between datasets analyzed by different taxonomists may therefore be problematic. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40683" pm="."><plain>The smallest plankton organisms, i.e., the pico- and nanoplankton (0.2–2 and 2–20 μm), and larger organisms that lack distinctive morphological features are difficult to identify using light microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40684" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these most abundant organisms are most often simply termed “Unicells” or “Flagellates” since they cannot be taxonomically identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40685" pm="."><plain>Hence, there is a need for faster, more robust novel methods that can cover a larger fraction of planktonic diversity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40686" pm="."><plain>Due to the recent developments of high-throughput sequencing techniques, genetic methods are a promising avenue for monitoring biological diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40687" pm="."><plain>Genetic barcoding consists of taxonomically assigning a specimen based on sequencing a short standardized DNA fragment (barcode) and by matching this to a reference library of sequences of known taxonomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40688" pm="."><plain>By metabarcoding, the approach is extended to a community of individuals of different species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40689" pm="."><plain>Metabarcoding has been extensively used for assessing both prokaryotic and eukaryotic plankton diversity and biogeography (Sogin et al., 2006; Amaral-Zettler et al., 2009; de Vargas et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40690" pm="."><plain>A number of metabarcoding studies have investigated diversity and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of prokaryotes in the Baltic Sea (Andersson et al., 2010; Herlemann et al., 2011; Dupont et al., 2014; Lindh et al., 2015), however, the methodology has not yet been used to map eukaryotic plankton in this sea. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40691" pm="."><plain>Here, we have conducted ultra-deep Illumina sequencing of surface-water bacterial and eukaryotic plankton communities sampled in the summer of 2013 along a 2000 km transect following the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40692" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to give a comprehensive view of plankton diversity across the salinity gradient, and to investigate how microbial alpha- and beta-diversity is structured by salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40693" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first high-throughput sequencing-based investigation of eukaryotic plankton biogeography in the Baltic Sea and we combined it with a renewed description of the bacterial diversity highlighted by previous studies (Herlemann et al., 2011; Dupont et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40717" pm="."><plain>The primers were trimmed from forward and reverse reads with FastX (Pearson et al., 1997), as well as 40 bases in the 3′ end of the reverse reads (these displayed lower quality than the forward reads). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="40719" pm="."><plain>In order to avoid generating artificial OTUs while assigning as many reads as possible, we used more stringent criteria when generating OTU-centroid sequences than in the mapping (assigning step). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="40917" pm="."><plain>The Baltic Sea has an exceptional long record of plankton monitoring, based primarily on microscopy, from the HELCOM-COMBINE monitoring program (HELCOM, 2015), but to our knowledge this is the first investigation of eukaryotic plankton diversity along the full salinity gradient using high-throughput sequencing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40918" pm="."><plain>Compared to traditional microscopy based methods, high-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes (metabarcoding) potentially offers a more comprehensive view of microbial diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40919" pm="."><plain>While not yielding absolute cell counts, sequencing data presents integral information of microbial communities, and reveals trends in community changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40920" pm="."><plain>While morphological features in some cases can be used to classify plankton with high taxonomic resolution, this is not the case for the majority of species that are too small to allow classification by light microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40921" pm="."><plain>This is probably the reason why, with only 1 week's sampling, the present metabarcoding-based study revealed a microbial diversity on par with what has been recorded in the Baltic Sea with microscopy over a century (Hällfors, 2004; Telesh et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40922" pm="."><plain>In total we observed 1860 OTUs (548 broadly classified as phytoplankton and 774 as heterotrophs) which can be compared with 2075 known species of phytoplankton (Hällfors, 2004) and 1030 known species of micro-, meso-, and macrozooplankton (Telesh et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40923" pm="."><plain>When performing metabarcoding, the taxonomic accuracy is limited primarily by the resolution of the marker gene, the coverage of the primers, and the quality and completeness of the reference database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40924" pm="."><plain>Here we used the SSU rRNA gene, the most widely used taxonomic marker for bacterioplankton and protists (Amann et al., 1995; Pace, 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40925" pm="."><plain>While it provides a lower taxonomic resolution than e.g., the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, its highly conserved regions allow the use of primers with domain-wide taxonomic range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40926" pm="."><plain>Databases are also more complete than for other markers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40927" pm="."><plain>We amplified and sequenced 450–600 bp of the hypervariable regions V3–V4 in bacteria and V4–V5 in eukaryotes, using in-house designed primer pairs that cover a large proportion of taxa in each domain (Hugerth et al., 2014a,b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40928" pm="."><plain>Of the generated 18S OTUs, 31.8% could be classified to the genus level using our automatic classification scheme (see Methods), while 58.3% did not have sufficiently close matches (&gt;98% identity) in the PR2 database (i.e., insufficient database completeness) and 9.8% matched multiple genera (i.e., insufficient taxonomic resolution of the marker). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40929" pm="."><plain>An example of the former condition is present for sequences classified to Amoebozoa, which displayed unusually low identity levels to reference sequences (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40930" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the bacterial phylum Chlamydiae, that are symbionts on e.g., fish and amoeba in aquatic environments (Collingro et al., 2005; Stride et al., 2014) also displayed unusually low identity to reference sequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40931" pm="."><plain>Thus, the Baltic Sea appears to be inhabited by a set of poorly characterized Amoebozoa with poorly characterized bacterial symbionts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40932" pm="."><plain>Examples of the latter were E. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40933" pm="."><plain>Huxleyi and G. muellerae (Bendif et al., 2015) that have 100% identical sequences in the V4–V5 region, as was also the case for species of Labyrinthula isolated from different hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40934" pm="."><plain>Ideally, one would like to sequence both a part of the SSU rRNA gene and a more rapidly evolving marker, such as the ITS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40935" pm="."><plain>With recently developed emulsion-based protocols, it will be possible to connect different markers from the same cell (Borgström et al., 2015; Spencer et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40936" pm="."><plain>OTU relative abundances need to be carefully interpreted due to variations in the respective copy numbers of rRNA genes among phylogenetic groups, especially for eukaryotes (Prokopowich et al., 2003; Větrovský and Baldrian, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40937" pm="."><plain>Due to large cell volumes and vast genomes, dinoflagellates, diatoms, and ciliates in general possess more copies of the 18S rRNA gene than smaller flagellates, such as prasinophytes (Zhu et al., 2005; Godhe et al., 2008; Gong et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40938" pm="."><plain>Although, previous studies have shown a correlation between cell size (volume or length) and rRNA gene copy number (Godhe et al., 2008), copy numbers can also vary among species of the same genus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40939" pm="."><plain>Thus, comparing the relative abundance among different taxonomic groups may be misleading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40940" pm="."><plain>However, the variation in relative abundance of the same group across samples is still valid, allowing to test for correlations with variations in e.g., environmental parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40941" pm="."><plain>Most taxonomic groups, at all taxonomic levels, displayed strikingly smooth abundance changes along the salinity gradient sampled (Figures 3–5, Supplementary Figure 6) in contrast to the spiky abundance distributions to be expected if the methodology had introduced substantial random noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40942" pm="."><plain>This was also true for metazoa (Figure 6), which is perhaps unexpected given that the low volumes of water sampled here (&lt;1 l) are suboptimal for quantifying metazoa with their relatively low abundances in the water column. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40943" pm="."><plain>Systematic biases still likely exist, caused by e.g., primer mismatches and differences in rRNA gene copy numbers, but these should affect all samples equally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40944" pm="."><plain>Extracellular DNA released from dead (Kloos et al., 1994; Choi et al., 2004; Rice et al., 2007) or live (Böckelmann et al., 2006) cells may also lead to skewed estimates of abundance and diversity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40945" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, metabarcoding detects all life forms that carry the marker gene, muddling the distinction between vegetative cells and other life stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40946" pm="."><plain>Some species of dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and haptophytes are known to form resting cysts after blooms (Lichtlé, 1980; Adam and Mahood, 1981; Jordan and Chamberlain, 1997; Lotter et al., 1998; Warns et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40947" pm="."><plain>One example is Alexandrium, a toxic genus of dinoflagellates (Teegarden and Cembella, 1996) that sporadically blooms in the Baltic (Witek, 2004; Kremp et al., 2009), for which we observed high abundance (9.1% of protist reads) in one of the Kattegat samples (Supplementary Figure 6B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40948" pm="."><plain>Whether this reflects a bloom is hard to tell, since the sequences may be derived from cysts (Oshima et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40949" pm="."><plain>However, cysts are also toxic (Oshima et al., 1992), thus in some cases detecting both cysts and vegetative cells can be useful to track toxic outbreaks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40950" pm="."><plain>Similar to what was observed in previous studies (Herlemann et al., 2011; Dupont et al., 2014), bacterial community composition changed gradually along the salinity gradient, and difference in community composition (beta-diversity) was significantly correlated with difference in salinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40951" pm="."><plain>Here we showed for the first time a similar pattern for eukaryotic plankton composition using molecular data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40952" pm="."><plain>The observed pattern can probably also be driven by a combination of other factors such as availability of micronutrients and composition of dissolved organic matter that covary with salinity across the gradient, and may be different or weaker during other seasons than summer, but it is well established that salinity difference per se is a major barrier for species to cross (Logares et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40953" pm="."><plain>A recent study shows that the bacterioplankton inhabiting the Baltic Proper are not locally adapted freshwater or marine populations, but are rather members of a global brackish metacommunity that most likely adapted to brackish conditions before the Baltic Sea was formed (Hugerth et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40954" pm="."><plain>Whether this also holds true for protists inhabiting this sea remains to be investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40955" pm="."><plain>For endosymbiotic protists, isolated from the surrounding water and protected from osmotic stress, the distribution patterns are likely mainly determined by the salinity preference of the host. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="40956" pm="."><plain>The “Remane curve” (Remane, 1934) illustrates how diversity of freshwater, marine, and brackish specialist species vary along a salinity gradient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40957" pm="."><plain>Total diversity is lowest in the horohaliculum (salinity 5–8) because few freshwater and marine species can tolerate this salinity level and relatively few true brackish specialists exist that occupy this niche. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40958" pm="."><plain>Remane based his “Artenminimum” (species-minimum) concept (Remane and Schlieper, 1971) on macrozoobenthos, but since then the generality of the pattern has been debated (Reid, 1961; McLusky, 1989; Attrill, 2002; Portillo et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40959" pm="."><plain>Recently, Telesh et al. suggested the opposite pattern for protists, with a species-maximum in the horohaliculum (Telesh et al., 2011b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40960" pm="."><plain>The analysis was based on pooling species observations within salinity ranges from multiple studies, but has been questioned, since the intermediate salinity where the highest diversity was observed was also the most frequently sampled (Ptacnik et al., 2011; Telesh et al., 2011a), hence the pattern could stem from sampling biases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40961" pm="."><plain>Here we took the opportunity to measure alpha-diversity with our metabarcoding dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40962" pm="."><plain>This type of data has the potential to give an estimate of diversity that is not biased by morphological characters of the specimens, and the deep sequencing allows subsampling of each sample to the same depth, improving comparisons between samples (Lundin et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40963" pm="."><plain>Similar to what was previously observed (Herlemann et al., 2011), total bacterial alpha-diversity did not display any clear trends over the freshwater-marine continuum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40964" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the total protist community (eukaryotic data excluding metazoa) displayed neither a species-minimum nor a species-maximum in the horohaliculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40965" pm="."><plain>When zooming in on specific eukaryotic groups, only one phyla, Ochrophyta, displayed significantly different diversity in the horohaliculum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40966" pm="."><plain>Ochrophyta includes among other groups the diatoms, and since the sampling was conducted well after the spring bloom when diatoms are abundant in the Baltic Proper, the pattern may have been different if seasonal sampling had been conducted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40967" pm="."><plain>Overall, there is considerable noise in the data, and the limited number of samples were collected during a single cruise in the summer, thus more data is obviously needed to derive stronger conclusions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40968" pm="."><plain>However, if pronounced differences in alpha-diversity did exist between salinity regimes, this should have been visible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40969" pm="."><plain>Telesh attributed the lack of an “Artenminimum” for protists to their fast evolutionary rate and hence ability to adapt to brackish conditions (as opposed to macroorganisms; Telesh et al., 2011b), which is also what was suggested for bacteria (Herlemann et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40970" pm="."><plain>However, our recent study showing that many of the bacterioplankton inhabiting the Baltic Sea are brackish specialists adapted to these conditions before the Baltic Sea was formed (Hugerth et al., 2015), and likely migrated from other brackish waters, opens the possibility that the same applies to some of the protist species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40971" pm="."><plain>Future population genomic analysis may be able to reveal such patterns. </plain></SENT>
