</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41848" pm="."><plain>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal tumor type of the central nervous system, with 16,000 new cases per year in the US alone [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41849" pm="."><plain>GBM is highly heterogenic, invasive, and refractory to the current standard of care, which is a combination of surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy, and temozolomide [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41850" pm="."><plain>Despite decades of research, the overall outcome for patients with GBM remains extremely poor, with an average survival of approximately 15 months after diagnosis [1, 3–5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41851" pm="."><plain>To identify new targets for therapy, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium produced a comprehensive somatic landscape of GBM through a set of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses, combining molecular and clinical data for 543 patients [6, 7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41852" pm="."><plain>These analyses have improved our understanding of GBM pathobiology, emphasizing that gliomagenesis is driven by signaling networks with functional redundancy, which allows adaptation in response to therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41853" pm="."><plain>Because novel therapeutic strategies based on these findings have not yet become a reality, it is necessary to investigate additional pathways of gene deregulation in GBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41854" pm="."><plain>Equally important is the study of glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are particularly relevant to tumor initiation and resistance to treatment [8–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41855" pm="."><plain>Unveiling individual genes and pathways that contribute to GSC survival and phenotype maintenance might enable the design of novel therapeutic strategies against GBM. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41856" pm="."><plain>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are master regulators of co- and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including RNA processing (splicing, capping, and polyadenylation), transport, decay, localization, and translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41857" pm="."><plain>They are still a poorly characterized class of regulators, with hundreds of new members only recently identified via novel experimental high-throughput approaches [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41858" pm="."><plain>The most updated human RBP catalog includes 1542 genes [14], which represents ~7.5 % of human coding genes (GENCODE version 19 [15]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41859" pm="."><plain>Mutations and alterations in RBP expression levels, which have been observed in many tumor tissues [16–18], are known to impact large gene sets and to contribute to tumor initiation and growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41860" pm="."><plain>In fact, numerous well-characterized RBPs such as HuR, Musashi1, Sam68, and eIF4E have been implicated in multiple tumor types [19–22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41861" pm="."><plain>In the context of neural tissue, the number of tissue-specific RBPs and alternative splicing isoforms is particularly high compared with other tissues [14, 23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41862" pm="."><plain>Hence, RBPs play key roles in this biological context and their alteration is expected to be a major contributor to gliomagenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41863" pm="."><plain>Some important players include Musashi1 [26–28], HuR [27], hnRNP proteins (H and A2/B1) [29–32], and PTB [29, 33, 34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41864" pm="."><plain>In order to identify novel RBPs potentially implicated in GBM development, we conducted a combination of transcriptomic analyses followed by functional screenings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41865" pm="."><plain>We found 58 genes with oncogenic potential, defined as those with high expression in GBM and GSC samples relative to their normal counterparts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41866" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one of these genes are also associated with a poor prognosis and were further selected for functional analyses. SNRPB, which encodes core components of the spliceosome complex SmB/B’, showed the strongest impact on viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41867" pm="."><plain>We determined that changes in SNRPB expression levels have a large impact on expression and splicing regulation and preferentially affect alternative exons and introns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41868" pm="."><plain>RNA processing, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling are among the biological processes with the highest number of genes affected by SNRPB at expression and splicing levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41869" pm="."><plain>Moreover, several genes in pathways relevant to GBM initiation and development, such as RTK, PI3K, RAS, MAPK, AKT, RB, and p53, as well as a set of additional cancer genes, displayed alterations in their splicing and expression profiles upon SNRPB knockdown. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="41872" pm="."><plain>To identify RBPs potentially involved in GBM development, we examined the expression profiles of all 1542 human catalogued RBP coding genes [14] in two different contexts: GBM samples from TCGA versus normal brain; and GSCs versus normal neural progenitor cells (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41873" pm="."><plain>We obtained raw RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for 170 GBM samples from TCGA database (Additional file 1: Table S1) and compared them with 14 normal brain samples: eight samples from two studies available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), one sample from the Human Body Map, and five samples from TCGA (see ‘Methods’; Additional file 1: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41874" pm="."><plain>This approach allowed the identification of 223 upregulated and 135 downregulated RBPs in tumors compared to normal samples (Fig. 1b top panel; Additional file 1: Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41875" pm="."><plain>Next, we looked at the expression of these differentially expressed RBPs, classifying all samples according to the four molecular GBM subtypes (classical, neural, proneural, and mesenchymal) to identify particular associations (if any). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41876" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that the overall expression profile was very similar among subtypes, with no differentially expressed RBPs showing drastic changes across subtypes (Additional file 2: Figure S1).Fig. 1Experimental design and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression profile in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem cells (GSCs). a Gene expression results from GBM and GSC samples were combined to identify upregulated RBPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41877" pm="."><plain>Those RBPs were evaluated regarding their association with survival decrease, and their functional impact in GBM was assayed by a set of functional assays. b Heatmaps show all differentially expressed RBPs in GBM samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas compared to normal brain samples and in GSC samples compared to a normal neural progenitor cell line. c Venn diagram shows the intersection between gene expression analyses </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41878" pm="."><plain>GSCs constitute a unique subpopulation within the tumor and display features similar to normal stem cells [35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41879" pm="."><plain>Their association with tumor relapse is often linked to their tumor-initiating capacity as well as radio- and chemoresistance [35–38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41880" pm="."><plain>Therefore, identifying regulators that maintain GSC phenotypes and/or contribute to their survival is critical for designing novel therapeutic strategies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41881" pm="."><plain>We examined the microarray dataset of Mao et al. [39] to identify differentially expressed RBPs in GSCs in comparison to normal neural progenitor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41882" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed a total of 275 upregulated and 85 downregulated RBPs in GSCs (Fig. 1b bottom panel; Additional file 1: Table S3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="41883" pm="."><plain>We focused next on the identification of “pro-oncogenic RBPs.” We selected these RBPs because they tend to be more attractive targets in therapeutic contexts [40] and they are easier to handle in screening studies [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41884" pm="."><plain>Results from both transcriptomic studies were merged: 58 genes were determined to be upregulated in both GBM and GSC samples (Fig. 1c), which represents a highly significant overlap (p-value = 0.0006; hypergeometric test). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41885" pm="."><plain>Those 58 genes were selected for further analyses. </plain></SENT>
