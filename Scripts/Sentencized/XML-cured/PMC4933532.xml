</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42898" pm="."><plain>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world and the fourth leading cause of cancer death.1 In France, 42,000 patients are newly diagnosed with CRC each year.2 Metastasis often occurs in patients with CRC, and the liver is the most frequent site: 10%–25% of patients have hepatic metastases at diagnosis, and 20% of patients initially diagnosed with a localized CRC will subsequently develop liver lesions.3–5 For metastatic or unresectable CRC, standard first- and second-line treatments involve a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapies (eg, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan)6,7 and molecular targeted agents (eg, bevacizumab, aflibercept, cetuximab, and panitumumab),8–11 which can help to improve survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42899" pm="."><plain>These combinations have improved the progression-free survival and overall survival (OS), with a steady increase in median survival in the last two decades reaching to approximately 30 months in more recent trials.12,13 However, many patients see their disease progress after the guideline-recommended standard regimens, while maintaining a good performance status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42900" pm="."><plain>Regorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, which targets angiogenic, stromal, and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases, is approved for the treatment of these metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, and an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy in KRAS wild-type patients.14 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="42901" pm="."><plain>The CORRECT randomized clinical trial, a multinational, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, improved the median OS in the regorafenib group, 6.4 months, versus 5.0 months (HR, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64–0.94, one-sided P = 0.0052).15 This impact of regorafenib for OS improvement was also demonstrated in a second multinational multicenter randomized phase 3 trial, named CONCUR, conducted in 204 Asian patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42902" pm="."><plain>A significant prolonged OS value was observed with regorafenib treatment, in comparison to the placebo (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.77, one-sided P &lt; 0.001), with a median OS of 8.8 months in the regorafenib-treated group versus 6.3 months in the placebo group.16 However, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54% of the patients assigned to regorafenib treatment in the CONCUR and CORRECT trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42903" pm="."><plain>It is important to assess the potential clinical benefit of regorafenib while taking into consideration the clinical impact of its toxicities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42904" pm="."><plain>Particularly, the impact of such toxicities on the hospitalization rate should be reported in order to provide more evidence that regorafenib is a treatment option compatible with home maintenance of these patients with advanced disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42905" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide real-life information on regorafenib efficacy, safety, and cost in a cohort of mCRC patients treated within the regional institute of Franche-Comté. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="42986" pm="."><plain>Regorafenib offers a new potential line of therapy for patients with mCRC that progresses after all approved standard therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42987" pm="."><plain>However, use of regorafenib requires careful monitoring, for the management of schedule dosing and toxicities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42988" pm="."><plain>This study investigated treatment efficacy, safety, and cost of regorafenib in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42989" pm="."><plain>Our patients had been heavily pretreated and had failed to standard therapies containing 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42990" pm="."><plain>They received either anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42991" pm="."><plain>However, a portion of these patients still maintained good performance status and had few additional treatment options. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42992" pm="."><plain>In this setting, regorafenib is a standard-care option for treatment-refractory mCRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42993" pm="."><plain>However, clinical benefit appears modest, with median OS increased by six weeks compared to placebo (CORRECT, CONCUR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42994" pm="."><plain>Therefore, though regorafenib has shown a statistically significant clinical benefit, the safety, cost, and effectiveness need to be evaluated in clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42995" pm="."><plain>In our study, the median OS was six months, in concordance with CORRECT trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42996" pm="."><plain>In CONCUR trial (Asian population), the median OS was higher (8.8 months), possibly due to a better OS in the subgroup of patients (40%) who did not receive prior anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR target therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42997" pm="."><plain>In fact, OS was higher (median OS 9.7 months) in patients who did not receive any prior targeted therapy than in patients who received at least one prior targeted drug (median OS 7.4 months). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42998" pm="."><plain>Progression-free survival was not assessed in our study because, in clinical practice, we identified an important heterogeneity in the timing of radiologic assessment, leading to potential bias. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="42999" pm="."><plain>No objective response was observed in our cohort, in concordance with the pivotal CORRECT trial (1%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43000" pm="."><plain>The best response was stable disease and concerned a limited number of patients (26%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43001" pm="."><plain>The apparent lower disease control rate compared to phase 3 trials might be explained by the fact that patients were heavily pretreated, and radiological assessment was usually performed ≥2 months from treatment initiation, compared to 6 weeks in CORRECT and CONCUR trials. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43002" pm="."><plain>The safety profile of regorafenib is consistent with an important occurrence of adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43003" pm="."><plain>In the CORRECT and CONCUR trial, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 54% of patients assigned to the regorafenib group and the dose was reduced in 38% of patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43004" pm="."><plain>In these pivotal trials, the most frequent adverse events of grade 3 or higher related to regorafenib were hand–foot skin reaction (12%–32%), fatigue (3%–11%), diarrhea (1%–8%), and hypertension (7%–12%; Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43005" pm="."><plain>In our study, we reported 50% fewer grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events (24%) than in the phase 3 trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43006" pm="."><plain>Even though this could be secondary to our clinical practice with two-thirds of the patients starting at lower than 160 mg/day dose and only 31% needs dose reduction compared to about 70% in the CORRECT and CONCUR trials, we cannot exclude missing toxicity data, and no dose recommendation can be drawn from this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43007" pm="."><plain>However, the starting dose is relevant and is currently being studied in the phase II Regorafenib Dose Optimization Study (ReDOS, NCT02368886) in the United States. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43008" pm="."><plain>Since most severe toxicities occur early after regorafenib exposure, close monitoring should be required from the beginning of the treatment to adapt regorafenib dose and manage most common and severe adverse events.18,19 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43009" pm="."><plain>Our study has several limitations related to its retrospective nature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43010" pm="."><plain>Quality of life related to health evaluation was not available, and toxicity data recovery may not be exhaustive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43011" pm="."><plain>At the moment, a prospective observational cohort study (CORRELATE) is being conducted in routine clinical practice settings to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of regorafenib in patients with mCRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43012" pm="."><plain>Another aim of the CORRELATE study is to depict health-care resources and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), associated with the management of adverse events due to regorafenib in the real-world setting.20 The results of our analysis suggest that regorafenib monotherapy in our clinical practice presented similar efficacy and safety to those reported in the prospective CORRECT study and retrospective trials (Table 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43013" pm="."><plain>The hospitalization rate induced by regorafenib prescription has not been reported so far. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43014" pm="."><plain>The 10% of hospitalizations required to manage severe adverse events is to be taken into account, and supportive care to carefully monitor patients’ tolerance might be considered. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43015" pm="."><plain>In our study, the price of the drug itself accounts for most of the cost estimate of regorafenib outpatient management (93%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43016" pm="."><plain>Other health-care costs for management of patients treated by regorafenib, such as medical transportation, blood tests, medical examinations, or adverse event management, are small (7%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43017" pm="."><plain>Health-care costs have been dramatically increased by the number of new targets for cancer therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43018" pm="."><plain>Standard combination of chemotherapies in mCRC is associated with good clinical effectiveness at a favorable cost.21 We performed a descriptive cost analysis, but a full economic evaluation with cost-effectiveness analysis and cost–utility analysis is required. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43019" pm="."><plain>Economic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43020" pm="."><plain>Recently, Goldstein et al.22 developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib compared with placebo in third-line treatment of mCRC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43021" pm="."><plain>The use of regorafenib provides, in the USA, an additional 0.04 QALYs (or 0.13 life years) at a cost of $40,000 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) &gt;$550,000 per QALY. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43022" pm="."><plain>They concluded that regorafenib provides minimal incremental benefit at high incremental cost per QALY, and the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib could be improved by reduced pricing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43023" pm="."><plain>In comparison, the treatment with bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab is not mainly considered to be cost-effective, with an ICER &gt;$100,000.21,23,24 These data provide a reference point of value of regimens for mCRC, but the comparison of cost data remains difficult because of the different health systems and variations among countries (geographic transferability of economic evaluation).25 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43024" pm="."><plain>However, given that regorafenib is associated with significant adverse events with a modest incremental benefit at significant cost, the value of this treatment remains debatable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43025" pm="."><plain>Hence, regorafenib should be prescribed with caution and patients should be carefully selected by physicians before starting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43026" pm="."><plain>About one-fourth of patients seem to obtain clinical benefit from regorafenib treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43027" pm="."><plain>New strategies are needed in patient selection for regorafenib treatment in heavily pretreated mCRC patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43028" pm="."><plain>Maybe the identification of predictive biomarkers can help to better tailor this therapy to the targeted population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43029" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, recent data reported on the analysis of circulating DNA and protein biomarkers did not identify any prognostic or predictive biomarkers that can be used in current clinical practice to predict the clinical activity of regorafenib.26 </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43031" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of regorafenib in heavily pretreated mCRC patients was comparable in our study to the pivotal CORRECT trial and retrospective trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43032" pm="."><plain>Toxic effects were mostly manageable in an outpatient setting, even though 10% of patients required hospitalization to manage serious adverse events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43033" pm="."><plain>Given that regorafenib is an outpatient treatment and the drug itself represents the most important (93%) part of supported cost, a decrease in the drug’s price could improve the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib. </plain></SENT>
