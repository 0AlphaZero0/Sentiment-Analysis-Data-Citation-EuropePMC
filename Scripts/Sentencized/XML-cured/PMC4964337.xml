However, the factors that generate the TP snow cover (TPSC) anomalies at the intraseasonal time-scale are unclear. This report reveals the influence of the Madden‒Julian oscillation (MJO), which is the most dominant component of the tropical intraseasonal variability, on TPSC. We focus on wintertime snow cover over the central and eastern TP, where the intraseasonal variability is large. TPSC increases/decreases in the MJO phases 8‒1/4–5, when the eastward-propagating MJO suppressed/enhanced convection locates over the Maritime Continent. Such a change in TPSC leads to the most dominant positive/negative anomalies of TPSC in the following phases 2‒3/6‒7 due to the non-significant change of TPSC in these phases. There is anomalous moisture advection over the upstream of the TP caused by MJO-excited large-scale atmospheric circulation. The advection process generates the low-frequency eastward-propagating anomalous water vapour from upstream to the TP that influences precipitation and, eventually, TPSC. </p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p><text><SENT sid="43421" pm="."><plain>Snow cover is a crucial component in the cryosphere.

To make the results more concise, we categorized the eight MJO phases into four groups (i.e., Phase 8–1, Phase 2–3, Phase 4–5 and Phase 6–7) following Ref. 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43443" pm="."><plain>The eastward propagating convection is one of the most basic features of the MJO22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43444" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe convection by using precipitation data. Wintertime (Nov.‒Mar.) composites of the 20–100-day filtered daily anomalous precipitation for the four categorized phases of the MJO (shading in Fig. 1) depict the eastward-propagating MJO convection. Positive/negative precipitation anomalies correspond to enhanced/suppressed convective activity. The composite in phase 2‒3 shows a dipole structure of convection anomalies (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43448" pm="."><plain>Enhanced convection is located in the eastern Indian Ocean, whereas reduced convection is located in the western Pacific.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43456" pm="."><plain>This study spans 16 extended winters (from Nov. 1, 1998 to Mar. 31, 2014) and is focused on the intraseasonal variability of the daily TPSC. Each winter comprises 151 days from Nov. 1 to Mar. 31 of the next year. Most areas of the central and eastern TP are covered by snow for approximately 10–30% of wintertime (Supplementary Fig. S1a), which is much less than that of the western TP, where snow covers the ground for more than 80% of the time. The central and eastern parts of the TP have the largest intraseasonal (20–100-day) variabilities (Supplementary Fig. S1b), whereas the variability is much smaller in the western TP. Therefore, the TP in this study is defined as the area with an altitude greater than 3,000 meters and within 27–40°N and 80–105°E covering the central and eastern parts of the TP, where the main modulation of the MJO on TPSC occurs. <p><text><SENT sid="43467" pm="."><plain>To represent the TPSC regional variability, a TPSC index (TPSCI) is defined (see the Methods section for more details), which represents the number of snow-covered grid points over the TP in the analysis. Composites of the TPSCI for the categorized MJO phases are obtained by using the RMM index to examine the relationship between the MJO and the TPSC regional variability (Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43469" pm="."><plain>The index shows a clear variation associated with the MJO. There is a positive composite of the TPSCI in phase 2–3 that is significant at the 99% confidence level. In contrast, in phase 6–7, there is a negative composite of the TPSCI that is significant at the 99% confidence level. There is a dramatic switch from phase 2–3 to phase 6‒7, and the signatures of MJO convection are out of phase, as revealed in Fig. 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43473" pm="."><plain>However, the composited anomalies are not significant in phases 8–1 and 4–5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43474" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the composites of the standardized anomalies of the TPSCI in phase 2–3 is 0.23, whereas in phase 6–7, it is ‒0.14, which represents approximately 20% of its standardized variability on the intraseasonal time-scale. We also show the spatial distribution of the composites for each grid point over the TP (Fig. 3a‒d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43476" pm="."><plain>In phase 2‒3 (Fig. 3b), significant positive anomalies are found in 46% of the grid points over the TP, which corresponds to increased snow-covered probability. In phase 4‒5 (Fig. 3c), negative anomalies occur over the central TP, but positive anomalies are found over some area of the eastern TP. In phase 6‒7 (Fig. 3d), negative anomalies are found over 37% of the grid points, which corresponds to decreased snow-cover probability. In phase 8‒1 (Fig. 3a), the spatial patterns of positive and negative anomalies are quite mixed, with no dominant patterns observed. Both the composites of the TPSCI and the composites for each grid point suggest that the most dominant positive/negative anomalies of the overall TPSC occur in the MJO phases 2‒3/6‒7. <p><text><SENT sid="43481" pm="."><plain>To further investigate the change of snow cover, we analysed the relationship between the daily change of TPSC (ΔTPSC) and the MJO. The daily change of the TPSCI (ΔTPSCI) is the difference between the TPSCI for one day and the TPSCI for the previous day (see the Methods section for more details). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43483" pm="."><plain>A positive/negative ΔTPSCI corresponds to an/a increasing/deceasing TPSCI. Composites of the ΔTPSCI for the categorized MJO phases are examined (Fig. 2b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43485" pm="."><plain>The ΔTPSCI also shows a clear MJO-related variation. There is a positive composite of the ΔTPSCI in phase 8–1 that is significant at the 99% confidence level. In contrast, in phase 4–5, there is a negative composite of the ΔTPSCI that is significant at the 99% confidence level. Namely, the TPSCI significantly increases in phase 8–1 but decreases in phase 4–5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43489" pm="."><plain>However, the composites in phases 2–3 and 6–7 are non-significant. The composites of ΔTPSC for each grid point (similar to the ΔTPSCI, but for each grid point) are also investigated (Fig. 3e‒h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43491" pm="."><plain>In phase 8‒1 (Fig. 3e), a significant and positive anomalous ΔTPSC is found in 39% of the total grid points over the TP, whereas the significant and positive anomalous ΔTPSC is only found in 6% of the grid points. In contrast, negative anomalies are found over most of the anomalous grid points, with significance in phase 4‒5 (Fig. 3g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43493" pm="."><plain>In phases 2‒3 and 6‒7 (Fig. 3f,h), the spatial patterns of positive and negative anomalous ΔTPSC are mixed, without uniform negative or positive anomalies. The spatial distributions of the composites for ΔTPSC are consistent with the composites of the ΔTPSCI. Both the composites of the ΔTPSCI and the composites of ΔTPSC for each grid point suggest that TPSC increases/decreases in the MJO phases 8‒1/4‒5. <p><text><SENT sid="43496" pm="."><plain>The change of TPSC has an inherent relationship with the anomalous TPSC. In phase 8–1, the ΔTPSCI is positive, which means that the TPSCI increases in this phase. When phase 8–1 ends and the following phase 2–3 starts, the TPSCI reaches its peak value. Due to the non-significant anomalous ΔTPSCI in phase 2–3, the TPSCI keeps the positive peak value in this phase. For a similar reason, the negative anomalous ΔTPSCI in phase 4–5 leads to the negative peak value of the TPSCI in the consequent phase 6–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43501" pm="."><plain>The TPSCI lags that of ΔTPSCI by two phases of a MJO cycle (1/4 cycle). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43502" pm="."><plain>A theoretical explain on this relationship can be referred in the Method section. Such a relationship is also generally applicable for the spatial grid points. <p><text><SENT sid="43504" pm="."><plain>The above analysis reveals that TPSC increases/decreases in the MJO phase 8‒1/4–5, when the eastward-propagating MJO suppressed/enhanced convection is located over the Maritime Continent. Such a change of TPSC leads to the positive/negative peak anomalies of TPSC in their following phase 2‒3/6‒7 due to the non-significant change of TPSC in these phases. We also get similar results based on regression method, which can be referred in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S2a–b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43508" pm="."><plain>To further understand this MJO phase and TPSC relationship, in the next section, we discuss the relationship between the MJO and TP precipitation. </sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><text><SENT sid="43509" pm="."><plain>Relationship between the MJO and precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43510" pm="."><plain>Due to the very cold temperature over the wintertime TP, wintertime precipitation occurs mainly in the form of snow. The anomalous precipitation contributes to the anomalies of snow cover where the surface temperature is below the freezing point1144. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43512" pm="."><plain>Therefore, precipitation plays a key role in the variability of the TPSC. Previous studies have found that the influence of the MJO on rainfall is significant almost globally25, including the rainfall variability in East Asia26282930. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43514" pm="."><plain>However, to date, few works have focused on the influence of the MJO on precipitation over the TP. As such, in this study, we examine the MJO’s influence on precipitation over the TP. <p><text><SENT sid="43516" pm="."><plain>We first calculated the TP Precipitation Index (TPPI) by averaging the precipitation at each grid point over the TP. Composites were then calculated for the 20‒100-day filtered anomalous TPPI (Fig. 2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43518" pm="."><plain>We found that there are significant influences of the MJO on precipitation over the TP. There is more precipitation in phase 8‒1 but less precipitation in phase 4‒5, and these composites are significant at the 99% confidence level. However, the anomalous TPPI is non-significant in phases 2–3 and 6–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43521" pm="."><plain>We also get consistent results based on regression method, which can be referred in the supplementary (Fig. S2c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43523" pm="."><plain>The spatial distributions of composites of precipitation show similar results (Fig. 3i‒l). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43524" pm="."><plain>Positive anomalies are found over most anomalous grid points with significance in phase 8‒1 (Fig. 3i), and the significant negative anomalies occur in phase 4‒5 (Fig. 3k). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43525" pm="."><plain>In other phases, the spatial patterns of precipitation show fewer anomalies (Fig. 3j,l). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43526" pm="."><plain>The spatial distributions of the composites for precipitation are consistent with the composites of the TPPI. Both the composites of the TPPI and the composites for precipitation over each grid point suggest that the precipitation over the TP increases/decreases significantly in the MJO phases 8‒1/4‒5. <p><text><SENT sid="43528" pm="."><plain>It is not a surprise that the relationship between the TPPI and the MJO is the same as that between the ΔTPSCI and the MJO (Fig. 2b‒c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43529" pm="."><plain>The greater amount of precipitation that occurs in phase 8–1 is in favour of the increase of TPSC. Therefore, the ΔTPSCI is also significantly positive. Conversely, the lower levels of precipitation in phase 4‒5 lead to the negative ΔTPSCI in phase 4‒5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43532" pm="."><plain>The non-significant anomalous TPPI in phases 2–3 and 6–7 corresponds to the non-significant anomalous ΔTPSCI in these phases. The composites for each grid over the TP show similar results. The increased precipitation over most grid points in phase 8‒1 (Fig. 3i) is generally consistent with the most positive anomalous ΔTPSC (Fig. 3e), except for some grid points over the eastern part of the Himalayas (near 30°N, 95°E), where the climatology of wintertime snow is different from that of the surrounding areas (Fig. S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43536" pm="."><plain>In phase 2–3, both composites of ΔTPSC and precipitation over the grid points (Fig. 3f,j) feature a dipole pattern with opposite signs of anomalies over the central and eastern TP. However, the number of grid points with significant anomalies is less than that observed in phases 8–1 and 6–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43538" pm="."><plain>The negative anomalies show eastwards propagation. In the following phase 4‒5, both composites of ΔTPSC and precipitation over the grid points show coincident negative anomalies (Fig. 3g,k). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43540" pm="."><plain>In phase 6‒7, the spatial patterns of both ΔTPSC and precipitation are quite mixed (Fig. 3h,l), and the number of grid points with significant anomalies is relatively low. </sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><text><SENT sid="43541" pm="."><plain>Mechanism </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43542" pm="."><plain>To investigate the mechanism for the above modulation by the MJO, we examine the evolution of the large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with the MJO and their link to snow cover and precipitation over the TP. It is well known that tropical diabatic heating associated with the MJO excites subtropical planetary waves via barotropic vorticity perturbations which then propagate poleward404148495051. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43544" pm="."><plain>Gill48 described the large-scale circulation that forms in response to prescribed localized steady heating associated with deep tropical convection. He used a linear damped shallow-water equation model on an equatorial plane that provided elegant analytical solutions for some particular heating distributions. In the Gill’s model, the feature of the tropical atmospheric response to the MJO diabatic heating is a pair of anomalous cyclones symmetric about the equator to the west of the heating. The cyclones are associated with an equatorial Rossby wave structure. The response can be found in real atmospheric circulation through composites to certain MJO phases according to our study. The eastward propagation of the anomalous convection pattern is associated with modifications of low-level atmospheric circulation (vectors in Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43550" pm="."><plain>When the major enhanced convection (corresponding to upward vertical motion) of the MJO moves into the eastern Indian Ocean (Phase 2–3, Fig. 1b), the diabatic heating of convection excites the classic Matsuno–Gill pattern4852. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43551" pm="."><plain>The tropical atmospheric response to the MJO diabatic heating is characterized by a pair of low-level cyclones symmetric about the equator to the west of the diabatic heating region.

<SENT sid="43554" pm="."><plain>The cyclone moves eastwards, following the eastward progression of the MJO convection. Due to the huge blocking effect of the TP, the features of a cyclone are not well developed in phase 4–5 (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43556" pm="."><plain>However, when the suppressed MJO convection (corresponding to downward vertical motion) moves from the western Indian Ocean to the Marine Continent (Phase 6–7 and 8–1, Fig. 1d,a), the anomalies are almost opposite to the anomalies induced by the enhanced MJO convection. There is an anticyclone moving eastwards (marked by “A” in Fig. 1d,a), following the movement of the suppressed MJO convection. <p><text><SENT sid="43558" pm="."><plain>The wave perturbations related to the Matsuno–Gill-type pattern that induced by the MJO are able to influence northern hemispheric weather patterns2427283035. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43561" pm="."><plain>Note that there are southerly/northerly winds in the western part of the anticyclone/cyclone. The southerly anomalies are located over the Arabian Peninsula in phase 6−7 and move eastwards in the following phase 8−1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43563" pm="."><plain>In phase 8−1, the Arabian Sea, Arabian Peninsula and Iranian Plateau are controlled by the southerly wind anomalies.

<SENT sid="43565" pm="."><plain>In phase 4‒5, the Arabian Sea, Arabian Peninsula and Iranian Plateau are controlled by these northerly wind anomalies. The southerly wind anomalies over the Arabian Sea may bring water vapour from the sea to the land and increase the moisture over the area upstream of the TP, whereas the northerly wind anomalies from the land to the sea reduce the moisture. To prove this hypothesis, we analysed the vertical integral of water vapour and its flux related to the activity of the MJO (Fig. S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43569" pm="."><plain>Because most moisture in the atmosphere exists in the low-level region, the vertical integral of water vapour flux shows a similar pattern to that of the horizontal wind at 700 hPa (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43570" pm="."><plain>There is a southerly anomalous water vapour flux over the Arabian Sea, Arabian Peninsula and Iranian Plateau in phase 8‒1 (Fig. S3a), which is consistent with the low-level southerly wind anomalies over this area (Fig. 1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43572" pm="."><plain>The water vapour flux influences the amount of vapour in atmosphere.

Precipitation over these areas is then influenced. Our study is consisting with their work. And we further found that the anomalous water vapour propagates eastwards and reaches the TP due to an advection process. In the wintertime, low-level westerly winds occur over the area upstream of the TP. The low-level westerly winds that climb up the TP bring water vapour from the west of the TP to the central and eastern TP, thereby forming a moisture channel. The anomalous water vapour occurs over the area upstream of the TP (Iranian Plateau) and influences the moisture over the TP through the advection caused by the background of westerly winds.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43619" pm="."><plain>This report presents the influence of the MJO on TPSC. We focus on wintertime snow cover over the central and eastern parts of the TP at an altitude greater than 3,000 meters, where the intraseasonal variability is large. The TPSC increases/decreases in the MJO phases 8‒1/4–5, when the eastward-propagating MJO suppressed/enhanced convection is located over the Maritime Continent. Such a change of TPSC leads to the most dominant positive/negative anomalies of TPSC in the following phases 2‒3/6‒7 due to the non-significant change of TPSC in these phases. <p><text><SENT sid="43623" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the modulation of the MJO on precipitation over the TP, which contributes to the change of TPSC. The diabatic heating of MJO-suppressed/enhanced convection excites the classic Matsuno–Gill pattern, which features an anticyclone/cyclone in the northwest of the diabatic-cooling/heating region. The southerly/northerly wind anomalies associated with the anticyclone/cyclone over the Arabian Sea increase/decrease the moisture over the area upstream of the TP. The anomalous water vapour propagates eastwards and reaches the TP due to an advection process, thus causing positive/negative anomalies of water vapour over the TP. The precipitation over the TP is subsequently influenced, and TPSC is eventually affected. The mechanism of this modulation is summarized in Figure S7. <p><text><SENT sid="43629" pm="."><plain>This report provides a first look at the influence of the MJO on TPSC and suggests a possible mechanism for the modulation of the MJO on TPSC. However, further work is needed, including numerical experiments. Because TPSC significantly affects albedo, it may play an important role in linking the MJO and the meteorological and hydrologic elements over the TP, such as the surface energy budgets. More related work in the future is necessary for a better understanding of the MJO modulation on weather and climate in the TP. Although the MJO is the most dominant component of the tropical intraseasonal variability, the intraseasonal variability of weather can also be influenced by other potential factors. For example, the oscillation with higher frequency (10–30-day)1954 and subtropical jet18 may be related the variability of Tibetan Plateau snow cover. More detail work on this topic will be in our future study. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec disp-level="1"><title><text><SENT sid="43636" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>

Because TPSC has multiple time-scale variability9, including interannual to decadal variability, a bandpass filter that isolates the 20–100-day components is applied for all of the variables discussed in this studies, except for climatology in Supplementary Figure S1a. For the snow cover of each grid point (Fig. 3), we also applied the bandpass filter to single out the intraseasonal component. When one grid point is covered by snow, we used a value of 100% to represent the probability of being snow-covered, whereas 0% indicates the non-snow covered points.
