</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="43946" pm="."><plain>Carbohydrates exist in many forms in nature, from the O- and N-linked glycans of proteins to the cell walls of plants, fungi and bacteria as well as storage polymers such as starch and glycogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43947" pm="."><plain>Enzymes active towards these carbohydrates must have the means to identify and act on their particular substrate within an often complex milieu. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43948" pm="."><plain>A common strategy for accomplishing this recognition is to utilize binding regions outside of the active site that are less constrained as they need not bind the substrate in an optimal mode for catalysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43949" pm="."><plain>These non-catalytic binding sites can operate in conjunction with the active site in catalysis, or may simply serve to localize the enzymes to the substrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43950" pm="."><plain>Such external sites interacting with carbohydrates exist on a continuum from independent domains, termed carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) [1], to regions or spots termed surface binding sites (SBSs) situated on the catalytic domain at a certain distance from the active site [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43951" pm="."><plain>Enzymes can contain multiple CBMs, multiple SBSs or combinations of both and these carbohydrate binding sites can perform diverse functions related to enzyme activity [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43952" pm="."><plain>The importance of CBMs has long been established, particularly for enzymes acting on insoluble polysaccharides, and they are formally organized into families in the CAZy database [5,6] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/">www.cazy.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43953" pm="."><plain>SBSs, however, are much less studied and also much less frequently occurring, with the majority of the investigated enzymes participating in starch or xylan degradation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43954" pm="."><plain>Thus of the approximately 60 enzymes from 20 CAZy families to date identified to possess one or more SBSs, almost half belong to GH13, the α-amylase family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43955" pm="."><plain>It is likely, however, that since SBSs have commonly been detected only by observation in crystal structures of ligand complexes, they are in fact more widespread among the CAZy families and have to now gone unappreciated. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="43956" pm="."><plain>A variety of methods have been used to study the characteristics of SBSs and CBMs, including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) [7,8], surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [9–11], insoluble polysaccharide pulldown (IPP) [9,10,12], affinity electrophoresis (AE) [9,13], confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) [9,14] and enzyme activity progress curves [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43957" pm="."><plain>This set of assays enables measurement of binding properties of known sites, AE and CLSM having been applied to qualitatively demonstrate binding; although AE can also be used to quantify the affinity [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43958" pm="."><plain>Mutational analysis has been used to confirm the presence and location of the binding site and disclose its impact on enzyme activity [10,16–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43959" pm="."><plain>Many sequences suspected to perform binding functions within carbohydrate active enzymes remain uncharacterized and there are probably many more that are unsuspected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43960" pm="."><plain>Importantly, just as IPP, AE and SPR are useful to describe the known binding sites, in this work we show these techniques are suitable for revealing the presence of and to further characterize hitherto unknown SBSs as well as CBMs, even in the absence of a solved crystal structure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="43964" pm="."><plain>The identification, properties and origins of the enzymes, which either stemmed from our research group, were donated by other researchers or were commercially available are listed in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="43965" pm="."><plain>GH5-1 [20], GH13-1 [21], GH13-2 [22], GH15-1/GH15-2 [23], GH36-1 [24], GH62-1 [18], GH65-1 [25] and GH94-1/GH94-2 [26] were produced in-house as previously described. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44442" pm="."><plain>In this study we have started out with a reasonably large collection of 35 enzymes and screened these for binding to 18 soluble and 4 insoluble polysaccharides using AE and IPP, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44443" pm="."><plain>These techniques have several advantages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44444" pm="."><plain>First, they can be performed in a relatively high throughput manner, so numerous enzyme-polysaccharide interactions can be examined in a relatively short time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44445" pm="."><plain>Second, they are inexpensive, not requiring specialized equipment and also using generally inexpensive polysaccharides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44446" pm="."><plain>Finally, they look for interactions with polysaccharides, which in many cases are the relevant substrate for the enzyme under study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44447" pm="."><plain>An important consideration, however, is discriminating between binding at the active site and a potential SBS or previously unrecognized CBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44448" pm="."><plain>Using active enzymes, as was done in this study, may help in this matter as catalysis might limit the contribution of the active site to the observed binding with these techniques. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44449" pm="."><plain>Competition with small molecules known to bind at the active site, may also help identify if binding is taking place elsewhere, however, caution is needed as these may also bind at a potential SBS or CBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44450" pm="."><plain>Comparison with other related enzymes known to contain an SBS may also provide important clues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44451" pm="."><plain>Ultimately however, these methods are used to generate the hypothesis that an SBS is present, which then must be tested by other means. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44452" pm="."><plain>In this study we have taken that next step examining a group of six enzymes by SPR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44453" pm="."><plain>The main drawback of SPR is that oligosaccharides must be used, which depending on the enzyme, may be quite expensive or unavailable, making it more appropriate for targeted studies, rather than screening. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44454" pm="."><plain>However, SPR has several advantages in the identification of SBSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44455" pm="."><plain>It uses relatively little protein and can examine a wide range of binding affinities compared to an alternative technique such as ITC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44456" pm="."><plain>It is also able to be used with active enzymes as it measures equilibrium binding with a constant flow of ligand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44457" pm="."><plain>Its most useful attribute, however, is that binding stoichiometry can be detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44458" pm="."><plain>This provides direct evidence of binding taking place outside of the active site, a critical consideration as will be discussed below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title><text><SENT sid="44459" pm="."><plain>Positive Controls </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44460" pm="."><plain>Among the tested enzymes, three from GH13: GH13-1 [17,30,31], GH13-5 (PDB ID: 2E9B, unpublished) and GH13-6 [32,33] presented one or more SBSs in crystal structures and serve as positive controls for the purposes of this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44461" pm="."><plain>The properties of the two SBSs in GH13-1, barley α-amylase 1 (AMY1), have been extensively studied by using IPP [9,10], AE [9] and SPR assays [9,10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44462" pm="."><plain>However, exploitation of these techniques to detect SBSs in the absence of structural data has not been reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44463" pm="."><plain>In the previous studies of GH13-5 and GH13-6, the SBSs were not analyzed in depth, but SBSs studied by mutational analysis in human salivary α-amylase having a high degree of identity with porcine pancreatic α-amylase (GH13-6) [45–48], were found to be important for binding to and activity against starch [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44464" pm="."><plain>SPR analysis indicates GH13-5 and 13-6 have multiple binding sites for β-cyclodextrin (Table 4), possibly representing the active site where both crystal structures show bound α-cyclodextrin [49], PDB ID: 2E8Z (unpublished), and one, perhaps more, SBSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44465" pm="."><plain>Noticeably, the affinity at these multiple sites are not distinguished from one another, suggesting that they have similar Kd values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44466" pm="."><plain>This has been seen for other SBS containing enzymes, e.g. Bacillus subtilis [7] and B. circulans xylanases [50] and barley AMY1 (GH13-1) [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44467" pm="."><plain>In xylanases, concurrence of active site and SBS binding affinity has been measured by NMR, SPR and ITC, using mutational analysis and active site inhibitors, indicating that the phenomenon was not an artefact of any particular technique. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44468" pm="."><plain>It may be that the affinity at SBSs and their cognate active sites have evolved in tandem to efficiently act together in substrate binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44469" pm="."><plain>As expected AMY1 binds to pullulan, amylopectin and glycogen in AE (its binding to amylose is just outside the cutoff chosen to define binding) and to starch granules by IPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44470" pm="."><plain>Neither GH13-5 that possesses a CBM48 nor GH13-6 binds to starch granules, but GH13-6 interacts with all α-1,4 linked glucan substrates and several other polysaccharides in AE (GH13-5 was not tested as it did not produce easily distinguishable bands). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44471" pm="."><plain>Binding of GH13-6 to non-substrates may result from the surface exposed nature of SBSs making them less selective in their interactions than active sites, which tend to bury a greater proportion of the substrates in a groove or tunnel in the protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44472" pm="."><plain>The GH15-1 containing CBM20 interacts with all of the starch-like compounds in AE and additionally with galactan, whereas the version lacking CBM20 (GH15-2) does not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44473" pm="."><plain>Thus binding to non-substrate polysaccharides may be a particular characteristic of SBSs as well as CBMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44474" pm="."><plain>While this phenomenon has not been studied before in SBS containing enzymes, it has been noted for CBMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44475" pm="."><plain>Recently Hernandez-Gomez et al. [51] examined the ability of crystalline cellulose specific CBMs to bind xyloglucan, a more soluble polymer thought to apply an entirely different mode of binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44476" pm="."><plain>They found that binding was weaker to xyloglucan than to crystalline cellulose, but still occurred on the same binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44477" pm="."><plain>In another study, Strobel et al. [52] demonstrated that the cellulose binding face of a CBM1 was also binding to lignin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44478" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they attempted to increase the specificity for cellulose using a mutational approach, but as most mutants had reduced affinity for both cellulose and lignin, perhaps substantial overlap occurred among the binding sites for both ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44479" pm="."><plain>In complex polysaccharide environments it can be advantageous for CBMs to attach onto other polysaccharides that are present in addition to the substrate of their appended enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44480" pm="."><plain>Mannanases are found with cellulose specific CBMs [53], thus targeting the far more abundant cellulose in the plant cell wall, while the active site maintains exquisite selectivity [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44481" pm="."><plain>There may be evolutionary reasons for CBMs and SBSs to have lower specificity, which may go hand in hand with the highly exposed nature of these binding sites unavoidably resulting in this reduced specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44482" pm="."><plain>In the CBM2 family there are both cellulose and xylan recognizing members, however it is possible to interconvert the specificity by mutation of a single residue [54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44483" pm="."><plain>This propensity for binding to non-substrate polysaccharides could prove useful in identifying enzymes possessing previously unrecognized CBMs or SBSs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44485" pm="."><plain>In complement to the positive controls analyzed, several proteins that have been extensively structurally characterized without detection of an SBS were included to serve as negative controls. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44486" pm="."><plain>The barley limit dextrinase (GH13-2) has been co-crystallized with several different ligands, recently including its natural substrate, an α-limit dextrin [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44487" pm="."><plain>The only structure, however, which has shown binding outside of the active site was soaked with 400 mM maltotetraose. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44490" pm="."><plain>Similarly, crystal structures of barley β-amylase (GH14-1) in complex with different oligosaccharides did not reveal the presence of an SBS [34,35], moreover it does not bind any of the polysaccharides in AE and only to OSX by IPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44491" pm="."><plain>This enzyme does not exhibit binding to its substrate, starch, and since this is binding to a single polysaccharide, which is not biologically relevant, we conclude that this is most likely irrelevant non-specific binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44492" pm="."><plain>In addition, a β-mannanase (GH26-1) has crystal structures solved in complex with several oligosaccharides without showing an SBS and does not bind to any polysaccharides in the screening experiments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44493" pm="."><plain>GH48-1, a processive endoglucanase from Clostridium cellulolyticum, is a cellulosomal enzyme and hence part of a multi-enzyme assembly where it can take advantage of binding sites on other enzymes in the scaffoldin-enzyme complex [55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44494" pm="."><plain>Although crystal structures did not reveal any additional binding sites, this enzyme indeed is retarded by several polysaccharides in AE, including the non-substrates RHG and WAX; as expected GH48-1 binds to cellulose in IPP (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44495" pm="."><plain>Further investigation shows that cellobiose, a potential inhibitor of binding, does not significantly suppress the interaction of GH48-1 with BBG in AE or in IPP with avicel. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44496" pm="."><plain>Cellopentaose, however, virtually eliminates GH48-1’s binding to avicel in IPP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44497" pm="."><plain>Follow up by SPR reveals just one binding site for cellopentaose, which almost certainly is the active site as crystal structures show cellotetraose and cellohexaose accommodated in the active site [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44498" pm="."><plain>Thus all GH48-1 interactions with cellulosic substrates seem mediated through the active site, while the possibility remains that binding to non-substrate polysaccharides takes place at an alternate location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44499" pm="."><plain>This illustrates the point that while AE and IPP are very good for detecting the presence of binding sites, further experiments where the active site is blocked and/or the number of binding sites can be assessed are needed to rule out false positives of SBSs due to active site binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44500" pm="."><plain>There are a few reports on xylanases where the active site was blocked by covalent reaction with a mechanism-based inhibitor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44501" pm="."><plain>Thus B. circulans xylanase treated with 2′,4′-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-xylobioside ensured independent analysis of SBS binding in AE, while distinct active site data were achieved by mutation of the SBS [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44502" pm="."><plain>Similarly, Cuyvers et al. [7] reacted the B. subtilis xylanase with the mechanism-based inhibitor 2,3-epoxypropyl β-D-xylopyranoside to investigate the SBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44503" pm="."><plain>Such inhibitors are absolutely useful tools in the study of non-catalytic site binding, but they are far from available for enzymes in general. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44553" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that these techniques are useful in detecting novel enzyme binding sites, also in the absence of a solved structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44554" pm="."><plain>Assessment of additional binding sites is not routine in characterization of new enzymes, however, thanks to these relatively simple tools, the presence of potential SBSs can be recognized fairly quickly. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44556" pm="."><plain>Localizing the binding site to particular residues is more challenging, however, besides structural techniques, chemical modification in the presence and absence ligands, coupled to proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis offers an alternative path. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44557" pm="."><plain>Indeed such differential labelling was used to identify an SBSs in barley α-amylase AMY2 [73]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="44558" pm="."><plain>SBSs appear to be fairly widespread in nature, but still relatively few studies examined their properties and importance to enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44559" pm="."><plain>Binding site screening techniques such as presented here can greatly expand knowledge about these important sites if employed more routinely in enzyme characterization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44560" pm="."><plain>Additionally, while CBMs are easier to predict than SBSs based on sequences, there are still new CBM families to be discovered and characterized and these same techniques are equally suited for detecting binding by CBMs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44561" pm="."><plain>However, interaction at the active site must always be kept in mind, although cases of binding to non-substrates or to insoluble substrates may indicate non-active site binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44562" pm="."><plain>Measuring the impact of non-substrate polysaccharides on enzyme activity against natural substrates provides one way of determining binding location. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44563" pm="."><plain>Follow up with a technique such as SPR that can determine the number of binding sites is an important verification step. </plain></SENT>
