</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44672" pm="."><plain>The degradation of polysaccharides such as cellulose, chitin, starch and glycogen is an essential feature of carbon cycle in the biosphere, a process that requires the contribution of various microorganisms that together deploy an arsenal of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. Plant cell walls (PCWs) are composed of a composite network of macromolecules, including polysaccharides and lignin. The major polysaccharide in most plant cell walls is cellulose, which is composed of β-1,4 linked glucose polymers that interconnect through strong hydrogen bonds, forming crystalline microfibrils that are very stable. Cellulose is further embedded in a 3 D matrix composed of hemicelluloses, pectin and lignin [14] resistant to degradation. Compared to cellulose, hemicelluloses are heteropolymers that are variable in both chemical composition and structure, with heteroxylans and mannans being the two major categories of hemicelluloses in PCWs [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44677" pm="."><plain>The exact compositional and structural features of hemicelluloses are dependent on a number of determinants, including the botanical origin of the plant, and also the pedoclimatic conditions prevailing at the time of growth [13, 14, 62]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44678" pm="."><plain>Therefore, microorganisms that are responsible for biomass degradation are faced with a formidable task, which they achieve through the deployment of complex arsenals of enzymes [62]. <p><text><SENT sid="44679" pm="."><plain>Among the key PCW-degrading enzymes that are produced by microorganisms, the glycoside hydrolases (GH) and the carbohydrate esterases (CE) belong to a wide class of enzymes that modify, synthesize or hydrolyze carbohydrates: Carbohydrate Active enZymes, or CAZymes (ref CAZy). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44680" pm="."><plain>The CAZymes are prominent and highly diverse and have been identified in all taxa, representing typically 1–5 % of the predicted coding sequences in their genomes [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44681" pm="."><plain>These proteins are expressed by microorganisms inhabiting almost all ecological niches (e.g., soil, marine environment and digestive tracts), where they participate in carbon cycling. The strategies of carbohydrate-degradation are often different at both the level of the microbial community and of individual microorganisms [30]. <p><text><SENT sid="44683" pm="."><plain>GH and CE can be encoded by multigenic operon-like clusters [45], such as Sus system [15, 51], that have been designated as Polysaccharide Utilization Loci in Bacteroidetes species [41, 44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44684" pm="."><plain>Evidence so far reveals that the proteins produced by such clusters display functional interplay with CAZyme components, displaying synergy on complex substrates [1, 48, 53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44685" pm="."><plain>In some anaerobic biomass-degrading bacteria, CAZymes, such as cellulases and hemicellulases, are arranged on cellulosomes, which are extracellular, cell-bound multi-enzyme complexes. In cellulosomes, the enzyme components are brought into close physical proximity, thus optimizing their synergistic actions and enhancing their biomass-degrading ability [3, 20]. <p><text><SENT sid="44687" pm="."><plain>GH and CE, and particularly those that are active on PCWs, are sought after for a wide range of industrial applications, including biorefining. In this field, the enzymes that are of particular interest include those active on cellulose (e.g., endoglucanases, EC 3.2.1.4, exoglucanases, EC 3.2.1.91 and EC 3.2.1.176) and on heteroxylans (e.g., endoxylanases, EC 3.2.1.8, β-D-xylosidases, EC 3.2.1.37 and α-L-arabinofuranosidases, EC; 3.2.1.55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44689" pm="."><plain>Cellulose and hemicellulose yield monomeric sugars readily fermentable to produce alcohols, organic acids, or alkenes. The exploration of glycoside hydrolase (GH) diversity, and to a lesser extent CE can provide efficient biocatalysts and new insight into the different enzyme mechanisms that are used by microorganisms in biomass degradation. GHs have been used in many industries such as in paper production, textiles, detergents, feed and food [4, 33] as well as to promote healthy human nutrition and prevent diseases [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44692" pm="."><plain>In the last decade, cellulases and more recently hemicellulases have been considered for biorefining [23, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44693" pm="."><plain>The discovery of GHs has been considerably accelerated with the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches, which allow the identification of new enzymes in an unprecedented manner. <p><text><SENT sid="44694" pm="."><plain>GH exploration is largely facilitated by the existence of the CAZy database (CAZy; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cazy.org/">www.cazy.org</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44695" pm="."><plain>This database describes the families of enzymes that catalyze the breakdown, biosynthesis or modification of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. In the CAZy database, GHs are classified into families based on amino acid sequence similarities and others conserved features [7, 25, 26, 39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44697" pm="."><plain>GH- are classified in 135 families and represent approximately 47 % of the entire database. (April 2016) [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44699" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of currently known GH are from bacterial origin. <p><text><SENT sid="44700" pm="."><plain>DNA microarrays are widely used to profile gene expression and represent a relevant tool to study expression of key enzymes and monitor physiological changes of pure cultures or microbial communities [12, 18, 28, 42, 46, 50, 68]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44701" pm="."><plain>This approach can also be useful to link microbial diversity to ecosystem processes and functions [22, 29, 67]. <p><text><SENT sid="44702" pm="."><plain>In this study, we developed the first microarray tool, termed CAZyChip, to quickly and accurately explore, at transcriptomic level, the GH composition of environmental samples. The CAZyChip provides snapshot views of the enzymes expressed by a single microorganism or more interestingly by microbial consortia derived from complex and various ecosystems. The biochip gives an opportunity to highlight enzyme cooperation along with the plant biomass degradation pathway. The present study demonstrates that the CazyChip represents a unique, robust and yet generic tool to dynamically analyze the expression of a large variety of GHs in parallel. The current version of this biochip allows the detection of 55,220 bacterial annotated GHs and contains the signatures of all bacterial GH in all families available to date in the CAZy database in addition to 53 CE sequences. The CAZy chip was validated using characterized enzymes from gut metagenomic libraries of different species, which were chosen for their known abilities to degrade plant cell walls. The encoding sequences of the enzymes of interest were recovered from microbiome of worm (Pontoscolex corethrurus), human, rumen, and termites these latter include fungus-growing (Pseudacanthotermes militaris), wood-feeding (Nasutitermes corniger), or soil-wood feeding (Termes hispaniolae). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44709" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the developed biochip was tested to highlight the GH functional diversity of complex lignocellulolytic microbial communities, using a cow rumen-derived microbial consortium. The resulting biochip is able to test the GH functional diversity of complex microbial communities that present high metabolic and taxonomic diversity. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="44711" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="44714" pm="."><plain>When the design of 60-mers were impossible, a 40-mer or a pair of 25-mers associated with inert nucleotidic linkers was generated. For each targeted CAZyme gene (GH and CEs), three different 60-mer probes were designed and for each probe. The Agilent probe design algorithm assigned a BC score, which reflects uniqueness, secondary structure considerations, GC content and thermodynamic parameters, that predicts hybridization quality on the basis of their nucleotidic composition [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44717" pm="."><plain>Five grades of BC scores were defined and indicated the quality of the designed probes. These different scores were, from the best to the worst: BC_1, BC_2, BC_3, BC_4 and BC_Poor. A total of 180,000 probes, including 4848 Agilent internal positive or negative control probes, were selected and synthesized in situ, on a glass slide using Agilent SurePrint technology to obtain a high-density DNA microarray tool on 4x180 K format (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France) [32]. </plain></SENT>

This is the first high throughput tool, based on DNA microarray technology, allowing the rapid characterization and exploration of the GHs arsenal of complex microbiota at the transcriptomic level. For design purposes, we first collected all sequences of bacterial GHs available in the CAZy data base, belonging to cultivated species, as well as some metagenomic sequences issued from uncultivated species. We then performed a probe bioinformatic design using eArray and ROSO softwares, which took into account the thermodynamics and specificity regardless of the secondary structures that probes can adopt. We validated probe specificity and the robustness of the biochip with different RNAs obtained from well characterized GHs cloned in plasmids and expressed in E. coli. For each GH, we validated at least one specific probe on the three designed per gene. For the great majority of GHs tested, the three probes gave a positive and specific hybridization signal, meaning that our probe design was highly effective. <p><text><SENT sid="44831" pm="."><plain>Following this first validation step with unique GH overexpressed in bacteria, we studied the hybridization behavior of a series of metagenomic clones obtained from different metagenomic libraries. Metagenomic clones were selected for their enzymatic activity and can express up to 9 identified GHs. The CAZyChip allowed for the identification of genes responsible for the activity detected in each metagenomic clone. The multi-genic hybridization step allowed us to validate probes to identify 69 GHs. As an example, His28, which showed arabinofuranosidase activity, encodes two GH51 typical arabinofuranosidases, F but only one was expressed. 96 % of tested GHs had at least one validated probe. Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of multiple probes per target sequence is not essential for in situ synthesized 60mer oligonucleotides in bacterial Agilent’s arrays [37]. </plain></SENT>

With the CAZyChip, GH expression profiles at two different time points (day 3 and day 5) characterized by an exponential burst of enzyme activities were analyzed. At day 5, we identified overexpression of the GH families associated with cellulase (GH5, GH6, GH8, GH9 and GH48), xylanase (GH8, GH10), and exoglucanase (GH1, GH3) activities, which is in agreement with previous results [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44843" pm="."><plain>The most common activities of GH3 include glucosidases, arabinofuranosidases, xylosidases and glucosaminidases and GH43 shows xylosidase, arabinofuranosidase, arabinanase, xylanase and galactosidase activities. Thus, these two families are implicated in degradation of arabinoxylan, the most abundant hemicellulose component in wheat straw [35] which explains the great number of genes overexpressed at day 5 in these GH families. An over representation of members of family GH13 and GH23 was seen, as they are implicated in common bacterial physiological processes and known to possess one of the broadest distributions among the gut microbiota [8, 17, 18]. </plain></SENT>

This transcriptomic screening approach (microarrays), reveals the genes that are being actively expressed by lignocellulolytic communities. This in turn allows us to consider the stability and/or performance of target enzymes, enabling the design of new enzyme cocktails and engineering microbial mixed cultures for an optimized lignocellulose bioconversion.

<SENT sid="44863" pm="."><plain>Modifications of their expression induce a number of diseases like colon cancer, Crohn’s disease, lactose malabsorption, food allergies, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, mucopolysaccharidoses [49, 55, 60, 64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="44864" pm="."><plain>Thus applications referred for diagnostic or preventive health and nutrition could be explored, if considering GHs as biomarkers. Following glycosyltranferase expression could be also of great interest as they play an important role in the human antigenic system [63]. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title><text><SENT sid="44866" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="44867" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the CAZychip developed in this study is a user-friendly, high-throughput, and reliable method to quickly explore GHs expression from complex environmental samples. It can be used to explore functional and ecological dynamics of the enzymatic machinery used by microbes for carbohydrate degradation. This approach can enhance the understanding of how the microbes metabolize polysaccharides and optimize polysaccharide or glycan deconstruction. The CAZyChip could guide the design of enzyme cocktails or the engineering of microbial mixed cultures for many applications. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="ABBR"><sec id="Sec17"><title><text><SENT sid="44871" pm="."><plain>Abbreviations </plain></SENT>
