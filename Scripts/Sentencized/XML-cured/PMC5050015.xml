This disk contains four Apaf-1/pc-9 CARD pairs arranged in a shallow spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD at lower occupancy. On average, Apaf-1 CARDs recruit 3 to 5 pc-9 molecules to the apoptosome and one catalytic domain may be parked on the hub, when an odd number of zymogens are bound. This suggests a stoichiometry of one or at most, two pc-9 dimers per active apoptosome.

The term arises from the Greek word that describes leaves “falling off” a tree, and the process entails damaged or unwanted cells essentially committing suicide in a controlled manner. As such, apoptosis keeps the number of cells in tissues and organs in check. It also allows components of old cells to be recycled to make new ones. </p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="45565" pm="."><plain>In cells that are targeted to die, a protein called cytochrome c interacts with another protein, named Apaf-1, together with a nucleotide triphosphate molecule. These steps work in concert to trigger the assembly of the apoptosome: a large wheel-like complex that contains seven copies each of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. The central hub of the wheel then recruits a specific protein-cutting enzyme, which once activated sets in motion a cascade of events that dismantle the cell from the inside out. </p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="45568" pm="."><plain>Cheng et al. now use an electron microscope to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the active human apoptosome, in enough detail to determine the positions of many of the amino acids that make up the complex. The three dimensional model provides new insights into how Apaf-1 changes shape as the complex assembles in the presence of cytochrome c and nucleotide triphosphate. Cheng et al. went on to reveal a disk-like structure made from the parts of four Apaf-1 proteins that interact with the protein-cutting enzymes. This disk forms a spiral that sits atop the central hub of the wheel-like apoptosome. Finally, the findings suggest that, although the wheel like complex has seven spokes, at any one time the active apoptosome may only need two (or at most four) copies of the protein-cutting enzyme to trigger the cascade of events that lead to cell death </p><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="45573" pm="."><plain>In the future, emerging technologies may provide high enough resolution to visualize fine details of the interactions between cytochrome c and Apaf-1, and reveal more about the disk-like spiral as well.

<SENT sid="45578" pm="."><plain>In general, this process allows cellular components to be recycled without activating inflammatory pathways (Green and Evan, 2002; Inohara and Nuñez, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45579" pm="."><plain>In humans, intrinsic cell death signals converge on mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic factors through outer membrane pores formed by Bcl-2 family members (Brunelle and Letai, 2009; Tait and Green, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45580" pm="."><plain>These factors include cytochrome c, which up-regulates assembly of the Apoptotic protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome (Li et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45581" pm="."><plain>Other released factors, such as Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 (reviewed in Tait and Green, 2010), are pro-apoptotic and interact with inhibitory proteins to unblock procaspases –9, –3 and –7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45582" pm="."><plain>This multi-pronged pathway allows activation of procaspase-9 on the apoptosome and subsequent proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 and –7, which results in selective proteolysis of target proteins and cell death (Bratton and Salvesen, 2010). <p><text><SENT sid="45583" pm="."><plain>Apaf-1 is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, has seven domains and exists as an inactive monomer in the cytoplasm of healthy cells (Danot et al., 2009; Leipe et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45584" pm="."><plain>When released, cytochrome c binds to β-propellers in Apaf-1 and may trigger nucleotide exchange with ATP/dATP replacing bound ADP/dADP (Liu et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997; Zou et al., 1997, 1999; Hu et al., 1998, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45585" pm="."><plain>This leads to the assembly of a heptameric apoptosome (Acehan et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45586" pm="."><plain>Caspase recognition domains (CARDs) are present as N-terminal effector domains in both Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (pc-9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45587" pm="."><plain>Thus, CARD-CARD interactions target inactive pc-9 monomers to the apoptosome (Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45588" pm="."><plain>During this step, a CARD 'disk' is formed that sits above the central hub, and is attached by linkers to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (Yuan et al., 2010, 2011a, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45589" pm="."><plain>The nature of the disk is not known but a recent hypothetical model suggests that two CARD-CARD interfaces may be used to form a quasi-helical stack, akin to structures in Death Domain complexes (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45590" pm="."><plain>Local proximity of procaspase-9 monomers on the apoptosome leads to protease activation. However, the precise mechanism of pc-9 activation after recruitment to the apoptosome is still being debated. Catalytic domains may associate in solution or they may interact with the apoptosome to form an active protease (Yuan et al., 2011a, Bratton and Salvesen, 2010; Boatright et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2014; Würstle and Rehm, 2014). <p><text><SENT sid="45593" pm="."><plain>We now present a near atomic structure of the active human apoptosome determined with cryo-EM at a global resolution of ~4.1 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45594" pm="."><plain>This work provides a model of Apaf-1 in an extended conformation with bound dATP and shows monomer interactions within the apoptosome. Improved clarity reveals interactions of cytochrome c with β-propellers in the V-shaped sensor domain. For the first time, molecular details are provided of a tilted, acentric disk formed by N-terminal CARDs from four Apaf-1 and three or four pc-9 molecules. In brief, the disk contains four pairs of Apaf-1/pc-9 CARDs in one turn of a spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD being present at lower occupancy. This arrangement creates a mismatch between the CARD spiral in the disk and the c7 symmetry of the platform. We also verified that a pc-9 catalytic domain may be parked on the central hub (Yuan et al., 2011a), adjacent to a pc-9 CARD in the disk. In addition, three Apaf-1 CARDs are excluded from the disk but may retain a limited ability to bind pc-9 molecules, depending upon steric constraints. Stoichiometry measurements have suggested that 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be recruited by Apaf-1 CARDs on the apoptosome (Malladi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45602" pm="."><plain>Hence, at any instant one or two pc-9 dimers may be tethered to the apoptosome.

<SENT sid="45610" pm="."><plain>After movie frame corrections for global movements during imaging (Li et al., 2013), ~135,000 particles were extracted from the resulting micrographs and processed by 2D and 3D classification in RELION (Scheres, 2012) to identify the best particles (~93,000). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45612" pm="."><plain>However, the resolution is not isotropic. As estimated by ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014) the central hub is at a nominal resolution of 3–4 Å and this is supported by the visibility of larger side chains.

However, a major rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair occurs when dATP is bound, such that the HD1-WHD loop rotates into position at the bottom of the nucleotide pocket. This is coupled with a large rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair about the WHD (Yuan et al., 2013; Figure 6), which positions the NBD, HD1 and WHD to form lateral contacts in the inner and outer rings of the central hub (Yuan et al., 2010, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45773" pm="."><plain>This large rotation also breaks a hydrogen bond between His348 in helix α24 of the WHD and the β-phosphate, which may help stabilize the closed configuration (Danot et al., 2009; Riedl et al., 2005; Reubold et al., 2011; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45774" pm="."><plain>Hence, the HD1-WHD loop effectively replaces helix α24 in the transition from a closed to an extended conformation.

To understand this process, we investigated Apaf-1 assembly with native gradient gels, which are sensitive to changes in mass, shape and charge. However, these experiments were complicated by the presence of a ladder with up to seven bands in purified and functional Apaf-1 preparations. This ladder may be due to lateral subunit interactions at the non-physiological protein concentration. Concerted band shifts were visible when Apaf-1 was incubated with increasing amounts of cytochrome c (Figure 6A, lanes 2–3), coupled with a depletion of the original Apaf-1 bands. In addition, higher order bands were formed relative to control lanes with Apaf-1 alone (Figure 6A, lanes 1, 4). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45825" pm="."><plain>We then over-layed Apaf-1 structures with and without bound cytochrome c, by focusing the alignment on the WHD and HD2 arm, as these domains remain relatively unchanged during the transition from a closed to an extended conformation. During activation, cytochrome c most likely binds first to the 8-blade β-propeller since this region is accessible and the resulting interface is quite extensive. At this stage, the 8-blade β-propeller and helices α29 to α32 of the HD2 undergo a small upwards rotation relative to the core of the HD2 arm (helices α25 to α28), to bring this region into proximity with the 7-blade β-propeller (Figure 6B,C; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C, Video 1). </plain></SENT>

In addition, band shift experiments with Apaf-1 monomers and pc-9 suggest that excluded Apaf-1 CARDs may, in principle, bind to pc-9 molecules in the absence of steric restraints. However, a measured stoichiometry of 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules per apoptosome under various conditions, places an upper limit on the number of Apaf-1 CARDs that may recruit pc-9 molecules (Malladi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

At position 3a the N-terminal helix of the Apaf-1 CARD may interact with helices α8 and α11 in a single NBD.

We then docked domains from crystal structures into the 3D map to create a model for the apoptosome. This analysis identified plausible conformational changes of Apaf-1 that may drive assembly (Yuan et al., 2010, 2013), although high resolution details were absent. However, density for the CARD disk was blurred due to a symmetry mismatch with the platform. To extend our studies, we have now determined the first near atomic structure of an active human apoptosome using cryo-EM. In total, we modeled 57 domains in the active apoptosome. Models for the sensor domain with cytochrome c and the CARD disk are based on local maps obtained by focused 3D classification at a resolution of ~6Å. </plain></SENT>

In addition, most pc-9 catalytic domains are flexibly-tethered to their respective CARDs in the disk, while catalytic domains from one pc-9 may be parked on the central hub in some particles. Our model provides insights into cytochrome c binding, nucleotide exchange, Apaf-1 assembly, CARD disk formation and pc-9 activation.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45966" pm="."><plain>In the current assembly model, cytochrome c binding and nucleotide exchange produce a large conformational change in Apaf-1 (Yuan et al., 2013; Pang et al., 2015; Reubold et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45967" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cytochrome c binding is a pre-requisite for nucleotide exchange during assembly. In particular, we observed a significant band shift and aggregation of Apaf-1 on native gels when cytochrome c was added, while similar changes could not be detected when dATP was added in a separate reaction. Conformational changes due to cytochrome c binding may involve a small rotation of the 8-blade β-propeller and the supporting four α-helices of HD2, along with a much larger rotation of the 7-blade β-propeller about the base of the HD2 arm, to form the appropriate contact surface within the V-shaped sensor region for cytochrome c (Yuan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45970" pm="."><plain>During this reaction, the NBD-HD1 pair must begin to rotate away from the 7-blade β-propeller to avoid a clash, while allowing nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, a hinge-like rotation of the NBD-HD1 pair relative to the rest of Apaf-1 may be dynamic. Hence, the NBD-HD1 pair could fluctuate between ADP and ATP/dATP bound conformations until they are fixed in place by the binding of both ligands. Thus, cytochrome c and a bound nucleotide triphosphate would predispose Apaf-1 to adopt an extended conformation that promotes lateral assembly of subunits to form the ring. In the absence of nucleotide exchange, binding by cytochrome c leads to a local conformational change (or alternatively to a change in the dynamics of the closed form) and subsequent aggregation of Apaf-1 molecules. <p><text><SENT sid="45975" pm="."><plain>The low intrinsic ATPase activity of Apaf-1 (~4–5 ATP per Apaf-1/hr) is probably not required for assembly per se (Reubold et al., 2009), as exchange of bound ADP/dADP for a nucleotide triphosphate (dATP, ATP or even GTP at 1 mM) is all that is required to promote conformational changes that drive assembly. Near atomic structures of Apaf-1 monomers (Riedl et al., 2005; Reubold et al., 2011) and the apoptosome (Zhou et al., 2015; this work) suggest that the molecule has diverged from the canonical architecture of AAA+ ATPases. This includes the 'loss' of a stable binding site for a Mg+2 ion adjacent to the γ-phosphate of dATP/ATP, which greatly diminishes the intrinsic ATPase activity of the monomer. However, as Apaf-1 folds during translation or shortly thereafter, the protein may bind adenine nucleotide diphosphate or adenine nucleotide triphosphate, as both are present in the cytoplasm. If nucleotide diphosphate is bound, then Apaf-1 will be locked into a closed conformation, until cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death signals. Alternatively, if newly synthesized Apaf-1 binds a nucleotide triphosphate then a limited hydrolysis activity would ensure that the molecule adopts a closed, inactive conformation to prevent aggregation or further assembly into the cell death machine. Moreover, no detectable ATPase activity has been found in apoptosomes (Reubold et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45982" pm="."><plain>This may be correlated with the lack of an arginine finger and the absence of a stably-bound Mg+2 ion at the nucleotide binding site. <p><text><SENT sid="45983" pm="."><plain>We also find that pc-9 is able to interact with Apaf-1 to form a 1:1 complex and this step is mediated by CARD-CARD interactions. Hence, Apaf-1 and pc-9 may co-assemble to form an active apoptosome. In this case, preformed Apaf-1/pc-9 complexes would bind cytochrome c and undergo nucleotide exchange. Alternatively, Apaf-1 may adopt an extended conformation triggered by cytochrome c and dATP/ATP, and then bind pc-9 as it interacts with other copies of itself during assembly. Remarkably, the concentration of pc-9 and Apaf-1 in HeLa cervical cancer cells is estimated to be ~30 nM and ~340 nM, respectively (Würstle and Rehm, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45988" pm="."><plain>This translates to roughly one pc-9 molecule for every 10–11 Apaf-1 molecules and with an assembly efficiency of ~70% this would give a pc-9 to Apaf-1 ratio of roughly 1:7 or 1:8 in active complexes. However, in non-cancer cells the ratio of pc-9 to Apaf-1 may be higher. Even so, this raises the possibility that preformed Apaf-1/pc-9 heterodimers may undergo preferential recruitment to apoptosomes during their assembly, due to the additional cooperativity of disk formation. </sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><text><SENT sid="45991" pm="."><plain>The apoptosome and pc-9 activation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46016" pm="."><plain>When taken together, this data would argue against an activation mechanism that requires binding of pc-9 catalytic domains to the central hub formed by Apaf-1 molecules, since this region does not exist in chimeric complexes. These data also suggest that efficient procaspase-3 cleavage can proceed in chimeric complexes in the absence of the Apaf-1 platform. However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that procaspase-3 may interact with Apaf-1 at some point either during or after its activation (Yuan et al., 2011a and references therein). <p><text><SENT sid="46019" pm="."><plain>Our structure of an active apoptosome provides additional insights into the mechanism of pc-9 activation. One constraint is provided by stoichiometry measurements, which indicate that a range of 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be bound to the apoptosome (Malladi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46021" pm="."><plain>In line with this data, our structure suggests that 3 or 4 pc-9 molecules may be tethered to the disk through CARD-CARD interactions, with the caveat that a pc-9 molecule might also interact with Apaf-1 CARDs that are excluded from the disk. We also identified density in some particles for catalytic domains from a single pc-9 that are 'parked' on the NBD ring of the central hub (this work, Yuan et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46023" pm="."><plain>The two 'most favored' positions for parked pc-9 catalytic domains are next to the pc-9 CARD at position 2p in the disk. Our analysis further suggests that the acentric position of the disk may create the binding site for pc-9 catalytic domains. However, it is unlikely that adjacent parking sites would be occupied at the same time due to steric restraints. One implication of this finding is that parked catalytic domains could be attached to pc-9 CARDs located at all possible positions in the disk, due to the length of the CARD-p20 linker. Hence, the most favored parking sites are generally available to all four pc-9 molecules that may be tethered to the disk. We hypothesize that parked pc-9 catalytic domains may be held in reserve when an odd number of zymogens are bound to the apoptosome. This in turn, may prevent entanglement of linkers between parked pc-9 catalytic domains and flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers anchored to the disk, with the latter representing active proteolytic centers. There is no ordered density in our map for other pc-9 catalytic domains, and these domains can be released by a single clip in the CARD-p20 linker (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46031" pm="."><plain>Thus, we surmise that the remaining pc-9 catalytic domains are flexibly-tethered to the disk through CARD-p20 linkers. <p><text><SENT sid="46032" pm="."><plain>We propose that the active apoptosome is a dynamic proteolytic machine with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains, whose nature may depend upon the number of pc-9 molecules that are bound at any instant.

<SENT sid="46034" pm="."><plain>However, if four pc-9 molecules are bound to the apoptosome they may form an 8-CARD disk with two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers, while leaving open parking spots on the central hub (Figure 9, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46035" pm="."><plain>By extension, if 5 pc-9 molecules were bound to the apoptosome then one pc-9 molecule might interact with an Apaf-1 CARD that is not incorporated into the disk. In this case, two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers may be formed on the apoptosome with an 8 CARD disk and a parked p20/p10 domain would also be present (e.g. Figure 8—figure supplement 1B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46037" pm="."><plain>Since the pc-9 CARD at position 8p in the disk is present at lower occupancy, it is clear that active apoptosomes with three bound pc-9 molecules were formed with a higher likelihood under our in vitro conditions. At the same time, the high protein concentration in our experiments may have aided the formation of an 8 CARD disk in particles with four pc-9 molecules, whereas apoptosomes with a 7 CARD disk and three pc-9 molecules may be favored in vivo. Moreover, the KCl concentration may affect the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. The lower KCl concentration used in Buffer A, relative to physiological conditions (20 mM versus ~150 mM), may favor electrostatic interactions that predominate at CARD-CARD interfaces. Hence, the transient association of a pc-9 CARD at position 8p may be more favorable in low salt buffer. Also note that it remains an open question whether each putative pc-9 dimer on the active apoptosome may contain one (Renatus et al., 2001) or possibly two active sites. <p><text><SENT sid="46043" pm="."><plain>Activation of pc-9 on the apoptosome has been proposed to follow the dictates of a molecular timer.

<SENT sid="46045" pm="."><plain>The rapid nature of the auto-proteolysis reaction suggests that two-chain pc-9 molecules, as used in our structure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), may account for most of the activity towards procaspase-3 (Malladi et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46046" pm="."><plain>Since there is no uncleaved pc-9 in our assembly reaction, we are not able to comment directly on the proposed turnover of pc-9 in the molecular timer hypothesis. However, the disposition of pc-9 on the apoptosome is similar for both unprocessed and cleaved pc-9 molecules. Indeed, a 3D map of apoptosomes with bound pc-9 CARDs, made by thrombinolysis of a single chain pc-9 with a triple point mutation (E306A/D315A/D330A), also showed the disk, while flexibly-tethered catalytic domains were released from the complexes (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46049" pm="."><plain>Our structure of the active apoptosome suggests that flexibly-bound pc-9 catalytic domains are probably not able to affect the stability of the CARD-CARD disk. However, parked p20/p10 subunits of pc-9 could exert some effect on disk stability, to modulate the binding and release of pc-9, although this is speculative. Intriguingly, pc-9 CARDs are located on the top surface of the disk, which would provide a route for pc-9 molecules to dis-associate from the complex, such as occurs at position 8p. This step would down-regulate apoptosome activity until a replacement pc-9 is bound from solution. The major variable in evaluating possible turnover of bound pc-9 molecules is the overall stability of the CARD disk. Given the multiple interactions of pc-9 CARDs in positions 2p, 4p, and 6p, it appears that a CARD at position 8p will be the most likely to exchange, as observed in our analysis. Hence, the turnover of pc-9 at position 8p in the disk would lead to an oscillation in the number of potentially active pc-9 dimers bound to the apoptosome. <p><text><SENT sid="46056" pm="."><plain>Finally, pc-9 molecules with shortened CARD-p20 linkers are not activated on the apoptosome as readily as wild type pc-9 (Yuan et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46057" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the CARD-p20 linker may facilitate pc-9 activation by providing a suitable spacer between CARDs in the disk and the catalytic domains. Indeed, the requirement for a somewhat longer spacer may reflect the disposition of the four pc-9 CARD binding sites on the disk. Moreover, the CARD-p20 linker may also stabilize the pc-9 dimer when it is formed. In either case, a single clip in the linker releases the catalytic (p20/p10) domains from the apoptosome and results in a complete loss of proteolytic activity (Yuan et al., 2010, 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46061" pm="."><plain>This argues that putative pc-9 dimers are only stable when present at a high local concentration on the apoptosome. <p><text><SENT sid="46062" pm="."><plain>In summary, our structure of an active apoptosome suggests that most complexes will contain one (or possibly two) pc-9 dimers, which may be responsible for proteolytic activity and initiation of a cell death cascade. In a subsequent step, the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 dimers may occur either in solution through a collisional process with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains or the reaction may be facilitated by transient interactions with the Apaf-1 platform (Yin et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46089" pm="."><plain>A previously published map (EMD-1931) was low pass filtered to 60 Å and used as the starting model for 3D classification. Refinement with c7 symmetry gave a map at 4.7 Å resolution (gold-standard FSC0.143). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46091" pm="."><plain>Per particle corrections for beam-induced motion and B-factor weighting for radiation damage were carried out with statistical movie processing in RELION-1.3 (Scheres, 2014) with frames 2–18, a running average of 5 frames and a standard deviation of 1 pixel for translations. A soft mask was used along with correction for the modulation transfer function of the K2 Summit detector to produce a map at 4.1 Å resolution, which was sharpened using automatic B-factor estimation (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) within RELION 1.3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46093" pm="."><plain>Local resolution was estimated using ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014). <p><text><SENT sid="46094" pm="."><plain>A focused 3D classification was used to improve the local resolution of the sensor domain in a single Apaf-1 subunit as described (Zhou et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46095" pm="."><plain>In brief, the first Euler angle (α) from the alignment of each original particle image on the whole apoptosome was permutated cyclically by n times in 360°/7 increments, with n=1 to 6, to create six additional 'virtual particle' line entries in a new alignment data star file. In effect, this rotates each spoke density region within a given 2D image into the mask in the aligned 3D reference volume. The 3D mask covered the HD2, β-propellers, and cytochrome c in one Apaf-1 subunit. A focused 3D classification in RELION (Scheres, 2012) was done without an alignment search and members of the best class were then used to calculate an improved 3D map using relion_reconstruct, which places each particle projection only in its most probable orientation. After excluding the HD2, this gave a final sharpened map for the sensor domain with a resolution of 6.1 Å. <p><text><SENT sid="46100" pm="."><plain>The CARD disk is rotationally blurred during c7 alignments, and refinement with c1 symmetry failed to clarify the map due to the small size (~75–80 kD) of the disk. Thus, we used a 3D classification that focused on the disk without local refinement. A soft mask was used that covered the disk and enclosed the NBD ring. In total, we identified seven classes with an asymmetric disk in different orientations, relative to the aligned c7 platform. After applying a soft mask to the disk, an estimated gold standard resolution of ~5.8 Å was obtained for each of the seven class maps. Sharpened 3D maps from each of the classes were then aligned and averaged in Chimera with vop_resample and equal weighting (Pettersen et al., 2004) to produce a final map of the disk. <p><text><SENT sid="46106" pm="."><plain>The following steps were used to produce a map of the pc-9 apoptosome with c1 symmetry. Coordinates of shiny particles (92867) from RELION were used to extract particles from the movement corrected micrographs in EMAN2.1 (Tang et al., 2007) and CTFFIND4 parameters (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015) were imported using a utility in EMAN2.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46108" pm="."><plain>After 2D classification with e2refine2d.py, particles in the best classes were selected (82091) and further segregated by a supervised 3D classification using e2refinemulti.py with two references. The first 3D reference was EMD-1931 (apoptosome with bound pc9 catalytic domains processed with c1 symmetry; Yuan et al., 2011a), while the second reference was constructed by removing density for the parked pc9 catalytic domains from the first reference map using Chimera. Particles in the class with bound catalytic domains (39985, ~48.7%) were used for c1 refinement with EMD-1931 as a reference, which was low pass filtered to 30 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46111" pm="."><plain>This produced a map with a gold standard FSC0.143 of 7.2 Å with α-helical rods resolved in the central hub (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46112" pm="."><plain>However, density for the bound pc-9 catalytic domains was not resolved at α-helical resolution presumably due to local flexibility. </sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><text><SENT sid="46113" pm="."><plain>Model building </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46116" pm="."><plain>The flexibly fitted model accounted well for most of the density, except for a loop between residues 349 to 364 in HD1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46118" pm="."><plain>In the next stage, β-propellers were docked into the local map of the V-shaped domain using MDFF, while cytochrome c (PDB 3J2T), and individual CARDs from a crystal structure (Hu et al., 2014; PDB 4RHW) were docked with rigid body fitting in Chimera. We then calculated a model vs map FSC0.5 to obtain an estimate of the final resolution for each of the models. All molecular figures were made with Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004; Goddard et al., 2005) and Adobe Photoshop. </sec><sec id="s4-5"><title><text><SENT sid="46121" pm="."><plain>Author information </plain></SENT>

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.

Using this structure, the authors describe the putative interactions that drive oligomerization of Apaf-1, the interaction cytochrome c with the sensor domain, and the spiraling CARD disk at the center of the apoptosome, which interestingly involves association of only 4 of the 7 CARDs. This new structure is coupled with prior apoptosome structures, as well as with native gradient gels to present a model for oligomerization, wherein cytochrome c binding induces conformational rearrangements that allow for nucleotide exchange and apoptosome assembly. The work of the authors significantly extends beyond their prior contributions to the analysis of the intricacies of apoptosome formation, and their model also provides novel insight into how caspase-9 may be activated on this signalling platform. The work also complements recent structural studies published by their international peers. One of the most striking findings of the authors is that their structural information might explain the current contradiction of how a supposedly heptavalent platform for caspase-9 activation is providing only a low number of active caspase-9 sites. <p><text><SENT sid="46215" pm="."><plain>Overall the cryoEM analysis is well-done, and the authors show great expertise in their treatment of the data, using focused classification and other advanced image processing techniques to improve the resolution of disordered or flexible regions of the apoptosome complex. The overall quality of the density is consistent with the interpretation presented in the manuscript. <p><text><SENT sid="46217" pm="."><plain>Essential revisions: <p><text><SENT sid="46218" pm="?"><plain>1) The "global" resolution is stated to be at 4.1 Angstroms resolution, yet a soft 3D mask was applied for this estimation – was this mask generated automatically, or manually, and more importantly, did this mask include the disordered sensor domains or CARD disk? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46219" pm="."><plain>If any structural features were cropped through the masking, then the reported "global" resolution is misleading. <p><text><SENT sid="46220" pm="."><plain>2) The Resmap software is widely used by the EM community estimate local resolutions due to its ease of use.

Comparison of the Resmap output with a similar program available in the Bsoft package is encouraged to ensure that the resolution claims are seen to be credible with map quality. <p><text><SENT sid="46223" pm="."><plain>3) The PDB map associated with the combined EM density was generated by rigid body fitting previously determined crystal structures into the density, and these atomic models were refined into the density using a combination of MDFF and Phenix. For regions where side-chain densities are not clearly visible, the authors should limit the deposition to a C-α trace of the backbone. <p><text><SENT sid="46225" pm="."><plain>4) Previous studies have shown that caspase-9 dimer activities towards procaspase-3 differ substantially from caspase-9 activities on apoptosomes. Can the structural model explain this phenomenon? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46227" pm="?"><plain>In particular, can an allosteric contribution by the apoptosome backbone be excluded or substantiated? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46228" pm="."><plain>The authors also briefly touch on and somehow exclude the anti-dogmatic idea that caspase-9 monomers may be activated on the apoptosome backbone. It is not clear to me why that idea is or can be refuted. Would it be possible that both homodimers of active casp-9 can be formed on the apoptosome as well as active monomers? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46231" pm="."><plain>The authors should also explain better whether their structural model is consistent with the finding that the apoptosome can act as a molecular timer. Other than that, data presented in Figure 6D would probably be more convincing if the authors added a repeat in which a binding deficient PC9 was used as a negative control. Another suggestion is to comment on whether the data on cyt-c integration into the apoptosome and the contact regions (subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding”, fourth paragraph) corresponds to cyt-c residues found to be critical for its proapoptotic potential (see e.g. published studies that compared yeast and human cyt-c). <p><text><SENT sid="46234" pm="."><plain>5) The authors' structure of the platform of the pc-9 bound apoptosome and the unbound apoptosome recently reported by Zhou et al. 2015 is nearly identical (with the exception of the nucleotide orientation and whether Mg++ ions are involved in nucleotide binding), and for the most part the conclusions on the roles of cytochrome c and nucleotide binding in the formation of the apoptosome corroborate the findings of Zhou et.al. (2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46237" pm="."><plain>Perhaps more interesting is the increased resolution (~5.8 Angstroms) of the APAF-1:caspase-9 CARD disk and the confirmation of a previously postulated interaction of at least one catalytic caspase-9 P20/P10 dimer bound to the NBD ring of the central hub (Yuan et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46239" pm="."><plain>Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. 2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. 2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is "parked" on the hub. However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46247" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Hu et al. 2015 identified mutations in APAF-1, K58E/K62E which are not found in any of the CARD:CARD interfaces and do not disturb apoptosome formation or recruitment of caspase-9, but severely interfere with the activity of the bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46249" pm="."><plain>This suggests an allosteric mechanism exists for increased activation of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46250" pm="."><plain>The author's only comment is that these mutations may affect binding of the CARD disc to the NBD hub. It would be helpful if they could elaborate on that further. <p><text><SENT sid="46252" pm="."><plain>Other specific points: <p><text><SENT sid="46253" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – a list of residues potentially involved in lateral interactions in the central hub are listed.

Has mutagenesis been performed on these residues, or is there evidence of co-evolutionary variance to support these claims? <p><text><SENT sid="46257" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – some of the distances shown in Figure 3G &amp; H are almost 5 Angstroms, which is beyond the range of hydrogen bonding. Due to the limited resolution of this region, it's possible that the modeling is inaccurate, so again, is there any other biochemical evidence supporting the role of the listed residues in stabilizing this region? <p><text><SENT sid="46259" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – The density described for the pi-cation interaction is questionable, if the authors want to include this statement, the density for this region should be shown in a figure. <p><text><SENT sid="46260" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The authors state that all α-helices in cytochrome c are resolved. While the subunit can be unambiguously docked into the density, sausage-like densities that are consistent with α helices resolved to 6 Å resolution are not present. <p><text><SENT sid="46262" pm="."><plain>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The interpretation of side-chain interactions based on docked crystal structures is appropriate, but discussion of visible Trp844 side chain density in a region where α helical densities are not discernible is over-interpretation. <p><text><SENT sid="46263" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The CARD disk” – The authors mention that linker densities are visible, but the data is not shown. The symmetry mismatch in this region is a particularly interesting aspect of the manuscript, and the details of these linkers are relevant to understanding the mismatch – these linker densities should be shown. Despite their flexibility, is there any evidence of linker density for the linkers to the unassociated CARDs? <p><text><SENT sid="46266" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – Concerning the localization of the pc-9 catalytic domain – the authors' statement that EMAN2 uses a "density based approach in real space" needs further explanation. Is this simply cross-correlation-based projection matching? </plain></SENT>

The mask was made in Relion based on user choice of threshold by visualizing the unsharpened map in Chimera. Please note that the CARD disk has been omitted for clarity in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, because it is rotationally-averaged and featureless at this stage of the analysis. <p><text><SENT sid="46282" pm="."><plain>2) The Resmap software is widely used by the EM community estimate local resolutions due to its ease of use. However, this software has repeatedly been shown to over-estimate resolutions. Comparison of the Resmap output with a similar program available in the Bsoft package is encouraged to ensure that the resolution claims are seen to be credible with map quality. <p><text><SENT sid="46285" pm="."><plain>We agree with the reviewers’ observation concerning the over-estimation of resolution by ResMap. As stated in the Methods section: “Local resolution was estimated using ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014).” Please note that Resmap results are not presented as absolutes, but rather as a guide to highlight the inherent resolution gradient that is present. We have reinforced this point by changing the main text: “As estimated by ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014) the central hub is at a nominal resolution of 3-4 Å, which is supported by the visibility of larger side chains, while the extended arm and peripheral sensor domains are in the range of 4.5-10 Å (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).” <p><text><SENT sid="46288" pm="."><plain>3) The PDB map associated with the combined EM density was generated by rigid body fitting previously determined crystal structures into the density, and these atomic models were refined into the density using a combination of MDFF and Phenix. For regions where side-chain densities are not clearly visible, the authors should limit the deposition to a C-α trace of the backbone. <p><text><SENT sid="46290" pm="."><plain>Well this is always a tricky point and in our opinion there is no single correct approach. Since we have used well defined crystal structures for regions of lower resolution, we feel that side chains should be left in place as a best estimate for that particular local region, and as a courtesy to biologists and structural groups who may use the pdb files in future. In particular, it is clearly indicated in the paper which regions are supported by higher resolution and the map itself serves as a clear guide. Side chains can easily be turned off in graphics programs, but having them present as they are found in the crystal structure allows one to more readily understand details of the local fold and packing, that might also apply within the larger ensemble. While contact regions between domains that form novel interactions, such as those between the two β-propellers will differ between the crystal structure and the ensemble, it is still more useful to have the residues present to get a general idea of the chemistry of a local environment. In addition, side chains help to guide the refinement of the protein backbone into the density with MDFF, so it seems reasonable to leave them in the final pdb file. Another approach would be to have two depositions, one in the Protein Data Bank with rather more strict guidelines pertaining to this issue, and a second repository for models, wherein a slightly more liberal, and in our opinion, more useful deposition can be made. However, for the moment this issue is left at the discretion of the authors. <p><text><SENT sid="46298" pm="."><plain>4) Previous studies have shown that caspase-9 dimer activities towards procaspase-3 differ substantially from caspase-9 activities on apoptosomes. Can the structural model explain this phenomenon? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46300" pm="."><plain>In particular, can an allosteric contribution by the apoptosome backbone be excluded or substantiated? <p><text><SENT sid="46301" pm="."><plain>We presume that this point is in reference to work from Hao Wu’s group showing that pc-9 linked to the C-terminus of a sequence that forms a Gcn leucine zipper is not as efficient as the pc-9 apoptosome at activating pc-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46302" pm="."><plain>That is a good point, but the story is complicated since the time course of pc-3 activation is not linear but actually slows significantly as activated caspase-3 accumulates, due to a reaction that mimics classic feedback inhibition by product, but the mechanism remains obscure (Yuan et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46304" pm="."><plain>We decided not to discuss pc-3 activation in great detail in this paper, since the paper focuses on pc-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46305" pm="."><plain>Future work may address this issue. <p><text><SENT sid="46306" pm="."><plain>However, we added a final statement for the paper: “In a subsequent step, the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 dimers may occur either in solution through a collisional process with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains or the reaction may be facilitated by transient interactions with the Apaf-1 platform (Yin et al. 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46308" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments are needed to address this point in light of recent experiments with chimeric platforms that contain N-terminal Apaf-1 CARDs, as these complexes are able to activate procaspase-9 and cleave procaspase-3 efficiently (Hu et al., 2014).” <p><text><SENT sid="46309" pm="."><plain>Also see below. <p><text><SENT sid="46310" pm="."><plain>The authors also briefly touch on and somehow exclude the anti-dogmatic idea that caspase-9 monomers may be activated on the apoptosome backbone.

Would it be possible that both homodimers of active casp-9 can be formed on the apoptosome as well as active monomers? <p><text><SENT sid="46313" pm="."><plain>Of course it is theoretically possible that monomers of pc-9 might be activated on the apoptosome, as well as dimers. To test this idea, we obtained a clone of chimeric Apaf-1 CARD/ClpP molecules from Dr. Yigong Shi, as described below and in the main text of the paper, to investigate this possibility. We undertook this step because we had previously observed a single pc-9 catalytic domain on the platform of the holo-apoptosome and suggested that this might be involved in activation (Yuan et al., 2011). <p><text><SENT sid="46316" pm="."><plain>“[…]heptamers, respectively, are able to activate pc-9 to a similar extent as the Apaf-1 apoptosome using a fluorescence-based proteolysis assay and by monitoring procaspase-3 cleavage (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46317" pm="."><plain>[…] However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that procaspase-3 may interact with Apaf-1 at some point either during or after its activation (Yuan et al., 2011a and references therein).” <p><text><SENT sid="46318" pm="."><plain>The authors should also explain better whether their structural model is consistent with the finding that the apoptosome can act as a molecular timer. <p><text><SENT sid="46319" pm="."><plain>This is a complicated issue, however, we have now addressed this point.

[…] Hence, the turnover of pc-9 at position 8p in the disk would lead to an oscillation in the number of potentially active pc-9 dimers bound to the apoptosome.” <p><text><SENT sid="46323" pm="."><plain>We also added the following point to the preceding paragraph concerning the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. “Moreover, the KCl concentration may affect the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. The lower KCl concentration used in Buffer A, relative to physiological conditions (20 mM versus ~150 mM), may favor electrostatic interactions that predominate at CARD-CARD interfaces. Hence, the transient association of a pc-9 CARD at position 8p may be more favorable in low salt buffer.” <p><text><SENT sid="46326" pm="."><plain>Other than that, data presented in Figure 6D would probably be more convincing if the authors added a repeat in which a binding deficient PC9 was used as a negative control. <p><text><SENT sid="46327" pm="."><plain>A good idea, but there are unfortunately no such mutants known to us, that might not be structurally compromised. Currently, we do not have an accurate enough docking of the catalytic domains to the platform region, due to the low resolution of this feature, to pin-point precise sites for mutation. This is a future goal of course. <p><text><SENT sid="46330" pm="."><plain>Another suggestion is to comment on whether the data on cyt-c integration into the apoptosome and the contact regions (subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding”, fourth paragraph) corresponds to cyt-c residues found to be critical for its proapoptotic potential (see e.g. published studies that compared yeast and human cyt-c). <p><text><SENT sid="46331" pm="."><plain>Given the more limited α-helical resolution in this region of the map, we felt that space in the manuscript should be used to address other issues. However, we cite studies on cytochrome c and comment: “In total, 7 lysines from cytochrome c are found in these contact regions that include: lysines 25, 27, 39, 55, 72, 73 and 79 (also see Yu et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46333" pm="."><plain>However, higher resolution will be needed to pin down the precise nature of the interactions (also see mutation studies in Zhou et al., 2015).” <p><text><SENT sid="46334" pm="."><plain>5) The authors' structure of the platform of the pc-9 bound apoptosome and the unbound apoptosome recently reported by Zhou et al. 2015 is nearly identical (with the exception of the nucleotide orientation and whether Mg++ ions are involved in nucleotide binding), and for the most part the conclusions on the roles of cytochrome c and nucleotide binding in the formation of the apoptosome corroborate the findings of Zhou et.al. (2015). <p><text><SENT sid="46337" pm="."><plain>We concur that the general structure of the Apaf-1 platform for ground state and active apoptosomes is very similar, as reflected in the rmsd between the two platforms, and as predicted by our earlier work (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46338" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this is an important point and also provides a benchmark for the methodology. <p><text><SENT sid="46339" pm="."><plain>Perhaps more interesting is the increased resolution (~5.8 Angstroms) of the APAF-1:caspase-9 CARD disk and the confirmation of a previously postulated interaction of at least one catalytic caspase-9 P20/P10 dimer bound to the NBD ring of the central hub (Yuan et al. 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46341" pm="."><plain>Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. 2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. 2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is "parked" on the hub. However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9. <p><text><SENT sid="46349" pm="."><plain>We agree with most of the comments above, but one has to also take into account the large body of data showing that all other caspases are active as dimers. Please see our second reply to point 4 above. Hence, at this stage, the most parsimonious model would be that flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains probably form dimers. Unfortunately, the resolution of the parked pc-9 p20/p10 domains does not allow us to discern whether it is in an active or inactive conformation and its lower resolution is consistent with it also being rather dynamic, coming on and off the central hub. <p><text><SENT sid="46353" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Hu et al. 2015 identified mutations in APAF-1, K58E/K62E which are not found in any of the CARD:CARD interfaces and do not disturb apoptosome formation or recruitment of caspase-9, but severely interfere with the activity of the bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46355" pm="."><plain>This suggests an allosteric mechanism exists for increased activation of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46356" pm="."><plain>The author's only comment is that these mutations may affect binding of the CARD disc to the NBD hub. It would be helpful if they could elaborate on that further. <p><text><SENT sid="46358" pm="."><plain>Please note that K58E/K62E mutations are located on the bottom surface of the CARD disk and are not positioned where they could interact with pc-9 catalytic domains. We have now clarified this point in the paper. <p><text><SENT sid="46360" pm="."><plain>“Two additional Apaf-1 CARD mutations (K58E, K62E) were found to greatly diminish pc-9 activation and occur outside of interfaces I and II (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46361" pm="."><plain>[…] However, these two point mutations suggest that proper disk formation may be a pre-requisite for proper activation of pc-9 zymogens.” <p><text><SENT sid="46362" pm="."><plain>Other specific points: <p><text><SENT sid="46363" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – a list of residues potentially involved in lateral interactions in the central hub are listed. Are these based solely on the EM density? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46365" pm="."><plain>If so, the density should be included in a figure. Has mutagenesis been performed on these residues, or is there evidence of co-evolutionary variance to support these claims? <p><text><SENT sid="46367" pm="."><plain>Apaf-1 like molecules that may form a similar heptameric ring are restricted to vertebrates with the level of identity being very high, 55% in zebra fish to 87% and higher in other vertebrates. Hence, this approach is not particularly enlightening, and there is no space in the paper to go into a more detailed analysis. Please note that we point out possible interactions that are present as a guide, no systematic mutations have been made in Apaf-1, although now with this structure and that from Zhou et al., 2015 in hand, this would be possible. However, the process is fairly laborious with the protein being made in insect cells from a baculovirus. <p><text><SENT sid="46371" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – some of the distances shown in Figure 3G and H are almost 5 Angstroms, which is beyond the range of hydrogen bonding. Due to the limited resolution of this region, it's possible that the modeling is inaccurate, so again, is there any other biochemical evidence supporting the role of the listed residues in stabilizing this region? <p><text><SENT sid="46373" pm="."><plain>A good point, however something is holding this critical interfacial region together. We have rephrased the text as follows: <p><text><SENT sid="46375" pm="."><plain>“This surface is formed in part by possible interactions between Ser356 and Ser358 in the HD1-WHD loop to Asp271 and Ser272 in an extended region, which follows strand β4 in the NBD (Figures 3G, H; Figure 2—figure supplement 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46376" pm="."><plain>However, some of these interactions are in the 4.5-5 Å range and thus, could be mediated in part by water molecules that have not been resolved.” <p><text><SENT sid="46377" pm="."><plain>Also added to legend Figure 3 &gt; “Possible interactions are indicated by dashed lines.” <p><text><SENT sid="46378" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – The density described for the pi-cation interaction is questionable, if the authors want to include this statement, the density for this region should be shown in a figure. <p><text><SENT sid="46379" pm="."><plain>We have deleted this minor point from the paper. <p><text><SENT sid="46380" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The authors state that all α-helices in cytochrome c are resolved. While the subunit can be unambiguously docked into the density, sausage-like densities that are consistent with α helices resolved to 6 Å resolution are not present. <p><text><SENT sid="46382" pm="."><plain>Cytochrome c in the sensor domain may not be at 6A resolution, but individual helices are visible in the map at higher thresholds (e.g. 7.0 rmsd in Coot). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46383" pm="."><plain>At this threshold, some flexible regions of cyt c are outside the density envelope, but all helices are enclosed in connected rods. <p><text><SENT sid="46384" pm="."><plain>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The interpretation of side-chain interactions based on docked crystal structures is appropriate, but discussion of visible Trp844 side chain density in a region where α helical densities are not discernible is over-interpretation. <p><text><SENT sid="46385" pm="."><plain>As noted above α-helices are resolved in cytochrome c, however we modified this statement: “In addition, a strong density at the base of the V-shaped cleft may arise from a tryptophan (Trp844) in the 7-blade β-propeller. Two lysine residues from cytochrome c (Lys72 and Lys79) are also present in this region.” <p><text><SENT sid="46387" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is a reasonable statement, given that there is no other logical explanation for this density in the map. <p><text><SENT sid="46388" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The CARD disk” – The authors mention that linker densities are visible, but the data is not shown. The symmetry mismatch in this region is a particularly interesting aspect of the manuscript, and the details of these linkers are relevant to understanding the mismatch – these linker densities should be shown. <p><text><SENT sid="46390" pm="."><plain>We realize that this is a particularly interesting aspect of the structure, but the current resolution and perhaps an inherent flexibility, precluded us from trying to build linker models. However, we have now used the SEGGER tool in Chimera to extract the 4 Apaf-1 CARD-NBD linkers and these linkers are now clearly shown in Figures 7A and 7B. <p><text><SENT sid="46392" pm="."><plain>Despite their flexibility, is there any evidence of linker density for the linkers to the unassociated CARDs? <p><text><SENT sid="46393" pm="."><plain>There is no obvious density for the flexibly-attached CARDs. <p><text><SENT sid="46394" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – Concerning the localization of the pc-9 catalytic domain – the authors' statement that EMAN2 uses a "density based approach in real space" needs further explanation.

<SENT sid="46396" pm="?"><plain>How is it different from other processing packages? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46397" pm="."><plain>The difference between the approach used in EMAN2 and RELION is not clear. <p><text><SENT sid="46398" pm="."><plain>EMAN2 uses a real space cross-correlation approach in projection matching but as described below, a critical step is the supervised 3D classification, which allows one to identify particles with bound pc-9 catalytic domains, and these particles are then refined to obtain a structure. I think that the questions of differences between EMAN2 and Relion in analyzing this type of very difficult problem, are beyond the space restraints for the paper, and in fact we’d need to have Steve Ludtke and Sjors Scheres debate this head to head! </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46400" pm="."><plain>My understanding is that the real space method is a bit more sensitive to lower resolution features, while Fourier space Methods implemented in Relion are optimized to focus on higher resolution features. I would note however, that it recently became clear to us that there is a way to do a 3d autorefine in Relion that uses two or more models, to in effect carry out a supervised 3D classification. We have not processed our data with this approach in Relion, nor have we tried limiting the resolution of the particles through a strong low pass filter. <p><text><SENT sid="46403" pm="."><plain>Notably, a full description of the pc-9 processing is completely missing from the Methods section. <p><text><SENT sid="46404" pm="."><plain>We have added the following paragraph to Methods for the data processing with c1 symmetry that produced a map with bound pc-9 catalytic domains, as had been observed previously in Yuan et al., 2011. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46411" pm="."><plain>However, density for the bound pc-9 catalytic domains was not resolved at α-helical resolution presumably due to local flexibility.” This point is also made in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “The CARD disk”. <p><text><SENT sid="46412" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – How was alignment of composite map into the C1-symmetric pc-9-containing reconstruction performed? <p><text><SENT sid="46413" pm="."><plain>By cross-correlation in Chimera <p><text><SENT sid="46414" pm="."><plain>Is the cross correlation of this docked register substantially better than if it is docked into neighboring registers? <p><text><SENT sid="46415" pm="."><plain>The cross correlation is better for the position discussed in the paper (0.9126) versus 5 others which ranged from 0.900-0.904, while an adjacent position was nearly the same at 0.9122. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46416" pm="."><plain>We have clarified this point now in the paper.

This may prove to be important when we dissect further the mechanism of pc-9 activation and procaspase-3 feedback inhibition, but there is no space to go into this at this stage of the work. However, we have amended the text as follows. <p><text><SENT sid="46424" pm="."><plain>“Our analysis further suggests that the acentric position of the disk may create the binding site for pc-9 catalytic domains.
