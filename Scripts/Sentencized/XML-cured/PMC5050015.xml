</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="45577" pm="."><plain>Programmed cell death occurs during tissue development and homeostasis to remove superfluous cells or alternatively, during disease states to remove damaged or rapidly dividing cells (Song and Stellar, 1999; Salvesen and Dixit, 1997; Green and Evan, 2002; Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004; Thompson, 1995). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45578" pm="."><plain>In general, this process allows cellular components to be recycled without activating inflammatory pathways (Green and Evan, 2002; Inohara and Nuñez, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45579" pm="."><plain>In humans, intrinsic cell death signals converge on mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic factors through outer membrane pores formed by Bcl-2 family members (Brunelle and Letai, 2009; Tait and Green, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45580" pm="."><plain>These factors include cytochrome c, which up-regulates assembly of the Apoptotic protease activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apoptosome (Li et al., 1997). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45581" pm="."><plain>Other released factors, such as Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 (reviewed in Tait and Green, 2010), are pro-apoptotic and interact with inhibitory proteins to unblock procaspases –9, –3 and –7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45582" pm="."><plain>This multi-pronged pathway allows activation of procaspase-9 on the apoptosome and subsequent proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 and –7, which results in selective proteolysis of target proteins and cell death (Bratton and Salvesen, 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45583" pm="."><plain>Apaf-1 is a member of the AAA+ ATPase family, has seven domains and exists as an inactive monomer in the cytoplasm of healthy cells (Danot et al., 2009; Leipe et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45584" pm="."><plain>When released, cytochrome c binds to β-propellers in Apaf-1 and may trigger nucleotide exchange with ATP/dATP replacing bound ADP/dADP (Liu et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997; Zou et al., 1997, 1999; Hu et al., 1998, 1999). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45585" pm="."><plain>This leads to the assembly of a heptameric apoptosome (Acehan et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45586" pm="."><plain>Caspase recognition domains (CARDs) are present as N-terminal effector domains in both Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (pc-9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45587" pm="."><plain>Thus, CARD-CARD interactions target inactive pc-9 monomers to the apoptosome (Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45588" pm="."><plain>During this step, a CARD 'disk' is formed that sits above the central hub, and is attached by linkers to the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) (Yuan et al., 2010, 2011a, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45589" pm="."><plain>The nature of the disk is not known but a recent hypothetical model suggests that two CARD-CARD interfaces may be used to form a quasi-helical stack, akin to structures in Death Domain complexes (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45590" pm="."><plain>Local proximity of procaspase-9 monomers on the apoptosome leads to protease activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45591" pm="."><plain>However, the precise mechanism of pc-9 activation after recruitment to the apoptosome is still being debated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45592" pm="."><plain>Catalytic domains may associate in solution or they may interact with the apoptosome to form an active protease (Yuan et al., 2011a, Bratton and Salvesen, 2010; Boatright et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2014; Würstle and Rehm, 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45593" pm="."><plain>We now present a near atomic structure of the active human apoptosome determined with cryo-EM at a global resolution of ~4.1 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45594" pm="."><plain>This work provides a model of Apaf-1 in an extended conformation with bound dATP and shows monomer interactions within the apoptosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45595" pm="."><plain>Improved clarity reveals interactions of cytochrome c with β-propellers in the V-shaped sensor domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45596" pm="."><plain>For the first time, molecular details are provided of a tilted, acentric disk formed by N-terminal CARDs from four Apaf-1 and three or four pc-9 molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45597" pm="."><plain>In brief, the disk contains four pairs of Apaf-1/pc-9 CARDs in one turn of a spiral with the fourth pc-9 CARD being present at lower occupancy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45598" pm="."><plain>This arrangement creates a mismatch between the CARD spiral in the disk and the c7 symmetry of the platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45599" pm="."><plain>We also verified that a pc-9 catalytic domain may be parked on the central hub (Yuan et al., 2011a), adjacent to a pc-9 CARD in the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45600" pm="."><plain>In addition, three Apaf-1 CARDs are excluded from the disk but may retain a limited ability to bind pc-9 molecules, depending upon steric constraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45601" pm="."><plain>Stoichiometry measurements have suggested that 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be recruited by Apaf-1 CARDs on the apoptosome (Malladi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45602" pm="."><plain>Hence, at any instant one or two pc-9 dimers may be tethered to the apoptosome. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45967" pm="."><plain>We suggest that cytochrome c binding is a pre-requisite for nucleotide exchange during assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45968" pm="."><plain>In particular, we observed a significant band shift and aggregation of Apaf-1 on native gels when cytochrome c was added, while similar changes could not be detected when dATP was added in a separate reaction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45969" pm="."><plain>Conformational changes due to cytochrome c binding may involve a small rotation of the 8-blade β-propeller and the supporting four α-helices of HD2, along with a much larger rotation of the 7-blade β-propeller about the base of the HD2 arm, to form the appropriate contact surface within the V-shaped sensor region for cytochrome c (Yuan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45970" pm="."><plain>During this reaction, the NBD-HD1 pair must begin to rotate away from the 7-blade β-propeller to avoid a clash, while allowing nucleotide exchange. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="45974" pm="."><plain>In the absence of nucleotide exchange, binding by cytochrome c leads to a local conformational change (or alternatively to a change in the dynamics of the closed form) and subsequent aggregation of Apaf-1 molecules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45975" pm="."><plain>The low intrinsic ATPase activity of Apaf-1 (~4–5 ATP per Apaf-1/hr) is probably not required for assembly per se (Reubold et al., 2009), as exchange of bound ADP/dADP for a nucleotide triphosphate (dATP, ATP or even GTP at 1 mM) is all that is required to promote conformational changes that drive assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45976" pm="."><plain>Near atomic structures of Apaf-1 monomers (Riedl et al., 2005; Reubold et al., 2011) and the apoptosome (Zhou et al., 2015; this work) suggest that the molecule has diverged from the canonical architecture of AAA+ ATPases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45977" pm="."><plain>This includes the 'loss' of a stable binding site for a Mg+2 ion adjacent to the γ-phosphate of dATP/ATP, which greatly diminishes the intrinsic ATPase activity of the monomer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45978" pm="."><plain>However, as Apaf-1 folds during translation or shortly thereafter, the protein may bind adenine nucleotide diphosphate or adenine nucleotide triphosphate, as both are present in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45979" pm="."><plain>If nucleotide diphosphate is bound, then Apaf-1 will be locked into a closed conformation, until cytochrome c is released from mitochondria in response to intrinsic cell death signals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="45980" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, if newly synthesized Apaf-1 binds a nucleotide triphosphate then a limited hydrolysis activity would ensure that the molecule adopts a closed, inactive conformation to prevent aggregation or further assembly into the cell death machine. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="45983" pm="."><plain>We also find that pc-9 is able to interact with Apaf-1 to form a 1:1 complex and this step is mediated by CARD-CARD interactions. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46012" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, tethered pc-9 catalytic domains may bind directly to the platform and/or the disk and be activated (Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46013" pm="."><plain>Recent computational modeling favors an allosteric mechanism wherein pc-9 catalytic domains bind to the apoptosome, but could not differentiate between monomers or dimers as the active species (Würstle and Rehm, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46014" pm="."><plain>However, recent experiments have shown that chimeric Apaf-1 CARD/ClpP or Apaf-1 CARD/GroEl complexes, which are thought to form ClpP and GroEl heptamers, respectively, are able to activate pc-9 to a similar extent as the Apaf-1 apoptosome using a fluorescence-based proteolysis assay and by monitoring procaspase-3 cleavage (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46015" pm="."><plain>We have verified this remarkable observation for pc-9 added to chimeric ClpP molecules with N-terminal Apaf-1 CARDs (not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46016" pm="."><plain>When taken together, this data would argue against an activation mechanism that requires binding of pc-9 catalytic domains to the central hub formed by Apaf-1 molecules, since this region does not exist in chimeric complexes. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46018" pm="."><plain>However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that procaspase-3 may interact with Apaf-1 at some point either during or after its activation (Yuan et al., 2011a and references therein). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46019" pm="."><plain>Our structure of an active apoptosome provides additional insights into the mechanism of pc-9 activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46020" pm="."><plain>One constraint is provided by stoichiometry measurements, which indicate that a range of 2 to 5 pc-9 molecules may be bound to the apoptosome (Malladi et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2011a; Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46021" pm="."><plain>In line with this data, our structure suggests that 3 or 4 pc-9 molecules may be tethered to the disk through CARD-CARD interactions, with the caveat that a pc-9 molecule might also interact with Apaf-1 CARDs that are excluded from the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46022" pm="."><plain>We also identified density in some particles for catalytic domains from a single pc-9 that are 'parked' on the NBD ring of the central hub (this work, Yuan et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46023" pm="."><plain>The two 'most favored' positions for parked pc-9 catalytic domains are next to the pc-9 CARD at position 2p in the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46024" pm="."><plain>Our analysis further suggests that the acentric position of the disk may create the binding site for pc-9 catalytic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46025" pm="."><plain>However, it is unlikely that adjacent parking sites would be occupied at the same time due to steric restraints. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46026" pm="."><plain>One implication of this finding is that parked catalytic domains could be attached to pc-9 CARDs located at all possible positions in the disk, due to the length of the CARD-p20 linker. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46027" pm="."><plain>Hence, the most favored parking sites are generally available to all four pc-9 molecules that may be tethered to the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46028" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that parked pc-9 catalytic domains may be held in reserve when an odd number of zymogens are bound to the apoptosome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46029" pm="."><plain>This in turn, may prevent entanglement of linkers between parked pc-9 catalytic domains and flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers anchored to the disk, with the latter representing active proteolytic centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46030" pm="."><plain>There is no ordered density in our map for other pc-9 catalytic domains, and these domains can be released by a single clip in the CARD-p20 linker (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46031" pm="."><plain>Thus, we surmise that the remaining pc-9 catalytic domains are flexibly-tethered to the disk through CARD-p20 linkers. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46032" pm="."><plain>We propose that the active apoptosome is a dynamic proteolytic machine with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains, whose nature may depend upon the number of pc-9 molecules that are bound at any instant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46033" pm="."><plain>For example, a flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimer may form when three pc-9 molecules are anchored to form a 7 CARD disk, with the pc-9 catalytic domains that are odd man out occupying a parking spot on the central hub (Figure 9, left). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46034" pm="."><plain>However, if four pc-9 molecules are bound to the apoptosome they may form an 8-CARD disk with two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers, while leaving open parking spots on the central hub (Figure 9, right). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46035" pm="."><plain>By extension, if 5 pc-9 molecules were bound to the apoptosome then one pc-9 molecule might interact with an Apaf-1 CARD that is not incorporated into the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46036" pm="."><plain>In this case, two flexibly-tethered pc-9 dimers may be formed on the apoptosome with an 8 CARD disk and a parked p20/p10 domain would also be present (e.g. Figure 8—figure supplement 1B,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46037" pm="."><plain>Since the pc-9 CARD at position 8p in the disk is present at lower occupancy, it is clear that active apoptosomes with three bound pc-9 molecules were formed with a higher likelihood under our in vitro conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46038" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the high protein concentration in our experiments may have aided the formation of an 8 CARD disk in particles with four pc-9 molecules, whereas apoptosomes with a 7 CARD disk and three pc-9 molecules may be favored in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46039" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the KCl concentration may affect the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46040" pm="."><plain>The lower KCl concentration used in Buffer A, relative to physiological conditions (20 mM versus ~150 mM), may favor electrostatic interactions that predominate at CARD-CARD interfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46041" pm="."><plain>Hence, the transient association of a pc-9 CARD at position 8p may be more favorable in low salt buffer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46042" pm="."><plain>Also note that it remains an open question whether each putative pc-9 dimer on the active apoptosome may contain one (Renatus et al., 2001) or possibly two active sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46043" pm="."><plain>Activation of pc-9 on the apoptosome has been proposed to follow the dictates of a molecular timer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46044" pm="."><plain>In this model, auto-processing of pc-9 on the apoptosome triggers activation and subsequent release via exchange with unprocessed pc-9 in solution (Malladi et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46045" pm="."><plain>The rapid nature of the auto-proteolysis reaction suggests that two-chain pc-9 molecules, as used in our structure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), may account for most of the activity towards procaspase-3 (Malladi et al., 2009; Hu et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46046" pm="."><plain>Since there is no uncleaved pc-9 in our assembly reaction, we are not able to comment directly on the proposed turnover of pc-9 in the molecular timer hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46047" pm="."><plain>However, the disposition of pc-9 on the apoptosome is similar for both unprocessed and cleaved pc-9 molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46048" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a 3D map of apoptosomes with bound pc-9 CARDs, made by thrombinolysis of a single chain pc-9 with a triple point mutation (E306A/D315A/D330A), also showed the disk, while flexibly-tethered catalytic domains were released from the complexes (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46049" pm="."><plain>Our structure of the active apoptosome suggests that flexibly-bound pc-9 catalytic domains are probably not able to affect the stability of the CARD-CARD disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46050" pm="."><plain>However, parked p20/p10 subunits of pc-9 could exert some effect on disk stability, to modulate the binding and release of pc-9, although this is speculative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46051" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, pc-9 CARDs are located on the top surface of the disk, which would provide a route for pc-9 molecules to dis-associate from the complex, such as occurs at position 8p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46052" pm="."><plain>This step would down-regulate apoptosome activity until a replacement pc-9 is bound from solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46053" pm="."><plain>The major variable in evaluating possible turnover of bound pc-9 molecules is the overall stability of the CARD disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46054" pm="."><plain>Given the multiple interactions of pc-9 CARDs in positions 2p, 4p, and 6p, it appears that a CARD at position 8p will be the most likely to exchange, as observed in our analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46055" pm="."><plain>Hence, the turnover of pc-9 at position 8p in the disk would lead to an oscillation in the number of potentially active pc-9 dimers bound to the apoptosome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46056" pm="."><plain>Finally, pc-9 molecules with shortened CARD-p20 linkers are not activated on the apoptosome as readily as wild type pc-9 (Yuan et al., 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46057" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the CARD-p20 linker may facilitate pc-9 activation by providing a suitable spacer between CARDs in the disk and the catalytic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46058" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the requirement for a somewhat longer spacer may reflect the disposition of the four pc-9 CARD binding sites on the disk. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46059" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the CARD-p20 linker may also stabilize the pc-9 dimer when it is formed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46060" pm="."><plain>In either case, a single clip in the linker releases the catalytic (p20/p10) domains from the apoptosome and results in a complete loss of proteolytic activity (Yuan et al., 2010, 2011a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46061" pm="."><plain>This argues that putative pc-9 dimers are only stable when present at a high local concentration on the apoptosome. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46062" pm="."><plain>In summary, our structure of an active apoptosome suggests that most complexes will contain one (or possibly two) pc-9 dimers, which may be responsible for proteolytic activity and initiation of a cell death cascade. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46063" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent step, the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 dimers may occur either in solution through a collisional process with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains or the reaction may be facilitated by transient interactions with the Apaf-1 platform (Yin et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46064" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments are needed to address this point in light of recent experiments with chimeric platforms that contain N-terminal Apaf-1 CARDs, as these complexes are able to activate procaspase-9 and cleave procaspase-3 efficiently (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46205" pm="."><plain>Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46206" pm="."><plain>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gabriel C Lander (Reviewer #2). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46208" pm="."><plain>Summary: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46209" pm="."><plain>Cheng et al. present the molecular architecture of the active form of the human apoptosome, based on a number of focused cryo-EM reconstructions that were determined from a single dataset. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46210" pm="."><plain>Using this structure, the authors describe the putative interactions that drive oligomerization of Apaf-1, the interaction cytochrome c with the sensor domain, and the spiraling CARD disk at the center of the apoptosome, which interestingly involves association of only 4 of the 7 CARDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46211" pm="."><plain>This new structure is coupled with prior apoptosome structures, as well as with native gradient gels to present a model for oligomerization, wherein cytochrome c binding induces conformational rearrangements that allow for nucleotide exchange and apoptosome assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46212" pm="."><plain>The work of the authors significantly extends beyond their prior contributions to the analysis of the intricacies of apoptosome formation, and their model also provides novel insight into how caspase-9 may be activated on this signalling platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46213" pm="."><plain>The work also complements recent structural studies published by their international peers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46214" pm="."><plain>One of the most striking findings of the authors is that their structural information might explain the current contradiction of how a supposedly heptavalent platform for caspase-9 activation is providing only a low number of active caspase-9 sites. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46215" pm="."><plain>Overall the cryoEM analysis is well-done, and the authors show great expertise in their treatment of the data, using focused classification and other advanced image processing techniques to improve the resolution of disordered or flexible regions of the apoptosome complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46216" pm="."><plain>The overall quality of the density is consistent with the interpretation presented in the manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46217" pm="."><plain>Essential revisions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46218" pm="?"><plain>1) The "global" resolution is stated to be at 4.1 Angstroms resolution, yet a soft 3D mask was applied for this estimation – was this mask generated automatically, or manually, and more importantly, did this mask include the disordered sensor domains or CARD disk? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46219" pm="."><plain>If any structural features were cropped through the masking, then the reported "global" resolution is misleading. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46220" pm="."><plain>2) The Resmap software is widely used by the EM community estimate local resolutions due to its ease of use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46221" pm="."><plain>However, this software has repeatedly been shown to over-estimate resolutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46222" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the Resmap output with a similar program available in the Bsoft package is encouraged to ensure that the resolution claims are seen to be credible with map quality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46223" pm="."><plain>3) The PDB map associated with the combined EM density was generated by rigid body fitting previously determined crystal structures into the density, and these atomic models were refined into the density using a combination of MDFF and Phenix. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46224" pm="."><plain>For regions where side-chain densities are not clearly visible, the authors should limit the deposition to a C-α trace of the backbone. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46225" pm="."><plain>4) Previous studies have shown that caspase-9 dimer activities towards procaspase-3 differ substantially from caspase-9 activities on apoptosomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46226" pm="?"><plain>Can the structural model explain this phenomenon? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46227" pm="?"><plain>In particular, can an allosteric contribution by the apoptosome backbone be excluded or substantiated? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46228" pm="."><plain>The authors also briefly touch on and somehow exclude the anti-dogmatic idea that caspase-9 monomers may be activated on the apoptosome backbone. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46229" pm="."><plain>It is not clear to me why that idea is or can be refuted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46230" pm="?"><plain>Would it be possible that both homodimers of active casp-9 can be formed on the apoptosome as well as active monomers? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46231" pm="."><plain>The authors should also explain better whether their structural model is consistent with the finding that the apoptosome can act as a molecular timer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46232" pm="."><plain>Other than that, data presented in Figure 6D would probably be more convincing if the authors added a repeat in which a binding deficient PC9 was used as a negative control. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46233" pm="."><plain>Another suggestion is to comment on whether the data on cyt-c integration into the apoptosome and the contact regions (subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding”, fourth paragraph) corresponds to cyt-c residues found to be critical for its proapoptotic potential (see e.g. published studies that compared yeast and human cyt-c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46234" pm="."><plain>5) The authors' structure of the platform of the pc-9 bound apoptosome and the unbound apoptosome recently reported by Zhou et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46235" pm="."><plain>2015 is nearly identical (with the exception of the nucleotide orientation and whether Mg++ ions are involved in nucleotide binding), and for the most part the conclusions on the roles of cytochrome c and nucleotide binding in the formation of the apoptosome corroborate the findings of Zhou et.al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46236" pm="."><plain>(2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46237" pm="."><plain>Perhaps more interesting is the increased resolution (~5.8 Angstroms) of the APAF-1:caspase-9 CARD disk and the confirmation of a previously postulated interaction of at least one catalytic caspase-9 P20/P10 dimer bound to the NBD ring of the central hub (Yuan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46238" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46239" pm="."><plain>Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46240" pm="."><plain>2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46241" pm="."><plain>The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46242" pm="."><plain>Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46243" pm="."><plain>2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46244" pm="."><plain>With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46245" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is "parked" on the hub. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46246" pm="."><plain>However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46247" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Hu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46248" pm="."><plain>2015 identified mutations in APAF-1, K58E/K62E which are not found in any of the CARD:CARD interfaces and do not disturb apoptosome formation or recruitment of caspase-9, but severely interfere with the activity of the bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46249" pm="."><plain>This suggests an allosteric mechanism exists for increased activation of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46250" pm="."><plain>The author's only comment is that these mutations may affect binding of the CARD disc to the NBD hub. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46251" pm="."><plain>It would be helpful if they could elaborate on that further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46252" pm="."><plain>Other specific points: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46253" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – a list of residues potentially involved in lateral interactions in the central hub are listed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46254" pm="?"><plain>Are these based solely on the EM density? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46255" pm="."><plain>If so, the density should be included in a figure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46256" pm="?"><plain>Has mutagenesis been performed on these residues, or is there evidence of co-evolutionary variance to support these claims? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46257" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – some of the distances shown in Figure 3G &amp; H are almost 5 Angstroms, which is beyond the range of hydrogen bonding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46258" pm="?"><plain>Due to the limited resolution of this region, it's possible that the modeling is inaccurate, so again, is there any other biochemical evidence supporting the role of the listed residues in stabilizing this region? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46259" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – The density described for the pi-cation interaction is questionable, if the authors want to include this statement, the density for this region should be shown in a figure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46260" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The authors state that all α-helices in cytochrome c are resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46261" pm="."><plain>While the subunit can be unambiguously docked into the density, sausage-like densities that are consistent with α helices resolved to 6 Å resolution are not present. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46262" pm="."><plain>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The interpretation of side-chain interactions based on docked crystal structures is appropriate, but discussion of visible Trp844 side chain density in a region where α helical densities are not discernible is over-interpretation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46263" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The CARD disk” – The authors mention that linker densities are visible, but the data is not shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46264" pm="."><plain>The symmetry mismatch in this region is a particularly interesting aspect of the manuscript, and the details of these linkers are relevant to understanding the mismatch – these linker densities should be shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46265" pm="?"><plain>Despite their flexibility, is there any evidence of linker density for the linkers to the unassociated CARDs? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46266" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – Concerning the localization of the pc-9 catalytic domain – the authors' statement that EMAN2 uses a "density based approach in real space" needs further explanation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46267" pm="?"><plain>Is this simply cross-correlation-based projection matching? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46268" pm="?"><plain>How is it different from other processing packages? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46269" pm="."><plain>The difference between the approach used in EMAN2 and RELION is not clear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46270" pm="."><plain>Notably, a full description of the pc-9 processing is completely missing from the Methods section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46271" pm="?"><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – Why is α-helical resolution reconstruction not shown? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46272" pm="?"><plain>Do the p20 and p10 domains dock in with great accuracy into this reconstruction? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46273" pm="?"><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – How was alignment of composite map into the C1-symmetric pc-9-containing reconstruction performed? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46274" pm="?"><plain>Is the cross correlation of this docked register substantially better than if it is docked into neighboring registers? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46275" pm="."><plain>Due to the speculative nature of this section, it's unclear what this paragraph adds to the manuscript. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46281" pm="."><plain>Please note that the CARD disk has been omitted for clarity in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, because it is rotationally-averaged and featureless at this stage of the analysis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46282" pm="."><plain>2) The Resmap software is widely used by the EM community estimate local resolutions due to its ease of use. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46285" pm="."><plain>We agree with the reviewers’ observation concerning the over-estimation of resolution by ResMap. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46286" pm="."><plain>As stated in the Methods section: “Local resolution was estimated using ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014).” Please note that Resmap results are not presented as absolutes, but rather as a guide to highlight the inherent resolution gradient that is present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46287" pm="."><plain>We have reinforced this point by changing the main text: “As estimated by ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014) the central hub is at a nominal resolution of 3-4 Å, which is supported by the visibility of larger side chains, while the extended arm and peripheral sensor domains are in the range of 4.5-10 Å (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46288" pm="."><plain>3) The PDB map associated with the combined EM density was generated by rigid body fitting previously determined crystal structures into the density, and these atomic models were refined into the density using a combination of MDFF and Phenix. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46290" pm="."><plain>Well this is always a tricky point and in our opinion there is no single correct approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46291" pm="."><plain>Since we have used well defined crystal structures for regions of lower resolution, we feel that side chains should be left in place as a best estimate for that particular local region, and as a courtesy to biologists and structural groups who may use the pdb files in future. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46292" pm="."><plain>In particular, it is clearly indicated in the paper which regions are supported by higher resolution and the map itself serves as a clear guide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46293" pm="."><plain>Side chains can easily be turned off in graphics programs, but having them present as they are found in the crystal structure allows one to more readily understand details of the local fold and packing, that might also apply within the larger ensemble. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46294" pm="."><plain>While contact regions between domains that form novel interactions, such as those between the two β-propellers will differ between the crystal structure and the ensemble, it is still more useful to have the residues present to get a general idea of the chemistry of a local environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46295" pm="."><plain>In addition, side chains help to guide the refinement of the protein backbone into the density with MDFF, so it seems reasonable to leave them in the final pdb file. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46296" pm="."><plain>Another approach would be to have two depositions, one in the Protein Data Bank with rather more strict guidelines pertaining to this issue, and a second repository for models, wherein a slightly more liberal, and in our opinion, more useful deposition can be made. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46297" pm="."><plain>However, for the moment this issue is left at the discretion of the authors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46298" pm="."><plain>4) Previous studies have shown that caspase-9 dimer activities towards procaspase-3 differ substantially from caspase-9 activities on apoptosomes. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46301" pm="."><plain>We presume that this point is in reference to work from Hao Wu’s group showing that pc-9 linked to the C-terminus of a sequence that forms a Gcn leucine zipper is not as efficient as the pc-9 apoptosome at activating pc-3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46302" pm="."><plain>That is a good point, but the story is complicated since the time course of pc-3 activation is not linear but actually slows significantly as activated caspase-3 accumulates, due to a reaction that mimics classic feedback inhibition by product, but the mechanism remains obscure (Yuan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46303" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46304" pm="."><plain>We decided not to discuss pc-3 activation in great detail in this paper, since the paper focuses on pc-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46305" pm="."><plain>Future work may address this issue. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46306" pm="."><plain>However, we added a final statement for the paper: “In a subsequent step, the cleavage and activation of procaspase-3 dimers may occur either in solution through a collisional process with flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains or the reaction may be facilitated by transient interactions with the Apaf-1 platform (Yin et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46307" pm="."><plain>2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46308" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments are needed to address this point in light of recent experiments with chimeric platforms that contain N-terminal Apaf-1 CARDs, as these complexes are able to activate procaspase-9 and cleave procaspase-3 efficiently (Hu et al., 2014).” </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46312" pm="."><plain>Would it be possible that both homodimers of active casp-9 can be formed on the apoptosome as well as active monomers? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46313" pm="."><plain>Of course it is theoretically possible that monomers of pc-9 might be activated on the apoptosome, as well as dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46314" pm="."><plain>To test this idea, we obtained a clone of chimeric Apaf-1 CARD/ClpP molecules from Dr. Yigong Shi, as described below and in the main text of the paper, to investigate this possibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46315" pm="."><plain>We undertook this step because we had previously observed a single pc-9 catalytic domain on the platform of the holo-apoptosome and suggested that this might be involved in activation (Yuan et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46316" pm="."><plain>“[…]heptamers, respectively, are able to activate pc-9 to a similar extent as the Apaf-1 apoptosome using a fluorescence-based proteolysis assay and by monitoring procaspase-3 cleavage (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46317" pm="."><plain>[…] However, these studies do not rule out the possibility that procaspase-3 may interact with Apaf-1 at some point either during or after its activation (Yuan et al., 2011a and references therein).” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46318" pm="."><plain>The authors should also explain better whether their structural model is consistent with the finding that the apoptosome can act as a molecular timer. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46319" pm="."><plain>This is a complicated issue, however, we have now addressed this point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46320" pm="."><plain>The paragraph below has been added to the Discussion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46321" pm="."><plain>“Activation of pc-9 on the apoptosome has been proposed to follow the dictates of a molecular timer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46322" pm="."><plain>[…] Hence, the turnover of pc-9 at position 8p in the disk would lead to an oscillation in the number of potentially active pc-9 dimers bound to the apoptosome.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46323" pm="."><plain>We also added the following point to the preceding paragraph concerning the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. “Moreover, the KCl concentration may affect the stability of the pc-9 CARD at position 8p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46324" pm="."><plain>The lower KCl concentration used in Buffer A, relative to physiological conditions (20 mM versus ~150 mM), may favor electrostatic interactions that predominate at CARD-CARD interfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46325" pm="."><plain>Hence, the transient association of a pc-9 CARD at position 8p may be more favorable in low salt buffer.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46326" pm="."><plain>Other than that, data presented in Figure 6D would probably be more convincing if the authors added a repeat in which a binding deficient PC9 was used as a negative control. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46327" pm="."><plain>A good idea, but there are unfortunately no such mutants known to us, that might not be structurally compromised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46328" pm="."><plain>Currently, we do not have an accurate enough docking of the catalytic domains to the platform region, due to the low resolution of this feature, to pin-point precise sites for mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46329" pm="."><plain>This is a future goal of course. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46330" pm="."><plain>Another suggestion is to comment on whether the data on cyt-c integration into the apoptosome and the contact regions (subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding”, fourth paragraph) corresponds to cyt-c residues found to be critical for its proapoptotic potential (see e.g. published studies that compared yeast and human cyt-c). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46331" pm="."><plain>Given the more limited α-helical resolution in this region of the map, we felt that space in the manuscript should be used to address other issues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46332" pm="."><plain>However, we cite studies on cytochrome c and comment: “In total, 7 lysines from cytochrome c are found in these contact regions that include: lysines 25, 27, 39, 55, 72, 73 and 79 (also see Yu et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46333" pm="."><plain>However, higher resolution will be needed to pin down the precise nature of the interactions (also see mutation studies in Zhou et al., 2015).” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46334" pm="."><plain>5) The authors' structure of the platform of the pc-9 bound apoptosome and the unbound apoptosome recently reported by Zhou et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46335" pm="."><plain>2015 is nearly identical (with the exception of the nucleotide orientation and whether Mg++ ions are involved in nucleotide binding), and for the most part the conclusions on the roles of cytochrome c and nucleotide binding in the formation of the apoptosome corroborate the findings of Zhou et.al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46336" pm="."><plain>(2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46337" pm="."><plain>We concur that the general structure of the Apaf-1 platform for ground state and active apoptosomes is very similar, as reflected in the rmsd between the two platforms, and as predicted by our earlier work (Yuan et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46338" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, this is an important point and also provides a benchmark for the methodology. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46339" pm="."><plain>Perhaps more interesting is the increased resolution (~5.8 Angstroms) of the APAF-1:caspase-9 CARD disk and the confirmation of a previously postulated interaction of at least one catalytic caspase-9 P20/P10 dimer bound to the NBD ring of the central hub (Yuan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46340" pm="."><plain>2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46341" pm="."><plain>Previously, Akey's model of the apoptosome and caspase-9 (mostly from Yuan et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46342" pm="."><plain>2010 and 2013) described the CARDs to be arranged in an acentric disk above the hub of a seven-spoked wheel of the apoptosome platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46343" pm="."><plain>The improved resolution of the disk reveals that it consists of 4 APAF-1 CARDS and 3 to 4 caspase-9 CARDS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46344" pm="."><plain>Also, although their zipper like packing of APAF-1 and caspase-9 CARD domains differs from the crystal structure of the artificially created CARD disk of Hu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46345" pm="."><plain>2014, the author's structure is consistent with the existence of a second interface between the CARDs (dubbed type II interface) reported in that work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46346" pm="."><plain>With one caspase-9 catalytic domain bound to the hub, this leaves the other two catalytic domains flexibly bound, potentially as an active dimer, though there is no evidence to verify this since the dimer is not resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46347" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that their model is consistent with the idea that the hub merely provides a platform for increasing the effective concentration of caspase-9 which drives dimerization and activation and that the caspase-9 catalytic domain is "parked" on the hub. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46348" pm="."><plain>However, their data in no way precludes that an as yet not understood allosteric mechanism accounts for the increased activity of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46349" pm="."><plain>We agree with most of the comments above, but one has to also take into account the large body of data showing that all other caspases are active as dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46350" pm="."><plain>Please see our second reply to point 4 above. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46351" pm="."><plain>Hence, at this stage, the most parsimonious model would be that flexibly-tethered pc-9 catalytic domains probably form dimers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46352" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the resolution of the parked pc-9 p20/p10 domains does not allow us to discern whether it is in an active or inactive conformation and its lower resolution is consistent with it also being rather dynamic, coming on and off the central hub. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46353" pm="."><plain>Indeed, Hu et al. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46354" pm="."><plain>2015 identified mutations in APAF-1, K58E/K62E which are not found in any of the CARD:CARD interfaces and do not disturb apoptosome formation or recruitment of caspase-9, but severely interfere with the activity of the bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46355" pm="."><plain>This suggests an allosteric mechanism exists for increased activation of apoptosome bound caspase-9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46356" pm="."><plain>The author's only comment is that these mutations may affect binding of the CARD disc to the NBD hub. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46357" pm="."><plain>It would be helpful if they could elaborate on that further. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46358" pm="."><plain>Please note that K58E/K62E mutations are located on the bottom surface of the CARD disk and are not positioned where they could interact with pc-9 catalytic domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46359" pm="."><plain>We have now clarified this point in the paper. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46360" pm="."><plain>“Two additional Apaf-1 CARD mutations (K58E, K62E) were found to greatly diminish pc-9 activation and occur outside of interfaces I and II (Hu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46361" pm="."><plain>[…] However, these two point mutations suggest that proper disk formation may be a pre-requisite for proper activation of pc-9 zymogens.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46362" pm="."><plain>Other specific points: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46363" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – a list of residues potentially involved in lateral interactions in the central hub are listed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46364" pm="?"><plain>Are these based solely on the EM density? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46365" pm="."><plain>If so, the density should be included in a figure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46366" pm="."><plain>Has mutagenesis been performed on these residues, or is there evidence of co-evolutionary variance to support these claims? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46367" pm="."><plain>Apaf-1 like molecules that may form a similar heptameric ring are restricted to vertebrates with the level of identity being very high, 55% in zebra fish to 87% and higher in other vertebrates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46368" pm="."><plain>Hence, this approach is not particularly enlightening, and there is no space in the paper to go into a more detailed analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46369" pm="."><plain>Please note that we point out possible interactions that are present as a guide, no systematic mutations have been made in Apaf-1, although now with this structure and that from Zhou et al., 2015 in hand, this would be possible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46370" pm="."><plain>However, the process is fairly laborious with the protein being made in insect cells from a baculovirus. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46371" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – some of the distances shown in Figure 3G and H are almost 5 Angstroms, which is beyond the range of hydrogen bonding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46372" pm="."><plain>Due to the limited resolution of this region, it's possible that the modeling is inaccurate, so again, is there any other biochemical evidence supporting the role of the listed residues in stabilizing this region? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46373" pm="."><plain>A good point, however something is holding this critical interfacial region together. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46374" pm="."><plain>We have rephrased the text as follows: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46375" pm="."><plain>“This surface is formed in part by possible interactions between Ser356 and Ser358 in the HD1-WHD loop to Asp271 and Ser272 in an extended region, which follows strand β4 in the NBD (Figures 3G, H; Figure 2—figure supplement 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46376" pm="."><plain>However, some of these interactions are in the 4.5-5 Å range and thus, could be mediated in part by water molecules that have not been resolved.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46377" pm="."><plain>Also added to legend Figure 3 &gt; “Possible interactions are indicated by dashed lines.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46378" pm="."><plain>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Domain and subunit interactions” – The density described for the pi-cation interaction is questionable, if the authors want to include this statement, the density for this region should be shown in a figure. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46379" pm="."><plain>We have deleted this minor point from the paper. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46380" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The authors state that all α-helices in cytochrome c are resolved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46381" pm="."><plain>While the subunit can be unambiguously docked into the density, sausage-like densities that are consistent with α helices resolved to 6 Å resolution are not present. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46382" pm="."><plain>Cytochrome c in the sensor domain may not be at 6A resolution, but individual helices are visible in the map at higher thresholds (e.g. 7.0 rmsd in Coot). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46383" pm="."><plain>At this threshold, some flexible regions of cyt c are outside the density envelope, but all helices are enclosed in connected rods. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46384" pm="."><plain>In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Sensor β-propellers and cytochrome c binding” – The interpretation of side-chain interactions based on docked crystal structures is appropriate, but discussion of visible Trp844 side chain density in a region where α helical densities are not discernible is over-interpretation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46385" pm="."><plain>As noted above α-helices are resolved in cytochrome c, however we modified this statement: “In addition, a strong density at the base of the V-shaped cleft may arise from a tryptophan (Trp844) in the 7-blade β-propeller. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46386" pm="."><plain>Two lysine residues from cytochrome c (Lys72 and Lys79) are also present in this region.” </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46387" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is a reasonable statement, given that there is no other logical explanation for this density in the map. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46388" pm="."><plain>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The CARD disk” – The authors mention that linker densities are visible, but the data is not shown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46389" pm="."><plain>The symmetry mismatch in this region is a particularly interesting aspect of the manuscript, and the details of these linkers are relevant to understanding the mismatch – these linker densities should be shown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46390" pm="."><plain>We realize that this is a particularly interesting aspect of the structure, but the current resolution and perhaps an inherent flexibility, precluded us from trying to build linker models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46391" pm="."><plain>However, we have now used the SEGGER tool in Chimera to extract the 4 Apaf-1 CARD-NBD linkers and these linkers are now clearly shown in Figures 7A and 7B. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46392" pm="."><plain>Despite their flexibility, is there any evidence of linker density for the linkers to the unassociated CARDs? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46393" pm="."><plain>There is no obvious density for the flexibly-attached CARDs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46394" pm="."><plain>In the first paragraph of the subsection “A pc-9 catalytic domain on the hub” – Concerning the localization of the pc-9 catalytic domain – the authors' statement that EMAN2 uses a "density based approach in real space" needs further explanation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46395" pm="?"><plain>Is this simply cross-correlation-based projection matching? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46396" pm="?"><plain>How is it different from other processing packages? </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="46398" pm="."><plain>EMAN2 uses a real space cross-correlation approach in projection matching but as described below, a critical step is the supervised 3D classification, which allows one to identify particles with bound pc-9 catalytic domains, and these particles are then refined to obtain a structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46399" pm="!"><plain>I think that the questions of differences between EMAN2 and Relion in analyzing this type of very difficult problem, are beyond the space restraints for the paper, and in fact we’d need to have Steve Ludtke and Sjors Scheres debate this head to head! </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46400" pm="."><plain>My understanding is that the real space method is a bit more sensitive to lower resolution features, while Fourier space Methods implemented in Relion are optimized to focus on higher resolution features. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46401" pm="."><plain>I would note however, that it recently became clear to us that there is a way to do a 3d autorefine in Relion that uses two or more models, to in effect carry out a supervised 3D classification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46402" pm="."><plain>We have not processed our data with this approach in Relion, nor have we tried limiting the resolution of the particles through a strong low pass filter. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46416" pm="."><plain>We have clarified this point now in the paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="46417" pm="."><plain>Note that the small range is due to the shared structure of the platform in both maps and the fact that the differences are focused on the tilt and acentric location of the disk. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="46422" pm="."><plain>This may prove to be important when we dissect further the mechanism of pc-9 activation and procaspase-3 feedback inhibition, but there is no space to go into this at this stage of the work. </plain></SENT>
