</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47515" pm="."><plain>Plant associated microbes may present risks of infectious illness for human end consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47516" pm="."><plain>However, many plant-associated microbes may provide benefits for plant cultivation in terms of growth stimulation, insect or microbial resistance, or may simply be neutral passengers 1– 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47517" pm="."><plain>The microbiome of Cannabis leaves and flowers includes bacteria and fungi residing on the exterior surface of these tissues (epiphytes) as well as those residing within the plant tissues (endophytes). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47518" pm="."><plain>While epiphytic microbes may originate from many sources like aerosols, dusts and liquids, or via human contact, endophytes typically gain entry from the rhizosphere via root junctions, and subsequent translocation through the xylem 4, 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47519" pm="."><plain>Considering this and the known impact that the soil and root microbiome has on plant growth and development 6, 7, all sources of microbial inputs, including below ground compartments should be considered important for optimal Cannabis growth and consumer safety 8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47520" pm="."><plain>Studies on the natural Cannabis microbiome have identified several species of culturable endophytic fungi, including Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium copticola (a member of the citrinum section 9) and several Aspergillus species 10, 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47521" pm="."><plain>Similar studies looking at culturable bacterial endophytes identified nearly a dozen isolates from the Bacillus clade and two mycobacteria 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47522" pm="."><plain>Of those Bacillus species, B. subtilis, B. lichenoformis and B. pumilis have been isolated as endophytes and have been shown to be beneficial to growth in other plant species 12– 14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47523" pm="."><plain>Finally, a recent investigation of the fungal microbiome in a number of dispensary-derived Cannabis samples identified numerous species including some toxigenic Penicillia and Aspergilli 15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47524" pm="."><plain>While there have not been any reported cases of Cannabis-related mycotoxin poisoning resulting from Penicillium infections, there have been numerous reported cases of serious or fatal pulmonary Aspergillosis associated with marijuana smoking in immunocompromised patients 16– 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47525" pm="."><plain>A multistate outbreak of Salmonellosis has also been reported 19, 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47526" pm="."><plain>Denver’s Department of Environmental Health has also issued warnings related to Cannabis extracts and Clostridium botulinum 21. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47527" pm="."><plain>State Cannabis markets rely on a patchwork of testing regulations to protect patients and consumers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47528" pm="."><plain>In terms of microbial testing, these vary widely from state to state. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47529" pm="."><plain>States such as Maine, Michigan, and Arizona currently do not impose testing regulations, while several states such as Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Mexico have adopted regulations based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and American Herbal Pharmacopeia (AHP) recommended guidelines 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47530" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the AHP recommends appropriate methods for testing microbial loads be adopted from the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm2006949.htm">http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodScienceResearch/LaboratoryMethods/ucm2006949.htm</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47531" pm="."><plain>State regulators frequently use AHP guidelines to set limits of 10 5 CFU/g for Total Aerobic Bacteria (TAC), 10 4 CFU/g for Total Yeast and Mold (TYM), 10 3 CFU/g for Total Coliform and Enterobacteriaceae and &lt; 1 CFU/g for pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47532" pm="."><plain>The AHP states, “It is important to note that microbial and fungal values do not typically represent pass or fail criteria and recommended limits may require adjustment over time.” New York and Hawaii specify some additional genera for testing such as Aspergillus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Mucor, and Penicillium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47533" pm="."><plain>A few States require that testing laboratories follow the procedures outlined in the USP for microbiological examination of non-sterile products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47534" pm="."><plain>Others allow testing laboratories to choose from a wide variety of technologies designed for the food testing industry. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47535" pm="."><plain>However, there is no peer-reviewed research supporting the effectiveness and validity of any of these protocols for Cannabis microbial testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47536" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no studies to date have examined the impact of beneficial endophytes on the Cannabis microbiome and on microbial testing results. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47845" pm="."><plain>Elevated Cq values due to ribosomal DNA copy number amplification does not seem a likely explanation because the estimated copy numbers of several Aspergillus species are similar to those of other fungi 40, 41. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47846" pm="."><plain>While the presence of spores with a slow germination rate 42 could explain the results on plant material, it does not explain the qPCR result using active cultures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47855" pm="."><plain>Aspergillosis has been reported in numerous immunocompromised patients and, to date accounts for the only clinical reports of fatalities associated with an infectious organism linked to Cannabis consumption 16– 18, 46– 48. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47857" pm="."><plain>Growers may pasteurize Cannabis samples to avoid failing culture-based microbial testing, but Aspergillus spores are pasteurization resistant 50, as are the toxins they produce 51, so pasteurization does not eliminate the potential risk from these organisms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47859" pm="."><plain>Other classified species that failed to grow in some of those samples include Furcaspora eucalypti and Tilletiopsis pallescens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47860" pm="."><plain>Organic growth practices often utilize beneficial bacterial or fungal endophytes 52 to promote crop growth and to enable lower chemical fungicide use. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47861" pm="."><plain>For example, Trichoderma species are known to synthesize β-1,3 gluconases and a chitinase which work synergistically to break down the cell walls of other fungi 53, 54. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47870" pm="."><plain>Quantitative inter-sample comparisons cannot be performed with the sequencing data at present due to the lack of internal controls to help calibrate any pooling or sampling issues throughout the workflow. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47871" pm="."><plain>The qPCR data can be used to estimate inter-sample bacterial or fungal burden but these data do not always resolve to the genus or species level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47872" pm="."><plain>Intra-sample comparisons can nonetheless provide information on the relative proportions of bacterial or fungal species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47873" pm="."><plain>Sampling from BMX cards was straightforward, since it uses a liquid culture medium, but 3M sampling was subject to bias in scraping off colonies from culture plates. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="47877" pm="."><plain>Culture based techniques used to measure the microbial burden and establish safety of Cannabis have several shortcomings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47878" pm="."><plain>States adopt and implement regulations at different tolerance thresholds for bacteria and fungi without specifically detailing standardized methods or coordinating inter-laboratory ring testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47879" pm="."><plain>Yeast and mold counts from the culture-based platforms tested here are confounded by the growth of bacteria - even when antibiotics like chloramphenicol are included. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47880" pm="."><plain>The microbiome in the plant material tested changes radically after culturing, such that the microbes and counts that are finally observed bear little or no resemblance to those of the starting sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47881" pm="."><plain>This represents a classic observer effect, where the act of measuring the microbial composition using these culture-based methods fundamentally changes that composition - which is a well-studied phenomenon known as the “great plate-count anomaly” 62. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47882" pm="."><plain>This is a serious issue, which clearly has implications beyond Cannabis safety testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47883" pm="."><plain>The 3M and BMX platforms tested here are also used widely in the food testing industry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47884" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the most concerning observation is that one of the most regulated of fungal pathogens, Aspergillus - the only microbe to ever be associated with clinical harm concerning cannabis - grows poorly, and is therefore severely under-reported by current culture-based platforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47885" pm="."><plain>The differential growth of other toxigenic fungi, depending on the companion species present, further influences the results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47886" pm="."><plain>Bacterial pathogens are not uncommon, and beneficial bacteria are also capable of influencing the growth or inhibition of other flora. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47887" pm="."><plain>We have demonstrated that molecular testing is capable of accurately quantifying and identifying a wide spectrum of microorganisms present on Cannabis samples, while avoiding false positives due to the presence of bacteria for fungal testing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47888" pm="."><plain>Molecular testing is rapid and is capable of distinguishing between harmful and beneficial microbes – permitting the use of the latter in organic cultivation practices to eliminate the need for reliance on chemical fungicides. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="47968" pm="."><plain>As strong proponents of open science, we engage to provide an objective assessment of the work presented here and to make suggestions aimed at improving the clarity and readability of the present work. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47969" pm="."><plain>The microbiome (the collection of microbial genomes present on an organism or in an environment) has emerged as an additional dimension (in addition to genomic, epigenomic, metabolomic and phenotypic data…) from which one can harness cryptic information that may contribute to a particular biological phenomenon. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47970" pm="."><plain>Novel technical advances have enabled a metagenomic approach in which one can isolate and enumerate bacterial and fungal genus/species from environmental samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47971" pm="."><plain>In their paper, McKernan et al. compare the performance of traditional culture based techniques with commercial qPCR kits in terms of accuracy and ability to detect different types of microbes, with an emphasis on prokaryotic organisms, which was so far underrepresented in previous published work (including a recent F1000 research paper by the same lead author). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47972" pm="."><plain>We support the authors’ work and understand that as pioneers in the Cannabis microbiome space, they are currently laying the foundation on which further development of assays will likely rely strongly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47973" pm="."><plain>As such, much of our comments relate to improving the transparency of their results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47974" pm="."><plain>We pose several questions/comments, which the author may choose to incorporate into updated versions of this paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47975" pm="."><plain>Overall, the paper is very well written and we do not have any editorial suggestions, except for the spelling of Biomerieux, which in one instance requires the accent aigu: “é”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47976" pm="."><plain>Below, please find minor comments, which we would like to authors to consider: We are in agreement with review 1 (Ethan Russo) that the abstract could be improved if word limit permits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47977" pm="."><plain>We particularly think that the concluding statement could incorporate a stronger statement about the application of their approach in the Cannabis industry.A short statement on why the comparison between culture-based platforms and DNA-based detection is relevant (e.g. in “Background”) would be of general interest to the readership.   </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47978" pm="."><plain>Introduction We found the introduction to lack a common thread and rather abruptly “jumps” between the primary objectives of the paper: methodological comparison between different microorganism detection techniques, microbe-microbe interactions and health implications: e.g. in paragraph 1 the authors focus on microbiome-ecological considerations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47979" pm="."><plain>Then again in paragraph 3, they bring up plant-microbe/microbe-microbe interaction although the rest of this paragraph is focus on methodologies.The statement ”…no studies have examined the impact of beneficials…” does not make much sense there. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47980" pm="."><plain>Perhaps the considerations about Trichoderma could be saved for the discussion.Some brief background on the two culture platforms (3M, BMX) would help frame the need for other novel technologies in microbial detection.   Methods As a general comment to all sections from hereon, it would be helpful to have the same sub-headings (as much as possible) logically flow from methods to results and into the discussion points: e.g.   DNA-extraction from plantsPlatform culturingqPCRMetagenomic / sequencing   </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47981" pm="."><plain>(Currently, the last paragraph of the Introduction gives an overview of the methods, the first technique that is mentioned is NGS, then qPCR; in the Methods and Results it is first qPCR and then NGS…) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47982" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned will help disentangle some of the concepts introduced here, and send a clearer message to the readership: why and when to use qPCR/metagenomics instead of conventional approaches. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47983" pm="."><plain>If there is sufficient evidence that the novel approach outperforms the old is another question that seems rather elusive in the current paper. It would be valuable to share some information about their standard curve and how they derived their Cq values of 21 and 26 cycles for TYM and TAC assays respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47984" pm="."><plain>This brings up the point that a more convincing comparison of culture based and qPCR assays need to be provided in order for the readership to assess if/when one should be used over another.It would be useful to share the name of the R package used to undertake the USEARCH OTUs analyses.The authors should consider perhaps using other multivariate statistics than bivariate correlation coefficients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47985" pm="."><plain>Another angle to tackle this is to implement diversity analyses on the microbial community data using either Shannon’s diversity index or some other metric such as alpha- and beta- diversity in each sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47986" pm="?"><plain>While sample size is likely limiting, are there other similarities between samples for common origins? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47987" pm="."><plain>Or grown in similar conditions?Please expand on what you mean by “specificity analysis” and how this was undertaken.   </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47988" pm="."><plain>Results The title of the first section is misleading: “qPCR and colony counts before and after”; i.e. there is no colony count before (refer to above comment about unifying sub-heading in paper sections).Table 1 could be presented in a clearer way: Table description and content (the column headers) are redundant; too much text in the table description; instead of sample nr., give some info in the sample identification (e.g. origin); visually separate TYM and TAC.The presentation of the results (using excel bar plots), while understandable, is not that efficient at presenting the data at hand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47989" pm="."><plain>Without overstepping, we suggest looking at multivariate plots that would be more suited to drive their points home.   </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="47990" pm="?"><plain>Discussion It seems counterintuitive that qPCR, being more sensitive than plating approach, would fail the lowest number of samples out of all approaches: Is the BMX positive bias toward C. botulinum a false positive or is the lack of C. botulinum detection by qPCR a false negative?In that vein, it would be helpful to describe your strategy to assess false positives, i.e. how many negative controls were implemented? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47991" pm="."><plain>Any negative control with botulism?Failure thresholds are subjective in nature, please expand on how the Cq threshold is superior, what microbial load (e.g. ng of DNA) do each of the two Cq thresholds correspond to?We found that while a large and varied bacterial assemblage was identified here, it would be important to note that modern Cannabis such as the 15 samples presented here have likely gone through several genetic and microbiotic bottlenecks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47992" pm="."><plain>A recent paper on the Agave microbiome 1 demonstrates the paucity of the microbiome in domesticated/farmed plants compared to wild relatives, likely due to the pervasive effects of monoculture. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47993" pm="."><plain>While the Cannabis domestication process is convoluted and masked by prohibition, it is likely that the same pattern is observed in Cannabis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47994" pm="."><plain>Characterizing the genetic profiles of Cannabis, along with the microbiome of wild Cannabis accessions will likely yield enhanced inference in terms of the underlying mechanisms related to plant growth and disease tolerance.A larger part of the discussion should be dedicated to the community composition shift before and after culturing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47995" pm="?"><plain>Especially some considerations about the biological relevance of this shift: i.e. are the pathogens that grow on the plate relevant for human health/plant growth considerations? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47996" pm="?"><plain>Or the other way round: are the pathogens detected before culturing relevant for human health/plant growth issues? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47997" pm="."><plain>It would be good to more explicitly separate what the authors think are artifacts caused by different methodologies (community shifts) with biologically relevant phenomena.If the authors found polymorphisms in OTUs, they may want to suggest the application of the Cannabis microbiome to provide higher resolution to clustering exercises in highly related or poly-hybridized Cannabis accessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47998" pm="."><plain>This may also be used to trace the origin of particular dispensary samples to a cultivator or methodology of plant growth as using hydroponics, soil, aquaponics, etc. will likely influence the Cannabis rhizospheres and phyllospheres. While the authors discuss the presence of C. botulinum and Aspergillum spp. in emulsified oils, perhaps addressing the use of extraction technologies such as butane, propane, Nitrogen, CO 2, Rosin tech and its putative impact on the presence of unwanted microorganisms may be a topic of general interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="47999" pm="."><plain>In Canada until recently, only Cannabis flowers were prescribed as medicinal Cannabis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48000" pm="."><plain>This study highlights some drawbacks of using this type of Cannabis for medical purposes, particularly when used in immune-compromised individuals, and indirectly supports the use of Cannabis extracts that can be dosed effectively with minimal risks of exposure to toxicogenic microbes.   </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48001" pm="."><plain>We sincerely hope that the authors will find our review useful and we remain available for further discussion through the F1000 research platform. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48010" pm="."><plain>Since the purpose of the study is to discuss the difference between a qPCR based microbial testing platform with culture based methods the introduction should focus more on discussing this in other industries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48011" pm="."><plain>For example it's becoming well known that only a small percentage of organisms that exist in nature are easily cultured on the most common forms of media used. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="48025" pm="?"><plain>Why those samples were chosen should be discussed. Throughout the results section numbers of samples are discussed but we don't know if those are the same samples or which samples shown in Table 1. For example page 7 paragraph 2: "First, we observed that although  Aspergillus species were present in 15 plant samples (average proportion: 25% of classified reads), they were only detected at low levels in three samples after culturing on either 3M or BMX media (average proportion: 1.1% or 0.4% of classified reads, respectively).". Which 15 plant samples? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48026" pm="?"><plain>This kind of vague reference to samples needs to be corrected and be made more clear.  Page 6, sequence reproducibility: "14 samples". Which samples?  Page 6, paragraph 4: "Pairs of samples from three of the seven growers....". Which detected fungi were commonly found and correlated?  Page 7, Figure 1: Why just discuss 2 and 14? </plain></SENT>
