<SENT sid="48840" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyze a unique viral data set of next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples generated from a human influenza challenge study wherein 17 healthy subjects were inoculated with cell- and egg-passaged virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48841" pm="."><plain>Nasal wash samples collected from 7 of these subjects were successfully deep sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48842" pm="."><plain>From these, we characterized changes in the subjects' viral populations during infection and identified differences between the virus in these samples and the viral stock used to inoculate the subjects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48843" pm="."><plain>We first calculated pairwise genetic distances between the subjects' nasal wash samples, the viral stock, and the influenza virus A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) reference strain used to generate the stock virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48844" pm="."><plain>These distances revealed that considerable viral evolution occurred at various points in the human challenge study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48845" pm="."><plain>Further quantitative analyses indicated that (i) the viral stock contained genetic variants that originated and likely were selected for during the passaging process, (ii) direct intranasal inoculation with the viral stock resulted in a selective bottleneck that reduced nonsynonymous genetic diversity in the viral hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein, and (iii) intrahost viral evolution continued over the course of infection. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="48855" pm="."><plain>Advances in sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to observe, in unprecedented detail, the genetics of viral infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48856" pm="."><plain>In the case of infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses, genetic sequence data have shown that viral pathogen populations within hosts frequently exist as complex populations of many genetically related virions (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48857" pm="."><plain>Studies based on the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data have, in particular, shown that these populations can be highly diverse (3–5) and that they may evolve over the time course of a single infection (5–8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48858" pm="."><plain>A number of studies have specifically focused on characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of influenza A virus (IAV), an important RNA virus with a broad host range and cross-species potential. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48859" pm="."><plain>These studies include ones that characterize IAV evolution across transmission events in attempts to determine the size and type of transmission bottleneck (9–19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48860" pm="."><plain>While some of these studies have focused on the evolutionary dynamics of well-adapted viruses already circulating in these or similar host populations (9–16), others have instead probed the evolutionary dynamics of maladapted viruses in new host populations to determine the adaptive potential of IAV following cross-species viral spillover (17–19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48861" pm="."><plain>The studies that have considered IAVs that are well adapted to their hosts have generally shown that viral populations in recipient hosts are genetically similar to the ones in donor hosts and that they frequently harbor variants that were present at low frequencies in donor hosts (11–13, 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48862" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the between-host transmission dynamics of well-adapted IAVs are characterized by loose bottlenecks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48863" pm="."><plain>The exact size of the bottleneck, however, depends on the route of transmission, as demonstrated in a recent small-mammal study using barcoded virus (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48864" pm="."><plain>Beyond viral evolution during the transmission process, these studies have further indicated that IAV genetic diversity can change over the course of acute infection through either genetic drift or natural selection (9, 10, 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48865" pm="."><plain>However, a general trend of intrahost viral diversification is not apparent in these studies (9, 10, 13). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48866" pm="."><plain>Distinct from these studies, other studies have specifically focused on characterizing the evolutionary dynamics of viral populations during the process of host adaptation, where the virus is to some degree maladapted to the target host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48867" pm="."><plain>The best known of these are the gain-of-function studies involving avian influenza virus adaptation to mammalian hosts via experimental infection of ferrets with avian influenza H5N1 (18, 20, 21), H1N1 (17, 22), or H7N9 (19) virus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48868" pm="."><plain>These studies have generally shown that viral populations in recipient hosts differ from the ones in donor hosts, although they again can contain variants that are present at low frequencies in donor hosts (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48869" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that the between-host transmission dynamics of less well adapted IAVs are instead better characterized by narrow, selective bottlenecks (17, 18), although the size and type of the bottleneck will be affected by the degree of viral maladaptation to the host (17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48870" pm="."><plain>These selective bottlenecks appear to result mainly from strong selection on the hemagglutinin (HA) gene segment of the virus (18, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48871" pm="."><plain>A subset of these studies have further shown that, following the profound reduction in viral genetic diversity during the process of transmission, intrahost IAV populations have the potential to diversify genetically over the course of acute infection (17, 18), although IAV genetic diversification is not apparent in all studies (19). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="48872" pm="."><plain>Here, we analyze a unique data set generated from a human challenge study in which subjects were experimentally inoculated with cell- and egg-passaged IAV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48873" pm="."><plain>Both the viral stock used to inoculate the subjects and serial nasal wash samples collected from the subjects were deep sequenced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48874" pm="."><plain>We first find that the viral stock had accumulated genetic variation during the passaging process, with some variants reaching high frequencies, presumably due to positive selection acting on these variants during the viral preparation process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48875" pm="."><plain>We further find that IAV populations experienced a narrow, selective bottleneck following subject inoculation, similar to what was found in experimental studies with IAVs that were not well adapted to their target hosts (18, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48876" pm="."><plain>In our case, however, and in contrast to some of these studies, we do not find evidence for extensive intrahost viral diversification following infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="48877" pm="."><plain>Instead, we find evidence for continued purifying selection and only limited evolution via de novo mutation, more similar to what was found in studies with well-adapted IAVs. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49101" pm="."><plain>We have here analyzed viral deep sequencing data from nasal wash samples of 7 subjects challenged with human IAV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49102" pm="."><plain>The viral stock used for inoculating the subjects was generated by propagating reference strain A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) sequentially through avian primary chicken kidney cells, embryonated chicken eggs, and GMP Vero cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49103" pm="."><plain>Based on the nonsynonymous mutations that were identified in the viral stock (Table 2) and on the levels of nonsynonymous (relative to synonymous) nucleotide diversity present in the stock (Fig. 4A), it appears that the virus stock was at least in part adapted to the egg and/or tissue environments that it experienced during its preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49104" pm="."><plain>The significant reductions in nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (πN) on the HA and NP gene segments, in the absence of significant reductions in synonymous nucleotide diversity (πS) on any gene segment, are consistent with a selective transmission bottleneck following inoculation (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49105" pm="."><plain>This conclusion was strengthened by the finding that the subjects' first sequenced nasal wash samples were genetically more similar to the reference strain than to the viral stock (Fig. 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49106" pm="."><plain>Over the course of infection, the intrahost viral population continued to undergo purifying selection (Fig. 5), with a tendency to become genetically even closer to the reference strain (Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49107" pm="."><plain>Although a large number of nonstock variants were identified in the nasal wash samples (Fig. 7A), these putative de novo variants did not appear to be subject to strong positive selection and their appearance did not result in rapid intrahost genetic diversification (Fig. 7C). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49108" pm="."><plain>Our observation of apparent adaptation during the preparation of the viral stock is consistent with previous studies showing that certain nucleotide substitutions lead to improved replication in ovo (51–54) or in vitro (44, 55). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49109" pm="."><plain>While these variants can be beneficial in some circumstances, as in the production of vaccines by increasing the yield of virus (51, 54), they may also have unforeseen effects on viral antigenicity and immunogenicity and thus on vaccine efficacy (56, 57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49110" pm="."><plain>In fact, the H156Q variant that was enriched in the viral stock of this experiment affects a major antigenic site (58) and was demonstrated to have contributed to the decreased vaccine efficacy during the 2012-2013 influenza season (43). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49111" pm="."><plain>Our finding of a strong selective bottleneck acting on the HA and NP gene segments is consistent with gain-of-function experimental studies that have characterized the transmission bottleneck of avian-adapted IAV between index and contact ferrets (18, 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49112" pm="."><plain>The selective bottleneck observed in these transmissions led to a sharp reduction of nonsynonymous genetic diversity on the HA gene segment, while genetic diversity on the other gene segments remained intact. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49113" pm="."><plain>In our study, selective forces appeared to act not only on the HA gene segment, but also on the nonsynonymous genetic variation present on the NP gene segment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49114" pm="."><plain>Our study further found that intrahost evolution was dominated by persistent purifying selection, with only limited genetic diversification arising via putative de novo mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49115" pm="."><plain>This stands in contrast to the experimental gain-of-function studies (17, 18), in which rapid genetic diversification of the IAV population occurred following transmission of only a small number of haplotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49116" pm="."><plain>Our study is more consistent in this manner with intrahost evolutionary dynamics observed in studies in which the virus is already well adapted to its host (9, 10, 13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49117" pm="."><plain>Yet, in contrast with our current findings, these studies found transmission bottlenecks to be loose and nonselective. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49118" pm="."><plain>To reconcile the differences between the findings of our study and those from these previous studies, in which the virus is either poorly or well adapted to its host, we can consider an idealized fitness landscape occupied by a viral population (Fig. 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49119" pm="."><plain>In the case of a virus that is poorly adapted to its host, such as an avian IAV in a ferret, the initial viral population occupies an area around a fitness valley (Fig. 8A), with some virions having higher fitness than others in the novel host environment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49120" pm="."><plain>Seeding of this viral population into a contact animal results in a selective bottleneck, with a small number of virions having a major selective advantage over other virions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49121" pm="."><plain>Once this small number of virions has established, the viral population has many further mutational routes available to it to further increase fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49122" pm="."><plain>This leads to rapid intrahost genetic diversification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49123" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for a well-adapted virus, the initial viral population already occupies a fitness peak (Fig. 8B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49124" pm="."><plain>Because there is very little difference in the fitness levels of virions within the population, transmission is characterized by a loose, nonselective bottleneck. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49125" pm="."><plain>Within newly infected hosts, the virus already occupies a fitness plateau, such that most mutations are either deleterious or neutral. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49126" pm="."><plain>As a result, little intrahost viral genetic diversification occurs, and evolution will be dominated by purifying selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49127" pm="."><plain>In our study, the virus is generally well adapted to humans but contains variants that have been selected for during stock generation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49128" pm="."><plain>While these variants likely had a fitness advantage during virus propagation, these variants likely carried a fitness cost in human hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49129" pm="."><plain>As a result, the initial viral population can be thought of as occupying a region of the fitness landscape that spans the peak, as well as several nearby gulches (Fig. 8C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49130" pm="."><plain>Because of the fitness differential present in the viral population, this fitness landscape occupancy leads to a selective transmission bottleneck and continuing intrahost purifying selection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49131" pm="."><plain>Little intrahost genetic diversification is apparent, because most mutations are deleterious or, at best, neutral. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="49134" pm="."><plain>By the first successfully sequenced nasal wash sample, the nonsynonymous variants that were enriched (but not fixed) in ovo or in vitro had either markedly decreased in frequency or were absent entirely from the sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49135" pm="."><plain>This suggests that selection pressures can be strong in healthy and effectively naive human hosts and that high levels of genetic diversity at the onset of infection enable the occurrence of rapid intrahost evolution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49136" pm="."><plain>One major limitation of this study was the short read lengths of the viral sequences, which curtailed our ability to distinguish those sites under direct selection from those loci whose allele frequency changes could have been driven by linkage to other alleles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49137" pm="."><plain>Given that homologous recombination does not readily occur in influenza viruses (59), the contribution of linkage must be considered when interpreting the frequency changes of variants on the same gene segment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49138" pm="."><plain>Given that only one high-frequency nonsynonymous variant was identified on the NP in the viral stock, however, it is likely that the reduction in nonsynonymous genetic diversity on the NP gene segment following subject inoculation was a consequence of selection directly acting against this G868A variant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49139" pm="."><plain>On the HA gene segment, it is less clear whether selection acted against C516A, G1258A, or both. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49140" pm="."><plain>Longer reads would prove invaluable in determining which HA sites were under selection and which variants changed in frequency simply as a result of genetic hitchhiking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49141" pm="."><plain>Longer reads would also allow us to identify epistatic interactions between sites, similar to what was done in recent work based on IAV deep sequencing data from an H5N1 host adaptation study (60). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49142" pm="."><plain>Despite this limitation, we have shown that an IAV population partially adapted to the environments in which it was generated can rapidly evolve in healthy and effectively naive human hosts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49143" pm="."><plain>This rapid evolution occurs via a selective transmission bottleneck and continuing purifying selection acting on the founding viral population. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49144" pm="."><plain>While a large and phenotypically heterogeneous founding population size may be unique to this experimental study, recent estimates of transmission bottleneck sizes in natural human-to-human infections are much larger than anticipated by many—on the order of 100 to 250 virions (16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49145" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the fitness differences within a viral population, rather than the initial levels of genetic diversity, may be the primary factor setting the speed limit of IAV adaptation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49146" pm="."><plain>Clearly, further analyses are critical for improving our nascent understanding of the dynamics of IAV adaptive evolution between transmission events and within single infections. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49147" pm="."><plain>This work, however, provides support to existing studies documenting the remarkable capacity for this virus to rapidly evolve, this time in human hosts. </plain></SENT>
