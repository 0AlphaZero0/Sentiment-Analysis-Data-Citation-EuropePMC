</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49228" pm="."><plain>Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1; UniProt: P19544) is a zinc-finger transcription factor central to embryonic development of the genitourinary system (reviewed in (1–3)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49229" pm="."><plain>The gene for human WT1, located in band 13 on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13), comprises 10 exons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49230" pm="."><plain>Exons 1–6 encode N-terminal domains responsible for protein dimerization and for transcriptional regulation (4,5); exons 7–10 encode four C-terminal zinc fingers (ZF), the last three of which are primarily responsible for DNA sequence-discrimination and target binding (Supplementary Figure S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49231" pm="."><plain>Individuals with aberrant WT1 are invariably heterozygous, with copies of both normal and mutated Wt1 genes, and they exhibit a spectrum of unusual features typically early in life. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49232" pm="."><plain>Truncations of WT1 due to frame-shift or chain-termination mutations leads to pediatric renal malignancies termed Wilms tumors, the fifth most common childhood malignancy (6,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49233" pm="."><plain>Although the action of WT1 is not well understood, these mutations, whether inherited or de novo, give rise to Wilms tumors following somatic loss of the normal copy of the Wt1 gene resulting in hemizygous cells with no normal WT1 at all (8–10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49234" pm="."><plain>Another class of mutations in Wt1 causes Denys-Drash Syndrome (DDS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49235" pm="."><plain>These are predominantly missense mutations in ZF2 and ZF3 that alter either the Cys2-His2 structural amino acids that coordinate the zinc ions, or the sequence-recognition amino acids at the protein-DNA interface (Supplementary Figure S1b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49236" pm="."><plain>DDS mutations result in an array of severe problems, including a high probability of Wilms tumor, mesangial sclerosis and early renal failure, gonadal dysgenesis, and ambiguous or female genitalia in 46XY males. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49237" pm="."><plain>The most common mutation found in individuals with DDS is arginine 394 to tryptophan (R394W) (11), but many additional singletons are known as summarized in Supplementary Figure S1b. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49238" pm="."><plain>Alternative splicing between exons 9 and 10 of Wt1 leads to the presence or absence of three additional amino acids—lysine (K), threonine (T) and serine (S)—between ZF3 and ZF4 of WT1 (Supplementary Figure S1a and b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49239" pm="."><plain>The usual 2:1 balance between the two isoforms, ‘+KTS’ and ‘-KTS’, is critical for normal genitourinary development, and splice junction mutations that invert this ratio result in Frasier Syndrome (FS), a condition similar to but distinct from DDS, characterized by nephropathy, genital anomalies and gonadoblastoma, but only rarely Wilms tumor (8,12,13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49240" pm="."><plain>Wilms tumors can arise from mutations in a number of different genes (14,15), but WT1-derived Wilms tumors, DDS, and FS all stem from mutations in the same, Wt1, gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49241" pm="."><plain>The resulting phenotypes correlate well with the position and type of mutation present, although there are individual differences in the extents to which these are manifest, and overlaps in diagnoses (8,9,16). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49242" pm="."><plain>The varied consequences of Wt1 mutations appear to depend upon the functionalities of the mutant WT1 proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49243" pm="."><plain>Truncations starting near the beginning of the gene are expected to lead to inactive proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49244" pm="."><plain>Those starting further down the polypeptide chain could retain the ability to dimerize and, when paired with normal WT1 protein, to bind to DNA and affect regulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49245" pm="."><plain>C-terminal mutations in the zinc fingers should behave in a similar way when the mutations abolish DNA-binding, but if their effect is to change sequence-specificity instead, the proteins might bind to new DNA target sites as monomers or homodimers, or as heterodimers in combination with normal WT1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49246" pm="."><plain>Mis-association with other transcription factors is also feasible (1,17). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49247" pm="."><plain>Numerous regulatory perturbations could result from such interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49248" pm="."><plain>To better understand these, we have investigated the DNA-binding behavior of the zinc-finger domain of normal WT1, and of three missense mutations reported to cause DDS in which glutamine 369 (Q369) is replaced by arginine (18) (see Supplementary text), histidine (19) or lysine (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49249" pm="."><plain>Unlike R394W, Q369 mutations are rare—each has been reported only once—and if generalizations based on single examples have validity, their consequences are somewhat different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49250" pm="."><plain>The Q369H patient displayed genitourinary anomalies, and the early onset renal failure characteristic of DDS (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49251" pm="."><plain>The Q369R patient displayed only mild mesangial proliferation that progressed slowly, and did not develop early renal failure (18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49252" pm="."><plain>And the third, Q369K, patient developed gonadoblastoma, which is more typical of Frasier Syndrome than DDS (20). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49253" pm="."><plain>These patients exemplify the phenotypic variation and overlap that can result from mutations in WT1, and the challenges these pose to current diagnostic classification. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49254" pm="."><plain>Eukaryotic proteins that interact with DNA often do so by means of ZFs (21–23) (reviewed in (24)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49255" pm="."><plain>These comprise a tandem series of approximately 30-amino acid zinc finger modules, each of which interacts in the major DNA groove with three or four adjacent bases (the recognition ‘triplet’) of mainly one DNA strand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49256" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal ZF domain of WT1 comprises four zinc fingers, but only three of these—ZF2, 3 and 4—are thought to determine specificity; ZF1 is reported to contribute to binding affinity, but in a relatively non-specific manner (25–27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49257" pm="."><plain>The consensus DNA binding sequence of WT1 (Figure 1A) is 5′-GCG-(T/G)(G/A)G-G(C/A)G-3′ (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49258" pm="."><plain>ZF4 interacts with the 5′ triplet in this sequence (GCG); ZF3 interacts with the central triplet; and ZF2 interacts with the 3′ triplet (G-C/A-G) (27,29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49259" pm="."><plain>Arginine 394 of ZF3 recognizes the conserved (3′) Gua of the central triplet (Supplemental Figure S1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49260" pm="."><plain>The R394W DDS mutation is reported to abolish DNA binding (30–32), precluding structural analysis of its interactions with DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49261" pm="."><plain>Glutamine 369 recognizes the central base (C or A) of the 3′ triplet, and as we report below, the three Q369 mutants continue to bind to DNA, providing us an avenue to investigate the interactions of WT1 DDS associated mutants with DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49262" pm="."><plain>We report our findings here, together with X-ray crystallographic structural analyses that provide molecular explanations for these results. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkw766fig1"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="49270" pm="."><plain>The WT1 consensus sequence overlaps the target sequence of another transcription factor, early growth response protein 1 (Egr1; also known as Zif268 or Krox-24): 5′-GCG-(T/G/C)GG-GCG-3′ (25,26,33,34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49271" pm="."><plain>The 5′ and 3′ triplets of this consensus sequence include CpG dinucleotides, which are the primary sites of epigenetic DNA modification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49272" pm="."><plain>In a previous study of binding to modified-cytosine forms of the Egr1 sequence, WT1 displayed markedly different affinities according to the type of modification present, suggesting that this protein might be responsive to epigenetic signals during development (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49273" pm="."><plain>In particular, WT1 bound with highest affinity when the modified base in the 3′ triplet was 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC—the terminal oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine), due to electrostatic attraction between the side chain of Q369 and the negatively charged carboxylate group (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49274" pm="."><plain>This observation prompted us to include in the present study of the Q369 mutations not only target nucleotide sequence variants, but also cytosine modification variants. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="49468" pm="."><plain>Mutations in human zinc-finger transcription factor WT1 cause an array of pediatric health problems that stem from aberrant development and functioning of the genitourinary system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49469" pm="."><plain>The problems include nephroblastoma and renal failure; gonadal dysgenesis, sterility and gonadoblastoma; anomalous or ambiguous genitalia and male to female sex reversal; and possibly more. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49470" pm="."><plain>The N-terminus of WT1 comprises domains for dimerization, and for transcription activation and repression (1); the C-terminus comprises four zinc fingers (ZF) in tandem, which to varying degrees determine the DNA sequences to which WT1 binds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49471" pm="."><plain>For its small size of around 450 amino acids, WT1 is a surprisingly complicated protein with multiple physiological effects (2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49472" pm="."><plain>Several overlapping conditions have been linked to mutations in Wt1, the gene that codes for WT1, including Wilms tumors, WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary malformations and mental retardation), Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), and Frasier syndrome (FS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49473" pm="."><plain>The phenotypes manifested depend largely on the type of mutation present, and its position within the gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49474" pm="."><plain>WAGR results from gross deletion of Wt1 and the adjacent Pax6 gene (49–52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49475" pm="."><plain>FS is caused by mutations at the end of exon 9 of Wt1 that lead to an overabundance of the stronger DNA-binding –KTS isoform of WT1 versus the weaker binding +KTS isoform (8,12,13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49476" pm="."><plain>And DDS is caused predominantly by missense mutations in ZFs 2 and 3 that change amino acids involved in zinc-coordination, or in sequence-recognition in the major DNA groove (Supplementary Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49477" pm="."><plain>DDS mutations are generally considered to abolish DNA binding by WT1 (19,27,31,32,53), but what we find here is that those at position 369 in ZF2 continue to bind DNA very well indeed, only now they bind to different sequences instead of, or in addition to, the original sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49478" pm="."><plain>ZF2 of normal WT1 has the predominant specificity G-(A/C)-G. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49479" pm="."><plain>The predominant specificity of ZF2 mutants Q369R and Q369K is G-G-G, and of Q369H it is G-(G/A)-G. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49480" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the predominant specificity of ZF2 Q369P is G-T-G. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49481" pm="."><plain>In addition to changing nucleotide-specificity, we find these mutations also change affinity for epigenetically modified forms of cytosine within the WT1 target sequence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49482" pm="."><plain>The effects vary according to the type of modification, and whether both CpG sites are modified, or only one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49483" pm="."><plain>Normal WT1, for example, binds the target sequence well when either cytosine or 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is present at both sites, but binds poorly when any of the three oxidized forms of cytosine are present instead. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49484" pm="."><plain>Q369H and Q369R, by comparison, are very much more tolerant of the presence of 5-formylcytosine (5fC) at both sites, and Q369R is also more tolerant of 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), probably due to the increased positive charge. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49485" pm="."><plain>Affinity changes such as these, we speculate, might allow DDS mutants of WT1 to bind, with unpredictable consequences, to an array of new genomic sites in addition to, or instead of, those normally bound. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49486" pm="."><plain>The common effect of such ‘off-target’ binding could be to reduce the amount of normal WT1 available to bind to correct sites, an effect that would be exacerbated if WT1 bound as a dimer rather than a monomer (5,54) due to sequestration of normal WT1 into dysfunctional heterodimeric complexes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49487" pm="."><plain>It is interesting to note that WT1 physically interacts with Tet2 (55,56), one of the three mammalian 5mC-dioxygenases that generates oxidized cytosine (57–59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49488" pm="."><plain>It is possible that WT1 either recruits Tet2 to its target sites and/or binds the sequences modified by Tet2 enzymatic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49489" pm="."><plain>Accumulating evidence supports the view that 5hmC exists as a relatively stable modification, constituting a distinct epigenetic signal (60,61) that marks lowly expressed genes, gene bodies, and intragenic regions (reviewed in (62,63)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49490" pm="."><plain>5fC and 5caC are found at much lower levels and at fewer sites, but are enriched at mono-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1)-marked enhancers (64–69), implying that these higher oxidized forms might play an important role in enhancer activity. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49491" pm="."><plain>Despite an enormous amount of work on the biochemistry, genetics, and physiology of WT1 spanning several decades, much remains unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49492" pm="."><plain>From our perspective as specialists in protein-DNA structural interactions, the role of ZF1, for example, continues to puzzle us. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49493" pm="."><plain>The C-terminal ZF domain of WT1 is essentially identical in mammals, birds, amphibians and fish, whereas numerous differences occur in the N-terminal regulatory regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49494" pm="."><plain>This high degree of conservation implies that all four ZFs are essential for normal vertebrate development and are immutable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49495" pm="."><plain>ZF1 has all the features of a regular zinc finger unit, and the identification of DDS missense mutations located in this ZF (70) suggest that it participates in sequence-discrimination and binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49496" pm="."><plain>Using in vitro selection approaches, ZF1 was found to have affinity for Thy as the first base of its putative triplet (26), and in a separate study it was found to preferentially bind the ambiguous triplet (T/G)-(G/A/T)-(T/G) (25) in which cytosine was excluded as the central base. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49497" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, NMR and X-ray crystallographic analyses of ZFs 1–4 in complex with an oligonucleotide failed to reveal sequence-specific contacts by ZF1, leading to the conclusion that ZF1 ‘…does not contribute significantly to binding specificity’ (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49498" pm="."><plain>We are investigating whether this discrepancy could be due to the oligo used in this analysis, which was based on the Egr1 consensus rather than the WT1 consensus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49499" pm="."><plain>We speculate that WT1 ZF1-4 might have higher affinity for the sequence of triplets 5′-GCG-TGG-GAG-TGT, than for 5′-GCG-GGG-GCG-TCT used by Stoll et al. (27), and that complexes with this oligo instead might reveal specific interactions with ZF1. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49501" pm="."><plain>Another question concerns the behavior of the predominant, +KTS, isoform of WT1 (71), depletion of which leads to Frasier Syndrome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49502" pm="."><plain>This protein has three extra amino acids—lysine, threonine, and serine—in the linker between ZF3 and ZF4, which greatly reduce its affinity for the consensus DNA sequence (72). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49503" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the +KTS isoform might play a role in RNA splicing (73), but from a structural point of view a change in overall affinity from DNA to RNA is difficult to rationalize. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49504" pm="."><plain>Lysine, threonine and serine are benign in the context of DNA-binding, and can interact favorably with both the bases and the backbone phosphate groups of DNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49505" pm="."><plain>It seems plausible to us, then, that the +KTS isoform has affinity for a variant of the WT1 consensus, one in which triplets 1 and 2 are separated by one or more base pairs to compensate for the increased length of the linker, for example, GCG-N1-3-TGG-GAG-TGT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49506" pm="."><plain>Although analysis of natural WT1 (+KTS) binding-sites cast some doubt on this possibility (74), there is precedent for such changes among the sequence-specificity subunits of certain restriction enzymes, where insertion or deletion of four amino acids between pairs of DNA-binding domains increases or reduces the separation between the sequences recognized by one base pair (75). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="49507" pm="."><plain>Many apparently opposite activities have been ascribed to WT1 (reviewed in (76)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49508" pm="."><plain>These include transcriptional activation and repression (77); roles in RNA processing and translation (73,78,79); localization in nucleus or cytoplasm (80–82); a tumor suppressor in the formation of Wilms tumor, and an oncogene in adult tumors (83–86); a role in controlling active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone modification marks (87); and a capacity to differentially bind to epigenetically modified DNA (29). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49509" pm="."><plain>WT1 is expressed in cells that are undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (88–90) or the reverse, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (87,91). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49510" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the opposing activities of WT1 maintain the balance between epithelial and mesenchymal states (92) and the potential to transition in either direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="49511" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the Wt1 gene, or altered expression could perturb this balance and lead to disease. </plain></SENT>
