<SENT sid="50243" pm="."><plain>Ninety-seven percent of activating FGFR3 mutations observed in BC are clustered in either exon 7 (codons 248 and 249), exon 10 (codons 372, 373 and 375), or exon 15 (codon 652)[3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50244" pm="."><plain>Mutations in exons 7 or 10 create unpaired cysteines in the proximal extracellular region, leading to the formation of disulfide bonds between adjacent receptors, thereby inducing ligand-independent dimerization and activation[4][5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50245" pm="."><plain>Mutations within the kinase domain, such as codon 652, are thought to induce a conformational change in the activation loop, resulting in constitutive autophosphorylation of the receptor[6]. <p><text><SENT sid="50246" pm="."><plain>Recently, FGFR3-transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC3) fusions have been identified in glioblastoma[7], head and neck carcinoma[8], and lung cancer[9], as well as urothelial cancer (UC)[10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50247" pm="."><plain>FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed and shown to be effective in cell lines harboring not only an activating FGFR3 mutations, but also an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion gene in vitro and in vivo[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50248" pm="."><plain>These include the S249C mutation in human BC cells 97–7[12], Y375C mutation in human BC cells MGH-U3[13], and FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in human glioma stem cells GIC-1123[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50249" pm="."><plain>In addition, significant clinical responses to an FGFR inhibitor were reported in FGFR3-TACC3 fusion-positive patients with cervical cancer[14] or glioma[11] in Phase I clinical trials. Thus, detection of not only the activating FGFR3 mutations, especially in exons 7, 10 and 15, but also the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in BC patients could be clinically important to identify responders to FGFR kinase inhibitors. <p><text><SENT sid="50251" pm="."><plain>DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (DNA-FISH) is widely used to detect fusion genes from genomic DNA[15][16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50252" pm="."><plain>However, genomic DNA-FISH is not a feasible option to detect an FGFR3-TACC3 fusion. Generally, fusion detection assays of DNA-FISH are based on 2 strategies, dual fusion or break apart. In the dual fusion strategy, 2 colored probes are designed to span the breakpoint of the 2 genes involved in the fusion. These probes are visually distinct in normal cells but appear merged by the specific fusion event. However, this strategy is not a feasible option for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion detection because the 2 genes map very closely, at a distance of only 48 Kb on chromosome 4p16.3, and thus the 2 probes appear merged in both normal cells and fusion-positive cells. In the break-apart strategy, probes are designed to target opposite sides of the translocation break point for a given gene, each labeled by a different color. These probes generate signals in normal cells that are co-localized and appear merged. Following a translocation, the signals are no longer co-localized but appear to be separate. This strategy is also not a feasible option for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion detection. According to Parker et al., the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion is caused by tandem duplication of a 70 kb region on 4p16.3[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50262" pm="."><plain>This is confirmed by performing genomic DNA capillary sequencing of tandem duplication boundaries[17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50263" pm="."><plain>Therefore, fluorescent probes appear merged in both normal and fusion-positive cells. <p><text><SENT sid="50264" pm="."><plain>Recently, several RNA-ISH based assays have been applied to detect mRNA transcripts of fusion genes, which include padlock probes/rolling circle amplification (RCA), “smFISH,” and “branched DNA (bDNA)-FISH”. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50265" pm="."><plain>For example, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts were identified by padlock probes/RCA[18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50266" pm="."><plain>However, the padlock probe/RCA approach needs an in situ cDNA preparation, which would pose additional technical difficulty when using formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue slides due to degradation and modification of nucleic acids. “smFISH” systems using single fluorophore-labeled probes are also applied to detect mRNA transcripts of fusion genes[19][20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50267" pm="."><plain>Following smFISH, “bDNA-FISH” system has been applied to detect mRNA transcripts of fusion genes[21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50268" pm="."><plain>In “bDNA-FISH,” sequential hybridization of a series of oligonucleotide probes generates signal amplification. This contrasts with “smFISH,” which lacks a signal-amplification step. The bDNA probes are commercially available as a 'ViewRNA' system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or an 'RNAscope' system (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA, USA). “bDNA-FISH” and “smFISH” demonstrate the same accuracy, but “bDNA-FISH” yields brighter spots with a better signal-to-noise ratio[22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50271" pm="."><plain>Neither “smFISH” nor “bDNA-FISH” assay has been applied to detect FGFR3-TACC3 fusion yet. <p><text><SENT sid="50272" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to develop an RNA-FISH assay using bDNA probes to detect FGFR3-TACC3 fusion gene transcripts in FFPE tissue, which are the most widely available specimens in clinical settings. In this study, we first applied an RNA-FISH assay using bDNA probes to detect FGFR3-TACC3 fusion transcripts in human FFPE BC tissue. We also analyzed the relationship between the FGFR3 mutation, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion status, and clinical information in a prospective multicenter cohort of more than 100 patients with the clinical diagnosis of BC. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title><text><SENT sid="50275" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods <sec id="sec007"><title><text><SENT sid="50276" pm="."><plain>Patients and tissue samples <p><text><SENT sid="50277" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted as a prospective multicenter cohort study including 144 patients from 7 institutions with the clinical diagnosis of UC.

<SENT sid="50365" pm="."><plain>A step-by-step protocol is provided as the S1 Protocol. In brief, FFPE sections were treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol of QuantiGene® ViewRNA ISH Tissue Assay Kit before adding the labeled probe solution. In order to detect the mRNA signal with high resolution, the fluorescent label reagent (label probe mix) from a QuantiGene ViewRNA ISH Cell Assay Kit (Affymetrix) and its compatible custom-made probes described above were used. <p><text><SENT sid="50368" pm="."><plain>The target sequence of the FGFR3-specific oligonucleotide probes was located in exons 3 to 11 corresponding to nucleotide numbers 395–1595 in the sequence of NM_000142.3 of FGFR3 except for exons 8, 9 and 10, which are variable in alternative splicing. Thus the probes specifically hybridize to all three variants of human FGFR3 mRNA. The target sequence of the TACC3-specific oligonucleotide probes was located in exons 12–16 corresponding to the nucleotide numbers 2200–2838 in the sequence of NM_006342.1 of TACC3. Fig 1 shows a schematic representation of how FGFR3-specific probes and TACC3-specific probes were designed. The probe sets for each gene consisted of around 15 to 20 pairs of probes. One pair consisted of 2 of about 20 base oligonucleotide probes. The 2 probe pairs are designed to hybridize to adjacent segments on the target RNA, allowing further hybridization of a preamplification probe (Affymetrix) for signal amplification by labeled probes. This “double Z” structure assures the specificity to the target mRNA because this construction of a “double Z” structure by 2 adjacent probes is required for signal amplification. A schematic figure explaining how this bDNA-FISH-based assay works is shown in Fig 2. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="pone.0165109.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165109.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="50376" pm="."><plain>Schematic representation of how FGFR3-specific probes and TACC3-specific probes were designed. </caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0165109.g001"/></fig></SecTag><SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="pone.0165109.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0165109.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="50377" pm="."><plain>A schematic figure explaining how bDNA-FISH works. </caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0165109.g002"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="50378" pm="."><plain>After fluorescent label probe hybridization, slides were dried and mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="50380" pm="."><plain>For FGFR, a Cy5 (Excitation/Emission = 650/670 nm) filter was used, and for TACC3, a Cy3 (Excitation/Emission = 552/570 nm) filter was used. Each field of view was obtained from a different part of the tissue portion in which cancer cells were present. The presence of cancer cells was confirmed by comparing DAPI-stained nucleic images with H&amp;E stained images. These images were analyzed using IN Cell Investigator Developer Toolbox 1.9.2 which is the image analysis software used with IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) to obtain the number of signals for each probe (FGFR3 and TACC3) and to examine whether each signal dot from each probe overlapped or not. Overlapped/co-localized dots were recognized as “overlapped/co-localized” when 50% of the area from each signal overlapped with another signal. When overlapped/co-localized signals were observed, the number of such overlapped/co-localized dots were counted. These image analyses were performed unbiasedly and automatically by software with a fixed protocol every time. A schematic representation of how co-localized signals were detected by IN Cell Investigator is shown in S1 Fig. The overlapped signals could be detected not only from real fusion mRNA, but also from proximity of the 2 target RNAs simply by chance. Actually, a small number of overlapped signals were detected in the negative control HSC-39. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50390" pm="."><plain>These accidentally overlapped signals could be increased in direct proportion to the total number of FGFR3 signals and TACC3 signals. To overcome this problem, the number of overlapped signals was divided by the number of FGFR3 and TACC3 signals. These processes were repeated for each 10 non-overlapping fields of view per one sample. The co-localization ratios were defined as the ratio of the co-localized count number per total number for each probes, and this co-localization ratio for 10 non-overlapping fields in each slide was plotted as in a scatter diagram and used for detection of the presence of fusion transcripts. </sec><sec id="sec011"><title><text><SENT sid="50394" pm="."><plain>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis <p><text><SENT sid="50395" pm="."><plain>Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and from FFPE tissues using an RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). </plain></SENT>

The results of RNA-FISH using FFPE sections were identical to those obtained by RT-PCR using frozen tissues, indicating that RNA-FISH is a feasible assay for screening for FGFR3-TACC3 fusion.

To detect all known and possibly new variants of FGFR3-TACC3 fusions, the forward primer needs to recognize a sequence upstream of exon 18 of the FGFR3 and the reverse primer downstream of exon 13 of the TACC3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50516" pm="."><plain>The size of the PCR amplicon using this primer pair varies by case from between 100 to more than 1,000 base pairs. RNA obtained from FFPE tissues is generally highly degraded, making it difficult to detect a PCR amplicon of several hundred base pairs or more. Even if we design a multiplex PCR primer to cover to all known combinations of exons on the FGFR3 and TACC3, the expected length of the PCR amplicon varies by case for the following reasons. First, the genomic break point could be different in each case. Second, introns could be inserted between the genomic break point of the FGFR3 and TACC3 genes in some cases[27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50521" pm="."><plain>Actually, 36 bps of intron 10 of the TACC3 gene were inserted into fusion mRNA in TKB014 in our study. Thus, the expected lengths of PCR amplicons of the ready-made multiplex PCR primer for each exon were unequal and predisposed to give a false negative. Recently, targeted sequencing using next-generation sequencing was applied for detection of fusion genes. Ross et al. applied targeted sequencing to FFPE tissues of 35 UC patients, and the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion was detected in one patient[38]. </plain></SENT>

As reported in many previous studies[43][44], the proportion of cases having an FGFR3 mutation decreased with increasing stage and grade. In this study, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion genes were present in 2/60 (3%) of NMIBC and 2/44 (5%) of MIBC cases. In previous studies, the fusion was detected in 6% (1/17) of NMIBC cases[45] and 2–4% (3/129[46], 2/46[10], 1/25[45], and 1/35[38]) of MIBC cases. These results are consistent with the present study.
