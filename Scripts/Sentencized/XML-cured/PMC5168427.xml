</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50663" pm="."><plain>Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder that impedes to varying degrees an individual's comprehension and expression of language, be it through their ability to read, understand spoken language, write, speak, and/or gesture (Code, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50664" pm="."><plain>Aphasia is most commonly caused by stroke with ~30–40% of acute stroke cases presenting with aphasia (Pedersen et al., 2004; Engelter et al., 2006), and up to 61% of those individuals continuing to experience aphasia at 12 months post-stroke (Pedersen et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50665" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aphasia becomes a chronic communication disorder for a significant proportion of people who experience stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50666" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, research has demonstrated that people with aphasia can continue to improve their language skills many years post-stroke when they have access to efficacious treatment regimens (Brady et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50667" pm="."><plain>While a number of studies have suggested that intensive aphasia rehabilitation is most effective (Bhogal et al., 2003; Kelly et al., 2010; Cherney et al., 2011), other research supports more distributed protocols (Dignam et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50668" pm="."><plain>A likely outcome of this debate about rehabilitation intensity is that rehabilitation interventions should be tailored to the individual's needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50669" pm="."><plain>However, full customization of aphasia rehabilitation protocols that are delivered in-person are improbable in a healthcare landscape of increasingly restricted resource allocation combined with growing demand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50670" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even when such tailored rehabilitation services are available, access by individuals with aphasia may be restricted due to decreased mobility and/or geographical isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50671" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, a number of technology-based solutions, such as computer-based aphasia therapy (CBAT) and telerehabilitation, have been implemented in aphasia rehabilitation to overcome these issues of access, intensity, and limited resources. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50672" pm="."><plain>While CBAT programs have been used in aphasia rehabilitation for many years (van de Sandt-Koenderman, 2011) only recently has the highest level of evidence supporting the use of CBAT been reported in a systematic review (Zheng et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50673" pm="."><plain>The review concluded that there is evidence of the effectiveness of CBAT for people with chronic aphasia as it found statistically significant improvements in language outcomes after CBAT when compared to no therapy in all but one study and no statistically significant differences in language outcomes when compared to traditional clinician-delivered therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50674" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the authors of the review recommended that clinicians carefully consider matching the CBAT program to the needs of each client in terms of feedback, cueing hierarchies and the degree of clinician support provided when clients use CBAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50675" pm="."><plain>This recommendation may result in clinicians needing access to a wide range of CBAT programs in order to tailor therapies to this complex and heterogeneous disorder given that most CBAT programs are currently fixed in terms of the types of tasks, feedback and cues available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50676" pm="."><plain>Zheng et al. (2016) called for further quality and controlled research to be conducted around the use of CBAT in order to determine the key features required in CBAT programs and treatment protocols best suited to various types and severities of aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50677" pm="."><plain>This call for further research was also made by van de Sandt-Koenderman (2011) who appealed for current CBAT programs to be made more sophisticated and attractive to users by bringing them up-to-date with new technologies such as mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50678" pm="."><plain>Additionally, van de Sandt-Koenderman (2011) called for the development of CBAT programs that encompass functional treatment goals and social participation needs of people with aphasia, as well as, expansion into telerehabilitation models in which a clinician guides and supports a client in their rehabilitation using CBAT programs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50679" pm="."><plain>Telerehabilitation is another technology-based solution that has been explored for both assessment and treatment of aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50680" pm="."><plain>In the context of speech-language pathology telerehabilitation (or its synonym telepractice) has been defined by the peak professional body Speech Pathology Australia, as “the application of telecommunications technology to deliver clinical services at a distance by linking clinician to client, caregiver, or any person(s) responsible for delivering care to the client” (SPA Position Statement, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50681" pm="."><plain>Telerehabilitation may be delivered synchronously (real-time), or asynchronously (delayed), or using a hybrid combination of the two approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50682" pm="."><plain>Much of the aphasia telerehabilitation research to date has focused on synchronous or hybrid approaches (see Systematic Reviews by Hall et al., 2013; Coleman et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50683" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there has been less research into asynchronous models of telerehabilitation for aphasia rehabilitation reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50684" pm="."><plain>Seminal research into asynchronous telerehabilitation was conducted by Mortley and colleagues who combined the use of a CBAT program, StepByStep, with an asynchronous telerehabilitation approach to deliver aphasia rehabilitation directly into the individual's home (Wade et al., 2003; Mortley et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50685" pm="."><plain>The CBAT program, StepByStep had been designed for independent use by people with aphasia and was accessed on a personal computer with a Windows operating system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50686" pm="."><plain>A range of tasks were available such as written and spoken word to picture matching, semantic association tasks, as well as, naming, reading, and spelling tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50687" pm="."><plain>An important feature of the StepByStep program was that it allowed for the input of personal and meaningful stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50688" pm="."><plain>In this way the program aligned with the neurorehabilitation principle of saliency, which is a significant factor in language recovery (Pulvermüller and Berthier, 2008; Raymer et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50689" pm="."><plain>The telerehabilitation approach allowed clinicians to remotely monitor progress, provide feedback and update therapy tasks, resulting in an improved ratio of therapy to therapist time when compared with other computer-based aphasia therapy programs (Mortley et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50690" pm="."><plain>Clinical results were encouraging in that all seven participants demonstrated consistent and intensive use of the program, resulting in significant improvements in word retrieval (Mortley et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50691" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the participants reported experiencing increased confidence and participation in communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50692" pm="."><plain>The participants credited the asynchronous telerehabilitation model with improving their access to therapy, increasing the intensity of therapy and increasing their autonomy (Wade et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50693" pm="."><plain>This research highlighted the importance of providing people with aphasia with salient therapy tasks and demonstrated that people with aphasia appreciated having access to clinician monitored therapy which they could engage in autonomously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50694" pm="."><plain>However, the uptake of the Windows-hosted StepByStep program has perhaps been impeded by recent advances in technology toward mobile touch devices (iPad®, tablet PC, smartphones). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50695" pm="."><plain>As interest in mobile devices continues to grow current programs may need to be converted or new programs developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50696" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, research suggests that tomorrow's elders with disabilities will demand mobile access to services as they continue to participate in a lifestyle which includes travel and other activities outside the home (Morris et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50697" pm="."><plain>In response to this burgeoning use of mobile devices in the community, Brandenburg and colleagues conducted an integrated review of mobile computing and aphasia which examined issues of accessibility for people with aphasia and the potential uses of mobile computing with this population (Brandenburg et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50698" pm="."><plain>The issue of accessibility (also called usability) in CBAT programs is critical to the successful uptake of these programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50699" pm="."><plain>Usability has been defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as “the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (ISO 9241-11, 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50700" pm="."><plain>Another important concept in the development of software and new service delivery models such as telerehabilitation is acceptability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50701" pm="."><plain>Acceptability is a judgment by the user of the software or service as to whether their needs are sufficiently met. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50702" pm="."><plain>As discussed by Brandenburg et al. (2013) a number of features have been identified as improving the usability of mobile technology for people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50703" pm="."><plain>However, more research is needed in this area and the use of participatory design methodology, or an end-user design approach as it is known in the software development field, may be one way to achieve improved usability of CBAT programs accessed on mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50704" pm="."><plain>Given that mobile devices are becoming the device of choice for many people, including people with aphasia (Brandenburg et al., 2013), it is encouraging that recently developed asynchronous telerehabilitation platforms have made use of this new technology (Kiran et al., 2014; Brandenburg et al., 2015; Des Roches et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50705" pm="."><plain>Brandenburg et al. (2015) developed an application for use on a smartphone which measures “talk time” in much the same way that a pedometer measures steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50706" pm="."><plain>Features of CommFit™ include being able to set a goal for the amount of talking, and data feedback to both the person with aphasia using the app and their clinician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50707" pm="."><plain>Using key usability design and aphasia friendly text principles for people with aphasia, the prototype application was developed and then trialed with healthy adults to determine the accuracy of the measurement of talking time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50708" pm="."><plain>Usability of this app with the target population is yet to be published. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50709" pm="."><plain>The other two recently reported asynchronous telerehabilitation systems are more complex in that the programs aim to provide language therapy across a number of domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50710" pm="."><plain>Kiran et al. (2014) and Des Roches et al. (2015) reported the use of an iPad®-based software program, Constant Therapy, to deliver a range of impairment-level language and cognitive tasks to participants with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50711" pm="."><plain>The Constant Therapy program also allowed clinicians to monitor therapy progress remotely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50712" pm="."><plain>Kiran et al. (2014) demonstrated the feasibility of the iPad®-based software platform to deliver therapy tasks to four participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50713" pm="."><plain>Tasks were assigned from the Constant Therapy library of approximately 30 evidence-based language and cognitive therapy tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty thereby allowing some degree of individualization of therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50714" pm="."><plain>Following the positive findings of this feasibility testing, Des Roches et al. (2015) investigated the effectiveness of the program in a comparison study where both groups received ten 1-h sessions to complete therapy tasks on the iPad with the support of a clinician and the experimental group supplemented these sessions with home practice on the iPad® between clinic visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50715" pm="."><plain>Both the experimental and control groups showed improvements on standardized testing, however, the experimental group showed greater improvements than the control group, thus demonstrating the benefits of increased practice time using Constant Therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50716" pm="."><plain>While the effectiveness of this CBAT program is promising, the researchers noted only 68.7% compliance with the prescribed 6 h of home practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50717" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to determine whether usability issues impacted compliance and client satisfaction with this iPad®-based therapy approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50718" pm="."><plain>The asynchronous telerehabilitation platform described by Choi et al. (2016), iAphasia, was also designed for use on an Apple iPad®. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50719" pm="."><plain>The iAphasia program consisted of therapy tasks across the six language domains of auditory comprehension, reading comprehension, repetition, naming, writing, and verbal fluency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50720" pm="."><plain>Six levels of difficulty were available for each domain and arranged hierarchically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50721" pm="."><plain>Automatic feedback and progress graphs were available to the participant with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50722" pm="."><plain>Clinicians accessed client data from iAphasia stored on a database through a Web portal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50723" pm="."><plain>Results from a feasibility study using iAphasia with eight participants were promising with significant improvement on standardized assessment after the 4 week trial and maintenance of these outcomes at follow-up 4 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50724" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a strong and positive correlation was found between usage time and improvement in standardized assessment scores regardless of aphasia severity at baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50725" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, participants with mild aphasia had low usage time which the authors concluded was due to the program not being “attractive” to these participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50726" pm="."><plain>Regrettably, “attractive” was not defined and so it is unclear whether this was due to issues of usability or acceptability of the program, or its limited capacity to meet the participant's goals and needs due to the restriction of six domains and six difficulty levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50727" pm="."><plain>Thus, while the asynchronous telerehabilitation platforms that make use of modern mobile devices hold great promise for improving access to therapy, there are some limitations in their application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50728" pm="."><plain>In particular the fixed therapy task types and difficulty levels within some of the programs (e.g., Constant Therapy and iAphasia) may restrict their use to people with specific aphasia profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50729" pm="."><plain>The inability to import client images and/or local audio content to increase the saliency of tasks is also perhaps a limitation of these newer programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50730" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the older program StepByStep had this capacity to import images, but its utilization of Windows operating system restricts somewhat its accessibility on mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50731" pm="."><plain>Indeed to the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the asynchronous telerehabilitation programs for aphasia published to date have the capacity to provide complete customization of therapy tasks such that the programs can be used with a wide variety of aphasia types and severities to meet the goals of the user. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50732" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although the asynchronous telerehabilitation studies reviewed here have implemented aphasia friendly principles into the design of their user interfaces, none have scientifically examined the usability of their programs with people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50733" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need to develop an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform that has the capacity to be used across a range of clients of varying severity and aphasia types, and which is flexible in terms of the types of tasks available for use with clients or easily adaptable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50734" pm="."><plain>It is important that the platform uses high quality stimuli that are culturally appropriate and ideally would allow for the import of client images and local audio content to increase saliency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50735" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, usability of the asynchronous telerehabilitation platform should be considered throughout the development period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50736" pm="."><plain>Usability issues are a major barrier to the uptake of technology for people with disabilities (Simpson et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50737" pm="."><plain>For people with aphasia it is not just the communication disorder that presents challenges to technology usability, but also the sensory, physical, and cognitive impairments that often accompany aphasia (Brandenburg et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50738" pm="."><plain>One way to potentially ensure adequate usability of CBAT programs, either used in isolation or as part of an asynchronous telerehabilitation system, is to include end-users in the design and development of the programs and to assess usability with the target populations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50739" pm="."><plain>Considered best practice within software development, the end-user design process aims to inform the development of a product by considering the requirements of the user at all stages of the design process (Pavelin et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50740" pm="."><plain>However, the methodology of the end-user design approach relies heavily on communication skills and so the inclusion of people with aphasia as participants in the end-user design process may be particularly challenging (Galliers et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50741" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a number of studies have implemented aspects of the end-user design approach in order to enhance the usability of CBAT programs for people with aphasia (Boyd-Graber et al., 2006; Allen et al., 2008; Koppenol et al., 2010; Galliers et al., 2012; Simic et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50742" pm="."><plain>The study which most comprehensively included end-users in the design approach was that by Galliers et al. (2012) which aimed to develop a gesture therapy tool for people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50743" pm="."><plain>Five people with aphasia acted as consultants in a series of participatory workshops with developers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50744" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the Galliers et al. (2012) study provided researchers and developers alike with useful strategies in how best to promote the participation of people with aphasia in this end-user design approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50745" pm="."><plain>The Simic et al. (2016) study included both end-user groups in their usability study involving a synchronous telepractice program, PhonoCom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50746" pm="."><plain>In keeping with the end-user design process, this paper explores the development of a novel asynchronous telerehabilitation platform, called eSALT (eSALT: Enabling Speech and Language Therapy that is effective, electronic, and everywhere) and reports data from a usability study with two end-user groups and discusses how this data was used to further refine eSALT. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50752" pm="."><plain>eSALT is an implementation of a generic software program developed by the second author, Hugh Breslin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50753" pm="."><plain>The generic program, AppTailor, allows the user to easily and quickly design and/or adapt applications or “apps” for deployment to mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50754" pm="."><plain>The AppTailor system has two parts, a desktop application and a device-based component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50755" pm="."><plain>The desktop application allows practitioners to design tasks to be performed by their clients on a mobile device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50756" pm="."><plain>The user interface provides a preview of how the task will appear on the device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50757" pm="."><plain>The designer can build a layout for each task and specify which illustrated words or phrases will be used in each step of the task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50758" pm="."><plain>Additionally standard controls such as dropdown boxes, text editor, and switch controls can be dropped onto the layout as well as media elements such as a video player or a voice recorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50759" pm="."><plain>The saved designed task serves as a set of “layout instructions” that can be assigned to device users and uploaded to the cloud. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50760" pm="."><plain>The device application downloads and reads the “layout instructions” to determine how the device app should look and behave. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50761" pm="."><plain>The data input captured is uploaded to the cloud. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50762" pm="."><plain>The desktop application can download these results and present them to the practitioner so that they can view results and modify the tasks accordingly to repeat the process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50763" pm="."><plain>The authors felt that the entire AppTailor system could be adapted and implemented as an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform for use in speech-language pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50764" pm="."><plain>A period of adaptation of AppTailor into eSALT followed during which the nomenclature was made specific to speech pathology, custom layouts were developed, and the word/picture library and audio cues were created. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50765" pm="."><plain>The result was a working prototype of eSALT (v1.1) which allowed clinicians to develop and customize impairment-based aphasia therapy tasks for transfer to Windows tablet devices from which clients with aphasia could access the tasks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50766" pm="."><plain>As an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform, eSALT has both a client interface and a clinician interface and so aspects of end-user design and examination of usability needed to extend to the clinician's use of the platform to monitor progress, provide feedback and update tasks remotely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50767" pm="."><plain>Hence, a qualitative study with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) experienced in aphasia rehabilitation using CBAT was undertaken to determine SLPs' preferences for a comprehensive CBAT program (Swales et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50768" pm="."><plain>Ten Australian SLPs participated in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50769" pm="."><plain>Five themes emerged from the thematic analysis which detailed preferences across therapy activities in the CBAT program, the stimuli used and cues available, as well as, preferences for accessing progress data and considerations around accessibility and usability (Swales et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50770" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these SLPs confirmed that there was a need for a CBAT program that was more flexible than current programs in the types of therapy tasks available and that there should be a high degree of flexibility in the program for “clinicians to set all task parameters to each client's needs and increase saliency of therapy” through specific targets, stimuli, cues and feedback (Swales et al., 2016, p. 326). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50772" pm="."><plain>The SLPs considered usability of CBAT programs from a number of perspectives other than their own, such as the individual with aphasia, their family and also other health professionals such as allied health assistants who often manage the use of CBAT programs in clinics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50773" pm="."><plain>Finally, the SLPs desired a program that was accessible across a variety of operating systems and devices and they confirmed the need for platforms that enabled remote monitoring of client progress and remote updating of therapy tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50774" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these findings came from a group of SLPs who had no experience of eSALT (v1.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50775" pm="."><plain>At this point it was decided to embark upon a usability study with both end-user groups, in order to determine the usability and acceptability of eSALT (v1.1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50777" pm="."><plain>This formative usability study was embedded in a feasibility study and used mixed methods to examine the usability and acceptability of eSALT (v1.1) from the perspective of both people with aphasia and SLPs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50778" pm="."><plain>The feasibility study involved SLPs designing tasks for the participants with aphasia, remotely monitoring therapy progress and updating tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50779" pm="."><plain>Participants with aphasia engaged in the tablet-based therapy tasks for a period of 3 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50780" pm="."><plain>Ethical approval was granted by the University of Queensland Behavioural and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50783" pm="."><plain>Participants with aphasia were recruited via the Communication Research Register, a database of potential research participants hosted by The University of Queensland. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50784" pm="."><plain>All participants had aphasia as a result of a stroke and were native speakers of English. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50785" pm="."><plain>Participants who presented with concomitant severe apraxia of speech, severe motor speech disorder, cognitive impairment or poorly aided vision and hearing were excluded from the study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50786" pm="."><plain>A total of five individuals diagnosed with aphasia as a result of stroke (4 males and 1 female) were recruited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50787" pm="."><plain>The presence of aphasia was confirmed through assessment on the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT; Swinburn et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50788" pm="."><plain>The participants ranged in age from 67 to 78 years old (mean = 70.8 years) and were between 3 and 19 years post-stroke (mean = 8 years, 10 months). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50789" pm="."><plain>Participants were not receiving any other therapy at the time of participation in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50790" pm="."><plain>Characteristics likely to affect the participants' ability to use the tablet PC were also collected (see Table 1 for participant details). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><SecTag type="TABLE"></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="51436" pm="."><plain>The major usability issues identified by the SLPs were addressed through a number of key developments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51437" pm="."><plain>Firstly, efforts to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the eSALT (v1.1) platform were actioned through migration to a more efficient database, the upgrading of hardware and streamlining data access. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51438" pm="."><plain>In order to assist with task development and improve the ease with which clinicians could give a range of clients with aphasia appropriate tasks, the list of task templates was substantially expanded to over 50 tasks, including high level language tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51439" pm="."><plain>Restrictions on text length and punctuation were relaxed and the word/picture library was expanded to over 1300 high quality color photographs across a wider range of categories (e.g., verbs, money). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51440" pm="."><plain>Custom images can now be remotely uploaded to the cloud by the administrators for download to the desktop and mobile device as required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51441" pm="."><plain>In order to facilitate efficient feedback on client progress to the client and the clinician, the capacity to set the target response within a task was expanded to all response inputs (except free text input). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51442" pm="."><plain>This key development enabled results, such as percentages correct, to be displayed to the client at the end of each task and also assisted with automatic scoring and summation of client progress for the clinician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51443" pm="."><plain>This automatic scoring functionality may further improve the accessibility and usability of eSALT for both clients and clinicians, as it should significantly reduce the time clinicians need to manually score tasks and provide feedback, as well as, provide the option for immediate feedback to the client. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51444" pm="."><plain>However, it is up to the clinician to input these correct responses thus maintaining the flexible functionality of eSALT and aligning with the the recommendations arising from the Swales et al. (2016) study which found that clinicians wanted to tailor feedback options for individuals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51445" pm="."><plain>Functionality around the assignment of words/pictures to tasks and tasks to clients was also improved through the re-design of this interface to a more graphical layout which enabled randomization of words/pictures into exercises and also allowed for a step-through preview of the tasks in eSALT (v4.1 onwards) (See Figure 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51448" pm="."><plain>This interface provides the clinician with numerous graphical displays of client data, both per task and over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51449" pm="."><plain>The capacity to export data to Excel remains active. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51450" pm="."><plain>This client monitor interface also enables further customization of the display of tasks on the client device, such as changing labels on the task menu and the order of tasks in the menu (see Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51451" pm="."><plain>However, perhaps the most significant development in this interface was the capacity to combine different tasks under one menu label. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51452" pm="."><plain>This feature enables the clinician to have an initial page which may explain the task, joined up to the task itself. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51453" pm="."><plain>This also enables reading comprehension tasks to be designed with multiple pages of diverse text and questions within a single task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51454" pm="."><plain>Another feature of this interface is the ability to attach messages either to a specific task or as an overall message to the client. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51455" pm="."><plain>Overall messages may be designed with questions for the client to complete, thus supporting communication between the clinician and client. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51458" pm="."><plain>This development expanded the use of eSALT (v4.1 onwards) across a two operating systems (Windows and iOS) and in doing so goes some way to fulfill a recommendation that arose from the Swales et al. (2016) study that software be available across multiple platforms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51459" pm="."><plain>The iPad® application has a simpler interface and standardized user inputs (e.g., 2 step menus for input of single or multiple selection response). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51465" pm="."><plain>Proposed development of eSALT outlined in Table 5 will continue to focus on improving areas identified from end-user input and recommendations from previous studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51466" pm="."><plain>To assist clinicians in determining the ongoing progress of clients, individual usage goals such as daily time spent on tasks will be able to be set at client and/or task level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51467" pm="."><plain>Progress toward each of the goals will be shown as a snapshot of overall performance and reported in a calendar view with a daily summary status. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51468" pm="."><plain>The homepage dashboard will become customizable so that a clinician can quickly see their preferred measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51469" pm="."><plain>A history by word or phrase will be maintained so that a profile of client capability can be built and used by the clinician to set the difficulty of a task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51470" pm="."><plain>Feedback to the client on the device will be extended to show their progress toward their goals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51471" pm="."><plain>Further development will include catering for a range of client abilities and needs through clinician tailoring of the device behavior and layout. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51472" pm="."><plain>To further improve the clinician experience, typical steps and beneficial features will be made more transparent and a high level of task categorization will be allowed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51473" pm="."><plain>By the introduction of a web-based portal for the eSALT community, clinicians will be better able to enjoy the full potential of the system's flexibility through self-management and sharing of custom media and tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51474" pm="."><plain>Finally, the authors plan to further expand the platform such that it is applicable across a variety of communication disorders and a variety of settings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51475" pm="."><plain>One important expansion will be the capacity to transfer audio and video recordings to the clinician. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51477" pm="."><plain>Although this formative usability study used multiple methods to collect data during a feasibly study, a number of limitations were evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51478" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the usability data gathered from both end-user groups could have more comprehensively covered the use of the software by use of an expanded observational checklist that required all potential uses to be observed (e.g., an item specific to the participant's use of the audio recording and playback function) or by the software itself tracking usability in the form of error counts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51479" pm="."><plain>The study by Simic et al. (2016) collected error counts, however, this was achieved through observation rather than software tracking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51480" pm="."><plain>Usage data detailing exactly how long each participant engaged in therapy using eSALT (v1.1) and how long clinicians spent designing tasks and monitoring progress was not available in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51481" pm="."><plain>The capture of usage data will be vital in future studies to bestow additional credibility to the usability and acceptability of data collected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51482" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, accurate usage data from both end-users would enable analysis of the potential cost-efficiency of asynchronous telerehabilitation in relation to the ratio of practice time by the participant with aphasia to clinician time in designing, monitoring and updating therapy tasks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51483" pm="."><plain>The hardware chosen on which to run the clinician's desktop application was not ideal, with insufficient processing power and memory for the complex processing requirements of such an open and flexible software program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51484" pm="."><plain>This led to the program being inefficient in the performance of functions such as saving and loading words/pictures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51485" pm="."><plain>It will be important that future usability studies ensure that hardware is fit for purpose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51486" pm="."><plain>The sample size of this usability study may be considered small, however, usability literature suggests that formative usability studies involving early prototypes and set in a real world context may record valid data from as few as five participants (Macefield, 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51487" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, given the heterogeneity and complexity of aphasia there may be a need for future usability studies to include a larger sample of people with aphasia as well as a larger sample of clinicians from a variety of rehabilitation settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51488" pm="."><plain>Future usability studies should aim to further embed the research in real world settings so as to increase the ecological validity of the data and discover unanticipated issues earlier (Genov et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51489" pm="."><plain>For example, ecological validity of the data may be improved by including participants who are currently receiving other therapy, so as to diminish any potential Hawthorne effects in the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51490" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there may be a need for different types of usability studies, such as comparative studies which might compare the usability of two or more interfaces or punctuated studies which promote an iterative development process (Macefield, 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51491" pm="."><plain>Since the completion of this study in late 2013, improved versions of eSALT have been used in a number of other research projects, including a trial of the effectiveness of the therapy provided through eSALT (UQ ECR Grant eSALT v4.2) and as part of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing a comprehensive intensive aphasia program to usual care (NHMRC Grant APP1057047 eSALT v4.1). </plain></SENT>
