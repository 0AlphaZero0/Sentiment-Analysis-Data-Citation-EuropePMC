</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51710" pm="."><plain>Currently, promotion of lifestyle changes in diet and exercise habits as well as control of comorbidities (i.e., T2DM and dyslipidemia) remain the cornerstone of NAFLD management.7 The drug armamentarium to treat NAFLD/NASH is today rather limited,8 although new approaches are being intensively explored.9 In this context, bile acid (BA) derivatives and compounds that influence BA‐related signaling pathways are emerging as potentially useful therapeutic agents for NAFLD and NASH.10, 11, 12 In the present review, we provide a summary of current knowledge on the role of BAs in NAFLD/NASH and present new insights into the possible approach of targeting BA‐related pathways in the treatment of this serious global health problem. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51792" pm="."><plain>McMahan et al. found that treating db/db obese mice with one such dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, INT‐767, decreased hepatic steatosis, reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression, and shifted the monocyte and macrophages toward an anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype.87 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51794" pm="."><plain>Of note, a recent small, but well‐designed, study showed that administration of the GLP‐1 analog, liraglutide, led to histological resolution of NASH in a significant proportion of subjects.88 Moreover, the drug also reduced insulin resistance and decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis and lipotoxicity in key metabolic organs.89 Thus, the ability of BA‐based therapies to augment GLP signaling warrants further investigation as part of understanding their potential as a disease‐modifying intervention in NASH. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51795" pm="."><plain>In spite of the promising aforementioned results, the only published human study in which a TGR5 agonist was administered to diabetic patients yielded somewhat disappointing results given that glucose levels were strikingly increased and not reduced as expected.90 Further research is needed to determine whether TGR5‐based therapies would be a viable approach to metabolic disease and NAFLD. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51797" pm="."><plain>As alluded to above, blocking intestinal BA absorption through intestinal BA sequestration improves metabolic aspects of NAFLD in some human and mouse studies, perhaps through TGR5‐related effects.11 However, the only study specifically designed to assess the efficacy of colesevelam, a potent BA sequestrant, to decrease liver fat in patients with biopsy‐proven NASH yielded negative results.91 On the other hand, in line with the concept that inhibition of intestinal FXR signaling has benefit in NAFLD,51 preliminary observations show that pharmacological inhibition of ASBT substantially improves hepatic lipid accumulation in mice fed an HFD and cholesterol.92 The therapeutic potential for ASBT blockade to treat NAFLD in patients remains unexplored; however, several ASBT inhibitors are already in development to treat other conditions, such as dyslipidemia, cholestasis, or constipation.30 </plain></SENT>
