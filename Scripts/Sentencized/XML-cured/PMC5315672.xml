</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52726" pm="."><plain>Sativene sesquiterpenoids, as well as its derivatives, usually possessed an unusual backbone characterized by a 5/6 or 5/7 bridge ring system [1–7], which have become targets of synthetic chemists [8–12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52727" pm="."><plain>Previously, these sesquiterpenoids were obtained mainly from fungi Cochliobolus, Drechslera, and Bipolaris, et al., while some of them displayed bioactive diversity such as antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity [1–7, 13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52728" pm="."><plain>We also reported sativene sesquiterpenoids bipolenins A–C from cultures of endophytic fungus Bipolaris eleusines [15], while bipolenin B showed certain cytotoxicities to human cancer cell lines [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52729" pm="."><plain>In order to search for more interesting sativene sesquiterpenoids, we expanded the fermentation of B. eleusines and finished the chemical studies. As a result, we obtained three new sativene sesquiterpenoids, named bipolenins D–F (1–3), as well as three known ones, prehelminthosporol (4) [13], prehelminthosporolactone (5) [13, 14], and victoxinine (6) [14] (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52734" pm="."><plain>Compound 1 was isolated as a colorless oil. The molecular formula was established as C16H26O2 by HREIMS at m/z 273.1818 [M + Na]+ (calcd for C16H26O2Na, 273.1825), corresponding to four degrees of unsaturation. The IR absorption bands at 1631, 1454, and 1368 cm−1 revealed the existence of double bond. In the 1H NMR spectrum of compound 1 (Table 1), signals at δ H 0.85 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, Me-10), 0.94 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, Me-11), and 1.19 (3H, s, Me-8) were ascribable for three methyl groups, while signals at δ H 4.82 and 4.72 should be assigned to a terminal double bond. The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra showed 16 carbon resonances which were ascribable for four methyl (including one methoxy), four methylene, six methine and two quaternary carbons (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52739" pm="."><plain>On the basis of data comparison with those sesquiterpenoids reported from the same resource [13–15], compound 1 was suggested to possess a seco-sativene backbone with similar structure to that of prehelminthosporol (4) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52740" pm="."><plain>The key difference was that the hydroxy at C-15 in 4 was replaced by a methoxy group in 1, as indicated by HMBC correlation from δ H 3.36 (3H, s, OMe) to δ C 103.8 (d, C-15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52741" pm="."><plain>Detailed analyses of 1H–1H COSY and HMBC data suggested that other parts of 1 were the same to those of 4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52742" pm="."><plain>In addition, the ROESY correlation between H-15 and H-7 were detected, which indicated that H-15 should be α oriented. Therefore, the structure of compound 1 was established and named bipolenin D (Fig. 1).Table 1 1H and 13C NMR data of compounds 1–3 (CDCl3, δ in ppm, J in Hz)No. 1  2  3  δ H  δ C  δ H  δ C  δ H  δ C 12.57, br s48.6, d2.60, br s49.0, d5.71, br s127.4, d2158.1, s157.8, s146.5, s343.9, s43.8, s50.3, s41.45, m; 1.38 m42.0, t1.46, m; 1.39, m41.9, t1.62, m; 1.41, m44.4, t51.64, m; 1.11, m25.9, t1.66, m; 1.14, m26.0, t1.46, m; 1.36, m21.0, t61.08, m46.7, d1.12, m46.7, d1.34, m41.3, t72.61, br s37.8, d2.68, br s37.9, d1.94, dd (11.8, 4.0)45.6, d81.19, s20.3, q1.19, s20.4, q1.02, s21.2, q91.32, m30.8, d1.34, m31.0, d35.7, s100.85, d (6.6)21.0, q0.87, s21.2, q0.89, s31.9, q110.94, d (6.6)21.1, q0.98, s21.1, q0.91, s27.3, q124.82, s; 4.72, s101.1, t4.85, s; 4.71, s101.4, t4.11, d (14.0)59.8, t4.03, d (14.0)131.32, m51.5, d1.34, m51.4, d1.98, br s57.0, d143.74, br s64.8, t3.77, br s65.1, t1.76, m; 1.37, m29.8, t154.39, d (3.3)103.8, d4.79, d (3.0)99.6, d4.13, m; 3.99, m63.7. tOMe 3.36, s54.6, qOAc 2.05, s21.0, q171.2, s <p><text><SENT sid="52744" pm="."><plain>Compound 2 was isolated as a colorless oil.

<SENT sid="52746" pm="."><plain>The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 seemed to be similar to that of 1, including three singlets for three methyl, as well as signals for a terminal double bond. The 13C NMR spectrum displayed fifteen carbon resonances comprised of three methyl, four methylene, six methine, and two quaternary carbons. These data suggested that compound 2 was a dimer of seco-sativene sesquiterpenoid, which possessed a completely symmetrical structure. Preliminary analyses of NMR data suggested that the two units of compound 2 were closely related to that of 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52750" pm="."><plain>In the HMBC spectrum, a key correlation from δ H 4.79 (1H, d, J = 3.0 Hz, H-15 and H-15′) to δ C 99.6 (d, C-15′ and C-15) suggested that the two units were connected by ester bond of C-15–O–C-15′, which allowed the two units were completely the same. The ROESY correlations of H-15/H-7, H-15/H-14, and H-14/H-7, as well as similar coupling constant of H-15 (d, J = 3.0 Hz) with that in 1, indicated that H-15 and H-15′ should be α oriented. Therefore, the structure of compound 2 was established and named bipolenin E. <p><text><SENT sid="52753" pm="."><plain>Compound 3 was isolated as a colorless oil.

<SENT sid="52755" pm="."><plain>The 13C NMR spectrum displayed seventeen carbon resonances. Of them, signals at δ C 21.0 (q) and 171.2 (s) were ascribed to one acetoxyl group, while other fifteen signals were similar to those of secolongifolene diol [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52757" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that compound 3 should be an O-acetyl derivative of secolongifolene diol. The significant downfield shifts of CH-15 (δ H 4.13 and 3.99; δ C 63.7) indicated that the O-acetyl group should be placed at C-15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52759" pm="."><plain>The other data suggested that other parts of 3 were the same to those of secolongifolene diol. Previously, we obtained O-acetyl derivatives of secolongifolene diol from the same resource, bipolenins B and C [15], in which the NMR data were also similar to those of 3 [15]. </plain></SENT>
