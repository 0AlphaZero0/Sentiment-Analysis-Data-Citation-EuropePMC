<SENT sid="52848" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms through which Rab17 loss permits invasiveness, and the endosomal cargoes that are responsible for mediating this, are unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52849" pm="."><plain>Using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we have found that knockdown of Rab17 leads to a highly selective reduction in the cellular levels of a v-SNARE (Vamp8). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52857" pm="."><plain>The membrane trafficking events controlled by Rab GTPases influence cellular processes that accompany cancer initiation and progression, including loss of cell polarity, and the drive to invasion and metastasis (De Franceschi et al., 2015; Goldenring, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52858" pm="."><plain>The contribution made by Rab GTPases to acquisition of invasive behaviour has been intensively studied, and the molecular machinery that is responsible for trafficking receptors that control cell adhesion and cell migration is becoming well understood (Miller et al., 2000; Rainero and Norman, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52859" pm="."><plain>There is good evidence that Rab11 GTPase control of integrin and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) recycling drives invasive migration in cancer, and expression of Rab11 isoforms and their effectors, such as Rab-coupling protein (RCP), is linked to metastasis (Caswell et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52860" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Rab21 is closely associated with integrin trafficking, and the contribution made by this Rab GTPase to cancer invasiveness and suppression of apoptosis is now well documented (Alanko et al., 2015; Högnäs et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52861" pm="."><plain>Loss of epithelial cell polarity is a key event in cancer progression, and one that is generally accepted to precede acquisition of invasive and metastatic capabilities (McCaffrey and Macara, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52862" pm="."><plain>For example, in breast cancer, epithelial polarity is progressively lost as tumours progress from pre-malignant lesions to invasive carcinoma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52863" pm="."><plain>Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which is a heterogeneous group of lesions characterised by intraductal proliferation of malignant epithelial cells, possess an intact basement membrane (which may be considered to be a remnant basolateral domain) but the cells display no functional apical surface (Wiechmann and Kuerer, 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52864" pm="."><plain>The progression of DCIS to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) occurs when the basement membrane becomes disrupted and this last vestige of epithelial polarity is lost. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52865" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that transition between DCIS and IDC is an accepted watershed in disease aggressiveness, the key molecular and cellular drivers of this process are not well understood (Clark et al., 2011; Hannemann et al., 2006; Vincent-Salomon et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52866" pm="."><plain>Since the DCIS to IDC transition involves loss of aspects of epithelial polarity, this is likely to be driven by alterations to Rab GTPase levels and/or function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52867" pm="."><plain>It is already known that Rab25, a Rab11 GTPase whose expression is largely restricted to epithelia, is often lost in breast cancer (Cheng et al., 2010), and deletion of Rab25 accelerates tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colon cancer (Nam et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52868" pm="."><plain>One interpretation of this is that loss of Rab25 leads to disruption of trafficking pathways that maintain aspects of normal epithelial polarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52869" pm="."><plain>Rab17 was the first epithelial-cell-specific small GTPase to be identified, and its expression is induced as epithelial cells polarise (Hunziker and Peters, 1998; Lütcke et al., 1993; Zacchi et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52870" pm="."><plain>There is some debate as to the trafficking pathways controlled by Rab17, but a consensus is emerging that this Rab GTPase is associated with transcytosis of receptors, such as the polymeric immune globulin receptor (dlgA) and the transferrin receptor (TfnR), from the basolateral to the apical surface of epithelial cells (Hansen et al., 1999; Zacchi et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52871" pm="."><plain>We have recently identified Rab17 as a gene that is suppressed during the acquisition of invasive migration, which accompanies upregulation of ERK2 kinase signalling (von Thun et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52872" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have shown that Rab17 levels must be suppressed for ERK2 to drive breast cancer invasiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52873" pm="."><plain>Consistently, reduced levels of Rab17 have been shown to be associated with increased aggressiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma (Wang et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52874" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these studies suggest that Rab17 may oppose events that accompany the DCIS to IDC transition – such as the loss of cell polarity and the acquisition of invasiveness – and this is likely to be mediated by controlling endosomal trafficking of pro- and/or anti-invasive receptor cargoes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52875" pm="."><plain>As there is no reason to propose that the known receptor cargoes of Rab17-regulated transport – such as dlgA and TfnR – would be drivers of the DCIS to IDC transition or cancer invasiveness, we developed an unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic approach to investigate the Rab17 interactome and the protein cargoes whose trafficking it influences. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52876" pm="."><plain>To do this, we combined quantitative stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics with a biotinylation-based method to separate plasma membrane from endosomal proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52877" pm="."><plain>By using this approach, we found that Rab17 mediates its anti-invasive effects via interaction with the SNARE protein Vamp8, and that Rab17 and Vamp8 influence the endosome–plasma membrane distribution of a number of cargoes that might be expected to influence invasiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52878" pm="."><plain>Prominent amongst these proteins was neuropilin-2 (NRP2), which moves from endosomes to the plasma membrane following Rab17 depletion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52879" pm="."><plain>We conclude by showing that NRP2 is required for the DCIS to IDC transition and the acquisition of invasiveness that is driven by depletion of Rab17 or Vamp8. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52883" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this observation is pertinent to aggressiveness of the human disease, we interrogated the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories using the ‘kmplot’ analysis tool (Győrffy et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52884" pm="."><plain>Consistent with our previous results, we found that low levels of Rab17 expression in breast tumours was strongly associated with poor overall patient survival (P&lt;0.0001) (Fig. 1A), and this was statistically significant in all breast cancer intrinsic subtypes (Fig. S1A–C), with the exception of the HER-enriched subtype (Fig. S1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52885" pm="."><plain>Survival of ovarian cancer patients was also associated with low Rab17 expression (P&lt;0.0001) (Fig. S1E), but we were unable to demonstrate any correlation between Rab17 levels in lung or gastric cancers (data not shown).

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52908" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that Rab17 may restrict invasiveness by controlling the expression or trafficking of proteins that suppress invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52909" pm="."><plain>To search for these, we knocked down Rab17 (Fig. S1F) and performed a SILAC-based global proteomic MS analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52910" pm="."><plain>We labelled control and Rab17-knockdown MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with light-isotope and heavy-isotope SILAC amino acids, respectively (forward experiment), and with heavy-isotope and light-isotope amino acids, respectively (reverse experiment). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52911" pm="."><plain>We then prepared cells extracts and quantified them on an LTQ-Orbitrap. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="52913" pm="."><plain>Accurate protein quantification highlighted high reproducibility between forward and reverse experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52914" pm="."><plain>Despite the large number of proteins that were unambiguously identified and quantified, we found that only a single protein was significantly downregulated (in both forward and reverse experiments) in Rab17-knockdown cells, and this was the vesicle (v)-SNARE Vamp8 (Fig. 1B; Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52915" pm="."><plain>We confirmed this result by knocking down Rab17 in MDA-MB-231 cells using either a single small interfering (si)RNA oligonucleotide or pooled siRNAs, followed by western blotting (Fig. 1C,D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52916" pm="."><plain>Moreover, this analysis indicated that levels of Vamp3 and Vamp7 (the most closely related Vamps to Vamp8) were unaffected by knockdown of Rab17 (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52917" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since Rab17 knockdown suppressed Vamp8 protein but not levels of its mRNA, we conclude that Rab17 controls Vamp8 expression post-transcriptionally (Fig. S2A,B). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52918" pm="."><plain>Our previous work has identified Rab17 to be a key effector of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52919" pm="."><plain>Following suppression of ERK2 but not of ERK1 (ERK2 and ERK1 are also known as MAPK1 and MAPK3, respectively), Rab17 levels are increased and this leads to increased invasiveness (von Thun et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52920" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the ability of MAP kinase signalling to influence Rab17 results in control of Vamp8 levels, we knocked down ERK2 and measured Vamp8 levels by western blotting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52921" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of ERK2 led to increased levels of Rab17 mRNA and Vamp8 protein (Fig. 1E), further supporting the view that Rab17 controls Vamp8 levels and suggesting that suppression of this v-SNARE may underlie the ability of ERK2 to drive invasiveness. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="52923" pm="."><plain>We used MS-based proteomics to investigate the Rab17 interactome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52924" pm="."><plain>We expressed GFP-tagged Rab17 (GFP–Rab17) or GFP in MDA-MB-231 cells and immunoprecipitated these using GFP-trap beads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52925" pm="."><plain>A label-free quantification approach was then used to identify a set of 95 proteins that constitute the Rab17 interactome, and Vamp8 was a prominent component of this (Fig. 1F; Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52926" pm="."><plain>We used western blotting to confirm the association between Rab17 and Vamp8 (but not Vamp7), and also found that Rab24 (a Rab GTPase which is closely related to Rab17) did not coimmunoprecipitate with Vamp8, indicating that there was a degree of specificity to the Rab17–Vamp8 interaction (Fig. 1G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52927" pm="."><plain>To determine whether Vamp8 and Rab17 are able to interact directly with each other, we produced the cytoplasmic region of Vamp8 (Vamp8cyto) and GST-tagged Rab17 constructs (both the wild type and a constitutively active GTPase-deficient mutant of the protein) in Escherichia coli and purified these. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52928" pm="."><plain>However, we were unable to demonstrate co-precipitation of purified soluble Vamp8cyto with glutathione-bead-conjugated Rab17 constructs (Fig. S2C), indicating that these proteins either do not interact directly or interact transiently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52929" pm="."><plain>Next, we used STRING software (http://string-db.org) (Szklarczyk et al., 2015) to examine known functional interactions between proteins of the Rab17 interactome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52930" pm="."><plain>In addition to the anticipated Rab proteins involved in signal transduction and the SNARE complex groups, we found that Rab17 associated with proteins related to lysosomes (Fig. S2D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52931" pm="."><plain>Indeed, when we annotated our Rab17 interactome to denote the intracellular compartmentalisation of its components, we found that 43% of the proteins interacting with Rab17 could be classified as late endosomal and/or lysosomal proteins (Fig. 1H). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="52932" pm="."><plain>GFP–Rab17 displayed significant colocalisation (Pearson's coefficient=0.62±0.016; mean±s.e.m.) with endogenous Vamp8 at vesicular structures in the perinuclear region of MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with late endosomal localisation of Rab17 and Vamp8 (Fig. 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52933" pm="."><plain>Indeed, endogenous Vamp8 displayed significant colocalisation with both endogenous (Fig. 2B,C; Pearson's coefficient ∼0.6) and GFP-tagged (Fig. S3) markers of late endosomes, such as CD63, Lamp1 and Lamp2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52934" pm="."><plain>As described in Fig. 1, we observed a reduction in Vamp8 levels following Rab17 knockdown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52935" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the late endosomal distribution of Vamp8 was disrupted following transfection with siRNA against Rab17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="52936" pm="."><plain>Thus, the residual Vamp8 in Rab17-knockdown cells was distributed more generally in the central region of the cell, and its colocalisation with CD63-positive structures was significantly reduced (Fig. 2C,D).

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53065" pm="."><plain>The available database information concerning Rab17 and its interactors is insufficient to infer potential effectors and pathways through which this GTPase acts to suppress cancer invasiveness and progression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53066" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, determined the Rab17 interactome and its influence on the cellular proteome in an unbiased manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53067" pm="."><plain>The use of high-accuracy MS-based approaches has enabled us to do this and to show that Rab17 has a close physical and functional relationship with the SNARE protein Vamp8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53068" pm="."><plain>Rab GTPases are known to recruit specific effector proteins that bind to SNAREs, giving specificity to vesicle fusion (Angers and Merz, 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53069" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, to our knowledge, our study is the first to provide an indication that the stability and cellular levels of a SNARE protein may be controlled by a Rab GTPase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53070" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because Vamp8 is the only component of the proteome that is significantly altered following Rab17 knockdown, the relationship between this GTPase and Vamp8 stability is likely to be highly selective. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53071" pm="."><plain>Our MS and immunofluorescence data indicate that Vamp8 is localised primarily to late endosomes and that its recruitment to this compartment is strongly dependent on Rab17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53072" pm="."><plain>Thus, these data are consistent with a view that Rab17 acts primarily to recruit Vamp8 to late endosomes and, when Rab17 levels are low, Vamp8 becomes mislocalised and is subsequently degraded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53073" pm="."><plain>We have found that neither proteosomal nor lysosomal mechanisms are responsible for degradation of mislocalised Vamp8 (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53074" pm="."><plain>However, a report that caspases regulate Vamp8 expression and function in dendritic cells indicates the possibility that Rab17 could protect Vamp8 from caspase cleavage by localising it to late endosomes (Ho et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53075" pm="."><plain>Increased Vamp8 is primarily thought to promote homotypic fusion of either early or late endosomes (Antonin et al., 2000; Pryor et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53076" pm="."><plain>Endosomal compartments are constantly engaged in homotypic fusion and fission, and the relative rates at which these two processes occur dictate the size and identity of these compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53077" pm="."><plain>Our observation that NRP2-containing late endosomes are large when Vamp8 levels are high is consistent with a role for this v-SNARE in homotypic fusion of these compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53078" pm="."><plain>Thus, activation of ERK2, which leads to downregulation of Rab17 and, in turn, reduced Vamp8 levels might be expected to shift the homotypic fusion and fission balance of late endosomes in favour of fission to promote mobilisation of NRP2-containing late endosomes to the plasma membrane to drive invasion. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53079" pm="."><plain>Rab17 expression has been known for a number of years to be associated with establishment of a polarised epithelial phenotype (Hunziker and Peters, 1998; Lütcke et al., 1993; Zacchi et al., 1998), and its downregulation is linked to loss of epithelial polarity (Lütcke et al., 1993). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53080" pm="."><plain>Our observations that downregulation of Rab17 accompanies events such as the DCIS to IDC transition and the disruption of acinar morphology (including breach of the basement membrane) are consistent with a role for Rab17 in maintaining epithelial morphology and opposing the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53081" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is probable that cargoes trafficked by Rab17 are involved in maintenance of epithelial polarity and, consistently, Rab17 has been shown to control trafficking events, such as transcytosis, that distinguish polarised epithelia (Hunziker and Peters, 1998; Zacchi et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53082" pm="."><plain>Vamp8 has been functionally linked to transcytosis (Pocard et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53083" pm="."><plain>Indeed, most evidence indicates that this SNARE, like Rab17, plays an important role in controlling trafficking events that support maintenance of epithelial polarity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53084" pm="."><plain>In epithelial cells, Vamp8 is responsible for sorting apical cargoes, such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), to the apical plasma membrane (Pocard et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53085" pm="."><plain>Many tumour cells retain some, but not all, of the characteristics of a polarised epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53086" pm="."><plain>For instance, comedo-forming tumour cells, such as MCF10DCIS.com, have a basement membrane, which corresponds to a basolateral region, but do not have a well-defined apical domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53087" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is interesting to speculate about the role played by the transcytotic machinery in partially polarised comedo-like organoids and other less-polarised cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53088" pm="."><plain>One possibility is that, in the absence of an apical domain (as encountered in MCF10DCIS.com cells), proteins such as Rab17 and Vamp8 might still function to move receptors that could potentially disturb basement membrane integrity away from the plasma membrane and into other compartments. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53089" pm="."><plain>Characterisation of the endomembrane proteome is complicated by the fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain purified endosomal fractions that are uncontaminated by components from other cellular subcompartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53090" pm="."><plain>To overcome this, we have used a biotin-labelling approach, which allows enrichment of internalised protein cargo, and combined this with a quantitative SILAC method designed to highlight consistent changes in plasma membrane and endosomal distribution evoked in response to a defined pro-invasive stimulus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53091" pm="."><plain>By focussing on these changes, interference from proteins that are non-specifically associated with plasma membrane and/or endosomal isolates is minimised. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53092" pm="."><plain>The receptor whose distribution was most significantly altered by Rab17 knockdown was NRP2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53093" pm="."><plain>The neuropilins are well established as contributing to axonal guidance and angiogenesis (Raimondi and Ruhrberg, 2013); however, the roles played by these receptors in epithelial cells have received less attention. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53094" pm="."><plain>Neuropilins and the receptors with which they collaborate, such as VEGF receptors, are generally thought to be restricted to the apical and luminal domains of epithelial ducts to reduce their exposure to growth factor ligands that are abundant in the interstitium (Wild et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53095" pm="."><plain>Consistently, upregulation and/or mislocalisation of NRP1 and NRP2 to the basolateral region correlates with invasiveness and poor prognosis in a number of tumour types (Wild et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53096" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that Rab17 and Vamp8 promotes removal of NRP2, and other potentially proinvasive receptors (such as MT1-MMP), from the basolateral membrane so that they can be routed to cellular locales where they will not disrupt basement membrane integrity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53097" pm="."><plain>Thus, in normal epithelia, the role of a Rab17–Vamp8 complex might be to transcytose these receptors to the apical domain but, in partially transformed comedo-like tumours, Rab17 and Vamp8 strive to oppose the transition to invasive carcinoma by actively retaining NRP2 safely within the late endosomal system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53098" pm="."><plain>Thus, Rab17 and Vamp8-dependent sequestration of NRP2 within the endosomes of tumour cells is likely to represent a remnant of the transcytotic system that still acts to suppress basement membrane disruption and the DCIS to IDC transition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53099" pm="."><plain>Suppression of Rab17 levels through the activation of ERK2 signalling is likely to represent a key event in loss of the last vestiges of epithelial polarity, which allows tumours to invade and metastasise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53100" pm="."><plain>Our use of novel MS proteomics to identify NRP2 as a cargo of the Rab17–Vamp8 pathway indicates that loss of control over trafficking of this receptor is a key event in the DCIS to IDC transition. </plain></SENT>
