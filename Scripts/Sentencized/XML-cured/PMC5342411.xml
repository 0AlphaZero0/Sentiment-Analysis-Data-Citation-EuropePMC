</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53389" pm="."><plain>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an epithelial cell malignancy deriving from the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary trees [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53390" pm="."><plain>The incidence of CCA has been increasing annually in China [2], however, most CCA patients are notoriously difficult to diagnose and have poor prognosis [1, 3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53391" pm="."><plain>Currently, radical resection is the only effective treatment, with the 5-year survival rate after R0 resection ranging from 20% to 40%[4] and the rate of postoperative recurrence up to 75%[5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53392" pm="."><plain>The reason is that CCA cells possess a strong propensity to invade and metastasize to adjacent organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53393" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis remain elusive. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53394" pm="."><plain>Epithelial carcinoma cells shed themselves of cell-cell junctions and migrate to a distal site where they recolonize via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53395" pm="."><plain>The EMT has been shown to be a pivotal mechanism contributing to cancer invasion and metastasis [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53396" pm="."><plain>During the processes of EMT, epithelial cells lose their polarity and acquire the migratory properties of mesenchymal cells [8], including the down-regulating of E-cadherin and β-catenin, and the up-regulation of N-cadherin and vimentin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53397" pm="."><plain>Transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, ZEB1 and Twist, have been implicated in the control of EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53398" pm="."><plain>Snail is a zinc finger transcription factor which has been established as a key EMT regulator [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53399" pm="."><plain>Snail and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) together function as a molecular switch for many signaling pathways that strongly repress E-cadherin expression [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53400" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, EMT is mediated by a complex network of signaling pathways. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53401" pm="."><plain>In this network, atypical protein kinase C-iota (aPKC-ι), one of polarization regulatory proteins, acts as a central hub [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53402" pm="."><plain>It is well-known that aPKC-ι plays an essential role in controlling the organization of E-cadherin in different cell types [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53403" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies also showed that the synergistic expression of aPKC-ι and E-cadherin may reflect the differentiation and invasive potential of CCA and aPKC-ι may play an important role in inducing EMT [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53404" pm="."><plain>A recent study found that aPKC-ι can directly phosphorylate GSK-3β and lead to defects in apical-basal polarity [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53405" pm="."><plain>Interesting, the activity of GSK-3β is mainly regulated by its Ser9 phosphorylation, and 14-3-3ζ enhances Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β by PKC [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53406" pm="."><plain>14-3-3ζ has been proposed to be directly involved in cellular transformation and proliferation [17], and associated with prognosis of cancers [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53407" pm="."><plain>A striking feature of 14-3-3 proteins is that they are able to bind to many signaling molecules and have therefore been implicated in a wide array of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, migration, and the EMT [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53408" pm="."><plain>Studies have indicated that 14-3-3ζ is overexpressed in CCA [20] and that up-regulation of 14-3-3ζ contributes to resistance of tumor cells to apoptosis and increases the potential for invasion and metastasis by facilitating EMT [21–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53409" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 14-3-3ζ has the potential to serve as a molecular target for cancer therapy [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53410" pm="."><plain>However, the mutual relationship between 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι in CCA are unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53411" pm="."><plain>On the basis of previous works, we further detected the expression of 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι in CCA tissues, examined the interaction between them in CCA cells, investigated the regulation of EMT by them in vitro and in vivo, with an attempt to explore the mechanism of EMT. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53414" pm="."><plain>Initially, the expression of 14-3-3ζ, aPKC-ι and E-cadherin in 64 paired CCA and peritumoral tissue samples and 10 choledochocyst samples as controls was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB), meanwhile the patients’ samples were histopathologically evaluated (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53415" pm="."><plain>The average expression of 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι was significantly higher in CCA samples than in benign bile duct tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53416" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly lower (P&lt;0.05; Figure 1A, 1B &amp; 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53417" pm="."><plain>In IHC experiment, high expression (score &gt;4) or low expression (score ≤4) of 14-3-3ζ was detected in 60.9% (39/64) vs. 39.1% (25/64) of CCA tissues, 25% (16/64) vs. 75% (48/64) of peritumoral tissues (χ2=16.865, P&lt;0.001), 10% (1/10) vs. 90% (9/10) of choledochocyst tissues (χ2=9.035, P=0.003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53418" pm="."><plain>Similarly, high expression or low expression of aPKC-ι was detected in 59.4% (38/64) vs. 40.6% (26/64) of CCA tissues, 23.4% (15/64) vs. 76.6% (49/64) of peritumoral tissues (χ2=17.034, P&lt;0.001), 0% (0/10) vs. 100% (10/10) of choledochocyst tissues (χ2=12.205, P&lt;0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53419" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, as a key marker of EMT, E-cadherin expression was significantly lower in CCAs than in peritumoral or choledochocyst tissues (P&lt;0.05; Figure 1A, 1B &amp; 1C). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="53650" pm="."><plain>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents one of the most life-threatening tumor entities [1], and the main cause of death in patients is the invasion and metastasis of cancer [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53651" pm="."><plain>In the early stages of the metastasis cascade, EMT is a critical process [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53652" pm="."><plain>However, while substantial progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer has been made, we still lack sufficient insight into the mechanisms of EMT in patients with CCA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53653" pm="."><plain>EMT can be induced by various signaling pathways and regulatory networks that, in many cases, overlap with developmental processes that are hijacked by cancer cells [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53654" pm="."><plain>As a central hub in EMT, aPKC-ι is essential for the migration and invasion of multiple cancer cell lines and contributes to TGF-β-induced EMT [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53655" pm="."><plain>Our previous study suggested that aPKC-ι is also involved in the EMT in CCA cells [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53656" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, 14-3-3ζ is ubiquitous in all eukaryocyte and acts as a central hub regulating many pathways involved in cellular transformation common to various cancers [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53657" pm="."><plain>Over expression of 14-3-3ζ can increase the potential for invasion and metastasis by facilitating EMT [21, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53658" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the reports on the association of 14-3-3ζ with aPKC-ι in CCA are scarce. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53659" pm="."><plain>Based on our previous studies, we enrolled the 64 consecutive patients with CCA, and further detected the co-expression of 14-3-3ζ, aPKC-ι and E-cadherin by IHC, qRT-PCR and WB. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53660" pm="."><plain>The results revealed that in contrast to E-cadherin low expression, 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι were co-overexpression in CCA tissues (Figure 1A, 1B &amp; 1C) and there was a positive correlation between them (γ=0.406, P=0.001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53661" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the χ2 analysis indicated that overexpression of 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation (14-3-3ζ: χ2=9.722, P=0.002; aPKC-ι: χ2=9.329, P=0.002) and advanced CCA TNM stage (14-3-3ζ: χ2=10.136, P=0.001; aPKC-ι: χ2=13.856, P&lt;0.001) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53662" pm="."><plain>Therefor, CCA patients with high 14-3-3ζ or aPKC-ι expression had worse prognoses compared with those counterparts with low 14-3-3ζ or aPKC-ι expression (14-3-3ζ: χ2 =10.140, P= 0.001; aPKC-ι: χ2 =12.575, P&lt;0.001, respectively) (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53663" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that the expression of 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι was an independent and significant risk factor for survival after curative resection (P=0.026; P=0.025, respectively) (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53664" pm="."><plain>These clinical observations strongly suggested that 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι were oncogenes in CCA, and 14-3-3ζ expression was coupled with aPKC-ι expression to achieve a synergistic effect, and they may serve as useful prognostic biomarkers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53665" pm="."><plain>Notably particularly, we found that superabundance of 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι were associated with a deficiency of E-cadherin in 64 CCA tissue samples(Figure 1A, 1B &amp; 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53666" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that 14-3-3ζ and aPKC-ι synergistically facilitate the progress of CCA via EMT. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="53667" pm="."><plain>This idea was further supported by protein and gene expression analyses, including CO-IP and step-by-step interference in vitro. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53668" pm="."><plain>CO-IP assay revealed that 14-3-3ζ could bind to aPKC-ι in CCA (Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53669" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 14-3-3ζ or aPKC-ι knockdown with siRNA was associated with correspondingly down-regulated expression of both aPKC-ι and 14-3-3ζ (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 2B&amp;2C and Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53670" pm="."><plain>And then, in aPKC-ι-siRNA rescue experiment, the expression of 14-3-3ζ was up-regulated accompanying with elevated aPKC-ι (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 2B&amp;2C and Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53671" pm="."><plain>Our studies recommended that 14-3-3ζ forms a complex with aPKC-ι, and they regulate each other in CCA cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53672" pm="."><plain>14-3-3ζ is a dimeric protein and forms a flattened horseshoe structure containing two grooves that can modulate binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine motifs on its target proteins [27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53677" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ at Ser184 residue converts 14-3-3ζ to 14-3-3σ, and enhances its interaction with PKC in vitro[30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53678" pm="."><plain>aPKC-ι is also a serine/threonine kinase, and the N-terminal of aPKC-ι contains a conserved regulatory region-PB1 (Phox-Bem1) area which is rich in cysteine sequence [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53679" pm="."><plain>aPKC-ι can be activated through specific protein-protein interactions mediated by a Phox-Bem1 (PB1) domain within the N-terminal regulatory domain [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53680" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the PB1 area plays a crucial role in aPKC-ι promoting cell polarization, proliferation, survival, transformation and other biological activities [34, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53681" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation sites include Ser217, Ser237/Ser238, and Ser35/Ser37 [36]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53683" pm="."><plain>Similarly, both p-14-3-3ζ and p-aPKC-ι expression were inhibited by siRNA, and p-14-3-3ζ expression was recovered in the aPKC-ι-siRNA rescue experiment (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53684" pm="."><plain>In combination of our research, we hypothesized that 14-3-3ζ bind to the PB1 area of aPKC-ι through phosphorylation site, and activate the functions of aPKC-ι. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53685" pm="."><plain>However, the specific phosphorylation sites were still under further study. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53688" pm="."><plain>The potential mechanisms could include: (1) Phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ at Ser184 residue converts 14-3-3ζ to 14-3-3σ, and enhances its interaction with aPKC-ι in vitro[30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53689" pm="."><plain>(2) 14-3-3ζ protein forms stable homolo- or hetero-dimers structure, and feedback regulates 14-3-3ζ dimerization or expression alter the balance of 14-3-3ζ dimers [18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="53693" pm="."><plain>For insight into the molecular regulation of EMT, the TGF-β1-induced EMT model was successfully established and the changes in EMT markers were consistent with those described in the literature (Figure 4) [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53694" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, silencing of 14-3-3ζ or aPKC-ι prevented alterations in the EMT markers from occurring after TGF-β induction (P&gt;0.05) (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53695" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Snail, as the most important nuclear transcription factor in EMT, was decreased (P&lt;0.05). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53696" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, p-GSK-3β, one of the upstream regulatory molecules of Snail, was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 7B &amp; 7C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53697" pm="."><plain>However, in an aPKC-ι-siRNA rescue experiment, the conversion of EMT markers was recovered (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 4), and both expression of Snail and p-GSK-3β were increased (P&lt;0.05) (Figure 7B &amp; 7C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53698" pm="."><plain>A large number of studies have demonstrated that the nuclear transcription factor Snail inhibits the expression of E-cadherin [41] and is closely associated with cancer metastasis via EMT [42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53699" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Snail is degraded by proteasome after GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53700" pm="."><plain>The suppression of GSK-3β through phosphorylation of Ser 9 promotes Snail to be much more stable and reside exclusively in the nucleus to induce EMT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53701" pm="."><plain>In fact, Snail and GSK-3β together function as a molecular switch for many signaling pathways that lead to EMT [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="53702" pm="."><plain>In summary, 14-3-3ζ binds to aPKC-ι and activate aPKC-ι through phosphorylation, and activation of aPKC-ι lead to the suppression of GSK-3β through phosphorylation of Ser 9, and furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3β results in the upregulation of Snail and downregulation of E-cadherin, and promotes the EMT ultimately in CCA cells (Figure 7D). </plain></SENT>
