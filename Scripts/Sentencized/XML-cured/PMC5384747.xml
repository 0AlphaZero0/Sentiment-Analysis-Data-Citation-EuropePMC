</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55467" pm="."><plain>During the last decade, it has become clear that the cellular role of NAD+ extends far beyond its classic participation in redox reactions, since it also acts as a substrate of several families of regulatory enzymes [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55468" pm="."><plain>For this reason, intracellular concentrations of many NAD+ intermediates are maintained low [5–8], and NAD+ is considered as a sensor of metabolic and cellular stress [9–11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55469" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the origin of these NAD+-consuming enzymes, many other enzymes are involved in preserving the NAD+ supply, ranging from those related with its de novo synthesis to those associated with its regeneration in accordance with the pyridine nucleotide cycle [12–15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55470" pm="."><plain>Among them, the enzyme nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) deamidase or amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.42) was an ´orphan enzyme´ [16] with no associated sequence for many years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55471" pm="."><plain>It was first mentioned in 1969, as an enzyme in Clostridium sticklandii responsible of deaminating NMN to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) (Fig 1A) [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55472" pm="."><plain>Finally, its gene (pncC) was sequenced in the marine bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [18], and matched with a family of genes annotated in databases as competence/damage-inducible protein A (cinA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55473" pm="."><plain>This name derives from the fact that in some microorganisms these cinA genes are found adjacent to the competence gene recA, whose product is one of the proteins described in the DNA uptake and incorporation (´competence´) pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55474" pm="."><plain>The function of CinA protein in this process is still a riddle, although it could play a dual role in decreasing the intracellular level of NMN to avoid inhibition of NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, and at the same time, securing a continuous NAD+ supply for the ligases by propelling NaMN into the Preiss-Handler pathway to produce new NAD+ [18]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55484" pm="."><plain>In fact, only five have been kinetically characterized [13,18–21] and their nomenclature is confusing, since two of the terms “PncCs” and “CinAs” are used indistinctively, while they are in fact different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55485" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic and domain analyses have shown that the term PncC is better applied to enzymes formed by a domain with NMN deamidase activity (CinA domain) fused to another domain with ADP-ribose (ADPr) pyrophosphatase or NUDIX (Nucleoside Diphosphate linked to X) hydrolase activity (MocF domain), whereas the term CinA is better applied to NMN deamidases with only one domain [18,19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55486" pm="."><plain>Currently, only one structure of each kind of enzyme was determined, a CinA from the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens (PDB code: 2A9S), and a PncC from Thermus thermophilus (TtPncC) (PDB codes: 4UOC, 4CT8, 4UUX, 4CTA and 4UUW) [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55487" pm="."><plain>In addition, a MocF domain structure has also been resolved from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB code: 3KBQ). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55488" pm="."><plain>ADPr and NMN substrates were docked to the above structures [18,19], and NaMN and ADPr were co-crystallized [22] in order to identity the amino acids involved in binding and catalysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55489" pm="."><plain>Based on these latter studies and the mutational analysis carried out with E. coli CinA [23], two different catalytic mechanisms have been proposed [22,23], one describing a catalytic Ser/Lys dyad mechanism [23] and the other suggesting an asparaginase II-like mechanism [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55490" pm="."><plain>In this last mechanism, a water nucleophilic attack is promoted by a lysine (K301 in TtPncC) on the amide bond, and the resulting tetrahedral intermediate is rearranged to eliminate ammonia with the assistance of a threonine (T340 in TtPncC) [22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55491" pm="."><plain>In order to expand our limited knowledge of NMN deamidases, especially in those with only one domain, a detailed biochemical and mutational study was carried out with the NMN deamidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (AtCinA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55492" pm="."><plain>This enzyme was selected because it belongs to a biochemically uncharacterized subgroup (2.2.3) in the general phylogenetic tree described for the NMN deamidase family [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55493" pm="."><plain>In addition, no NMN deamidases from an alphaproteobacteria have been previously characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55494" pm="."><plain>And finally, its activity could play an important role in the NAD+ homeostasis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, since no NMN adenyltransferase (NadM or NadR) is present in this microorganism to recycle NMN into NAD+ (Fig 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55495" pm="."><plain>The results obtained showed that AtCinA not only has high stability at neutral pHs, but also the highest optimal temperature (80°C) described in the bibliography for NMN deamidases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55496" pm="."><plain>This high stability, corroborated by its high melting temperature (85°C), and its high catalytic efficiency, make AtCinA a promising biocatalyst for obtaining pure NaNM from NMN, in a process of potential commercial interest, given that the commercial value of the product is 10 times that of the substrate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55497" pm="."><plain>In addition, the correlation observed between the results of the mutational analysis and the enzyme structure sheds light on the NMN deamidase catalytic mechanism. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="55715" pm="."><plain>However, AtCinA is more active at basic pHs than A. vinelandii CinA with almost double the activity at pH 8.5 (82% vs 46%) [20]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55721" pm="."><plain>The study of the effect of temperature (Fig 4C) on AtCinA activity revealed it to be the NMN deamidase with the highest optimum temperature (80°C) described in the bibliography. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55722" pm="."><plain>This value is about 15°C above that described for OiPncC (65°C) [19] and A. vinelandii CinA (64°C) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55723" pm="."><plain>However, its stability at high temperatures was low in the absence of substrate, as previously observed for OiPncC [19], but it is still higher than the latter enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55724" pm="."><plain>For example, at 50°C, AtCinA showed 43% activity (Fig 4D) compared with the 6% described for OiPncC [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55725" pm="."><plain>Thus, when the best pH and temperature were used together (4–25°C and pH 7.0–7.5), the enzyme showed the highest stability described for NMN deamidases, maintaining 55% of its activity after 14 days (Fig 4D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55726" pm="."><plain>This high stability was corroborated by the thermal shift assay carried out (Fig 5), where a similar pH profile as in Fig 4A was obtained (S7 Fig) with a clear maximum at pH 7.5 (89 ± 0.1°C), a slight decrease in stability at basic pHs and a reduction at acidic pHs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55727" pm="."><plain>These data are the first values of a melting temperature reported for a NMN deamidase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55728" pm="."><plain>In order to explain this high melting temperature, the AtCinA structure was compared with that of the CinA domain of the bifunctional NMN deamidase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB 4UOC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55729" pm="."><plain>The AtCinA dimer showed a similar number of hydrogen bonds per residue than the CinA domain of TtPncC (3.76 vs 3.66), and a surprisingly high number of ion pairs (26 vs 19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55730" pm="."><plain>In fact, the number of ion pairs per residue in AtCinA was 0.056, which is higher than the average value (0.04) found in proteins [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55731" pm="."><plain>Most of these ion pairs are engaged in stabilizing helices through intra or inter-helix interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55732" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, charged residues compensate most of the N- and C-terminus α-helix macrodipoles, a characteristic that could contribute to thermoestabilization [36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55733" pm="."><plain>The number of charged residues is similar in both enzymes (20% vs 21%) [38] and the Arg/(Arg+Lys) ratio, which normally increases in thermophilic enzymes is very similar (0.8 vs 0.88). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55734" pm="."><plain>Another important aspect to explain the stability at high temperature is that AtCinA appears to be a very compact and thermodynamically stable dimer according to its positive free energy of dissociation (ΔGdiss = 23 Kcal/mol), as calculated by the PISA server [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55735" pm="."><plain>AtCinA also shows a large dimeric interface area, similar to that found in TtPncC (19% vs 15% of the total accessible area of the monomer). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55736" pm="."><plain>In addition, this dimeric interface area includes several stabilizing ion pairs between the dimer subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55737" pm="."><plain>Thus, AtCinA shows many structural characteristics that are very close to those of thermophilic enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55738" pm="."><plain>In fact, the melting temperature of AtCinA was also higher (between 23–35°C) than those described by our group for other enzymes, such as nicotinamidases [39] or sialic acid aldolases [40], indicating its high stability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55739" pm="."><plain>In addition, its long-term stability for possible commercial use could be improved by using protein stabilizers, the best found being to be ammonium sulfate, followed by hydroxyectoine (Fig 5, inset). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55741" pm="."><plain>As regards kinetic parameters, AtCinA showed a similar Km value for NMN (24 μM) to those described in the bibliography, being close to those of E. coli CinA and P. shermanii CinA (6–7 μM) [13,21], but lower than those of OiPncC (180 μM) [19] and A. vinelandii CinA (1 mM) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55742" pm="."><plain>Its kcat (8.7 s-1) was the highest determined, far from that of OiPncC (0.38 s-1) [19] and double those of SoPncC (3.3 s-1) [18] and EcCinA (4.1 s-1) [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55743" pm="."><plain>Thus, it showed a high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), which was similar to the best described for EcCinA [23]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55746" pm="."><plain>The mutational analysis carried out showed that the conserved amino acids predicted by Mistic can be used to define not only the binding site or the catalytic amino acids, but also some other important amino acids to preserve the integrity of the binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55747" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 mutants (S31A, C32A, S48A, Y58F, Y58A, K63A, T105, and R145A), only four were active (Table 1), and among them, three have never been described (C32A, S48A and Y58F) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55748" pm="."><plain>No activity was found for S31A, K63A or R145A mutants, since these residues are important for catalysis (S31 and K63) and for phosphate binding (R145), respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55749" pm="."><plain>In fact, binding of the NMN phosphate moiety is crucial for fixing the substrate in the binding site, since four hydrogen bonds are formed, two with R145, one with Y58 and one with S48, although the last residue corresponds to the adjacent subunit in the AtCinA dimer (Fig 7A; S1 Fig). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55750" pm="."><plain>The importance of this network of hydrogen bonds (Fig 7A, magenta) was evident from the 2.1-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency of the S48A mutant compared with wild type enzyme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55751" pm="."><plain>This decrease in catalytic efficiency was less pronounced in C32A (only 1.4-fold), since the substitution of a cysteine by an alanine does not much alter the orientation of the nicotinyl carbonyl oxygen, especially when another amino acid such as G106 is also involved [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55752" pm="."><plain>However, this effect is more marked in T105A with a 16-fold decrease caused by an impairment of both Km (6.5-fold increase) and kcat (2.5-fold decrease). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55753" pm="."><plain>This result illustrates the important contribution of T105 to the correct binding and orientation of the NMN amide group for catalysis, as has previously been described for a similar mutant in EcCinA (S103A) [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55754" pm="."><plain>Finally, the most dramatic decrease in catalytic efficiency was observed in Y58F (460-fold), produced by a large increase in Km and a 6-fold decrease in kcat. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55755" pm="."><plain>However, this replacement of tyrosine by phenylalanine still preserved activity, while its replacement by alanine (Y58A) completely abolished it (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55756" pm="."><plain>This effect, never before described, is not related with a general change in structure, since both mutants have similar Tm values (83°C) (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55757" pm="."><plain>Rather, it might be due to aromatic π-stacking between the nicotinamide moiety of NMN/NaMN and tyrosine/phenylalanine aromatic ring, as predicted by the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler web site [29], not only for the NaMN structurally aligned to the crystal structure of AtCinA (Fig 7A), but also for that crystallized in TtPncC (PDB code 4UOC) [22] (Fig 7B), with an average distance of 3.3 Å between the centroids of the aromatic rings in both structures, as calculated by Chimera (Fig 7) [32]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="55758" pm="."><plain>This mutational analysis also pointed to the total loss of activity in R145A but, in this case, the changes induced in the structure seemed to be responsible for the loss in activity, as confirmed by the 31°C decrease in Tm compared with that of wild type enzyme (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55759" pm="."><plain>This result agrees with that previously described by Raffaelli´s group for the equivalent R142A mutant in E. coli using circular dichroism [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55760" pm="."><plain>These authors found a different fingerprint for the side chains in the near-UV spectrum compared with that of wild type, and concluded that R142A is less structured [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55761" pm="."><plain>By contrast, a well-structured near-UV spectrum was found in Y56A (Y58A in AtCinA) [23], which also agrees with the result found in the thermal shift assay carried out with AtCinA Y58A mutant (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55762" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of activity in S31A and K63A mutants, with no apparently important changes in their structures according to the similar Tm values obtained compared with that of wild type (Table 1), reinforces the Ser/Lys catalytic dyad mechanism proposed by Raffaelli´s group [23], in which, K63 acts a general base activating S31 for the nucleophilic attack of the amide bond of the nicotinamide moiety, giving rise to the oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate stabilized by main chain amides of C32 and G106 (Fig 7A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55763" pm="."><plain>By contrasts, in the asparaginase II-like catalytic mechanism proposed by Derrick´s group [22], a water molecule activated by K301 (K63 in AtCinA) produced the nucleophilic attack on the amide bond, and then, the oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate formed with amino acids L270 and G431 was rearranged with the aid of T340 (T105 in AtCinA) and K301 [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55764" pm="."><plain>However, these two latter amino acids are separated in the TtPncC crystal structure by 6.6 Å (Fig 7B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55765" pm="."><plain>This distance, together with the fact that T340 is not strictly conserved in the CinA family, where it is replaced by a serine (e.g. S103 in EcCinA) in half of the family [23] and the fact that AtCinA T105A mutant still preserves activity (Table 1; Fig 6), make the proposed asparaginase II-like catalytic mechanism less likely. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="55767" pm="."><plain>The NMN deamidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens was cloned in E. coli, overexpressed, and purified to obtain a stable 41-kDa homodimeric protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55768" pm="."><plain>The enzyme was able to hydrolyze NMN with a catalytic efficiency similar to the best efficiencies found for NMN deamidases, but with higher thermal and pH stabilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55769" pm="."><plain>These relevant operational characteristics open up the possibility of developing a cost-effective enzymatic process for obtaining NaMN, which along with other NAD+ analogs and related mononucleotides, is now considered a promising potential therapeutic agent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55770" pm="."><plain>Finally, the mutational analysis carried out supported the classification of AtCinA in the Ser/Lys amidohydrolase family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55771" pm="."><plain>However, further structural and biochemical research is needed to confirm this catalytic mechanism of NMN deamidase activity in other members of the CinA family. </plain></SENT>
