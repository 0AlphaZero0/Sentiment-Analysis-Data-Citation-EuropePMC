<SENT sid="55916" pm="."><plain>Elevated lipid concentrations during childhood track into adulthood and increase the risk of CVD, and thus morbidity and mortality [6–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55917" pm="."><plain>Similarly, obesity tracks into adulthood [10, 11], and is positively associated with dyslipidemia [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55918" pm="."><plain>Up to 27% of Danish [13] and 43% of American children and adolescents [14] with overweight/obesity exhibit dyslipidemia, and early treatment and prevention is required [2]. <p><text><SENT sid="55919" pm="."><plain>The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends that children with obesity or familial aggregation of hyperlipidemia should have their lipid concentrations monitored regularly [15]. </plain></SENT>

Lipid concentrations differ with age, sex, and ethnicity [15], and accordingly age and sex specific reference values from each region/ethnicity is warranted. Current cut-offs for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents are based on data from the North American National Cholesterol Education Program [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="55924" pm="."><plain>Based on these cut-offs, 20% of American adolescents exhibit dyslipidemia [20]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56051" pm="."><plain>This study provides reference values for fasting plasma concentrations of TC, LDL, HDL, non-HDL, and TG in a population-based cohort of Danish/North-European White children and adolescents. In addition, the study evaluates the association of overweight and obesity with these variables. We calculated the percentiles in both the total population-based cohort and in a normal-weight subgroup of the cohort. Excluding the individuals with overweight/obesity in the population-based cohort did not change the reference curves markedly other than on the first decimal in some of the upper percentiles. This offers no clinical relevance, since the accuracies of the analysis methods exhibit a higher variation than the differences in values between the total population-based cohort and the normal-weight subgroup. We therefore generated reference percentiles for the entire population-based cohort. <p><text><SENT sid="56057" pm="."><plain>Except for the concentrations of TG, the lipid concentrations varied more throughout childhood and adolescence in boys compared to girls, with the reference curves in boys exhibiting a biphasic pattern for TC, LDL, HDL, and non-HDL, and a steady increase for TG. The reference levels at the 50th and 90th percentile in both a French cohort (N = 1976 (1004 girls), age 7 − 20 years) and a German cohort (N = 2571 (1226 girls), age 0 − 16 years), albeit showing comparable patterns throughout childhood, exhibited higher concentrations for TC, LDL, and TG, but similar levels of the HDL concentrations in both sexes compared to our study [21, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56059" pm="."><plain>Differences in overweight/obesity prevalences do not explain this difference, as the prevalences of overweight and obesity in Germany, France, and Denmark are comparable [18, 31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56060" pm="."><plain>In addition, only lean subjects were included in the French study [30], and in the present study, the 50th percentile did not change, when including the underweight, overweight, and obese individuals from the population-based cohort. <p><text><SENT sid="56061" pm="."><plain>Non-HDL concentrations among children and adolescents are more indicative of persistent dyslipidemia compared to TC, LDL, or HDL [5], and in a meta-analysis of 233,455 adults a more potent marker of cardiovascular risk than LDL [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56062" pm="."><plain>In our study, concentrations of non-HDL were not affected by puberty in either sex, and in girls not affected by age. In boys, concentrations were lower in the oldest age group of boys compared with the middle age group of boys. In contrast, a study in Slovakian children and adolescents found a negative effect of age on non-HDL in both girls and boys [34]. <p><text><SENT sid="56065" pm="."><plain>Through all ages and in both sexes in the present study, children from the TCOC cohort exhibited higher concentrations of TC, LDL, non-HDL, and TG, and lower concentrations of HDL than the population-based cohort, underlining the reports from a previous study on the effects of obesity on fasting plasma lipid concentrations [13, 35]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56066" pm="."><plain>In the German cohort, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was similar to what is previously described in US children and adolescents (N = 1482 (725 girls), age 8 − 17 years) [20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56067" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of dyslipidemia in our cohort was considerably lower than described in both of these cohorts. The difference to the German cohort may in part be explained by their inclusion of a cohort with obesity from an obesity clinic, where the degree of obesity may have been higher than the overall degree of obesity in the population, even though the prevalence of obesity in their cohort resembled the overall German prevalence of obesity [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56069" pm="."><plain>In the present study, a higher OR for dyslipidemia was observed in the TCOC cohort compared to the subgroup with overweight/obesity from the population-based cohort; a difference that was correlated with differences in BMI SDS. This indicates that differences in the degree of obesity may influence the prevalence of dyslipidemia in a given cohort. Similarly, the difference in prevalences of dyslipidemia between our cohort and the American cohort may be explained by the difference in the prevalences of obesity, being higher in USA and with increasing prevalence of extreme obesity [17–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56072" pm="."><plain>In the present study we focused on fasting concentrations of lipids and dyslipidemia. Future studies should investigate the distribution and effect of obesity on other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and insulin resistance, and the possible effects – individually and combined – of multiple risk factors present concomitantly in children and adolescents. <p><text><SENT sid="56074" pm="."><plain>A limitation to our study was the lack of diet registration. Nevertheless, adherence to the fasting state was assured by interview on the morning of the blood sampling. If the participant was not fasting, another appointment for blood sampling was made. <p><text><SENT sid="56077" pm="."><plain>During the study period, methods for blood sample analysis changed at the laboratory that analyzed our samples. This was due to hospital administrative decisions not related to this study. The comparability of the results was ensured, by applying a quality control analysis on all measurements performed at the laboratory in 2012 (Cobas® 6000) and 2014 (Dimension Vista®1500). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56080" pm="."><plain>The variation between the Cobas® 6000 and the Dimension Vista®1500 in measured concentrations of HDL and TG was less than the intra-assay variation, indicating that it may not have been necessary to apply a correction factor on these variables. Accordingly, applying the conversion factors on the lipid concentrations did not change any of the conclusions in the study. <p><text><SENT sid="56082" pm="."><plain>In the population-based sample, the pubertal developmental stage was self-evaluated with picture pattern recognition due to practical considerations. Thus, this method of determining puberty might be less accurate than the same evaluation done by a trained pediatrician; however, self-evaluated puberty distinguishing between the pre-pubertal and pubertal stage has been shown to be reliable in epidemiological studies [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="56084" pm="."><plain>The effects of puberty on lipid concentrations did not differ from the effects of age in our cohorts. Thus, we consider age to be the most straightforward way to define references for fasting plasma lipid concentrations in Danish/North-European children and adolescents. The references defined by the present study are presented both as charts easy to use for the clinicians plotting the values of their patients and monitoring progressions, and in tables for integration into electronic laboratory systems. <p><text><SENT sid="56087" pm="."><plain>The primary strength of the study was a large cohort of healthy Danish children recruited from schools, public dentists, and healthcare nurses in 11 municipalities in Denmark, with an extensive phenotype collected alongside biochemical markers. In addition, the TCOC cohort, a cohort of children and adolescents with overweight/obesity, was collected during the same period of time and provided information on the effects of obesity on the lipid concentrations, elucidating the health-related impact obesity has on human metabolism at an early age. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec id="Sec18"><title><text><SENT sid="56089" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="56090" pm="."><plain>This study provides reference values for fasting plasma lipid concentrations for both sexes in the age range 6 − 19 years in Danish/North-European whites. Different patterns for girls and boys were observed for lipid concentrations throughout childhood and adolescence. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effects of obesity on lipid concentrations in childhood including an increased risk of dyslipidemia, which might predispose the children with obesity to premature CVD morbidity and mortality later in life. </sec></SecTag><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><text><SENT sid="56093" pm="."><plain>Additional files </plain></SENT>
