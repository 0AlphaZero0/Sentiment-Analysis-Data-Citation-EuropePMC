</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57011" pm="."><plain>There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that children derive cognitive benefits from participating in physical activity, with changes in cognitive function induced by physical activity proposed as a mechanism for improved academic performance (Howie and Pate, 2012; Tomporowski et al., 2015; Donnelly et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57012" pm="."><plain>For example, Howie and Pate (2012) hypothesized a model for the causal links in their systematic review, where cognitive function acts as a mediator in the relation between physical activity (as well as physical fitness, and sports participation) and academic performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57013" pm="."><plain>Across the range of cognitive functions it is the higher-level executive functions that are shown to benefit the most from physical activity (Hillman et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57014" pm="."><plain>Executive functions encompass inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, functions that are distinguishable, but moderately correlated with each other (Miyake et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57015" pm="."><plain>Despite a rapid growth in studies investigating relations between physical activity and executive function and/or academic performance, most evidence is cross-sectional and only investigates single links. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57016" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only the studies by Rigoli et al. (2012) and Roebers et al. (2014) have tested the mediation effects of executive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57017" pm="."><plain>Rigoli et al. (2012) showed that working memory mediated the relation between motor coordination and academic performance in an adolescent sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57018" pm="."><plain>A major limitation in their study, however, was the cross-sectional design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57019" pm="."><plain>In order to claim mediation, evidence of change would need to be demonstrated (Little, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57020" pm="."><plain>Roebers et al. (2014) examined the predictive value of fine motor skills, intelligence, and executive function on academic performance 2 years later in preschool children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57021" pm="."><plain>They showed that executive function plays a role in the link between motor skills and academic performance, as the prediction of academic performance from fine motor skills and intelligence was no longer significant when executive function was added in the model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57022" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no significant effect was evident for a link between fine motor skills and executive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57023" pm="."><plain>Fine motor skills, intelligence, and executive function covaried, suggesting that executive function processes are shared mechanisms involved in both fine motor tasks and intelligence tests. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57024" pm="."><plain>Concerning this limited evidence for the executive function hypothesis, this study examined whether executive function mediated a possible prospective relation between indices of physical activity and academic performance in a cohort of 1,129 Norwegian elementary schoolchildren. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57025" pm="."><plain>The term “indices of physical activity” includes accelerometer measures [overall physical activity (counts per minute, cpm), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sedentary time], aerobic fitness, and motor skills. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57026" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesized model is illustrated in Figure 1. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="57029" pm="."><plain>A position paper published in 2016 concluded that physical activity has a neutral to positive effect on academic performance (Donnelly et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57030" pm="."><plain>The evidence base for this conclusion, however, is sparse and has important limitations, as randomized controlled studies of high quality are lacking (Singh et al., 2012; Mura et al., 2015; Donnelly et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57031" pm="."><plain>A recent intervention study by Mullender-Wijnsma et al. (2016) found improved performance in mathematics and spelling after 2 years of physically active mathematics and language lessons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57032" pm="."><plain>However, neither the 5-month Learning, Cognition, and motion (LCoMotion) trial (Tarp et al., 2016), nor the 7-month ASK trial (Resaland et al., 2016), found evidence for an effect of physical activity interventions on academic performance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57033" pm="."><plain>There is stronger evidence for a positive relation between physical activity and executive function, than between physical activity and academic performance (Donnelly et al., 2016; Vazou et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57034" pm="."><plain>Laboratory research has reported both superior brain function and structure in more fit compared to less fit children (see Chaddock et al., 2011; Khan and Hillman, 2014 for reviews). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57035" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these studies are cross-sectional and are thus unable to demonstrate a causal link. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57036" pm="."><plain>Three pathways have been suggested by which physical activity could affect executive function (Best, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57037" pm="."><plain>First, participation in aerobic physical activity may induce physiological changes in the brain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57038" pm="."><plain>Second, the cognitive demands inherent in goal-directed physical activities (e.g., group games) may also develop cognitive skills that can transfer to executive function tasks, and finally, the cognitive demands in executing complex motor tasks may induce physiological changes in the brain (Best, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57039" pm="."><plain>Hence, research has focused on both the quantitative (dose) and qualitative (type) characteristics of physical activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57040" pm="."><plain>These studies have reported both a dose-response relation between physical activity and executive functions (Davis et al., 2011; Hillman et al., 2014), and evidence for the importance of the cognitive demands inherent in physical activity through social interaction and complex motor skill tasks on executive functions (Crova et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2015; Pesce et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57041" pm="."><plain>Recently, Schmidt et al. (2015) demonstrated that although both an intervention with group-games and an intervention with individual aerobic exercise increased aerobic fitness, only the group-game intervention improved cognitive flexibility. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57042" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Pesce et al. (2016) showed the effects of an enriched physical education intervention consisting of both cognitively challenging activities and motor coordination compared to traditional physical education on inhibition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57043" pm="."><plain>Despite the promising evidence of several pathways by which physical activity may affect executive functions, the effects of different kinds of physical activities (aerobic, coordinative, and cognitively engaging) on executive function is still unknown due to the large heterogeneity in the existing intervention studies investigating these questions (Vazou et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57044" pm="."><plain>The present study used objectively measured physical activity levels, aerobic fitness, and motor skills as predictors in separate mediation models, to investigate their possible different relations to executive function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57045" pm="."><plain>There is a clear link between executive functioning and academic performance (Bull and Scerif, 2001; St Clair-Thompson and Gathercole, 2006; Best et al., 2011; Bull and Lee, 2014; Cantin et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57046" pm="."><plain>Mathematics and reading are complex skills that reflect executive function skills such as selecting and coordinating different executive function components (Best et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57047" pm="."><plain>Even though the content in mathematics and reading are very different, their patterns of correlations to executive functions across age are similar (Best et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57048" pm="."><plain>This similarity indicates that the same cognitive processes are important to both reading and mathematics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57049" pm="."><plain>The present study examines the relation between executive function and performance on national tests of numeracy, reading, and English (as a second language). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57050" pm="."><plain>Against this evidence for the hypothesized links of indices of physical activity to executive function and academic performance, the present study extends previous research aiming to investigate whether executive function is a mediator in a prospective relation between indices of physical activity (objectively measured physical activity, aerobic fitness, and motor skill) and academic performance in numeracy, reading, and English. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57051" pm="."><plain>Since MVPA and sedentary time are separate dimensions of activity (Sedentary Behaviour Research Network, 2012), their possible different predictions of executive function and academic performance were examined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57052" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, as sex-specific associations were observed between aerobic fitness and motor skills, and executive function and academic performance, in a previous study (Aadland et al., 2017a), we also examined if the mediation of executive function was different in girls and boys. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57794" pm="."><plain>The main finding from the present study was that executive function generally did not mediate the prospective relations between indices of physical activity and academic performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57795" pm="."><plain>Supplementing a direct link between motor skills and numeracy, we observed a small partial mediation effect through executive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57796" pm="."><plain>Executive function predicted numeracy and reading 7 months later. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57797" pm="."><plain>Our findings generally do not support a hypothesized model in which executive function mediates the relations between indices of physical activity and academic performance (Howie and Pate, 2012; Tomporowski et al., 2015; Donnelly et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57798" pm="."><plain>Our predictors were associated with neither executive function nor academic performance, and our findings contrast with the conclusions drawn in recent systematic reviews, based on a small number of high-quality studies (Singh et al., 2012; Donnelly et al., 2016), that identified a positive relation between indices of physical activity, academic performance and even more so executive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57799" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only Roebers et al. (2014) have previously examined whether executive function mediates the relation between fine motor skills and academic performance in children using a longitudinal design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57800" pm="."><plain>As the present study measured multiple predictors, it adds knowledge about the genuine prospective role of different indices of physical activity to executive function and academic performance. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57801" pm="."><plain>Neither physical activity, sedentary time, nor aerobic fitness predicted executive function or academic performance 7 months later indicate a consistent pattern of findings. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57802" pm="."><plain>Aerobic fitness is frequently used as a proxy of physical activity, as it is partly determined by the physical strain induced by MVPA, and also due to its superior measurement precision compared to physical activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57803" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that the effect of physical activity on executive function and academic performance operates through aerobic fitness (Tomporowski et al., 2011), as physical activity increasing aerobic fitness causes physiological changes in the brain that influence cognitive functioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57804" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is partly supported by the cross-sectional study by Lambourne et al. (2013) in which aerobic fitness mediated the relation between physical activity and performance in mathematics, but not in reading and spelling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57805" pm="."><plain>However, their indirect estimate was very low (0.003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57806" pm="."><plain>Our longitudinal study does not provide support for this hypothesis, as no link was observed between aerobic fitness and executive function at follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57807" pm="."><plain>However, previous longitudinal studies have revealed positive relation between aerobic fitness and both executive function (Niederer et al., 2011; Chaddock et al., 2012) and academic performance (London and Castrechini, 2011; Wittberg et al., 2012; Bezold et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57808" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the present study, Booth et al. (2014) observed that the proportion of time spent in MVPA predicted performance in English and mathematics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57809" pm="."><plain>Aggio et al. (2016) observed that higher levels of sedentary time were associated with improved cognitive performance 3 years later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57810" pm="."><plain>In the present study, higher levels of sedentary time were associated with increased performance in English, but not in numeracy or reading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57811" pm="."><plain>An explanation for this finding might be that children partly learn their English from screen-based, and thus sedentary, forms of entertainment (Cliff et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57812" pm="."><plain>A considerable heterogeneity exists across the studies examining relations between indices of physical activity and cognitive outcomes, opening up for inconsistent findings in the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57813" pm="."><plain>We cannot exclude the possibility that we failed adequately to identify expected links as a result of measurement error or methodological problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57814" pm="."><plain>Although, all assessments used in the present study have been shown to be appropriate and valid for the included age group (Council of Europe, 1993; Riva et al., 2000; Wechsler, 2003; Reitan and Wolfson, 2004; Ardila et al., 2006; Peru et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2007; Andersen et al., 2008; De Vries et al., 2009; Utdanningsdirektoratet, 2013; Aadland et al., 2014), our null-findings might be a type 2 error as a result of measurement errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57815" pm="."><plain>Although, accelerometer-determined physical activity is more reliable than self-report, it does nevertheless have well-known limitations (Ekelund et al., 2007; Corder et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57816" pm="."><plain>For example, our measure of physical activity levels over 4–7 days might be an insufficient snapshot of a child's complex physical activity behavior (Ekelund et al., 2007), despite reliability (intra-class correlation) of accelerometry of ~0.70–0.80 for monitoring in children over 3–7 days (Aadland and Johannessen, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57817" pm="."><plain>As is well known, measurement error in predictors can lead to regression dilution bias, which underestimates the paths between the predictors and the mediator (Cole and Maxwell, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57818" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the lack of a prospective link between MVPA and executive function has also been shown by others (Booth et al., 2013; Aggio et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57819" pm="."><plain>Underestimation of the link between the mediator and the outcome may also be present in our models, as a result of measurement errors in the academic performance scores we used. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57820" pm="."><plain>Our failure to identify links between predictors and executive function, in contrast with the existing literature (Donnelly et al., 2016), might also be explained by the use of different statistical approaches to examine these relations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57821" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, only the study by Roebers et al. (2014) have previously used structural equation modeling, treating executive function as a latent factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57822" pm="."><plain>Our rationale for using a latent factor was two-fold; first, to take into account the known impurity issues observed in executive function tasks (Cassidy, 2016) as we only had one measure of each domain, and second, to avoid measurement errors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57823" pm="."><plain>The exclusion of measurement errors in our mediator enhances reliability, and avoids underestimation of both the a and b path and an overestimation of the direct link which is the case for observational mediator variables (Cole and Maxwell, 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57824" pm="."><plain>Possibly, using latent variables of each dimension of executive function might have yielded other results, as randomized controlled trials have reported effects of indices of physical activity on only one aspect of executive functions and not the others (Schmidt et al., 2015; Pesce et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57825" pm="."><plain>However, such an approach would have required a more comprehensive test battery, which was not feasible for the present study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57826" pm="."><plain>The selection of executive function tasks might also explain our null findings, as we did not include tasks measuring reaction time or accuracy, which would have allowed more fine-grained analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57827" pm="."><plain>For example, Syvaoja et al. (2014) observed cross-sectional associations between objectively measured physical activity and both reaction time and rapid visual information processing, but not with other tests of executive function. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57828" pm="."><plain>The longitudinal design of the present study differs from the majority of existing evidence stemming from cross-sectional studies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57829" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a cross-sectional examination of our mediation models supports the executive function hypothesis proposed in previous studies (Howie and Pate, 2012; Rigoli et al., 2012; Tomporowski et al., 2015; Donnelly et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57830" pm="."><plain>More specifically, indirect effects through executive function were present for the cross-sectional relations between both aerobic fitness and all tests of motor skills and academic performance in numeracy, reading, and English (results not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57831" pm="."><plain>Yet, cross-sectional studies lack a temporal relation between the exposure and outcome, and are unable to demonstrate causation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57832" pm="."><plain>Thus, the half-longitudinal approach applied in the present study is a significant improvement compared to cross-sectional testing of mediation, as we were able to control for prior levels of the mediator and the outcome, and thus examining the influence of their change (Little, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57833" pm="."><plain>The use of only two measurement time points however, poses a limitation to the present study, as the path between the predictor and the mediator, and the path between the mediator and the outcome, are measured at the same time point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57834" pm="."><plain>An assumption therefore is that these paths would have had time-ordered relations if more than two occasions of measurement were obtained (Little, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57835" pm="."><plain>Hence, studies replicating our analysis with more than two time points of measurement are warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57836" pm="."><plain>Another explanation for our null findings may be the short duration of our follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57837" pm="."><plain>7 months might have been an insufficient duration to cause a change in executive function and academic performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57838" pm="."><plain>Assuming that change in executive function will result from structural changes in the brain, sufficient time for the predictor to affect structural changes in the brain is necessary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57839" pm="."><plain>In order to observe changes in academic performance, it is possible that a longer time is necessary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57840" pm="."><plain>For example, the study by Mullender-Wijnsma et al. (2016) found effects on academic performance after 2 years but not after 1 year of physically active mathematics and language lessons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57841" pm="."><plain>Other studies using shorter physical activity intervention length (5–7 months) have not revealed effects on academic performance or executive functions (Resaland et al., 2016; Tarp et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57842" pm="."><plain>On the other side, a 7-month follow-up period also impose noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57843" pm="."><plain>As a prerequisite for our prospective examinations, our indices of physical activity measured at baseline represents the child's supposed physical activity level, aerobic fitness, and motor skills during the follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57844" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot rule out the possibility of fluctuations from the baseline measures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57845" pm="."><plain>Levels of physical activity may have been less stable over the follow-up period (Jones et al., 2013), compared to aerobic fitness and motor skills, as it represents a behavior and not a personal trait. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57846" pm="."><plain>Following this line of reasoning, our observed significant prediction for the Shuttle Run test on both executive function and academic performance, might be explained by the stability of this trait over time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57847" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Pesce and Ben-Soussan (2016) suggest that motor skills have a longer-lasting predictive value of cognitive efficiency compared to aerobic fitness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57848" pm="."><plain>A prospective association for motor skills with executive function has also been observed in previous studies (Niederer et al., 2011; Roebers et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57849" pm="."><plain>Following up on the prediction of motor skills to executive function and academic performance, executive function mediated the relation between the Shuttle Run and academic performance in numeracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57850" pm="."><plain>These findings may be explained by the close parallelism of development and interaction between neural substrates of motor coordination (the cerebellum) and executive function the (prefrontal cortex; Diamond, 2000; Koziol et al., 2012; Rigoli et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57851" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the concept of embodied cognition directly links movements to thought, where executive functions are seen as an extension of the motor control system (Koziol et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57852" pm="."><plain>The review by Best (2010) suggests that engaging in activities that are complex in terms of motor coordination may transfer executive function skills to other contexts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57853" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the magnitude of both the direct and indirect links between motor skills and academic performance in the present study was small (standardized coefficient of −0.016), emphasizing the need for more research examining this relation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57854" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, taken into account the large number of mediation models analyzed, which potentially may increase the type 1 error rate, it could be a chance finding that should be interpreted carefully (Ioannidis, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57855" pm="."><plain>The lack of mediation for the two other measures of motor skills, Aiming and Catching, may support this line of reasoning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57856" pm="."><plain>However, we found a low pre-to-post correlation for Aiming (r = 0.27), indicating poor reliability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57857" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, pre-to-posttest correlations for Catching and Shuttle Run were 0.66 and 0.70, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57858" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the present study's findings, both the study by Rigoli et al. (2012) (cross-sectional) and Pesce et al. (2016) (RCT) highlight that the subgroup Aiming and Catching from the Movement ABC is linked to executive function and academic achievement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57859" pm="."><plain>Finally, our contrasting findings to the present literature might be attributable to publication bias in the literature, as also considered by Howie and Pate (2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57860" pm="."><plain>It is possible that positive findings have been highlighted despite mixed findings, or that the variables reported were selected on the basis of positive findings (Ioannidis, 2005; Howland, 2011; Howie and Pate, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="57861" pm="."><plain>We found that executive function predicts numeracy and reading, which is in line with previous research (St Clair-Thompson and Gathercole, 2006; Best et al., 2011; Cantin et al., 2016; Samuels et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57862" pm="."><plain>A close link between numeracy and reading has been demonstrated previously (Bull et al., 2008; Best et al., 2011), and a study by Cantin et al. (2016) revealed that reading mediated the influence of executive function on mathematics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57863" pm="."><plain>The Norwegian national tests of both numeracy and reading reflect integrated tasks across several subjects, and require both problem solving and metacognition, with high demands on executive functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57864" pm="."><plain>The test in English, however, focuses on grammar and vocabulary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57865" pm="."><plain>It is possible that these tasks put less demand on executive functions, explaining the lack of relation between executive functions and English. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57866" pm="."><plain>Randomized controlled trials have revealed that the effect of indices of physical activity to cognition are selective to aspects of cognition that required extensive amounts of executive functions (Kamijo et al., 2011; Hillman et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec><title><text><SENT sid="57867" pm="."><plain>Strengths and limitations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="57868" pm="."><plain>The main strengths of the present study were the longitudinal design with inclusion of a large sample of 10-year-old children. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57869" pm="."><plain>We furthermore adjusted for the effect of clustering of observations within schools, as well as several covariates in our analyses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57870" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot rule out that factors being important for the relations examined were not taken into consideration; for example, the child's motivation, other academic activities, quality of life, home environment, nutritional habits, or sleep (Tomporowski et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57871" pm="."><plain>Another, strength is the use of structural equation modeling including a latent variable of executive function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57872" pm="."><plain>This approach excludes measurement errors in our executive function factor, thus increasing its reliability and validity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57873" pm="."><plain>However, the latent variable comprising executive function obtained only partial invariance which might have conceptual implications (Putnick and Bornstein, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57874" pm="."><plain>Yet, partial invariance across time for executive functions might be expected in this case. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57875" pm="."><plain>Executive functions in these fifth-grade children typically undergo developmental changes giving rise to changes in how such functions are conceptualized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57876" pm="."><plain>Moreover, through learning and experience children might acquire skills that reorganize and expands their cognitive abilities which as well have implications for how executive functions are cognitively processed (Putnick and Bornstein, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57877" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the analyses of several predictors, gives the opportunity to investigate different indices of physical activity to both executive function and academic performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="57878" pm="."><plain>However, this also increases the chance of performing Type 1 errors, meaning that our results should be interpreted cautiously. </plain></SENT>
