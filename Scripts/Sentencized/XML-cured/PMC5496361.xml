</text></title><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="58335" pm="."><plain>Foot drop is the inability or difficulty to voluntarily lift the foot due to weak or absent ankle dorsiflexors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58336" pm="."><plain>It is commonly caused by stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord trauma [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58337" pm="."><plain>To avoid foot dragging during the swing phase of the gait, patients with foot drop adopt abnormal gait patterns characterized by hip hitching, circumduction and toe catch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58338" pm="."><plain>These distortions of the gait pattern lead to a decrease in the gait velocity and walking endurance, longer stance and double support gait phases, an increased energy cost, instability and a tendency to trip and fall [2]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="58339" pm="."><plain>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an active approach for treating foot drop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58340" pm="."><plain>It is a technique that relies on the production of short bursts of electrical pulses to induce contraction by eliciting an action potential in the motor neurons that innervate a muscle [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58341" pm="."><plain>FES principles can be employed for the therapeutic treatment of foot drop and/or in the form of an active assistive orthotic device for daily use and the long-term replacement of the impaired motor function [2, 4–7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58342" pm="."><plain>FES-based therapeutic and assistive devices for foot drop correction typically stimulate the common peroneal nerve in the swing phase of the gait to ensure foot lifting, i.e., the dorsiflexion (DF) of the ankle (for a review, see references [8, 9]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58343" pm="."><plain>Moreover, producing plantar flexion (PF) with FES during the pre-swing phase of the gait results in better knee flexion, which also facilitates the swing phase [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="58344" pm="."><plain>The most common challenges in foot drop FES applications are determining motor points, i.e., adequately positioning the electrodes, setting stimulation parameters that produce comfortable foot lift without unnatural foot eversion or inversion, and increased muscle fatigue from electrically induced contraction [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58345" pm="."><plain>Currently available commercial systems stimulate dorsiflexion only; they do not compensate for eversion (EV) or inversion (IV) and do not support push-off due to the complexity of proper electrode positioning [11, 14–16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="58346" pm="."><plain>One of the options for overcoming these issues is the use of multi-pad surface electrodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58347" pm="."><plain>Multi-pad electrodes comprise many relatively small stimulation pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58348" pm="."><plain>Each pad can be activated separately or as a part of a stimulation pattern, i.e., a set of individual pads that are associated with different parameters, including the pulse width and amplitude [17–20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58349" pm="."><plain>Multi-pad systems aim to improve the selectivity of stimulation and provide easier and faster electrode donning and doffing [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="58350" pm="."><plain>However, many pads increase the number of possible combinations for stimulation electrode shaping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58351" pm="."><plain>Defining the stimulation patterns can be time consuming and laborious and requires medical training and knowledge of neurophysiology and anatomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58352" pm="."><plain>Therefore, novel FES systems may benefit greatly from an automated stimulation electrode shaping process that does not rely on precise or finely reproducible electrode positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58353" pm="."><plain>Such an automated process can reduce the clinicians’ time and effort in therapeutic applications of FES and increase the users’ independence in terms of the everyday use of a FES system in assistive applications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="58354" pm="."><plain>Several groups have investigated the design of multi-pad stimulation systems and control algorithms for the automatic shaping of stimulation patterns/electrodes [14, 23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58355" pm="."><plain>Elsaify presented a proof of concept for using muscle twitches for the selection of stimulation patterns for DF induction using multiple individual electrodes positioned over the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and an inertial sensor on the foot for recording the twitch responses [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58356" pm="."><plain>Heller et al. described the principle of searching for an optimal 4 × 4 pad electrode within an 8 × 8 pad cathode placed over the peroneal nerve, with a common anode over the TA muscle [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58357" pm="."><plain>More recently, Valtin et al. described a FES system for foot drop with the control of DF and EV during the swing phase of the gait by two decoupled iterative learning controllers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58358" pm="."><plain>They employed two automatically tuned multi-pad electrodes, one over the TA muscle and the other over the area of the peroneal nerve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58359" pm="."><plain>Foot movements were monitored with 2 inertial measurement units at the shank and foot [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58360" pm="."><plain>In a recent publication, Kenney et al. described a ShefStim device [15, 26] array-based FES system for the correction of foot drop that comprises a three-phase search algorithm for finding an appropriate candidate out of 25 stimulation patterns within a multi-pad array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58361" pm="."><plain>Prenton et al. tested the automatic algorithm for stimulation pattern selection described by Kenney et al. [15] for unsupervised use by individuals with foot drop [27]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="58362" pm="."><plain>Although FES-induced ankle DF can correct foot drop, it also decreases knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion at the toe-off in the swing phase of the gait, which decreases the propulsive force generated during the transition from the stance phase to the swing phase [28], which in turn implies a need for more complex stimulation patterns in systems for FES-assisted gait, including the support of movements other than DF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58363" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available multi-pad FES systems for foot drop treatment support the induction of both DF and PF movement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58364" pm="."><plain>An assistive benefit of introducing electrically induced PF during FES-assisted walking is the enhancement of the propulsive force during the push-off phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58365" pm="."><plain>In addition to assistive effects, the therapeutic effects of FES that presumably arise through the facilitation of neural plasticity by increasing the strength of afferent inputs are also important to consider when designing a closed-loop FES system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58366" pm="."><plain>In particular, an FES system in which the timing of the electrical input that creates the afferent feedback is synchronized with the electrophysiological correlate of voluntary movement (i.e., EMG or a position sensor) has been shown to facilitate neural plasticity (for a review, see [29]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58367" pm="."><plain>Therefore, creating a natural, temporally precise sequence of phases (i.e., a FES-induced DF in the swing phase and a PF in the push-off phase of the gait) during FES-assisted walking therapy may further enhance motor recovery via the synchronization of sensory and motor information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="58368" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to clinically test a novel foot drop device supporting the induction of both DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58369" pm="."><plain>Because the system was based on multi-pad technology, we introduced and described a dedicated decision support system (DSS) to facilitate the process of defining the stimulation patterns for inducing ankle DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58370" pm="."><plain>The novel foot drop device that was the focus of this study comprised a custom-designed multi-pad electrode, an electrical stimulator, and a single inertial sensor (Fesia Walk, Tecnalia R&amp;I, Donostia/San Sebastián, Spain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58371" pm="."><plain>The novelty of the applied methodology lies in the multi-pad electrode design and positioning, covering the branches of peroneal and tibial nerves for supporting both DF and PF and a dedicated DSS for easier shaping of the DF and PF stimulation patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="58372" pm="."><plain>An additional goal was the clinical evaluation of the performance of the DSS for the automatic identification of high-quality pads for further electrode shaping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58373" pm="."><plain>A qualitative assessment of the DSS output was conducted by comparing the pads suggested by the DSS with the pads selected by trained rehabilitation specialists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58374" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we analyzed the variability of pads included in the DF/PF stimulation patterns during 20 daily sessions in 10 stroke patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58375" pm="."><plain>We also tracked the changes in the patients’ active and FES-induced ankle range of motion to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the proposed FES methodology for inducing good-quality movement. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58562" pm="."><plain>The results concerning pads included in the DF and PF patterns showed a global inter-patient spatial grouping of Set(DF)FIN and Set(PF)FIN. This effect is reflected in the results presented in Fig. 6, showing the percentages of the pad inclusions in the final DF and PF patterns for all patients and sessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58563" pm="."><plain>The most probable surface areas of custom multi-pad electrodes identified showed that the electrode zones for activating DF and PF are clearly separated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58564" pm="."><plain>The majority of the selected pads were concentrated in the 3 × 2 pad sections, which corresponded to a 5.70 × 3.70 cm area. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58565" pm="."><plain>When derived for individual patients, the global mean pads were all distributed within 1.6 pad sizes or 2.72 cm for DF and 1.3 pad sizes or 2.21 cm for PF, indicating relatively little inter-patient variability of the optimal stimulation areas for DF and PF induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58566" pm="."><plain>This grouping is in accordance with the underlying anatomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58567" pm="."><plain>The majority of the pads included in Set(PF)FIN were located in the half of the electrode positioned over the medial popliteal area and targeted the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve (i.e., the left half of the electrode in Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58568" pm="."><plain>The majority of pads included in Set(DF)FIN were in the half of the electrode that targeted the common peroneal nerve, passing through the lateral aspect of the popliteal fossa (i.e., the right half of the electrode in Fig. 6) [35]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par94"><text><SENT sid="58569" pm="."><plain>Another important outcome of this study is the analysis of the inter-session variability of pads included in Set(DF)FIN and Set(PF)FIN for each patient. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58570" pm="."><plain>The possible sources of the observed effect may be attributed to slight differences in garment donning from session to session, changes in skin-electrode impedance and/or differences in the shank circumference due to swelling or changes in tissue hydration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58571" pm="."><plain>All sources of variability listed cannot be avoided in realistic clinical or daily life applications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58572" pm="."><plain>These results support the necessity of employing multi-pad electrodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58573" pm="."><plain>Their major advantage over conventional electrodes is the ability to shape the stimulation area in an optimal manner without precise positioning, as the group of pads covers a larger area of interest, which could also indicate why commercially available foot drop systems with a single pair of electrodes are not able to provide reliable ankle dorsiflexion at all times. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par95"><text><SENT sid="58574" pm="."><plain>Our methodology was aimed at producing an adaptable stimulation pattern shape while retaining relatively small individual pad areas that provided increased selectivity of stimulation [20, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58575" pm="."><plain>However, a group of smaller pads within the array increases the number of the possible combinations for designing a stimulation pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58576" pm="."><plain>Testing all of these combinations is time consuming and exhausting for both clients and clinicians, which leads to the need for a fully automated algorithm; the DSS described in this study is the first step toward such a goal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58577" pm="."><plain>The fact that the final pads included formed two spatially distinct areas provides an opportunity to preselect certain pads for DF and PF and further reduce the search-zone per movement type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58578" pm="."><plain>The results presented in Table 2 indicate that 5 different pads were most frequently identified for DF electrode shaping, and those pads were used in more than 50% of the sessions (&gt;10) in 6 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58579" pm="."><plain>For PF electrode shaping, 6 different pads were most frequently identified, and the most frequent pads were used in 50% sessions or more only in 2 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58580" pm="."><plain>This result further confirms the variability of optimal stimulation hotspots within the DF and PF zones and suggests that an additional closed-loop motion-analysis-based refinement is necessary as a part of an automatic algorithm for electrode shaping. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par96"><text><SENT sid="58581" pm="."><plain>The combined effect of the activation of several pads was not systematically evaluated during the clinical study presented here. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58582" pm="."><plain>However, in our previous studies, we examined certain effects related to an asynchronous multi-pad FES [12, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58583" pm="."><plain>The important factor that affects the summation effect was the choice of stimulation parameters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58584" pm="."><plain>We selected a relatively high stimulation frequency (40 Hz) coupled with a short inter-pulse interval (IPI = 1 ms) to produce a responsive and strong muscle contraction suitable for walking (i.e., a strong push-off and fast foot clearance in the swing phase). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58585" pm="."><plain>The asynchronous FES regime implies that the burst of number (N) of consecutive pulses is routed to N pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58586" pm="."><plain>Therefore, an IPI value of 1 ms is the interval between the activation of consecutive pads within the multi-pad-shaped electrode. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58587" pm="."><plain>The 40 Hz stimulation frequency implies that the interval between the pulses sent to the same pad within the shaped electrode is 1/40 s (25 ms). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58588" pm="."><plain>A short IPI was selected to fit all the stimulation pulses in the nerve refractory period, preventing the consecutive activation of the same muscle fibers by stimulation pulses delivered to different electrode pads, thus reducing muscle fatigue, which occurs more rapidly from stimulation with high frequencies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58589" pm="."><plain>This setup also affects the summation effect of a stimulation electrode that comprises several pads during asynchronous multi-pad stimulation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58590" pm="."><plain>Due to the short IPI, a stimulus routed to a pad will only activate muscle fibers that were not activated by preceding stimuli, which means that the muscle force resulting from a combination of pads could not be exactly estimated after the single pad activations during the twitch protocol. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58591" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, activating a combination of several pads from the same group (e.g., for DF) always produced movement in the selected direction, proving that there was no electrical current superposition that could lead to the activation of nerves not activated during twitch protocol. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par97"><text><SENT sid="58592" pm="."><plain>Prenton et al. reported that a take-home array-based functional electrical stimulation system with automated setup is feasible for patients with foot drop [27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58594" pm="."><plain>The cathode positioning and anode placement over the tibialis muscle in this design were intended solely for DF and EV/IV control and prevented the induction of PF movement. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="58596" pm="."><plain>The system enables the control of DF in the swing phase and PF in the push-off phase during FES-assisted walking using a single custom-designed multi-pad electrode and a single IMU. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par98"><text><SENT sid="58597" pm="."><plain>A seated position was selected for the patient during the twitch protocol and electrode shaping process, as it was the safest and most comfortable and allowed for a minimally obstructed range of both DF and PF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58598" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the position of the stimulated structures of the paretic leg during the twitch protocol was similar to that in which the DF and PF stimulation electrodes are triggered during the FES-assisted gait cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58599" pm="."><plain>This was important for the successful translation of the DF and PF electrodes from the static condition during the twitch protocol to a dynamic condition during FES-assisted walking without the introduction of changes due to the relative displacement of the stimulated structures (i.e., underlying nerve branches and tissue) caused by a change in position from seated to standing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58600" pm="."><plain>The adhesive properties of the electrode hydrogel ensured stable contact between the skin and electrode, and the electrode garment also secured the electrode position by fixing it to the stimulation site. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par99"><text><SENT sid="58601" pm="."><plain>Although variability of the optimal stimulation sites for daily sessions was observed and reported in other publications [21, 26], this effect was never systematically evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58602" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study is the first to use an automated, quantitative assessment of the stimulated ROM to validate a qualitative pattern assessment performed by the clinicians. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58603" pm="."><plain>In more than 95% of cases, the clinicians were satisfied with the effect of the top-ranked pad activations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58604" pm="."><plain>To further strengthen and accelerate muscle contraction and/or to produce ankle flexion with pronounced eversion, which is a desirable movement during rehabilitation [7], the clinicians introduced additional pads to the proposed stimulation patterns until the foot movement was considered adequate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58605" pm="."><plain>The results also demonstrate that in 82% and 89% of all sessions, the clinicians included only the pads suggested by the DSS; i.e., the Set(DF)FIN and Set(PF)FIN were subsets of Set(DF)DSS and Set(PF)DSS, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58606" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that the pads suggested by the automatic algorithm were typically sufficient for creating good-quality stimulation patterns for both movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58607" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Set(DF)FIN/Set(PF)FIN were subsets of Set(DF)DSS/Set(PF)DSS plus Set(EV)DSS/Set(IV)DSS in both movements for 98.5% of the trials. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58608" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the DSS was successful in offering adequate choices for the construction of stimulation patterns for DF and PF movements, thus reducing the number of possible choices and facilitating the decision-making process of pad selection, which was the main purpose of the DSS presented in this study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par100"><text><SENT sid="58609" pm="."><plain>The quality of the chosen patterns was validated by the response of the shank muscle activations with electrical stimulation (ROMs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58610" pm="."><plain>Quantitative validation of the final selected stimulation patterns indicated that they did indeed produce the desired movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58611" pm="."><plain>Aside from the ROMs, we tracked the ability of a person to voluntarily flex and extend their ankle (ROMa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58612" pm="."><plain>We observed an assistive effect and a therapeutic effect of foot drop walking therapy with the selected patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58613" pm="."><plain>The assistive effect (i.e., a ROMs that is significantly greater than ROMa, p &lt; 0.01) was present with the first use of the system, but it decreased in later stages of therapy due to the therapeutic effect on the foot ROMa (Fig. 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58614" pm="."><plain>Compared to baseline, ROMa increased significantly starting after one week of therapy (session 6, p &lt; 0.0026), even though more than 3 months had passed since the occurrence of stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58615" pm="."><plain>ROMs showed a statistically significant increase at the end of the study compared to the baseline, possibly due to an increase in muscle strength and a reduction in spasticity (p &lt; 0.0026). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58616" pm="."><plain>The median value of the ROMs for all patients in the last session was 42 [Q1–Q3: 36–48]°, whereas it was 28 [Q1–Q3: 21–36]° in the first session. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58617" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is necessary to determine whether the therapeutic effects persist during a follow-up period. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58618" pm="."><plain>The fact that the stimulated ROM across the majority of sessions was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than the matching voluntary ROM demonstrates that the assistive potential of this type of stimulation remains observable regardless of a patient’s individual recovery pattern. </plain></SENT>
