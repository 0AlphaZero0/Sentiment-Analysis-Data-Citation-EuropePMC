</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59282" pm="."><plain>COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, leading to an estimated 3.1 million deaths globally in 2012.1 Although symptoms and exacerbation rate have been added to our assessment system of COPD,2 spirometry remains an important tool in assessing severity and prognosis in this disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59283" pm="."><plain>Changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) are still the best indicator of disease progression and the risk of dying from COPD.2,3 Yet, on an individual level, FEV1 is an unreliable marker of morbidity, especially in early disease,4–6 and there is a need to identify alternative objective tests that can aid in stratifying the risk of further patient deterioration. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59284" pm="."><plain>Patients who exhibit tidal expiratory flow limitation (EFLT) might be such a subgroup. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59285" pm="."><plain>EFLT occurs when increases in driving pressure fail to increase expiratory flow during resting tidal breathing and is most often seen in patients with severe COPD,7,8 although it can occur with only moderate airway obstruction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59286" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of EFLT in COPD have focused on its association with operating lung volume, exercise tolerance,9,10 and its relation to breathlessness.11–13 It is not known whether EFLT can provide longer-term prognostic information in COPD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59287" pm="."><plain>EFLT can be detected by the forced oscillation technique (FOT).14,15 When peripheral airways collapse on expiration, oscillatory pressure signals are prevented from reaching the alveoli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59288" pm="."><plain>As this happens, the oscillatory compliance is reduced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59289" pm="."><plain>Consequently, expiratory reactance (Xrsexp) becomes more negative than the inspiratory reactance (Xrsinsp), leading to a within-breath reactance difference (ΔXrs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59290" pm="."><plain>In the absence of EFLT, reactance measured in inspiration and in expiration is almost identical. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59291" pm="."><plain>The within-breath reactance difference (ΔXrs) cut-off of 0.28 kPa·s·L−1 has been defined and validated to identify flow-limited breaths.14,15 EFLT is not only linked to dyspnea in COPD,11,16 but also to COPD exacerbations, where ΔXrs have been found to increase at the onset of COPD exacerbations and decrease when the exacerbation resolves.17 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59292" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used forced oscillation technique to define EFLT in 425 patients with COPD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59293" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the presence of EFLT, assessed by increased mean ΔXrs (ΔXrs¯), would relate to changes in 6MWD, the risk of COPD exacerbations, and, possibly, mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59294" pm="."><plain>We explored these hypotheses using baseline ΔXrs¯ as a predictor for future events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59295" pm="."><plain>Patients with COPD with abnormally high ΔXrs¯, both above the upper limit of normal (ULN) and above the established threshold of EFLT, were investigated to determine whether they differed from those without evidence of tidal expiratory flow limitation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59367" pm="."><plain>Data describing the control group have previously been published.13,18 The FOT threshold identifying a single flow-limited breath has been defined when within-breath reactance was &gt;0.28 kPa·s·L−1.14,15 We interpreted our continuous spectrum measurements performed over several breaths as showing evidence of flow limitation when measurements between the ULN and the threshold of EFLT were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59368" pm="."><plain>These borderline measurements are thought to represent a mixture of normal and flow-limited breaths. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59369" pm="."><plain>Exercise limitation is extremely common in COPD, and even small decreases in the 6MWD over time identify patients with increased risks of dying.27 When EFLT is present, patients can only increase their minute ventilation during exercise by increasing breathing frequency or by dynamic hyperinflation, allowing end-expiratory lung volume to rise.28 Dynamic hyperinflation can be induced by self-paced walking exercise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59370" pm="."><plain>This is usually assessed by changes in operating lung volume.12,29 We did not measure lung volume during the 6MWT, but reasoned that patients with COPD showing evidence of flow limitation at baseline, either as having ΔXrs¯≥ULN or the threshold of EFLT, were more likely to have a worse exercise tolerance at the same visit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59371" pm="."><plain>This was true on a group level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59372" pm="."><plain>The EFLT group had the lowest 6MWD, but neither FEV1 % predicted nor any cut-off level of ΔXrs¯ could identify patients with COPD with a short walking distance (&lt;350 m), as proposed by Spruit et al.30 No significant decline was seen in patients with ΔXrs¯ in the normal range; in patients with COPD with ΔXrs¯≥ULN it declined 37 m, and in patients with EFLT, it declined by 63 m. The minimal clinically important difference on an individual level has been suggested to be 30 m in an ERS/ATS systematic review;31 consequently, the differences seen over time between our subgroups defined by ΔXrs¯≥ULN and EFLT are likely to be clinically important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59374" pm="."><plain>Exacerbation and hospitalization rates at our site were similar to those reported in the completed ECLIPSE study and in the TORCH study.32,33 By negative binomial regression, the ΔXrs¯≥cut-offsULN and EFLT were both significant predictors for higher rates of exacerbations with very similar RR, demonstrating that the increased risk of exacerbations by EFLT is identified already at ULN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59375" pm="."><plain>In the time to first event analysis of patients with ΔXrs¯≥ULN, we found a shorter time to first exacerbation and a shorter time to first hospitalization than that of the COPD patients with ΔXrs¯ in the normal range. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59376" pm="."><plain>A previous study on hospitalized patients showed that many, but not all, have FOT-defined EFLT during a COPD exacerbation.17 FOT measurements performed during hospitalized COPD exacerbations show that ΔXrs¯ measurements improve during resolution of an exacerbation, although many patients remain EFLT at discharge.17 At present, there is a shortage of readily measurable biomarkers that can predict the risk of future exacerbations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59377" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that, after adjusting for lung function and exacerbation history, EFLT measurement can identify patients who are more likely to develop exacerbations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59378" pm="."><plain>Further prospective studies to confirm these observations and explore their mechanism are merited. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59379" pm="."><plain>Patients with COPD with an FEV1 &gt;50% predicted and evidence of EFLT, defined as baseline ΔXrs ≥ ULN, had significantly higher risk of dying within the 5-year follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59380" pm="."><plain>Similar associations were not found in the patients with more advanced airway obstruction and FEV1 &lt;50%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59381" pm="."><plain>However, COPD is a complex, heterogeneous disease, and respiratory impairment is associated with higher incidence of comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.34 If there is an association between ΔXrs¯ and mortality, the higher risk of adverse outcomes associated with comorbid disease could mask such an association with advanced disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59382" pm="."><plain>Although the association between death and ΔXrs¯ was highly significant, this sub-analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of deaths in patients with FEV1 &gt;50% predicted (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59383" pm="."><plain>There are certain limitations of this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59384" pm="."><plain>The FOT threshold identifying a single flow-limited breath has been defined at ΔXrs¯&gt;0.28kPa⋅s⋅L−1.14,15 It is not known whether the use of this threshold may lead to different results when applied to values measured over a continuous spectrum of several breaths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59385" pm="."><plain>Previously published data show that the end-expiratory lung volume varies from breath-to-breath, affecting the prevalence of EFLT.8,15 Although the prevalence of EFLT increased as the FEV1% predicted declined, not all patients with very severe airway obstruction were found to have EFLT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59386" pm="."><plain>In previous studies on elderly and COPD with the NEP technique, higher prevalence of EFLT have been reported than in the present study.11,35,36 Different inclusion criteria and differences in sensitivity between the NEP and the FOT technique, together with the possibility that in borderline patients the application of a NEP per se could lead to development of EFLT, are likely explanations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59387" pm="."><plain>The wide reference range of FEV1 inevitably may also lead to an overestimation of the suspected lung function decline in many patients.23 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59388" pm="."><plain>As previously noted, EFLT varies between breaths in many patients with COPD and varies with repeat testing, likely reflecting differences in the end-expiratory lung volume on different test days.13 Physiological variability in these measurements might require the repetition of this test in different periods to increase the sensitivity of our test. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59389" pm="."><plain>Despite this limitation, important relationships related to the presence of tidal flow limitation were seen, even when the data were controlled for severity of airflow obstruction measured by FEV1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59390" pm="."><plain>The data reflect results from the largest recruiting center in the ECLIPSE study, in which patients were carefully characterized using standardized methodologies including oscillatory mechanics.18,37 </plain></SENT>
