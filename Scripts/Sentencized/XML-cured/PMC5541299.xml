</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59696" pm="?"><plain>Cardiovascular disease is a major burden in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with RA has been estimated to be the same size as the risk in patients with type II diabetes.1 2 Furthermore, patients with RA develop cardiovascular events 5–10 year earlier than non-RA patients,3 and the mortality in patients with RA who have their first cardiovascular event is higher than in matched non-RA patients.4 Mortality in RA is decreasing,5 but apparently not at the same pace as in the background population, and the mortality gap is still present, mostly associated with comorbid conditions in patients with RA.6 The question is, why is the mortality in RA still increased, and why do patients with RA die earlier than the general population? </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59697" pm="."><plain>Vitamin D, well-known for its calcium-homoeostatic properties, is also a potent immune modulator; with vitamin D receptor and vitamin D metabolising enzymes being present in all types of immune cells.7 By inhibiting the innate immune system and modulating the adaptive immune system, the prevalence of autoimmune disease might be affected by low vitamin D levels.8 Vitamin D insufficiency is common in patients with RA,9 and may be even more prevalent than in the general population.10–12 Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between low vitamin D and the prevalence of autoimmune disease, including RA,13 whereas recent studies and meta-analyses question this association.14 15 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59698" pm="."><plain>Also, myocytes and cells of the vessel walls contain vitamin D receptor and enzymes essential for vitamin D metabolism, and low levels of vitamin D are associated with several cardiovascular risk factors.16 In non-RA subjects, epidemiological studies consistently show significant associations between low vitamin D levels and increased cardiovascular disease.17–21 Atherosclerosis has become accepted as an inflammatory state,22–24 and the main proinflammatory cytokines involved in the atherosclerotic process, such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor α,25–27 are also pivotal in RA.28 29 Interestingly, in vitro studies show that the immune cells responsible for the production of these proinflammatory cytokines are upregulated when matured in a milieu low in vitamin D.30 This concomitance might reveal a potential promising role of vitamin D in the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with RA, further underlined by the finding that classic cardiovascular risk factors are commonly shared in patients with RA and patients with vitamin D insufficiency.31 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59699" pm="."><plain>However, the role of vitamin D in the evolvement of cardiovascular disease in RA, and in non-RA subjects, is controversial, owing to the close relationship between vitamin D and several factors known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as body composition, lipid metabolism and lifestyle factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59700" pm="."><plain>These are considered below. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59701" pm="."><plain>Patients with RA are often obese or have an altered body composition.32 33 In those with a low or normal body mass index (BMI), rheumatoid cachexia (low muscle mass, high fat mass) may be present,34 35 leading to an altered distribution of body fat and muscle mass; obesity and altered body composition are also obvious cardiovascular risk factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59702" pm="."><plain>Vitamin D sequesters in fatty tissue, and high fat mass, can thereby lead to lower levels of circulating bioavailable vitamin D.36 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59703" pm="."><plain>Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a sedentary lifestyle,37 often due to lack of sun exposure and thereby cutaneous vitamin D production during ultraviolet B radiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59704" pm="."><plain>Patients with RA, especially those with active disease and high disability, often have a sedentary, indoor lifestyle, thereby increasing the probability of having lower vitamin D levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59705" pm="."><plain>Smoking is a well-known risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis,38 one of the main-steps in the development of cardiovascular disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59706" pm="."><plain>Smoking can also be a part of the pathogenesis in RA, where it leads to early citrullination, and thereby, production of autoantibodies.39 40 In non-RA subjects, smoking is associated with lower levels of vitamin D than found in matched non-smokers.41–43 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59707" pm="."><plain>Patients with RA often have the ‘lipid paradox’—that is, low levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein, but a remaining high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).44 45 Likewise, in patients with RA, an inverse association has been observed between vitamin D levels and LDL,46 indicating that vitamin D might be associated with known cardiovascular risk factors in patients with RA.47–49 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59708" pm="."><plain>Other comorbidities in RA, such as insulin resistance,50 hypertension51 and metabolic syndrome,52 are highly prevalent, and similarly, low levels of vitamin D are linked to these comorbidities,53 which are all known to be individual risk factors of CVD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59709" pm="."><plain>An eventual aetiological role of low vitamin D levels in the development of CVD is important, as it is potentially remediable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59710" pm="."><plain>Most interventional studies of the effect of vitamin D treatment on autoimmunity, CVD and overall mortality are not convincing.54–60 On the other hand, low vitamin D levels might still be able to predict excess mortality,61 and thereby guide the clinician′s attention towards the need for prevention in patients at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59711" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is, in patients with an early diagnosis of RA who are treated-to-target since diagnosis, to evaluate the association between low vitamin Dtotal levels at baseline (defined as Dtotal &lt; 50 nmol/L) and occurrence of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up, to test the prespecified hypothesis that low vitamin D levels at baseline predict an increased risk of cardiovascular events during follow-up. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59879" pm="."><plain>There are no missing Dtotal levels at baseline (Herly M, 2010, abstract only), but we expect that the collection of journal data for cardiovascular events or hospitalisation might be insufficient, mainly because participants may move to another region in Denmark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59880" pm="."><plain>There might be sociodemographic differences in patients moving from one region to another, but we do not expect changes in these characteristics to be so different that they will markedly change the estimates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59881" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Denmark is a small country, with a relatively homogeneous population, and equal access to all types of health services, further minimising the risk of regional differences in prevention and registration of health outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59882" pm="."><plain>We will collect follow-up data concerning hospitalisation in all patients moving to one of the other regions where we have access to patient records, to minimise the amount of data missing. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59883" pm="."><plain>If outcome data are missing, we assume that they will be missing at random, and therefore, data missing before the patient has had an event, will not bias the estimates toward a stronger association, but solely underestimate the event rate, and thereby the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisation in the cohort. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="59887" pm="."><plain>This will possibly lead to an overestimation of the survival in the cohort, and an underestimation of the risk of hospitalisation, and ultimately, number of deaths, thereby diminishing the size of the final estimate towards ‘no association’. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59898" pm="."><plain>An important strength of observational studies like this is the ability to estimate the influence of vitamin D at baseline on cardiovascular events during long-time follow-up in these patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59899" pm="."><plain>This is a crucial strength, as we would be unable to use a better experimental design owing to ethical constraints (ie, it is not possible to randomise to low vitamin D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59900" pm="."><plain>Keeping this in mind, one drawback of observational studies is that they lack the ability to randomise their participants into treatment groups— that is, there is a chance that we infer from selection bias and confounding by indication. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="59905" pm="."><plain>Instead of being part of the pathogenesis in several diseases, vitamin D might merely be a marker of poor lifestyle,87 88 eventually due to RA, or it may be an independent risk factor of CVD, thereby confounding our results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59906" pm="."><plain>The primary exposure; baseline Dtotal is not randomised; the two vitamin D groups are simply allocated at baseline, according to the individual Dtotal level at baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59907" pm="."><plain>The use of vitamin D as a dichotomous variable is based on international cut-off values,69 to ease the clinical interpretation, though we are aware that we might lose more subtle differences when not assessing Dtotal as a continuous variable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59908" pm="."><plain>We will report and discuss eventual differences in the distribution of baseline variables between the two vitamin D groups, and attempt to evaluate to what extent, and in what direction this might affect the final estimates. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59909" pm="."><plain>All patients in the cohort are treated with vitamin D and calcium supplementation from baseline, in accordance with the National Danish prevention strategy for osteoporosis in patients with RA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59910" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a patient initially evaluated as having low vitamin D levels at baseline, will presumably achieve normal levels during the follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59911" pm="."><plain>If causality between low vitamin D levels and development of CVD exists, such patients might be ‘misclassified’, thereby leading an eventual association towards null. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59912" pm="."><plain>Though, we still find it relevant to evaluate if baseline vitamin D levels can predict long-term cardiovascular outcomes, despite ‘blurring’ the results by substitution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59913" pm="."><plain>We recommend all rheumatologists to substitute their patients with RA with vitamin D and calcium, both because it is known that low vitamin D levels are common in these patients, and as prophylactic treatment for osteoporosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59914" pm="."><plain>However, we also acknowledge that the substitution strategy in our cohort might diminish the comparability with studies not using vitamin D and calcium substitution. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59915" pm="."><plain>A profound association between Dtotal level and other cardiovascular risk factors may confound the association between baseline Dtotal and cardiovascular mortality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59916" pm="."><plain>To date, associations between vitamin D levels and several cardiovascular risk factors are well established, as mentioned in the introduction, and many of those risk factors are also associated with low vitamin D levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59917" pm="."><plain>In general, it seems that associations between vitamin D, RA and CVD are part of an extremely delicate interplay, challenging clarification of causality, and increasing the risk of confounding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59918" pm="."><plain>Despite our attempts to handle these confounders, the study lacks baseline data, such as markers of early atherosclerosis, body composition, insulin resistance and sedentary lifestyle, leading to potential residual confounding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59919" pm="."><plain>Most of this major limitation is due to the study design, with use of secondary analyses from a prior randomised controlled trial, with no influence on the variables collected at the time of inclusion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59920" pm="."><plain>Those limitations are regrettable, but we attempt to deal with them in the discussion section of the final paper. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59921" pm="."><plain>We accept those limitations, because the use of a cohort established at the millennium has the advantages of long-term follow-up, and therefore probably an ‘acceptable’ amount of cardiovascular events during this follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59922" pm="."><plain>Moreover, despite potential confounders, we still find that the study design is appropriate for evaluating if low vitamin D levels at baseline can predict long-term CVD in a cohort of patients with RA treated-to-target and receiving relevant anti-osteoporotic treatment according to National Guidelines. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59923" pm="."><plain>Using a previously designed cohort provides the advantage of long-term follow-up, but also has some major limitations due to the study design—for example, the exclusion criteria; diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg excludes some patients with a great risk of cardiovascular disease, and may therefore bias the results towards fewer incident cardiovascular events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59924" pm="."><plain>Neither is there information about lipid status, and therefore we cannot adjust for this well-known confounder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59925" pm="."><plain>An association between vitamin D and LDL and triglyceride46 89–91 is likely, as vitamin D is a marker of generally poor lifestyle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59926" pm="."><plain>This may lead to an overestimation of the association between low baseline vitamin D levels and CVD. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59927" pm="."><plain>Although this cohort was established at the millennium, the aggressive treatment, with both arms receiving increasing doses of MTX and intra-articular steroid injections for swollen joints in a step-up treat-to-target strategy, this strategy is still the ‘gold standard’ for treatment of RA in Denmark. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59928" pm="."><plain>Additionally, although the eligibility criteria led to selection of patients with RA with few comorbidities at baseline, the long-term follow-up leads to generalisability of the results. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59929" pm="."><plain>Like the present cohort, many other RA cohorts are strictly selected to avoid comorbidity, and long-term follow-up studies in RA cohorts with several comorbidities are needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59930" pm="."><plain>We try to deal with this issue in the nearby future by using a Danish inception cohort with no exclusion criteria, to extensively evaluate cardiovascular comorbidity during follow-up.92 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59931" pm="."><plain>Defining an event as a hospitalisation, does not take outpatient contacts into account, thereby potentially under-rating the incidence of cardiovascular comorbidity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="59932" pm="."><plain>We assume that outpatient contacts are due to minor comorbidities, and if a more severe comorbidity evolves, a hospitalisation will ultimately occur, thereby showing the patient as having an event in the medical records. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59933" pm="."><plain>The method of adjudicating events using patient′s medical records is evaluated and validated by Gaede.70–72 We assume this method classifies the events very precisely, also when compared with other methods, such as using the Danish National Patient Registry (Lands Patient Register), which has recently been shown to have general high validity.93 94 The two methods of classification in patients with RA could be compared, which would indicate the accuracy of the register-based outcome evaluation for CVD in patients with RA. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="59934" pm="."><plain>This study will be a cohort study, and causality underlying an eventual association on the effect of vitamin D in CVD in patients with RA needs to be evaluated in future studies, preferably in randomised controlled trials, measuring the effect on cardiovascular outcomes of varying sufficiently high doses of vitamin D supplements. </plain></SENT>
