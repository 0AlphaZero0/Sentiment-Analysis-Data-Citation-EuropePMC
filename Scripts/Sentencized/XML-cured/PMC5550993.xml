</text></title><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="60085" pm="."><plain>Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1] and despite developments in multimodal treatment approaches, overall survival rates have not improved significantly over the last four decades [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60086" pm="."><plain>Surgery to remove part or all the stomach continues to be the mainstay of treatment that offers a potential cure; however, this is associated with significant risks of short and long-term complications [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60087" pm="."><plain>Variations in surgical approaches aim to minimise these risks without compromising the oncological resection of the tumour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60088" pm="."><plain>These variations can be broadly categorised into those related to accessing the stomach (e.g. open, laparoscopic or robotic surgery) and those related to the extent of surgery (e.g. partial or total gastrectomy, level of lymphadenectomy and whether splenectomy is r﻿equired). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="60089" pm="."><plain>In principle, assessing the optimal surgical strategies for gastric cancer should involve analyses of well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with systematic reviews and meta-analyses of data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60090" pm="."><plain>However, trials are often methodologically heterogenous, report and measure their outcomes differently and preclude comprehensive evidence synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60091" pm="."><plain>Consequently, strong recommendations for clinical practice can seldom be made [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60092" pm="."><plain>In instances where trials may report the same outcomes, the definitions of these outcomes are often inconsistent and it is not known to what degree these outcomes may be relevant to key stakeholders such as patients. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="60093" pm="."><plain>In preparing this protocol, a rapid review of RCTs (published between January 2014 and January 2016) examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer was undertaken using a structured search strategy applied to MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60094" pm="."><plain>In the six trials identified, a total of 102 outcomes were reported, only 15% of which were defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60095" pm="."><plain>No single outcome was reported by every trial and only one trial described patient-reported outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60096" pm="."><plain>No trial measured quality of life after surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="60097" pm="."><plain>Many groups have now demonstrated similar, widespread inconsistencies in outcome reporting [7–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60098" pm="."><plain>Consequently, there has been a drive, with the support of initiatives such as COMET (Core Outcomes Measurement in Effectiveness Trials) and the Medical Research Council’s Hubs for Trials Methodology Research, to standardise the reporting of outcomes as an important step in improving trial design and reducing research waste. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="60099" pm="."><plain>Aims and objectives </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="60100" pm="."><plain>One solution to this problem is through the development of a ‘core outcome set’ (COS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60101" pm="."><plain>A COS is defined as an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific condition [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60102" pm="."><plain>The aim of the GASTROS study (GAstric cancer Surgery Trials Reported Outcomes Standardisation) is to develop a COS to be used by all trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer, which reflects the interests of both patients and health care professionals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="60103" pm="."><plain>The specific objectives include:To determine the degree of variation in the reporting of outcomes in the academic literatureTo identify a list of potentially important outcomes from published trials and trial protocolsTo identify a list of potentially important outcomes reported by patients, in semi-structured interviews, who have been treated for gastric cancer, to augment the list generated in item 2To reach consensus regarding the most important outcomes from the perspective of patients and health care professionals into a COSTo identify appropriate outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) to be used in the reporting of the COS and at what time points the outcomes should be measured </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="60105" pm="."><plain>This study will draw its methodological principles from recommendations developed by initiatives such as COMET and COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) and modified where necessary and appropriate [12–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60106" pm="."><plain>The COMET initiative has been instrumental in propagating the agenda for change in relation to outcomes reporting internationally and has amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience during the last 6 years. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60107" pm="."><plain>Whilst the field of COSs is still relatively new, COMET is supporting the development of hundreds of COSs demonstrated by over 400 completed, ongoing or planned studies across a wide spectrum of clinical specialties referenced in its online database [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60108" pm="."><plain>COSMIN, whose focus lies on developing rigorous methods of OMI selection, is working closely with COMET and has developed standards for selecting instruments used in the reporting of COSs [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="60109" pm="."><plain>Scope </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="60110" pm="."><plain>This COS is primarily aimed at pragmatic trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60111" pm="."><plain>The target population is male and female adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60112" pm="."><plain>We foresee that the COS will also be beneficial for the design of non-randomised studies and will inform the design of databases and national audits by identifying the priorities of patients and health care professionals. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="60113" pm="."><plain>Given that there is now a greater acceptance that the management of gastric cancer is often multimodal (involving a combination of surgical excision and chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy) [19], it may be argued that a COS would be more relevant if it were to encompass all therapeutic interventions and not just surgical ones. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60114" pm="."><plain>A structured search of the World Health Organisation’s International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</ext-link>, last accessed 3 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.Gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>, last accessed 3 August 2016) has identified 24 ongoing surgical gastric cancer trials planning to recruit approximately 11,000 patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60115" pm="."><plain>The rate at which these surgical trials are being set up does not show signs of slowing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60116" pm="."><plain>As such, a surgically focused COS is highly relevant given the research activity within this field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60117" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is a significant proportion of patients who do not require multimodal therapy due to early stage disease or on the account that they are unfit for additional therapies. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60118" pm="."><plain>In addition, given the large variation in surgical practice that already exists, and the range of therapeutic surgical interventions which have been, and are being, investigated, we believe that a surgically orientated COS is both desirable and necessary. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60119" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, our group recognises that future work is required to develop a COS which will be relevant to non-surgical interventions and this is within our planned programme of work in conjunction with endoscopic and medical and clinical oncology groups. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="60121" pm="."><plain>The development of COSs by different groups has highlighted some of the issues which arise with the inconsistent use of nomenclature and definitions in a new and developing research field. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60122" pm="."><plain>There are no widely agreed definitions for several commonly used terms in COSs; however, the COMET initiative recommends that studies clearly define their own terms. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60126" pm="."><plain>Our primary stakeholder groups include patients (with ‘lived experience’ of the condition and its management), surgeons (those directly delivering and developing the clinical interventions) and clinical nurse specialists (as they have an important dual role as health care professionals and patient advocates). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60127" pm="."><plain>In addition to their participation highlighted below (see ‘Study design’), representatives from each group have been recruited to our Study Advisory Group to support the general delivery of the study against its stated objectives and ensure that the viewpoints of all stakeholders are considered throughout the process. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="60151" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have highlighted that patients often have differing priorities and perspectives relating to outcomes measured in trials [21–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60152" pm="."><plain>To ensure that the views of patients are adequately considered, a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews, with patients who have previously undergone surgery, will be undertaken. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60154" pm="."><plain>There is no ‘sample size’ calculation for qualitative research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60155" pm="."><plain>The total number of participants should be guided by the concept of ‘saturation’, whereby further interviews do not result in the identification of new outcomes, and can range from between 5 and 50 participants [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60156" pm="."><plain>Based on the authors’ experience in qualitative research methods in COS development, we expect that between 15 and 30 patients will need to be interviewed before ‘saturation’ is reached. </plain></SENT>
