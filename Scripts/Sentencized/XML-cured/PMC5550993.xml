Whilst surgery is the mainstay of curative treatment, it is associated with significant risks. Surgical strategies for treating gastric cancer should be based on evidence from systematic reviews of well-designed randomised controlled trials. However, inconsistencies in the reporting of outcomes from these trials makes evidence synthesis unreliable. We present a protocol for an international consensus study to develop a standardised set of outcomes and measurement tools – a ‘core outcome set’ (COS) – to be used by all future trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer. The GASTROS study aims to standardise the reporting of outcomes in gastric cancer surgery trials through an international consensus process of key stakeholders including health care professionals and patients. </p></sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="60072" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="60085" pm="."><plain>Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1] and despite developments in multimodal treatment approaches, overall survival rates have not improved significantly over the last four decades [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60086" pm="."><plain>Surgery to remove part or all the stomach continues to be the mainstay of treatment that offers a potential cure; however, this is associated with significant risks of short and long-term complications [3, 4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60087" pm="."><plain>Variations in surgical approaches aim to minimise these risks without compromising the oncological resection of the tumour. These variations can be broadly categorised into those related to accessing the stomach (e.g. open, laparoscopic or robotic surgery) and those related to the extent of surgery (e.g. partial or total gastrectomy, level of lymphadenectomy and whether splenectomy is r﻿equired). <p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="60089" pm="."><plain>In principle, assessing the optimal surgical strategies for gastric cancer should involve analyses of well-designed and well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with systematic reviews and meta-analyses of data. However, trials are often methodologically heterogenous, report and measure their outcomes differently and preclude comprehensive evidence synthesis. Consequently, strong recommendations for clinical practice can seldom be made [5, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60092" pm="."><plain>In instances where trials may report the same outcomes, the definitions of these outcomes are often inconsistent and it is not known to what degree these outcomes may be relevant to key stakeholders such as patients. <p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="60093" pm="."><plain>In preparing this protocol, a rapid review of RCTs (published between January 2014 and January 2016) examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer was undertaken using a structured search strategy applied to MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid. In the six trials identified, a total of 102 outcomes were reported, only 15% of which were defined. No single outcome was reported by every trial and only one trial described patient-reported outcomes. No trial measured quality of life after surgery. <p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="60097" pm="."><plain>Many groups have now demonstrated similar, widespread inconsistencies in outcome reporting [7–10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60098" pm="."><plain>Consequently, there has been a drive, with the support of initiatives such as COMET (Core Outcomes Measurement in Effectiveness Trials) and the Medical Research Council’s Hubs for Trials Methodology Research, to standardise the reporting of outcomes as an important step in improving trial design and reducing research waste. <sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="60099" pm="."><plain>Aims and objectives </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="60100" pm="."><plain>One solution to this problem is through the development of a ‘core outcome set’ (COS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60101" pm="."><plain>A COS is defined as an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific condition [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60102" pm="."><plain>The aim of the GASTROS study (GAstric cancer Surgery Trials Reported Outcomes Standardisation) is to develop a COS to be used by all trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer, which reflects the interests of both patients and health care professionals. <p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="60103" pm="."><plain>The specific objectives include:To determine the degree of variation in the reporting of outcomes in the academic literatureTo identify a list of potentially important outcomes from published trials and trial protocolsTo identify a list of potentially important outcomes reported by patients, in semi-structured interviews, who have been treated for gastric cancer, to augment the list generated in item 2To reach consensus regarding the most important outcomes from the perspective of patients and health care professionals into a COSTo identify appropriate outcome measurement instruments (OMIs) to be used in the reporting of the COS and at what time points the outcomes should be measured </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec3"><title><text><SENT sid="60104" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par18"><text><SENT sid="60105" pm="."><plain>This study will draw its methodological principles from recommendations developed by initiatives such as COMET and COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) and modified where necessary and appropriate [12–17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60106" pm="."><plain>The COMET initiative has been instrumental in propagating the agenda for change in relation to outcomes reporting internationally and has amassed a wealth of knowledge and experience during the last 6 years. Whilst the field of COSs is still relatively new, COMET is supporting the development of hundreds of COSs demonstrated by over 400 completed, ongoing or planned studies across a wide spectrum of clinical specialties referenced in its online database [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60108" pm="."><plain>COSMIN, whose focus lies on developing rigorous methods of OMI selection, is working closely with COMET and has developed standards for selecting instruments used in the reporting of COSs [16]. <sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="60109" pm="."><plain>Scope </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par19"><text><SENT sid="60110" pm="."><plain>This COS is primarily aimed at pragmatic trials examining therapeutic surgical interventions for gastric cancer. The target population is male and female adults. We foresee that the COS will also be beneficial for the design of non-randomised studies and will inform the design of databases and national audits by identifying the priorities of patients and health care professionals. <p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="60113" pm="."><plain>Given that there is now a greater acceptance that the management of gastric cancer is often multimodal (involving a combination of surgical excision and chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy) [19], it may be argued that a COS would be more relevant if it were to encompass all therapeutic interventions and not just surgical ones. A structured search of the World Health Organisation’s International Clinical Trials Registry Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/</ext-link>, last accessed 3 August 2016) and ClinicalTrials.Gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>, last accessed 3 August 2016) has identified 24 ongoing surgical gastric cancer trials planning to recruit approximately 11,000 patients. The rate at which these surgical trials are being set up does not show signs of slowing. As such, a surgically focused COS is highly relevant given the research activity within this field. Furthermore, there is a significant proportion of patients who do not require multimodal therapy due to early stage disease or on the account that they are unfit for additional therapies. In addition, given the large variation in surgical practice that already exists, and the range of therapeutic surgical interventions which have been, and are being, investigated, we believe that a surgically orientated COS is both desirable and necessary. Nonetheless, our group recognises that future work is required to develop a COS which will be relevant to non-surgical interventions and this is within our planned programme of work in conjunction with endoscopic and medical and clinical oncology groups. </sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><text><SENT sid="60120" pm="."><plain>Definitions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="60121" pm="."><plain>The development of COSs by different groups has highlighted some of the issues which arise with the inconsistent use of nomenclature and definitions in a new and developing research field. There are no widely agreed definitions for several commonly used terms in COSs; however, the COMET initiative recommends that studies clearly define their own terms. Our definitions are summarised in Table 1.Table 1Definition of terms used in the GAstric cancer Surgery Trials Reported Outcomes Standardisation (GASTROS) studyCore outcome set (COS)An agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all trials in a specific condition [11]OutcomeA unique endpoint which attempts to describe health-related changes that occur secondary to a therapeutic intervention, e.g. hospital-acquired pneumoniaOutcome domainA collection of ‘outcomes’ which share common features, e.g. the outcome domain ‘respiratory complications’ would include outcomes such as ‘pleural effusion’, ‘hospital-acquired pneumonia’ and ‘atelectasis’Outcome measurement instrument (OMI)A method or tool used to measure an ‘outcome’ or an ‘outcome domain’Outcome measurement instrument setA collection of OMIs which are used to measure outcome domains in a COS </sec><sec id="Sec6"><title><text><SENT sid="60124" pm="."><plain>Stakeholder involvement </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="60125" pm="."><plain>An important aspect of the GASTROS study design is ensuring that key stakeholder opinion is represented at every stage of the COS development. Our primary stakeholder groups include patients (with ‘lived experience’ of the condition and its management), surgeons (those directly delivering and developing the clinical interventions) and clinical nurse specialists (as they have an important dual role as health care professionals and patient advocates). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60127" pm="."><plain>In addition to their participation highlighted below (see ‘Study design’), representatives from each group have been recruited to our Study Advisory Group to support the general delivery of the study against its stated objectives and ensure that the viewpoints of all stakeholders are considered throughout the process. <p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="60128" pm="."><plain>Most surgical gastric cancer trials are undertaken in the Far East where the incidence and prevalence is highest [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60129" pm="."><plain>It is, therefore, essential that aspects of the COS development take this international perspective into account. As such, representatives from all stakeholder groups will be invited to participate in the eDelphi survey.

<SENT sid="60149" pm="."><plain>Whilst overall quality of life may be deemed an outcome that should be prioritised and included in a COS, there may be components related to eating and drinking, for example, that may be deemed important outcomes within their own right. </sec><sec id="Sec10"><title><text><SENT sid="60150" pm="."><plain>Patient interviews </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="60151" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have highlighted that patients often have differing priorities and perspectives relating to outcomes measured in trials [21–24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60152" pm="."><plain>To ensure that the views of patients are adequately considered, a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews, with patients who have previously undergone surgery, will be undertaken. All interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed and interrogated for themes which may supplement the outcomes already gathered from the systematic academic literature review. There is no ‘sample size’ calculation for qualitative research. The total number of participants should be guided by the concept of ‘saturation’, whereby further interviews do not result in the identification of new outcomes, and can range from between 5 and 50 participants [25, 26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60156" pm="."><plain>Based on the authors’ experience in qualitative research methods in COS development, we expect that between 15 and 30 patients will need to be interviewed before ‘saturation’ is reached. <p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="60157" pm="."><plain>To ensure that a broad range of views are expressed during the interviews, we aim to purposefully sample patients based on several characteristics. These include age, sex, time since surgery, type of surgical approach (open or minimally invasive) and whether patients have undergone other perioperative therapies (chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy). </sec><sec id="Sec11"><title><text><SENT sid="60159" pm="."><plain>Stage 2: Prioritisation of outcomes to finalise a COS overview </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="60160" pm="."><plain>Delphi surveys have been used in many COS projects to reach consensus on the most important outcomes to include [14, 27, 28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60161" pm="."><plain>One of the main benefits of this approach is that the views of all participants are equally heard. This may not be the case in a face-to-face forum where the views of one individual or group of participants may be more vociferously asserted. There is no fixed methodological approach to undertake a Delphi survey. Some groups have retained all potential outcome domains in each round and used the participant responses to inform a final consensus meeting [27, 29], whilst others have only retained outcome domains deemed important in each round [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60165" pm="."><plain>We intend to use a hybrid approach over three rounds as described in greater detail below. Following the Delphi survey, a meeting of key stakeholder representatives will take place to ratify the prioritised outcomes into a COS. </sec><sec id="Sec12"><title><text><SENT sid="60167" pm="."><plain>Organising the outcome list in preparation for stage 2 </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="60168" pm="."><plain>Once potentially important outcomes have been identified from the systematic review and patient interviews, a final long-list of items will be compiled for the eDelphi survey. We plan to recruit at least 100 participants and so to minimise non-response and attrition between survey rounds, the initial number of items submitted to the Delphi survey will need to be carefully managed. Previous COS developers have aimed for less than 100 initial items for participants to prioritise [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60171" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, individual outcomes will be organised into ‘outcome domains’ (Table 1) whilst ensuring that domains do not become too broad. For example, the outcomes ‘hospital-acquired pneumonia’, ‘pleural effusion’ and ‘atelectasis’ grouped together under the outcome domain ‘respiratory complications’ may be appropriate, whereas grouping the same outcomes under the domain ‘complications’ may be too specific. The process of compiling and finalising the outcome domains will be undertaken during a meeting of key stakeholder representatives to ensure transparency. This meeting will involve open discussion of each outcome domain, including information relating to how the outcome domain was formulated, to ensure that it is not too broad or specific. An outcome domain will be admitted into the long-list for the subsequent eDelphi survey once agreement by majority regarding its appropriateness has been reached by all stakeholder representatives. <p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="60176" pm="."><plain>Each item entered into the survey will be described in lay terms with an additional scientific description. For example, an ‘anastomotic leak’ may be described as ‘a leak from the join between the stomach and the bowel’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60178" pm="."><plain>All item descriptions will be reviewed by the study group and patient representatives.

Whilst there is no accepted or required ‘sample size’ requirement for a Delphi survey [30], we aim to recruit at least 100 participants in total. The views of each stakeholder group will be considered separately which will enable intra- and inter-stakeholder group variability to be explored. As explained previously, gastric cancer is a worldwide disease, and as such, participants will be sought internationally through a network of patient groups, organisations, professional associations and cancer institutes. The Delphi survey will be Internet-based; however, we will give participants the opportunity to complete hard copies of the surveys so as not to exclude those with limited Internet access or knowledge of the Internet. </sec><sec id="Sec14"><title><text><SENT sid="60186" pm="."><plain>Delphi survey </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par49"><text><SENT sid="60225" pm="."><plain>Existing OMIs will be identified through several approaches. A structured search of MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid will identify systematic reviews of OMIs for the outcome domain concerned.

We will search MEDLINE and EMBASE via Ovid to identify studies of OMIs. We will also interrogate reference lists and examine trials and protocols identified in stage 1 of the GASTROS study to identify further OMIs.

</text></title><p id="Par51"><text><SENT sid="60235" pm="."><plain>Each OMI-related study identified will undergo an evaluation of its methodological quality using the COSMIN Checklist [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60236" pm="."><plain>In addition, an evaluation of the measurement properties of the OMI will be undertaken against several predefined criteria [16] including ‘content validity’ and ‘internal structure’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60237" pm="."><plain>Content validity is defined as ‘the degree to which the content of a measurement instrument is an adequate reflection of the outcome to be measured’. ‘Internal structure’ is comprised of two aspects – ‘internal consistency’ (the degree of interrelatedness among the items within the OMI) and ‘structural validity’ (the degree to which the scores of a measurement instrument are an adequate reflection of the dimensionality of the outcome to be measured). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60238" pm="."><plain>If either ‘content validity’ or ‘internal structure’ are considered poor or unknown, then the OMI will not be assessed further. The results of this quality assessment will be combined in a ‘best evidence synthesis’ exercise against criteria defined by the COMET-COSMIN guidance. <p id="Par52"><text><SENT sid="60240" pm="."><plain>It is also essential that OMIs are assessed in terms of their feasibility of use.

</text></title><p id="Par60"><text><SENT sid="60255" pm="."><plain>A COS must be implemented widely within its clinical field to have its intended benefit. Whilst grant-awarding bodies and international research groups are increasingly promoting the use of COSs, researchers must be willing to incorporate them into trial designs. Our approach to maximise the use of our COS is one of inclusion of key stakeholders in designing and delivering our study and dissemination of the findings at every stage. Given that most surgical gastric cancer trials are being undertaken in the Far East, this inevitably means involvement of international stakeholders. We are working with several groups in South Korea, Japan and China in addition to European and North and South American teams to ensure that this aspect of our study is facilitated. It is not yet fully understood how language or cultural differences may affect the results of consensus processes such as the one we propose. Our study will provide the opportunity to explore this question further. <p id="Par61"><text><SENT sid="60262" pm="."><plain>Some of the steps that we have considered as part of our dissemination and implementation strategy include:Registration of our study with COMET database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/764?result=true">http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/764?result=true</ext-link>)Development of our study website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gastrosstudy.org/">www.GASTROSstudy.org</ext-link>) where key stakeholders and interested parties can find regular updates and register for participationDevelopment of our social media identity, e.g. Twitter (@GASTROSstudy)Widespread dissemination of our work at every stage of the study through:National and international scientific meetingsJournal publicationsPatient eventsRegular updates to our network of international patient groups and charities, professional associations and cancer centres  <p id="Par70"><text><SENT sid="60263" pm="."><plain>Engagement with, and ‘ownership’ of, the COS by professional bodies will also be an important way to facilitate the necessary regular review of the COS. Such reviews are needed to ensure that individual outcomes remain relevant and to add new outcomes as appropriate. No recommendation exists regarding the time interval between reviews, but we anticipate the need for review within 3–5 years. </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="DISCUSS"><sec id="Sec27"><title><text><SENT sid="60266" pm="."><plain>Discussion </plain></SENT>
