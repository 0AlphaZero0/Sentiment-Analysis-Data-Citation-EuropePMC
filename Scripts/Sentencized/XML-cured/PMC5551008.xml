Regular exercise results in an adaptive response involving changes in muscle architecture and biochemistry, and is an effective way to manage and prevent common human diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disorders and type II diabetes.

</text></title><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="60347" pm="."><plain>Equine athletes have a genetic heritage that has been influenced by millions of years of evolution as grazing animals on prairie and steppe. More recently, centuries of intense selective breeding in the Thoroughbred horse has led to the refinement of multiple physiological adaptations for athletic performance, resulting in an ideal model of a natural athlete for the investigation of exercise and adaptive training responses. Equine skeletal muscle shows a remarkable ability to adapt to physical exercise and long-term training; however, the genetic, epigenetic and molecular changes underlying these adaptive responses have yet to be fully elucidated [1–3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60350" pm="."><plain>Cyclic muscle contraction during repeated bouts of exercise over time (training or conditioning) is known to induce physiological adaptation in skeletal muscle, which exhibits remarkable plasticity in structure and function [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60351" pm="."><plain>In equine athletes, training generally leads to an increase in muscle mass and aerobic capacity but the specific response, in terms of muscle fibre type and metabolic adaptation, depends mainly on the type of training regime (e.g. endurance or sprint type exercise) [5–7], nutrition [8–10] and an individual’s specific genetic potential [11–13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60352" pm="."><plain>Principal genetic determinants of muscle fibre type include the myostatin gene (MSTN), which encodes a ligand of the TGF-beta receptor family that negatively regulates muscle growth, and that has been associated with strength and performance in both human [14] and equine athletes [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60353" pm="."><plain>Sequence polymorphisms in the equine MSTN gene are highly predictive of optimal race distance in Thoroughbred horses [13, 15–19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60354" pm="."><plain>Horses homozygous for the ‘sprint’ variant (C-allele or SINE insertion) have 12.5% more type 2X myofibers than horses with the alternate allele [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60355" pm="."><plain>Following a period of training in Thoroughbred horses an increase in type 2A and a concurrent decrease in type 2X fibres along with an overall increase in muscle mass is typically observed [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60356" pm="."><plain>As type 2A fibres can sustain high power outputs for longer than 2X the functional implication of this is increased endurance. Concurrent with changes in muscle mass and fibre type, exercise training elicits metabolic adaptations. This primarily involves an increased capacity for oxidative phosphorylation [5], increased mitochondrial density [21] and a shift toward oxidizing proportionately more fats and less glucose during exercise [22]. <p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="60359" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that the adaptive response to training is caused by incremental changes in gene expression following a single bout of exercise, which will “accumulate” during the traing period leading to new baseline levels of gene expression. This would result in a significant overlap in the exercise and training response genes [23–25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60361" pm="."><plain>The alternate hypothesis is that transient differential expression of genes in response to exercise precedes adaptive changes through secondary mechanisms. In this case little overlap would be seen between the exercise and training response genes [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60363" pm="."><plain>While there is an assumption that “accumulative” changes play a major role in the adaptive response no study has clearly demonstrated this. In human skeletal muscle the mRNA expression of key transcription factors is transiently induced by exercise training leading to increases in downstream transcriptional and mitochondrial proteins [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60365" pm="."><plain>In equine athletes it has been shown that a single bout of high-intensity exercise consisting of an incremental step-test to fatigue elicits a modulation of the expression of genes involved in metabolism and muscle hypertrophy, signatures of endurance and resistance exercise, respectively [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60366" pm="."><plain>Following a period of training the basal levels of genes related to the mitochondrion, oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism have been shown to be significantly upregulated [28], supporting the hypothesis that training may cause a transcriptional reprogramming of the muscle. <p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="60367" pm="."><plain>A range of approaches has been taken to better understand the molecular adaptations to exercise and training with many factors needing to be considered for appropriate experimental design [6, 22, 28–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60368" pm="."><plain>Generally, the analysis of the impact of an experimental variable (e.g. environment, treatment, mutation, disease etc.) on a cell, tissue or organism results in a list of statistically significant response variables, such as genes. It is common, owing to the modular architecture of biological systems, to then examine this list for statistical over-representation of known functional modules (e.g. pathways or complexes) to assist biological interpretation (often referred to pathway enrichment analysis, or similar). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60370" pm="."><plain>Although valuable, such analysis is confined by the limits of the current knowledge of functional modules which tends to be biased [33] and incomplete [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60371" pm="."><plain>However, less supervised approaches that are informed more by the similarity of entity (i.e. gene) behaviour, are more open to uncovering unknown or context-specific gene relationships [34, 35]. <p id="Par33"><text><SENT sid="60372" pm="."><plain>The function of most genes, or gene products (proteins, miRNA, lncRNAs, etc.), can only be carried out in combination with other biomolecules as part of a functional module [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60373" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to fully elucidate the functional relevance of a set of genes we must also model the related set of molecular interactions and their dynamics. There are several methods for direct detection [37, 38] or inferral [39–41] of molecular interactions. Once determined, the set of molecular interactions may be modelled as a network of nodes (genes) and edges (interactions) and interrogated with an extensive toolbox of established network analysis methods [34, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60376" pm="."><plain>Common metrics include the centrality indices ‘degree’ and ‘betweeness’, which are used to measure the importance of individual network nodes in terms of the local connections and their network wide influence respectively. In the context of biomolecular interaction networks, these ‘hub’ and ‘bottleneck’ nodes tend to be fundamentally important to the behaviour of the network [43] and indeed to the biological process, cell, tissue or organism as a whole [44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60378" pm="."><plain>Other higher level node grouping or clustering methods, such as ‘community detection’ [45, 46], allow modelling of the underlying functional modules (e.g. complex or pathway) in a particular molecular interaction network [36, 42]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60379" pm="."><plain>Other methods extend this concept further to analyse multi-state, or ‘dynamic’ networks recorded over various time points or experimental treatments [47]. <p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="60380" pm="."><plain>Although hundreds of thousands of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have been recorded across many organisms, cell types and experimental conditions and made publicly available [48], proteome-scale detection of PPIs still remains beyond the budget and expertise of most researchers. Genome-wide gene expression analysis, however, is now relatively affordable and commonplace. Thus, high-throughput gene expression data generated for an experimental context is often integrated with the universal set of known molecular interactions (i.e. the global interactome) to infer putative contextual molecular interaction networks. However, most implementations of this approach only attempt to predict the contextual state of the nodes in the network (e.g. the set of genes expressed in or associated with the condition of interest) and include all associated PPIs as edges, regardless of the experimental conditions or cell types in which they were detected, which is clearly a gross over-simplification [49–51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60384" pm="."><plain>It has been recognized for over a decade that genes that exhibit highly correlated co-expression profiles, as determined by Pearson’s correlation coefficient for example, often interact within the same biological module [40, 52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60385" pm="."><plain>This raises the prospect of using gene expression information to also infer the contextual state of the edges in a molecular interaction network but this in itself is hampered by exceedingly high false positive rates [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60386" pm="."><plain>Here we have developed a novel pipeline to integrate contextual information, derived from gene expression data, with publicly available PPI data [48] to predict both the nodes and edges in the contextual PPI network. Ultimately, this more refined contextual model should lead to an improved elucidation of the interactions and functional modules that are active in each of the experimental conditions considered in this study. <p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="60388" pm="."><plain>In summary, the aim of this study was to investigate changes in the transcriptome of the skeletal muscle of untrained Thoroughbred horses (UR) in response to a single bout of high-intensity sprint exercise (UE), and following an exercise conditioning (training) regime (TR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60389" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that regular bouts of high-intensity exercise training would prime the transcriptome of Thoroughbred skeletal muscle for the demands of the next exercise bout. Furthermore, by integrating this information on contextual transcriptional changes with known molecular interactions, we also tested the hypothesis that these transcriptional adaptions may lead to a ‘re-wiring’ of the molecular interactome in response to high-intensity exercise and training. Lastly we have demonstrated that a refined computational network-based approach, which considers both context-specific nodes (genes) and edges (interactions), has the potential to uncover novel features indicative of specific biological processes when compared to standard supervised approaches. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec2"><title><text><SENT sid="60392" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par53"><text><SENT sid="60524" pm="."><plain>The functional relevance of a gene or gene list in a context can only be fully appreciated by also examining how the genes, or their products, interact in that context. We therefore attempted to reconstruct context-specific dynamic PPI networks by integrating our exercise and training response gene lists and per cohort co-expression correlations with the global set of experimentally validated PPIs as described by EBI’s IntAct Database. First, two dynamic networks were constructed to model how the genes associated with the exercise and training responses may ‘interact’ in each of the experimental cohorts. The set of genes (network nodes) in each dynamic interaction network was confined to those genes associated with that response. The putative interactions (network edges) were inferred from the gene expression correlations in each experimental cohort. The edges in each dynamic network had two states, the ground state, derived from the untrained rest (UR) cohort, and the active state, derived by either the exercise (UE) or trained (TR) cohort. Edges were also weighted with cohort specific correlation coefficients. To better model the putative contextual protein-protein interactions (PPIs) these correlation-based interaction networks were then rigorously pruned to remove edges with no supporting experimental PPI evidence, retrieved via EBI’s IntAct database. An overview of this process is illustrated in Fig. 5, where output networks (i)-(vi) reflect Figs. 6 and 7, and further details are given in Methods. The final putative dynamic PPI network for the exercise response contained 513 nodes (edgeless nodes were removed) and 514 edges in the untrained rest (UR) state, see Fig. 6(a), and 426 nodes and 390 edges in the exercise (UE) state, Fig. 6(b).Fig. 5Pipeline for construction of putative dynamic PPI networks in the exercise and training responses.

This can be considered the ‘ground state’ of the dynamic exercise network and can be compared to the exercise ‘active state’, (2): G = (V UE, E UE ), or the sub-network that is exclusive to exercise, (3):G = (V UE – TR ,E UE ) to model how these putative PPI interactions might be re-wired in the exercise response and the exercise-specific response respectively.

We observed that approximately one third of genes that were diffientially expressed in response to a single bout of exercise accumulate with training leading to new baseline levels of gene expression, suggesting that increases in aerobic capacity may be brought about mainly through this mechanism. Therefore, consecutive bouts of exercise training seem to result in a priming of the skeletal muscle transcriptome for the demands of the next exercise bout.

We also observed that several neurodegenerative disorders, namely Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Huntington’s Disease (HD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD), were amongst the most significantly enriched KEGG categories associated with both the exercise response and the training response. The links between these neurodegenerative diseases and mitochondrial dysfunction have been well established [90] and the over-representation of these pathways may be due in part to the effect that intense exercise has on mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, an early deficit of synaptic mitochondria and motor function has been associated with AD [90, 91], physical exercise has been shown to be protective in both AD and PD [92] and increased mitochondrial biogenesis has recently been shown to improve symptoms in HD [93]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60662" pm="."><plain>In addition, due to the group-wise nature of over-representation analysis the chief drivers or regulators of biological processes may not always be apparent (nor are these, of course, necessarily highlighted by basic statistical association of expression gene). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60665" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we found that some nodes appeared to gain influence in response to exercise and/or training relative to the untrained rest network state. In the exercise response network for example, FN1 (fibronectin) became more influential in the network after exercise relative to the untrained rest state (promoted from 11th to 2nd top bottleneck). FN1 is involved in cell adhesion, migration, growth and differentiation [97], and interestingly, has previously been used as an indicator of myofibre damage, such as may occur after intense exercise [98]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60667" pm="."><plain>Another gene that appeared to become more influential in the post-exercise network state, LIMA1 (LIM Domain and actin binding 1), has been shown to stabilize the vascular capillary network in vitro [99]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60668" pm="."><plain>This information, and the fact that neither FN1 nor LIMA1 expression was associated with the training response, might indicate involvement in muscle or microvascular recovery and repair following intense exercise. Continuing in this theme, the top differential bottleneck gene DNAJB1 (DnaJ Hsp40 Member B1), which was significantly (P = 3.6 × 10−14) upregulated (&gt;4-fold) in response to exercise, has previously been found to be upregulated in skeletal muscle in response to heat shock [100]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60670" pm="."><plain>Interestingly this is one of the few genes whose expression is also significantly reversed in the training response (−1.6-fold, P = 0.0005). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60672" pm="."><plain>Together these data suggest that these genes may be involved in the stress response induced by intense exercise in the untrained cohort. <p id="Par74"><text><SENT sid="60673" pm="."><plain>Several other genes, such as SIRT4 (sirtulin 4), GRB2 (growth factor receptor bound protein 2), GNB4 (G protein subunit beta 4) and CDK18 (cyclin dependent kinase 18), became less influential in the exercise network state relative to untrained rest network state (i.e. their hub/bottleneck ranks were all down-graded after exercise). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60674" pm="."><plain>Although SIRT4 had far fewer edges in the exercise state relative to rest state (4 vs. 18 edges) it was highly significantly upregulated (+1.69-fold; P = 2.4 × 10−14) in the exercise response. This perhaps suggests a shift in function in response to exercise. SIRT4 has been shown to associate with mitochondria and to have ‘strong and reproducible’ ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [101]. SIRT4 is also required for protection against cell death caused by nutrient starvation via a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial NAD+ levels [102]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60677" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the only novel edge that was gained by SIRT4 in the exercise response was with SLC25A5 (solute carrier family 25 Member 5), which was also highly significantly upregulated in the exercise response only (+3.2-fold; P = 5.3 × 10−21 ) relative to untrained rest. SLC25A catalyses the exchange of mitochondrial ATP with cytoplasmic ADP across the mitochondrial inner membrane [103]. SIRT4 also retains an edge with ETHE1 (persulfide dioxygenase), which was also upregulated in the exercise response (+1.3-fold; P = 9.5 × 10−08). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60680" pm="."><plain>Together these data suggest that the re-wiring of SIRT4 interactions in the exercise state may be part of the exercise-induced stress response and may contribute to the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in mitochondria. <p id="Par75"><text><SENT sid="60681" pm="."><plain>In the trained network, we also observed evidence of a re-wiring of key hubs. SPTBN1 (spectrin beta chain non-erythrocytic 1), which was upregulated in the training response (+1.38-fold; P = 0.0052), appears to gain network influence in the trained network state (promoted in rank from 55th to 3rd top bottleneck). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60682" pm="."><plain>Functionally, SPTBN1 is involved in secretion, interacts with calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and has been isolated from post-synaptic density preparations [106]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60685" pm="."><plain>In further support of a mechanistic connection between these seemingly disparate physiological states, the reduced expression of the myostatin (MSTN) gene, referred to as the Thoroughbred ‘speed gene’ [13], has also been associated with hibernation in ground squirrels [109]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60686" pm="."><plain>Similarly, another gene, PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase), has also been previously associated with hibernation in mammals as well as intense exercise in Thoroughbred horses [31, 110]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60687" pm="."><plain>These data suggest perhaps that a similar biological mechanism may be involved both in the process of muscle growth during training and prevention of muscle wasting during prolonged inactivity and nutrient starvation. <p id="Par76"><text><SENT sid="60688" pm="."><plain>The inferred contextual network may also provide some additional mechanistic insight into the activity of SPTBN1 in the context of skeletal muscle adaptations to training. In the trained network, the SPTBN1 bottleneck mediates the ‘flow of information’ between the module containing GABARAPL1 and the module containing unconventional myosins, MYO19 and MYO18A, and SYNPO (synaptopodin). MYO19, which was upregulated in both the exercise (+1.5-fold; P = 3.9 × 10−08) and trained (+1.3-fold; P = 0.0046) responses, is known to be involved in mitochondrial motility [111]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60690" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, SYNPO, which was downregulated in both the exercise (−1.66-fold; P = 6.7 × 10−14) and trained (−1.59-fold; P = 7.2 × 10−05) responses, is known to be part of the post-synaptic density [112]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60691" pm="."><plain>ATP and Ca2+ flux is particularly important at the synapse, and mitochondria are usually present in pre-synaptic terminals [113]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60692" pm="."><plain>Taken together the above ‘re-wiring’ of SPTNB1 interactors may possibly reflect changes to the neuromuscular junction that occurs in response to exercise and training and may also suggests an increased influence of SPTNB1 in the training response. <p id="Par77"><text><SENT sid="60693" pm="."><plain>Although we observed MSTN to be highly significantly downregulated in both the exercise (−5.9-fold; P = 1.4 × 10–19) and training (−6.4-fold; P = 1.5 × 10−06) responses, it was absent from our putative contextual PPI networks as none of its contextual (correlation-based) edges were supported by experimentally validated PPIs. This may be partially explained by the stringency of our protocol (e.g. the exclusion of inverse co-expression correlations, inclusion only of PPIs supported by IMEX standard) and also lack of recorded interaction evidences for MSTN, due in part to that fact the MSTN ligand generally interacts with membrane-bound proteins, which are under-represented in PPI databases [114]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60695" pm="."><plain>However, by examining the larger non-validated correlation-based networks we observed some evidence of a change in MSTN-related activity in the exercise and training responses. We saw a reduction in MSTN edges in both the exercise and training network states relative to the untrained rest state. Also, approximately 20% (43/231) of exercise-induced MSTN edges were also observed in the trained state, suggesting that there may be some sustained adaptation of the MSTN-related signalling network in the trained cohort, although, of course, further support is required to substantiate this. Interestingly however, this list of 43 genes includes PVALB (parvalbumin), which was the most downregulated gene in both the exercise response (−25.43-fold; P = 3.5 × 10−20) and the training response (−33.27-fold; P = 7.8 × 10−10). PVALB is involved in calcium sequestration after muscle contraction to support muscle relaxation and a recognized fast-twitch phenotype gene [115].It has also been found that double-knockout PV−/− mice have prolonged muscle relaxation time, due to the maintenance of muscle Ca2+ levels, but also generate ~40% more force per contraction than PV +/− and WT animals [116]. <p id="Par78"><text><SENT sid="60699" pm="."><plain>By far the most influential gene, as determined by hub and bottleneck analysis, across both the exercise and training response networks was GABARAPL1 (GABA type A receptor associated protein like 1), where it ranked as top bottleneck across all network states (Tables 2 and 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60700" pm="."><plain>We found GABARAPL1 to be highly significantly upregulated (+1.49-fold; P = 6.5 × 10−12) in response to exercise and significantly upregulated (+1.37-fold; P = 0.0001) in the trained cohort compared to the untrained cohort. <p id="Par79"><text><SENT sid="60701" pm="."><plain>The product of GABARAPL1 is a ubiquitin-like modifier associated with the autophagosome and known to cause an increase in cell-surface expression of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kappa type opioid receptor (KOR), through facilitating anterograde trafficking of the receptor [117]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60702" pm="."><plain>KOR is the product of the OPRK1 gene. In our data OPRK1 mRNA expression showed no association with the exercise response, however it was significantly upregulated (+1.74-fold; P = 0.0075) in the training response. Taken together this information supports the model of an initial post-translational upregulation of the KOR cell-surface expression by GABARAPL1 in response to exercise and then, upon adaption, a transcriptional upregulation in the trained cohort. However, the downstream effect of the putative upregulation of the KOR in the context of exercise and training still needs to be clarified. KOR mediated signal transduction is known to stimulate several kinase cascades depending upon the specific activating ligand [118]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60707" pm="."><plain>For example, dynorphin activation of KOR has been shown to be involved in the stress response (e.g. to stressors such as forced swim) in mice [119]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60708" pm="."><plain>This same ligand-receptor interaction has also been associated with pro-addictive behaviour [120]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60709" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed in this context, but we hypothesize that the regulation of aversive/motivational behaviour by KORs may play a role in the adaptation of the organism to regular and sustained bouts of intense exercise. <p id="Par80"><text><SENT sid="60710" pm="."><plain>We can also attempt to extract additional mechanistic and functional insight into GABARAPL1 in the context of exercise and training from community analysis. GABARPL1 is a member of the exercise network cluster that is significantly enriched (P = 2.56 × 10−10) for the Proton-transporting ATP synthase/Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V (MRC complex V). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60711" pm="."><plain>This cluster also has four putative interactions with the cluster that is significantly enriched (P = 9.69 × 10−38) for NADH dehydrogenase/ Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (MRC complex I) (see Fig. 6(a)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60712" pm="."><plain>In the exercise response, we observed a general upregulation of the genes in both clusters and a general disturbance in the rest of the network (see Fig. 6(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60713" pm="."><plain>These clusters became ‘re-wired’ but remained largely intact except for a major de-coupling of the MRC complex I-enriched cluster (along with genes encoding members of MRC complex V) from the rest of the network in the exercise state (see Fig. 6(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60714" pm="."><plain>We observed that correspondingly enriched clusters (i.e. also enriched for MRC complexes I and V) were also present and upregulated in the trained state network (see Fig. 7(b)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60715" pm="."><plain>However, in this case, the upregulation of these clusters was better coordinated with the rest of the network and was not accompanied by the similar de-coupling. Interestingly, this apparent ‘de-coupling’ of MRC complexes I and V during exercise, may be a reflection of the recognized physiological response to oxidative stress known as uncoupling and mediated by UCP3 in skeletal muscle [23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60717" pm="."><plain>This is also supported by the highly significant upregulation of UCP3 (+4.8-fold; P = 7.6 × 10−22) in the exercise response.

The central position of GABARAPL1 in both the exercise and trained networks may suggest a driver/regulatory role in these responses, perhaps mediated in part via its control of kappa OR cell-surface expression, and downstream effects may include the altered regulation of the components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Previous studies have shown that the knock-down of GABRAPL1 leads to many cellular bioenergetic changes, including increased basal oxygen consumption rate, increased intracellular ATP (possibly due to OR-mediated dysregulation of adenylyl cyclinase/cAMP signalling), increased total glutathione, and an accumulation of damaged mitochondria [117]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60722" pm="."><plain>It has also recently been reported that the dysregulation of autophagy, in which GABARAPL1 has a central role, is linked to several neuromuscular disorders in human [122]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60723" pm="."><plain>In the context of exercise and training, autophagy has already been shown to be activated by high-intensity, but not low-intensity, exercise in human [123] and to be involved in the maintenance of muscle mass in Atg7 (autophagy related 7) knock-out mice [124]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60724" pm="."><plain>It has also been proposed that autophagosomal proteins, of which GABARPL1 is one, may act as sensors for oxidative stress (via redox signalling) and mediate cross-talk between this and other cellular processes such as mitochondrial turnover [125]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60725" pm="."><plain>This latter relationship, in particular, would explain the tight coupling of GABARAPL1, NADH dehydrogenase/ Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and Proton-transporting ATP synthase/Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex V clusters that we observed in the exercise (rest state) and training networks. There is already some experimental evidence to support a role for autophagy in muscle cell homeostasis during exercise [126, 127]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60727" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there is support for GABARAPL1 being directly involved in mediating the autophagic energy stress response in heart muscle, involving both mitophagy and glycophagy, via its interaction starch binding domain 1 (STBD1) protein [128]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60728" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that GABARAPL1 may play a central role in the adaption to oxidative stress induced by intense exercise and may also play a key role in the adaptive response to training, perhaps in part via a role in the recycling and upregulation of mitochondria via mitophagy. <p id="Par82"><text><SENT sid="60729" pm="."><plain>The training response network also contains evidence of ancillary adaptations. For example, a small three-gene module, containing APP (amyloid beta precursor protein), ARRB1(arrestin beta 1) and MAPK10 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 10), that is enriched for Enzyme inhibitor activity/Response to radiation was initially disconnected from the main network in the untrained rest state (see Fig. 7(a)). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60734" pm="."><plain>This module is also extended with the addition of several genes also unique to the training response (see Fig. 7(c)), namely CAT (catalase) and EGLN3 (egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 3) and JUN (Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit), which were also upregulated at a transcriptional level in the trained cohort. Catalase helps protect the cell against hydrogen peroxide mediated cytotoxicity especially when levels of pyruvate are low [131]. EGLN3 is one of the most important isoenzymes in modulating the hypoxic response [132] and has also been reported to regulate myogenin expression and skeletal muscle differentiation. Interestingly, JUN is known to be activated by ORs [133] and has been found to be involved in oxidative stress-mediated suppression of insulin gene expression [134]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60737" pm="."><plain>Another six-gene cluster in the training response network, that was upregulated in a coordinated manner in response to training, contained genes that encode ligands and receptors of the VEGF signalling pathway.

</text></title><p id="Par83"><text><SENT sid="60742" pm="."><plain>Functional category over-representation analysis is a commonly used and valuable aid to the biological interpretation of gene/protein lists. However, this analysis may be improved with additional information (e.g. molecular interactions inferred from gene expression) derived from the experimental context in question (e.g. post-exercise skeletal muscle) and a contribution from unsupervised methods (e.g. community analysis) in defining functional classes. The absence of these considerations risks underexploiting rich high-throughput datasets and overlooking novel information that might help to expand knowledge of biological systems. As this is the first demonstration of this computational method, we have applied a stringent implementation to maximize quality over scale; however, in the future more refined implementations could be developed. Our results clearly demonstrate that network analysis and its capacity to predict influential nodes is very useful for highlighting putative control points. For example, our hypothesis that GABARAPL1 and autophagy may play a central role in the response to exercise and training was generated solely from this network analysis approach. Standard over-representation analysis enabled some insight into downstream effects (e.g. enrichment for energy metabolism, neurodegenerative disease etc.) but did not highlight the autophagy process nor point to a putative driver gene. Neither was this indicated by differential gene expression analysis (GABARAPL1 was outside the top 250 genes most significantly associated with exercise or training). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60750" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have demonstrated the benefits of a novel network-based approach, which may serve as a model for future transcriptomics-based investigations into the molecular dynamics of biological systems in health and disease. <p id="Par84"><text><SENT sid="60751" pm="."><plain>Taken together our results, both from the over-representation analysis and our novel network analysis approach, support the involvement of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase) and V (ATP Synthase) in both the exercise and training responses. As expected, the exercise response in the untrained cohort appeared to include elements of a stress response but also included the downregulation of genes involved in myogenic differentiation. Neither of these features were observed in the trained cohort, although we cannot preclude them from a ‘trained’ exercise response based on the current data. It is also noteworthy that there is some limited support for the constitutive downregulation of heatshock proteins in the trained cohort. However, we did observe strong indications of the constitutive and coordinated upregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and V in the trained cohort, which may suggest that the skeletal muscle has adapted to regular bouts of intense-exercise in this manner, presumably improving the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. There is also the suggestion from our network analysis that this upregulation of mitochondrial complexes, and indeed mitochondria, in response to exercise and especially training may be controlled in part by autophagy (and perhaps mitophagy) via GABARAPL1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60757" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggested a connection between GABARAPL1 and the stimulation of/response to GPCR, especially via the opioid receptor, signalling, in both exercise and training. The network analysis also suggested that the SPTBN1 gene may play an important role in the adaptive response and that this response may include re-wiring of its interactions at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction. Somewhat unexpected was the strong overlap between the exercise and training responses and pathways linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. However, there seems to be a strong body of evidence for an established role for mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagy in neurodegenerative disease. This also supports our hypothesis of the central involvement of these processes in both the exercise and training response in skeletal muscle. The involvement of authophagy and mitochondrial activity at the synaptic junction in both neurodegenerative disease and athletic adaptation seems to be a common theme, but further validation of this largely in silico generated hypothesis is required. In recent years autophagy and its role in many cellular processes and diseases [136] has garnered much interest and already autophagy-enhancing therapeutics have been proposed [137]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60764" pm="."><plain>This study has provided further support for this process in relation to exercise (especially intense exercise), provided novel evidence of its central involvement in the adaptation of skeletal muscle to training and identified the autophagosomal gene GABARAPL1 as a potential regulatory target. </sec></SecTag><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><text><SENT sid="60765" pm="."><plain>Additional files </plain></SENT>
