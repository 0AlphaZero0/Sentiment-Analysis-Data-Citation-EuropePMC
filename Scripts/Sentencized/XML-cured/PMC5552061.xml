<SENT sid="60983" pm="."><plain>In addition, recent studies have reported various cognitive deficits following damage to the cerebellum,3, 4, 5, 6, 7 suggesting its involvement in mental processes.8 </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60984" pm="."><plain>Significant advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cerebellar functions have been attained by the generation and analysis of gene-modified mice.9, 10, 11, 12, 13 In particular, mice with Purkinje cell-specific gene modifications played a pivotal role.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Purkinje cell-specific gene expression in most transgenic mice has used the Purkinje cell protein 2 (PCP2)/L7 promoter (henceforth L7), which drives the transcription of the L7 gene to produce the Purkinje cell-specific L7 protein.20, 21, 22 The L7 structural gene contains four exons that extend over about 2 kb in the genome.22 The rodent L7 promoter that was used in the Purkinje cell-specific transgenic mice consists of a 3-kb genomic region covering exons 1–4 with the upstream 0.9-kb promoter region.16, 23, 24, 25 The original start codon present in exon 2 and the potential downstream ATGs, in all reading frames, were removed from the exon regions.23 Therefore, the translation was initiated only from an ATG provided by an exogenous cDNA cloned into the unique BamHI site in exon 4. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60985" pm="."><plain>Recently, the application of gene transfer using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors has markedly increased because of their efficient and broad transduction capacity in neuronal and glial cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60986" pm="."><plain>A major drawback of the AAV vectors, however, is their limited packaging capacity of a maximum of 5 kb, including the two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which is similar to the size of the parent AAV genome.26 Therefore, expressing a 2-kb transgene by the 3-kb L7 promoter is not guaranteed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60987" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the L7 promoter has a considerably weaker promoter strength compared with constitutive virus promoters such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) and murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60988" pm="."><plain>Thus, identifying a minimal and strong L7 promoter sequence preserving the Purkinje cell specificity will broaden the range of the transgene size for the viral accommodation and will advance the utilization of AAV vectors in the cerebellar research. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60989" pm="."><plain>In a yet unpublished previous study using lentiviral vectors, we found that a 1-kb fragment of the L7 promoter exhibited strikingly greater promoter strength than the original 3-kb L7 promoter (US Patent 8912315 B2),27 although the experimental procedure to obtain the 1-kb fragment and the sequence have not yet been published. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60990" pm="."><plain>Subsequent utilization of the compact 1-kb promoter by several groups, including ours,28, 29, 30, 31 revealed overall maintenance of the Purkinje cell selectivity, but with some diffuse activity in off-target cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="60991" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we reported the identification of the 1-kb L7 fragment and its further truncation for a higher degree of Purkinje cell specificity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60992" pm="."><plain>We showed that a 0.8-kb sequence upstream of the transcription initiation codon in the first exon of the L7 gene alone exhibited a great promoter strength that is almost comparable with the 1-kb fragment, but with a significantly higher specificity to Purkinje cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60993" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we demonstrated that this minimal 0.8-kb L7 promoter could work efficiently and specifically in Purkinje cells of a non-human primate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="60997" pm="."><plain>Although those splice variants were designated by unique names in the original papers, they were re-named for clarity to form A,32 form B,33 form C,34 and form D.35 Oberdick et al.22 produced transgenic mice expressing LacZ (β-galactosidase) under the control of the 8-kb L7 genomic fragment comprising the transcribed region of the form A (1.9 kb), 4 kb upstream of the start codon present in exon 2, and 2 kb downstream of the polyadenylation signal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60998" pm="."><plain>In accordance with the native L7 expression, the transgenic line showed β-galactosidase expression solely in Purkinje cells, indicating that the 8-kb genomic fragment involves regions critical for Purkinje cell-restricted expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="60999" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, Smeyne et al.23 generated transgenic mice expressing an attenuated form of the diphtheria toxin under the control of the 3-kb L7 fragment in which the cDNA was inserted into a unique BamHI site present in exon 4, whereas the original start codon in exon 2 and other potential ATGs in exons were mutated (see L7-1 in Figure 2A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61000" pm="."><plain>The transgenic mice expressing a transgene using the L7-1 promoter exhibited highly specific GFP expression in Purkinje cells,16, 23, 24, 25 which strongly indicates the presence of regions regulating the Purkinje cell-specific expression in the L7-1 promoter. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61029" pm="."><plain>Notably, the Purkinje cell specificity, which was evaluated by the ratio of GFP-positive Purkinje cells relative to the total GFP-positive cells in the cell culture, was not compromised by the deletion of the distal half of the structural gene (98.88% ± 0.72% for L7-1 and 99.54 ± 0.30% for L7-3; p = 1.000; Figure 2D). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61049" pm="."><plain>In addition, the L7 splice variants that use different ATG in exon 1 as a translation initiation codon (forms B and C) prompted us to narrow down the L7 further to a shorter promoter with a more restricted leakage to other cell types. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="61117" pm="."><plain>In the first part of this study, we used the proximal 0.9-kb promoter sequence and the L7 (form A) structural gene sequence containing four exons (L7-1 in Figure 2A) to identify the minimal sequence required for a Purkinje cell-specific and robust transgene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="61118" pm="."><plain>This region was selected because the 3-kb L7-1 sequence has been widely used for the generation of transgenic mice with Purkinje cell-specific transgene expression.14, 16, 17, 22, 24, 25 In the L7-1 composition used for those transgenic mice, the original transcription start codon in exon 2 and other possible start codons in every exon were disrupted, and the transgene containing a start codon was inserted into the BamHI site of exon 4. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61120" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we returned the transcription start codon to the original position in exon 2: we deleted the distal half of the structural gene and placed the transgene in exon 2 following the original ATG codon with a reading frame adjusted (L7-3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="61122" pm="."><plain>This superior feature of the L7-4 promoter over the L7-1 promoter was confirmed also in the mouse cerebellum in vivo (Figures 3A–3F). </plain></SENT>
