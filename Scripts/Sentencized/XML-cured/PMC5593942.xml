</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="62797" pm="."><plain>Onychomycosis is a multifactorial nail fungal infection1–3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62798" pm="."><plain>It is an important public health problem because of its high prevalence, high rates of recurrence and progression to chronic lesions4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62799" pm="."><plain>Onychomycosis accounts for 50% of all nail diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62800" pm="."><plain>It affects 2–13% of the general population, and this percentage increases with age, reaching up to 40% in the elderly5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62801" pm="."><plain>Thickened, discoloured, deformed nails without pain are the most common symptoms of a fungal nail infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62802" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical picture can be very suggestive, the diagnosis should be confirmed by a routine method before starting treatment5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62803" pm="."><plain>The most commonly used methods are direct potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination, culture, and, to a lesser extent, nail biopsy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62804" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of onychomycosis is made when one or more of the three diagnostic tests are positive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62805" pm="."><plain>Other tests are expensive and require the use of specialized equipment and materials6. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="62806" pm="."><plain>Common pathogens in onychomycosis are dermatophytes, nondermatophyte moulds (NDMs) and yeasts1, 3, 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62807" pm="."><plain>The nomenclature of fungal infections proposed by the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology suggests that the term onychomycosis should be replaced by tinea unguium when the aetiological agent is a dermatophyte; by onyxis when yeasts are the cause; by ungual candidiasis when the agent is Candida; and by ungual mycosis when the causal agent is an NDM8. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="62808" pm="."><plain>Most cases of tinea unguium are caused by dermatophytes that belong to three genera: Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62809" pm="."><plain>The fungi Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum are the most common aetiologic agents of onychomycosis worldwide. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62810" pm="."><plain>The most commonly described species of NDM are Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Fusarium spp., Acremonium spp., Aspergillus spp., Scytalidium spp., and Onychocola canadienses 8. Candida species are the most frequent among the yeasts7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62811" pm="."><plain>Other yeasts accepted in recent years as causative agents of onychomycosis are Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 9, R. minuta 10 and R. glutinis 11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62812" pm="."><plain>Several authors have isolated Rhodotorula from ecosystems and environments12–15, humans16–18 and animals13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62813" pm="."><plain>During the last few decades, they have emerged as opportunistic pathogens, particularly in immunocompromised patients19. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="62814" pm="."><plain>Because onychomycosis aetiologic agents have variable susceptibility to antifungal drugs, laboratory diagnosis is a necessary tool for ascertaining the best therapeutic option4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62815" pm="."><plain>Precise and correct identification of the species responsible for onychomycosis in a given patient is required to select the most appropriate treatment as well as to avoid the misuse of antifungals9. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="62816" pm="."><plain>Thus, in vitro susceptibility tests demonstrated that R. mucilaginosa is sensitive to low concentrations of amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine and resistant to high concentrations of fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and terbinafine9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62817" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in the case of R. glutinis, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) vary depending on the antifungal drug: 0.125 μg/mL for itraconazole; 0.5 μg/mL for amphotericin B, anidulafungin and posaconazole; 1 μg/mL for voriconazole; 16 μg/mL for caspofungin and 128 μg/mL for fluconazole11. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62818" pm="."><plain>Overall, for humans the use of antifungals against Rhodotorula infections is still controversial because in vitro some are inactive against the majority of clinical isolates of Rhodotorula spp.19. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="62819" pm="."><plain>R. mucilaginosa is a basidiomycetous yeast. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62820" pm="."><plain>It presents only spheroidal to oval budding cells (2.5–6.5 × 6.5–14.0 µm) with carotenoid pigments12, 20 and without the rudimentary formation of hyphae21, 22. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62821" pm="."><plain>This species is characterized by yeast-like colonies that are coral pink and moist to mucoid on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), by the inability to assimilate inositol and by the absence of fermentation23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62822" pm="."><plain>Carotenoids can act as vitamin A precursors, having colouring and antioxidant properties24. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62823" pm="."><plain>Carotenoids are widely produced pigments found in algae, yeasts and plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62824" pm="."><plain>Their main functions are reactive oxygen species scavenging and protection against photooxidative damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62825" pm="."><plain>Four main pigments, torularhodin, torulene, beta-carotene and gamma-carotene, are synthesized by R. mucilaginosa species24, 25, and carotenoid production is usually enhanced by stress factors such as UV exposure, oxidative stress or osmotic stress26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62826" pm="."><plain>Torularhodin was shown to be correlated with the survival of the cells under UV-B light27. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62827" pm="."><plain>Beta-carotene and torularhodin also showed antioxidant activity, preventing hyperoxia-induced cytotoxicity28. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="62828" pm="."><plain>Carotenoid synthesis starts from acetyl-CoA that is transformed into isopentenyl pyrophosphate and further to lycopene, which is the source of many other carotenoids29. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62829" pm="."><plain>Cases of depigmentation have previously been reported and are thought to be induced by chemicals interfering with the biosynthetic process. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62830" pm="."><plain>Naftifine, a topical allylamine, has been shown to interfere with the pigmentation process of Staphylococcus aureus colonies by specifically and strongly inhibiting isoprenoid synthesis30. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="62831" pm="."><plain>The study aimed first to find onychomycosis etiology and sensitivity to naftifine and bifonazole. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62832" pm="."><plain>Secondly, R. mucilaginosa growth, carotenoids metabolism and structural changes were analysed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="62834" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that R. mucilaginosa was a causative agent in this specific case of onychomycosis in an aged patient with chronic HBV hepatitis (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62835" pm="."><plain>After incubation of all toenail samples in SDA control media, R. mucilaginosa isolates were identified by morphological and cultural characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62836" pm="."><plain>Control colonies of R. mucilaginosa obtained on SDA were mucoid, with red colour (Fig. 1B) and a diameter of 12-13 mm 3 days after inoculation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62837" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis was performed for species identity confirmation14, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62838" pm="."><plain>The DNA sequence was run against the BLAST-NCBI nucleotide database31 as a query and matched identically with R. mucilaginosa (GenBank: KU052792.1) species.Figure 1(A) Toenails affected by onychomycosis; (B).

<SENT sid="62839" pm="."><plain>Transfer and growth of depigmented yeast cells to fresh SDA results in repigmentation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="62840" pm="."><plain>Then, by exposing a control R. mucilaginosa isolate for 10 minutes to 1 mg/mL naftifine solution, depigmented fungal colonies were obtained on SDA control media. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62841" pm="."><plain>The depigmented colonies were mucoid and had similar diameters to the red colonies but showed a milky colour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62842" pm="."><plain>Moreover, by including small concentrations of naftifine (0.1 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL) in SDA before inoculation of R. mucilaginosa isolate, an inhibitory effect was obtained compared to the control colonies (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62843" pm="."><plain>These depigmented colonies had a diameter of 7-8 mm on SDA with 0.1 mg/mL naftifine and of 5-6 mm on SDA with 0.2 mg/mL naftifine, showing a small dose-dependent inhibitory effect of the drug (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62844" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, by inoculating depigmented R. mucilaginosa isolate into SDA control media, colonies regained pigment (Fig. 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62845" pm="."><plain>Considering that carotenoids are important substances against reactive oxygen species (ROS), depigmentation may be correlated with increased oxidative stress and fungal injury. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62846" pm="."><plain>Repigmentation suggested that the carotenoid metabolism changes induced in the fungi by naftifine were reversible. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62847" pm="."><plain>These surprising results suggested further analysis regarding R. mucilaginosa carotenoid metabolism and related structural changes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="62848" pm="."><plain>Preliminary tests of R. mucilaginosa growth under our conditions indicated that the stationary phase was reached after 60–70 h. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62849" pm="."><plain>However, in the initial exponential stage the cells appeared mostly colourless (low carotenoid content), and only after approximately 50 h could the pigmentation be observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62850" pm="."><plain>This monitoring was performed at various pH values (pH range 3.5–7.5), especially for tracking carotenoid formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62851" pm="."><plain>The growth was pH-dependent only in the initial exponential phase (Fig. S1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62852" pm="."><plain>Although the pH profile change in time was dependent on the initial pH (Fig. S1B), indicating a pH-dependent metabolism for R. mucilaginosa, carotenoid formation in terms of both rate and composition did not depend on pH significantly, as observed by monitoring the intensity and spectral features from the resonant Raman spectra (Fig. S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62853" pm="."><plain>We aimed to further understand the factors that influenced and controlled carotenoid formation in Rhodotorula spp. beyond the factors that interfered with basic metabolism, such as type of C and N sources and their ratio26, compounds inducing ROS stress (e.g., duroquinone, methylene blue). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62854" pm="."><plain>ROS upregulated carotenoid content in R. mucilaginosa, indicating that the carotenoids were a response of the cells to the negative effects of ROS agents (e.g., superoxide, singlet oxygen) as previously shown28, 32. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62855" pm="."><plain>Other chemicals, such as amphotericin and diphenylamine, not only inhibited carotenoid formation but also cell development (Fig. S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62856" pm="."><plain>In addition, we hypothesized that the photosensitizers hypericin and hyperforin could also induce carotenoid formation; however, this was not the case (Fig. S3), most likely due to the low level of the induced potential stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="62857" pm="."><plain>During these initial experiments, we observed that one of the two tested antifungal agents, namely, naftifine (an allylamine antifungal drug), did not inhibit cell growth at lower concentrations, but rather induced depigmentation of the cells when growing on solid medium (Fig. 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62858" pm="."><plain>The same results were obtained in liquid media, in controlled conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62859" pm="."><plain>In addition to determination of naftifine MIC50 (55 ± 14 mg/L) for its antifungal activity (Fig. 2A), quantified by OD600nm, the effect of naftifine on depigmentation was assessed by OD512nm and a corresponding MIC50 (0.088 ± 0.02 mg/L) was determined (Fig. 2B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62860" pm="."><plain>Depigmentation did not affect the cell growth at these naftifine concentrations, as could be observed by the optical density values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62861" pm="."><plain>In contrast, bifonazole (an imidazole antifungal drug) did not produce any depigmentation in R. mucilaginosa, although its MIC50 for antifungal activity was one order of magnitude lower, 4.4 ± 0.8 mg/L (Fig. 2C and D).Figure 2(A) Determination of MIC50 values for naftifine content in the pharmaceutical product Exoderil by monitoring the OD at 600 nm and (B) by absorbance at 512 nm after cell disruption with DMSO. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="62863" pm="."><plain>Similar depigmentation was observed by resonant Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 3A), where besides the expected decrease in signal intensities of the main peaks 999 cm−1 (C = CH deformation), 1150 cm−1 (symmetrical C-C stretching), 1505 cm−1 (symmetrical C = C stretching) due to carotenoid content, subtle changes could be observed in the 1200–1400 cm−1 region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62864" pm="."><plain>Minor Raman shifts were recorded for the secondary peak at 1283 cm−1 (torulene), ascribed to the CH2 deformation in carotenoids33, 34. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62865" pm="."><plain>This band was shifted in the case of torularhodin at 1284 cm−1, at 1286 cm−1 for β-carotene and at 1290 cm−1 for unidentified carotenoid (Cnd), indicating a possible change of the carotenoid composition in the cells, thus a qualitative change. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62866" pm="."><plain>This observation was further supported by the UV-vis spectra, where in addition to an absorbance decrease with increased naftifine concentrations, the spectral profiles also changed (i.e., the ratio of the three main spectral features) (Fig. 3B).Figure 3(A) Resonant Raman spectra of R. mucilaginosa cells grown in media containing various naftifine concentrations (indicated to the right of each spectrum). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="62869" pm="."><plain>Next, for more in-depth investigations, chromatographic analysis of the extracted carotenoids was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62870" pm="."><plain>From a variety of solvents or conditions for cell disruption available in the literature, we chose simple DMSO treatment of the washed cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62871" pm="."><plain>The advantages of this procedure are the high yield of extraction (only a colourless pellet remained, indicating a quantitative extraction) and the good solubility of ergosterol in this solvent, which allowed a simultaneous extraction of both type of constituents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62872" pm="."><plain>The High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed the separation of four main carotenoids including torularhodin, torulene and β-carotene (C1, C2 and C3, respectively), in good agreement with previous data27, 32 (Fig. 4A), while the other compound (Cnd) could not be identified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62873" pm="."><plain>The identification was done using a pure standard for β-carotene and retention times, as well as using highly specific spectral features of the other two compounds, which were in very good agreement with already known data (Fig. 4B, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62874" pm="."><plain>The unidentified compound presented torulene-like carotenoid absorption spectral features and had a chromatographic behaviour (lower retention time allowing assignment as hydroxy-torulene) resembling previously detected carotenoids in other Rhodotorula spp.35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62875" pm="."><plain>Additionally, ergosterol was also separated using the same method and identified based on its chromatographic and highly specific spectral characteristics (Fig. 4A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="62876" pm="."><plain>Moreover, using a dedicated method for ergosterol extraction, a highly similar spectrum was obtained. </plain></SENT>
