<SENT sid="63110" pm="."><plain>This Ly49H NK receptor/m157 ligand interaction has been found to mediate host resistance to CMV in the spleen, and lung, but is much less effective in the liver, so it is not known if this interaction is important in the context of SNHL. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="63123" pm="."><plain>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common infectious cause of congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in humans [1] with between 15–30% of pediatric hearing loss attributable to this infection [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63124" pm="."><plain>The consequences of hearing loss for affected children include speech and language delay, poor education attainment, and poor occupational performance in adulthood [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63125" pm="."><plain>The total cost for each child with hearing loss is estimated to be over three hundred thousand dollars accounting for the lost productivity, the need for special education, vocational rehabilitation, assistive devices and medical costs [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63126" pm="."><plain>One study estimates the total costs to the United States associated with congenital CMV infection to be $4 billion a year [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63127" pm="."><plain>Despite the known significant health burden caused by congenital CMV induced hearing loss, very little is known about its pathogenesis including considerable uncertainty regarding the roles of direct viral replication in the cochlea and the contribution of host immune responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63128" pm="."><plain>An animal model that accurately recapitulates human CMV-induced hearing loss has been developed to evaluate more effective strategies for prevention and treatment [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63129" pm="."><plain>Our group and others have successfully demonstrated that murine CMV (mCMV)-induced labyrinthitis in BALB/c murine newborn pups occurs when green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing mCMV was used to inoculate newborn mice via an intracerebral (IC) injection [10, 11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63130" pm="."><plain>These studies recapitulate viral mediated hearing loss in human infant because a critical factor for effective correlation between the mouse model and the clinical condition is that the mouse auditory system at birth is analogous to the human fetal auditory system and does not achieve stable thresholds until 4 weeks of age [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63131" pm="."><plain>When infected at birth, fifty-five percent had profound hearing loss (≥ 80 dB) at 4 weeks of age, while the other forty-five percent initially showed moderate hearing loss that progressed to profound hearing loss by 6–8 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63132" pm="."><plain>These findings mirror the longitudinal human clinical studies that show that 50% of children with hearing loss have worsening thresholds over time [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63133" pm="."><plain>Moreover, asymmetric hearing loss occurred in 40% of the mice, similar to the rate of 50% among children with congenital CMV infection observed by Fowler and colleagues [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63134" pm="."><plain>In addition, we also showed that this susceptibility to CMV-induced hearing loss was age dependent. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63135" pm="."><plain>While all of the postnatal day three (P3) infected mice showed elevated auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds at 4 weeks of age, only fifteen percent of the P8, and none of the P14 infected mice had hearing loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="63136" pm="."><plain>Pass et al. demonstrated an age dependent effect in children with congenital CMV infection who were more likely to develop hearing loss when infected during the first trimester rather than later in pregnancy [16]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="63137" pm="."><plain>The mouse model is relevant to evaluate the viral host interactions that involve the innate and adaptive immune response [17, 18]. </plain></SENT>
