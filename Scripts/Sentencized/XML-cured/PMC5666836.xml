<SENT sid="64834" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64835" pm="."><plain>Amyloids represent protein fibrils consisting of monomers that form intermolecular β-sheets located along the axis of a fibril and are stabilized by numerous hydrogen bonds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64836" pm="."><plain>Such a spatial structure is called “cross-β” [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64837" pm="."><plain>The term “cross-β” refers to the common pattern of amyloids in X-ray diffraction analysis with two scattering signals of approximately 4.7 and 10 Å corresponding to the distances between β-strands comprising β-sheets and between intermolecular β-sheets, respectively [2,3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64838" pm="."><plain>Their highly ordered structure gives amyloids unusual properties including resistance to treatment with ionic detergents [4], other protein denaturants [5] and proteinases [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64839" pm="."><plain>Initially, amyloids were described as lethal pathogens causing incurable diseases (amyloidoses) of humans and animals [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64840" pm="."><plain>The term “amyloid” was proposed in 1854 by Rudolf Virchow, who was the first to stain pathological amyloid deposits in human tissues with iodine [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64841" pm="."><plain>Though “amyloid” is a derivative from “amylon” and “amylum” (starch-like in Greek and Latin, respectively), the key components of amyloid deposits are protein fibrils [7,9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64842" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, such deposits additionally contain a significant number of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans that were initially detected by iodine and led to an incorrect interpretation of the chemical nature of amyloids [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64843" pm="."><plain>Amyloidoses occur primarily due to mutations that change the structure of the corresponding amyloid-forming proteins or lead to their overproduction [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64844" pm="."><plain>To date, more than 30 human proteins have been shown to adopt pathological amyloid states [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64845" pm="."><plain>Another aspect of these proteins was revealed over the last two decades, when amyloids that were not associated with pathogenesis were found. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64846" pm="."><plain>These amyloids, which are formed under native conditions and are implicated in cellular processes, were named “functional amyloids” [13,14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64847" pm="."><plain>In bacteria, functional amyloids are important for biofilm formation [15], toxin metabolism [16], and overcoming surface tension by aerial hyphae [17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64848" pm="."><plain>In archaea, such amyloids not only participate in the formation of biofilms [18] but also act as the structural components of the cell sheaths [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64849" pm="."><plain>Functional amyloids of fungi regulate heterokaryon incompatibility [20] as well as facultative multicellularity [21] and, similar to bacterial amyloids, contribute to the formation of aerial hyphae [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64850" pm="."><plain>Amyloids forming under native conditions in animals (including humans) are involved in long-term memory formation [23,24], melanin polymerization [25], hormone storage [26], tooth enamel polymerization, programmed necrosis [27], and antiviral responses [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64851" pm="."><plain>Taken together, amyloids represent not only pathogenic but also widespread functionally important variants of the quaternary protein structure and are vital for many species. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64852" pm="."><plain>The propensity of a protein to form amyloid fibrils is determined by the presence in its amino acid sequence of so-called “amyloidogenic regions” (ARs) that drive amyloidogenesis [29,30,31] acting as a “trigger” for polymerization [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64853" pm="."><plain>Amyloid-forming proteins may contain one or multiple ARs [33,34], which are relatively short [35] and predominantly composed of hydrophobic residues, especially aromatics (W, F, Y) and aliphatics (V, I, L) [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64854" pm="."><plain>ARs can be predicted using a wide range of algorithms, one of the most efficient of which is Waltz [37], which is based on a position-specific scoring matrix [36,37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64855" pm="."><plain>Another type of AR is represented by compositionally biased regions (CBRs) that are rich in glutamine (Q) and/or asparagine (N) [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64856" pm="."><plain>The key role of QN-rich CBRs in amyloid formation was initially demonstrated on the human poly-Q expanded Huntingtin protein [39] and further deepened by the data obtained on the yeast amyloid-forming proteins [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64857" pm="."><plain>In addition to QN, CBRs rich in E are also amyloid-prone [41]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64858" pm="."><plain>Compositionally biased regions rich in Q, N or E can be efficiently predicted by different existing bioinformatic algorithms, including LPS (Lower Probability Subsequences) [42] and SARP (Sequence Analysis based on the Ranking of Probabilities) [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64859" pm="."><plain>Hereafter, short amyloidogenic regions predicted with Waltz are referred to as ARs, while potentially amyloidogenic compositionally biased regions are referred to as CBRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64860" pm="."><plain>Currently, bioinformatic prediction is widely used for the detection of potentially amyloidogenic (i.e., containing amyloidogenic regions) proteins in the proteomes of different species [42,44,45] as well as for the identification of amyloidogenic regions in particular proteins to analyze their amyloid properties in vitro and in vivo [46,47,48]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64861" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that plants are one of the most economically important groups of organisms, they remain the least studied in the field of amyloid biology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64862" pm="."><plain>To date, amyloid properties have been demonstrated for several plant proteins or their fragments only in vitro [49,50] or in heterologous systems in vivo [46] (for a review, see [51]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64863" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a large-scale analysis of the distribution of potentially amyloidogenic proteins in the proteomes of land plants reported to date. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64864" pm="."><plain>We screened the proteomes of 75 species comprising more than 2.9 million proteins for the presence of amyloidogenic regions using the SARP and Waltz algorithms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64865" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the molecular functions of potentially amyloidogenic plant proteins along with their subcellular localization and molecular process involvement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64866" pm="."><plain>We found plant-specific groups of proteins in which amyloidogenic regions are overrepresented and discuss the analysis of amyloid properties of such proteins and their potential significance. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64870" pm="."><plain>Abundance of Potentially Amyloidogenic Proteins in the Proteomes of Plants </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64871" pm="."><plain>To assess the abundance of potentially amyloidogenic proteins in plant proteomes, the proteins of 75 plant species available in the Uniprot Proteomes database (available at http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/) were analyzed for the presence of amyloidogenic regions with two different bioinformatic approaches: Waltz, which predicts short amyloidogenic regions (ARs) based on a position-specific scoring matrix [37], and SARP, which searches for compositionally biased potentially amyloidogenic regions (CBRs) rich in particular residues [43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64872" pm="."><plain>For each proteome, we calculated the following: (i) fraction of potentially amyloidogenic proteins in the proteome; and (ii) the coverage of total proteome length with ARs and QN-rich CBRs (Figure 1, Table S1a). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64873" pm="."><plain>Amyloidogenic regions (ARs) predicted by Waltz are abundant in the proteomes of plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64874" pm="."><plain>More than half of all proteins in each proteome contained at least one such region (Figure S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64875" pm="."><plain>Most ARs are very short at approximately 6–9 amino acids long, with a modal length of seven residues (Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64876" pm="."><plain>Though such regions are amyloid-prone themselves [37], they may not contribute to amyloid-forming properties of the full-length proteins due to their short lengths. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64877" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to enhance the specificity of the predictions, we excluded from the Waltz analysis all ARs shorter than 10 amino acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64878" pm="."><plain>After this filtering, the median percentage of plant proteins that contained ARs predicted by Waltz was 25.41% (Table S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64879" pm="."><plain>Potentially amyloidogenic compositionally biased regions (CBRs) predicted by SARP were significantly less abundant than ARs predicted by Waltz: approximately 1.38% of plant proteins contain QN-rich CBRs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64880" pm="."><plain>The median length of CBRs predicted by SARP in plant proteomes was 203 residues for QN-rich CBRs (Table S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64881" pm="."><plain>In contrast to potentially amyloidogenic proteins predicted by Waltz, most of the potentially amyloidogenic proteins predicted by SARP contained only one potentially amyloidogenic compositionally biased region. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64882" pm="."><plain>Notably, though amyloidogenic region predictions by Waltz and SARP were completely different, ARs predicted by Waltz were associated with CBRs rich in hydrophobic residues I, W, Y, F predicted by SARP (Figure S3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64883" pm="."><plain>This result corresponds with the previous observation that amino acids with hydrophobic side chains have the highest amyloidogenic potential (i.e., propensity to form amyloid structure) [36]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64884" pm="."><plain>The AR contents predicted by Waltz and SARP varied broadly in the proteomes of different plant species and may be significantly different even in closely related species (Figure 1, Table S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64885" pm="."><plain>For example, Gossypium arboreum has many fewer proteins containing ARs predicted by Waltz (20.6%) compared to Gossypium hirsutum (29.5%) (Figure 1), which originated as a hybrid of Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium raimondii [52]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64886" pm="."><plain>Species of Oryza spp. significantly differ from one another in the content of proteins with QN-rich CBRs (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64887" pm="."><plain>We excluded Ipomeae nil from analysis because its proteome, available at Uniprot (Table S2), contained only proteins encoded by the chloroplast or mitochondrial genomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64888" pm="."><plain>The only conifer species, Picea glauca, drastically differed from other species in AR and QN-rich CBR contents (Figure 1), but this could be associated with an incomplete proteome available at Uniprot (Table S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64889" pm="."><plain>Despite variability in the content of ARs and QN-rich CBRs in the proteomes of land plants, there is a common tendency of the proteomes of grasses to have a lower percentage of proteins with ARs predicted by Waltz and to be more abundant in QN-rich proteins (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64890" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that the proteomes of plants have similar contents of potentially amyloidogenic proteins compared with the Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens proteomes (Table S1b), in which experimentally verified amyloid proteins have been previously reported [22,53,54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64891" pm="."><plain>Moreover, since plants have very large proteomes, the total number of potentially amyloidogenic proteins in several species of plants is greater even than the corresponding number in the human proteome (Table S1a,b). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64893" pm="."><plain>Molecular Functions of Potentially Amyloidogenic Proteins of Plants </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64894" pm="."><plain>Functional amyloids participate in diverse molecular functions in a wide spectrum of prokaryotic and eukaryotic species [13,54,55]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64895" pm="."><plain>Functional amyloids may be active in the amyloid state [23,24,25,28] or act as protein or peptide storage reservoirs [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64896" pm="."><plain>Thus, it was important to analyze the molecular functions of the predicted potentially amyloidogenic plant proteins to reveal functions that could be associated with amyloid formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64897" pm="."><plain>We searched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to molecular functions where potentially amyloidogenic proteins detected by Waltz and SARP are overrepresented. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64898" pm="."><plain>We found that GO terms enriched in proteins harboring ARs predicted by Waltz were drastically different from the terms associated with QN-rich proteins predicted by SARP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64899" pm="."><plain>For instance, amyloidogenic regions predicted by Waltz were found mostly in transmembrane proteins with transporter activity as well as proteins with motor and kinase activities (Figure 2, Table S1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64900" pm="."><plain>Conversely, proteins harboring QN-rich CBRs were mostly associated with transcription, DNA- and RNA-binding activities, and protein oligomerization (Figure 3, Table S1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64901" pm="."><plain>Both ARs and QN-rich CBRs-containing proteins shared kinase activity as a function (Figure 2 and Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64902" pm="."><plain>Several molecular functions were specific to particular systematic groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64903" pm="."><plain>For example, microtubule motor and actin-binding activities were characteristic of Poaceae QN-rich proteins (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64904" pm="."><plain>Notably, QN-rich proteins of approximately two-thirds of the analyzed species were associated with nutrient reservoir activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64905" pm="."><plain>Proteins with this function belong mostly to seed storage proteins that are known to be rich in Q and E in several species [56,57]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64906" pm="."><plain>Since E-rich proteins are also potentially amyloidogenic, we analyzed GO molecular functions associated with plant proteins containing E-rich CBRs predicted by SARP (Figure S4, Table S1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64907" pm="."><plain>Several functions of E-rich proteins were found to be similar to those observed for QN-rich proteins including nucleic acid and clathrin binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64908" pm="."><plain>In contrast to QN-rich proteins, in which microtubule motor and actin binding activities were typical only for Poaceae proteins, E-rich proteins harboring these functions were characteristic of most plant species analyzed (Figure S4, Table S1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64909" pm="."><plain>Some functions, including translation-associated activities and unfolded protein binding, were specific to E-rich proteins (Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64910" pm="."><plain>Finally, E-rich proteins with nutrient reservoir activity were abundant in fewer plant species compared to QN-rich proteins (Figure 3 and Figure S4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64911" pm="."><plain>Thus, the molecular functions of potentially amyloidogenic proteins predicted by Waltz drastically differ from the functions of potentially amyloidogenic QN- and E-rich proteins that are partially similar. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64915" pm="."><plain>Potentially amyloidogenic proteins harboring ARs predicted by Waltz were found to be associated with different membranes, membrane organelles, myosin and V-type ATPase complexes (Figure S5, Table S1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64916" pm="."><plain>Potentially amyloidogenic proteins with QN-rich CBRs were associated with the RNA polymerase II transcription complex, nucleus, RNA-processing complexes, cytoskeleton and clathrin-coated vesicles (Figure S6, Table S1g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64917" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, QN-rich proteins were abundant among proteins of P-bodies of only Asian species of rice, but not in the African species (Figure S6, Table S1g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64918" pm="."><plain>Potentially amyloidogenic proteins with E-rich CBRs were associated with the translation machinery complex, cytoskeleton and chromosomes (Figure S7, Table S1h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64919" pm="."><plain>Overall, the cellular components where different types of potentially amyloidogenic proteins predominate correspond to the molecular functions of these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64920" pm="."><plain>The general tendency is that potentially amyloidogenic proteins predicted by Waltz have membrane localization, while potentially amyloidogenic proteins with QN- and E-rich CBRs predicted by SARP are mainly cytoplasmic or intranuclear. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64923" pm="."><plain>We characterized the molecular functions and subcellular localization of potentially amyloidogenic proteins of different plant species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64924" pm="."><plain>As a next step, we analyzed biological processes in which potentially amyloidogenic proteins participate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64925" pm="."><plain>We found that proteins with ARs predicted by Waltz are overrepresented in biological processes associated with transmembrane transport, such as regulation of pH and ion (sodium, potassium, phosphate) and carbohydrate transport (Figure 4, Table S1i). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64926" pm="."><plain>Among these, there are several processes related to biosynthesis (cellulose and lipid biosynthesis, cell wall modifications) or associated with responses to outer factors (recognition of pollen and defense response). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64927" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the defense response is a biological process in which Waltz-predicted potentially amyloidogenic proteins are abundant in the majority of plant species, with the exception of most grasses (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64928" pm="."><plain>The biological processes in which QN-rich potentially amyloidogenic proteins are abundant are mostly related to transcription, cytoskeleton organization and clathrin vesicle formation (Figure 5, Table S1j). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64929" pm="."><plain>Some are connected with the regulation of development, such as the negative regulation of long-day photoperiodism, seed and flower development, auxin, jasmonic and abscisic acid pathways (Figure 5, Table S1j). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64930" pm="."><plain>Overrepresentation of potentially amyloidogenic proteins in some of these processes can only occur in a few species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64931" pm="."><plain>For example, the flower development process is only associated with QN-rich proteins in several very distant plant species: Arabidopsis spp., Teobroma cacao, Vitis vinifera, Amborella trichopoda and some grasses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64932" pm="."><plain>Similar to QN-rich proteins, potentially amyloidogenic E-rich proteins are associated with the cytoskeleton and genome organization, as well as RNA processing (Figure S8, Table S1k). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64933" pm="."><plain>However, E-rich proteins are also overrepresented among the translation initiation and folding machinery components (Figure S8, Table S1k). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64934" pm="."><plain>Taken together, QN-rich proteins are similar to E-rich proteins for subcellular localizations, but each of the three groups of potentially amyloidogenic proteins (Waltz-predicted, QN-rich and E-rich) is involved in specific molecular functions and biological processes that only partially overlap. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="64941" pm="."><plain>These three proteins encoded in the chloroplast genome demonstrate interesting variability in the presence of QN-rich regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64942" pm="."><plain>The first is TIC214, the only component of the translocon at the chloroplast inner envelope [58]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64943" pm="."><plain>It is present in most land plant species with the exception of grasses [59] (Figure 6a) and has a long QN-rich region in its C-terminus. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64944" pm="."><plain>The second chloroplast protein, Ycf2, has a QN-rich region only in Bryophyta (spreading earth moss, Psycomitrella patens) and Pinophyta (white spruce, Picea glauca) species, but not in the flowering plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64945" pm="."><plain>The third protein, an omnipresent ribosomal protein of the small subunit, rps18, has a short QN-rich region only in grasses. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64950" pm="."><plain>Potentially amyloidogenic regions have specific amino acid compositions and physical properties, and thus they might tend to be incorporated into certain structural features of proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64951" pm="."><plain>We analyzed co-occurrence of QN-rich regions and regions predicted with Waltz with different types of protein domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64952" pm="."><plain>We found that QN-rich regions tend to co-occur with different DNA- (HTH Myb-type) and RNA-binding (YTH, RRM, PUM-HD), kinase (FAT), lipase (GDSL), and cytoskeleton-related domains (Dilute, Myosin, Kinesin) (Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64953" pm="."><plain>QN-rich regions were also found to be associated with the LRRNT domain, which is mostly responsible for protein-protein interactions [60]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64954" pm="."><plain>Importantly, in many plant species, the QN-rich regions overlap with the conserved barrel domain, Cupin1, of the 11S and 7S plant seed storage proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64955" pm="."><plain>For deeper analysis of the association between seed storage protein domains and QN-rich regions, we used PFAM database (see Section 4.7) [61]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64956" pm="."><plain>We found that 302 storage proteins with Cupin1 were Q/N-rich in 54 of 75 plant species analyzed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64957" pm="."><plain>Q/N-rich storage proteins containing other domains were less abundant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64958" pm="."><plain>For example, we detected 119 Q/N-rich proteins with Zein domain in three plant species; 121 with Gliadin domain in 15 species; 13 with Vicilin domain in nine species; and seven with high molecular weight Glutenin in two plant species analyzed (Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64959" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data show that different seed storage proteins in various plant species are associated with the presence of potentially amyloidogenic Q/N-rich regions. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64960" pm="."><plain>Similar to QN-rich regions, E-rich regions of plant proteins were mainly enriched with DNA-binding (HMG, SMC) and cytoskeleton-associated (NAB, Kinesin) domains (Figure S9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64961" pm="."><plain>Additionally, E-rich regions were associated with Helicase and Cactin domains as well as with GTD and FF domains, which are likely responsible for protein-protein interactions (Figure S9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64962" pm="."><plain>In contrast to QN- and E-rich regions, amyloidogenic regions predicted with Waltz tend to be inside transmembrane domains (EamA, TPT, PBPe, MFS, ABC transmembrane Type-1, etc.) in all plant species analyzed except for P. glauca (Figure 8), which is likely because of incomplete proteome annotation for this species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64963" pm="."><plain>Signal peptides were strongly associated with ARs predicted by Waltz in all species except grasses (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64964" pm="."><plain>Notably, both QN-rich regions and ARs predicted by Waltz are associated with protein kinase domains (Figure 7 and Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64965" pm="."><plain>Thus, amyloidogenic regions occupy specific protein domains (Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure S9), which might reflect the involvement of ARs in the functioning of these domains. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="64968" pm="."><plain>The bioinformatic analysis performed in this study revealed that potentially amyloidogenic proteins are abundant in the proteomes of land plants (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64969" pm="."><plain>These proteins exhibit various molecular functions, cellular localizations and biological processes (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64970" pm="."><plain>Two algorithms used in our study, Waltz and SARP, revealed different groups of potentially amyloidogenic plant proteins based on their primary structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64971" pm="."><plain>Some of these proteins are related to amyloid-forming proteins in other groups of organisms identified in vivo or plant proteins whose amyloid properties were partially characterized in vitro and in heterologous systems. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64972" pm="."><plain>Most groups of plant proteins predicted by Waltz are transmembrane proteins acting as transporters of different compounds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64973" pm="."><plain>Such proteins can potentially have amyloid properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64974" pm="."><plain>For example, porins OmpA and OmpC of the bacteria Escherichia coli were shown to have amyloid properties [62,63]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64975" pm="."><plain>Thus, we cannot exclude that several membrane proteins of plants could also adopt amyloid structures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64976" pm="."><plain>The second group of amyloidogenic proteins predicted by Waltz to be abundant in most of the species analyzed were defense proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64977" pm="."><plain>These proteins represent a large and heterogeneous group, many representatives of which are hydrophobic [64]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64978" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, several plant defense proteins and peptides were shown to have amyloid-like properties in vitro [49,50,65]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64979" pm="."><plain>Amyloid formation by such plant proteins could stabilize them and enhance their survival during interactions with pathogens, since amyloids are extremely stable [66]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64980" pm="."><plain>Amyloidogenic proteins of plants predicted with SARP were mainly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64981" pm="."><plain>In the case of QN-rich plant proteins, DNA- and RNA-binding activities including transcriptional regulation are the most common. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64982" pm="."><plain>There are numerous examples of Q and/or N-rich transcriptional factors among human and yeast amyloid-forming proteins [38]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64983" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Luminidependens, a QN-rich transcriptional regulator of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana, was recently shown to have amyloid- and prion-like properties in a heterologous yeast system [46]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64984" pm="."><plain>We also found that QN-rich proteins are overrepresented among floral regulators, but only in several species including A. thaliana (Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64985" pm="."><plain>Overall, according to bioinformatic data, DNA- and RNA-binding QN-rich proteins of plants represent a promising group to search for novel amyloid-forming proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64986" pm="."><plain>The second group of potentially amyloidogenic proteins predicted by SARP was E-rich, which were similar to QN-rich in function and localization, but additionally included translation- and folding-related proteins (Figure S8) that could be involved in amyloid formation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64987" pm="."><plain>One of the most important findings of this study was the overrepresentation in different plant species of potentially amyloidogenic proteins among proteins acting as nutrient reservoirs (Figure 3 and Figure S4), including seed storage proteins, which constitute an important part of the human diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64988" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the evolutionarily conserved Cupin1 as well as Zein, Gliadin, Vicilin and high molecular weight Glutenin domains of seed storage proteins tend to have potentially amyloidogenic QN-rich regions (Figure 7, Table 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64989" pm="."><plain>Previously, proteolytic peptides of seed storage proteins of leguminous plants were shown to form fibrils with several properties of amyloids in vitro [67,68,69]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64990" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that storage proteins might adopt amyloid states in seeds to accumulate and stabilize their molecules during dehydration that naturally occurs as a result of seed maturation [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64991" pm="."><plain>The data obtained in this study strongly support our hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64992" pm="."><plain>We may expect that the process of accumulation of storage proteins in the seeds could be similar to the accumulation of human hormones in the amyloid state [26] or dehydration-dependent amyloid formation by the proteins of egg envelop of “annual killfish” Austrofundulus limnaeus [51,70]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="64993" pm="."><plain>We found that QN-rich proteins were absent in the mitochondria and that few chloroplast proteins contained QN-rich regions (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64994" pm="."><plain>One such protein is TIC214, which harbors a QN-rich region in its C-terminus in all investigated plant species (see Section 2.5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64995" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that TIC214 is the only translocon component on the inner envelope of chloroplasts that is encoded in the chloroplast genome [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64996" pm="."><plain>Though it is omnipresent in most species of plants (except grasses), the C-terminal region is highly variable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64997" pm="."><plain>The only common feature of the C-terminal region of TIC214 in different species is the presence of charged motifs [59]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64998" pm="."><plain>Possibly, an increased QN content might be important for interspersing these motifs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="64999" pm="."><plain>Another chloroplast protein, Ycf2, contains a QN-rich region, but not in the flowering plants (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65000" pm="."><plain>The changes in Ycf2 composition coincide with its gene duplication in the flowering plants lineage [71]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65001" pm="."><plain>The Poaceae species have lost the Ycf1/TIC214 protein, but they have a small QN-rich region in the C-terminal region of the rps18 protein (Figure 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65002" pm="."><plain>These examples suggest that the composition of QN-rich regions might correspond with the evolution of species, even when the sequence of such regions is highly variable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65003" pm="."><plain>Additionally, such a conservation of amino acid composition suggests that CBRs may be functionally important. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65004" pm="."><plain>Undoubtedly, the presence of bioinformatically predicted amyloidogenic regions does not indicate that the corresponding full-length proteins have amyloid properties in vivo. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65005" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, resistance of proteins to treatment with ionic detergents, which is one of the key properties of amyloids, correlates with the presence of ARs predicted by WALTZ and CBRs predicted by SARP [72], and the most of experimentally analyzed amyloidogenic plant proteins (LD, FPA, FCA, TGZ, monellin, pro-hevein) [51] bear such regions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65006" pm="."><plain>Thus, predictions of potentially amyloidogenic proteins with these algorithms are useful not only to analyze molecular functions, subcellular functions, and domain structure of such proteins but also to reveal candidates in plant proteomes for experimental analysis of their amyloid-forming properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65007" pm="."><plain>Identification of novel amyloid proteins is laborious and time-consuming, but bioinformatic predictions in combination with recently developed proteomic approaches [72,73,74,75] are useful in this regard. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65008" pm="."><plain>In addition, future development of novel, more efficient bioinformatic algorithms based on the machine learning, which is actively using now for protein analysis [76,77], could also contribute to the progress in the proteomics of amyloids. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65009" pm="."><plain>Overall, in this study, we have investigated the diversity of amyloidogenic proteins in plant species, analyzed their functions and localization, and, based on the obtained bioinformatic data, suggested possible roles of amyloid formation in different biological processes including defense from pathogens and storage of proteins in seeds. </plain></SENT>
