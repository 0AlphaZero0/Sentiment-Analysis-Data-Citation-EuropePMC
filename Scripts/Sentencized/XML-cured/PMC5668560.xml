</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="65448" pm="."><plain>Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of small integral plasma membrane proteins that primarily transport water across the plasma membrane driven by the osmotic gradient reviewed in [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65449" pm="."><plain>AQP10 is the fourth and last aquaglyceroporin discovered in mammals following AQP3, AQP7, and AQP9 [2], [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65450" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, human AQP10 has two isofoms: a fully-spliced form (isoform 1, 301 amino acids) [3] and a partially-unspliced form (isoform 2, 264 amino acids) [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65451" pm="."><plain>The sequence of the isoform 2 in 236–301 amino acid residues, most of the C-terminus, is different from that of the isoform 1, leading to the loss of the 6th transmembrane, which will explain the poor function of the isoform 2 [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65452" pm="."><plain>In fact, the isoform 1 was expressed predominantly in the GI tract [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65453" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the isoform 1 should be the focus of the functional and physiological studies. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65454" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, one commercially available anti-AQP10 antibody will react specifically to the isoform 2 at the 17 amino acid C-terminal sequence (Alpha Diagnostics), while another will react specifically to the isoform 1 at the 50 amino acid C-terminal sequence (Sigma). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65455" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the results with the antibody from Alpha Diagnostics should reflect those of the isoform 2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65456" pm="."><plain>The result that AQP10 was expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine by Mobasheri et al. was based on the isoform 2-specific antibody [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65457" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the isoform 1-specific antibodies localized AQP10 at the granular vesicles of enterochromaffin cells in the duodenum [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65458" pm="."><plain>Thus, AQP10 may play a role in enterochromaffin cells to modulate its secretion and not in the absorption of water at the epithelium. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65459" pm="."><plain>Recently, human AQP10 has been found to be expressed in the adipose tissue by the isoform 2-specific antibody [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65460" pm="."><plain>Whether the isoform 1 is also expressed or not remained to be clarified. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65461" pm="."><plain>Human AQP10 was also expressed in the skin with the antibody against the isoform 1 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65462" pm="."><plain>However, the expression level was very low compared with AQP3. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65463" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, the murine AQP10 gene has turned to a non-processed pseudogene without the authentic gene [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65464" pm="."><plain>A pseudogene is usually produced by gene duplications where the duplicated gene turns to a pseudogene so that the remaining original gene can secure the function. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65465" pm="."><plain>For example, human AQP7 has three pseudogenes in addition to the authentic gene [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65466" pm="."><plain>Thus, the absence of authentic AQP10 gene in mice suggests that AQP10 is generally not essential or the other aquaglyceroporins may compensate for the loss of the functional AQP10 protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65467" pm="."><plain>We speculated that some mammals other than mice may also have lost the functional AQP10 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65468" pm="."><plain>The complete or near-complete genome sequences from many mammals in public databases have enabled us to search for the AQP10 gene ortholog. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65469" pm="."><plain>We found that the bovine AQP10 gene is also a pseudogene as well as its relatives, sheep and goats. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="65549" pm="."><plain>The present study has expanded the scope of pseudogenes for AQP10 in mammals. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65550" pm="."><plain>So far, only the murine AQP10 gene was identified as a pseudogene [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65551" pm="."><plain>Here, we showed that the bovine AQP10 gene is also a pseudogene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65552" pm="."><plain>The genome sequences of bovine AQP10 have multiple structural defects including frame-shifts and a splice junction mutation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65553" pm="."><plain>The degree of mutations in the bovine AQP10 gene seems to be less than that of the murine AQP10 gene and both seemed to be unrelated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65554" pm="."><plain>For example, the murine AQP10 gene has a deletion of a guanine (G) at the ATG translation-initiation site, which will strongly inhibit the translation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65555" pm="."><plain>However, this is not the case with the bovine AQP10 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65556" pm="."><plain>The murine AQP10 gene has an insertion and a deletion at exon 2 and exon 5, respectively, while the bovine AQP10 gene has deletions at exon 1 and exon 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65557" pm="."><plain>As the frame-shifts are differently located in mice and cattle, the mutations in the AQP10 genes may not be related. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65558" pm="."><plain>Thus both may have independently turned to a pseudogene. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65559" pm="."><plain>As the transcript of the bovine AQP10 gene was not detected in the duodenum where human AQP10 is highly expressed [2], [3], this pseudogene may have a transcription problem although the 5′ upstream non-coding region seemed to have functional consensus sequences including a TATA box as is the case with murine AQP10 gene [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65560" pm="."><plain>Even if the bovine AQP10 gene should be transcribed in tissues other than the small intestine, it will not play a role in antisense interference or generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) as no authentic AQP10 gene is present [11]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65561" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the AQP10 genes of sheep and goats, the relatives of cattle, have also turned to a pseudogene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65562" pm="."><plain>These animals belong to ruminantia, which regurgitate and rechew their food. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65563" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, whales may have AQP10 pseudogenes if the genomic database is correct. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65564" pm="."><plain>In that case, the extent of AQP10 pseudogenes will be large and beyond ruminantia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65565" pm="."><plain>As there seemed to be shared mutations among these animals, AQP10 may have turned to a pseudogene at the time of the advent of artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) with the exception of swine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65566" pm="."><plain>Since pseudogenes do not have functional constraint, they usually accumulate more mutations than functional genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65567" pm="."><plain>Further analysis in the phylogeny will be necessary to examine the time course and extent of the AQP10 pseudogene formation in mammals as well as in the lower animals [12]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65568" pm="."><plain>Pseudogenes are usually produced by gene duplications. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65569" pm="."><plain>The duplicated gene turns to a pseudogene so that the authentic gene can preserve the original function, whereas the pseudogene could acquire a new function to survive in a hazardous environment [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65570" pm="."><plain>However, the absence of the authentic AQP10 in the bovine genome suggests that the function of AQP10 is not essential for cattle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65571" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the function of AQP10 may be compensated by the other aquaglyceroporins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65572" pm="."><plain>As the knockout mice of AQP3 [13], AQP7 [14], [15], [16] and AQP9 [17] did not suffer from GI tract symptoms such as diarrhea, such compensations may be absent or difficult to be detected. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65573" pm="."><plain>As human AQP10 is expressed intracellularly at the enterochromaffin cells [6], AQP10 may be needed for the hormone excretion as suggested by the enhanced expression in cholera patients [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65574" pm="."><plain>Some reports indicated that AQP10 permeates ammonia, erythritol (a nutrient) and metalloids including toxic inorganic arsenic as well as glycerol [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65575" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AQP10 may play more extensive unknown roles than water transport. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65576" pm="."><plain>Recent reports on the expression of human AQP10 in the skin stratum corneum and in the adipocyte suggest that AQP10 may be expressed widely [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65577" pm="."><plain>However, their western blot indicated several bands of AQP10 without monomer bands in contrast to the clear expression of AQP3 in the skin, suggesting a minimum expression of AQP10 [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65578" pm="."><plain>The localization of the AQP10 isoform 1 in the adipocyte still remains to be clarified as the isoform 2-specific antibody was used in the study [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65579" pm="."><plain>Why AQP10 gene become a pseudogene in some animals and not in other animals is an intriguing question. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65580" pm="."><plain>Speculatively, AQP10 protein could be a pathogen receptor which was originally expressed at the plasma membrane of the intestinal epithelium and later shifted to the enterochromaffin cell even intracellularly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65581" pm="."><plain>If it was the case, the defective AQP10 may be advantageous with the lessened susceptibility to pathogen toxins such as arsenites [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65582" pm="."><plain>Such an example was found in Bombyx mori, where a mutant of an amino acid transporter in the midgut membrane caused the resistance to B. mori densovirus type 2 (BmDNV-2) as this membrane protein is a functional receptor for BmDNV-2 [21]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="65583" pm="."><plain>In summary, the AQP10 gene is a pseudogene in cattle as is the case with mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="65584" pm="."><plain>The current genome database suggests a much wider distribution of AQP10 pseudogenes in many members in even-toed ungulates including whales [22]. </plain></SENT>
