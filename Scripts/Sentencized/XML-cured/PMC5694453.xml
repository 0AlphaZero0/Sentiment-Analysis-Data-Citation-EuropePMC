</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="67998" pm="."><plain>The majority of the biosphere on Earth is classified as a cold environment, where microorganisms representing the three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, have key ecological roles (Cantrell et al., 2011; Margesin and Miteva, 2011; Buzzini et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="67999" pm="."><plain>These cold-adapted microorganisms have attracted scientific interest mainly for their potential application in diverse productive areas, such as food, biofuel and textile industries and cold environments such as polar regions have become attractive for bioprospecting for new genes and bioactive compounds with potential commercial uses (Gerday et al., 2000; Margesin et al., 2007; de Pascale et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68000" pm="."><plain>Most studies of microbiota in cold environments focused on cultivable microorganisms (Cary et al., 2010; de Pascale et al., 2012; Gugliandolo et al., 2016), but it is estimated that only approximately 17% of fungi can be cultivated using current methodologies (Hawksworth, 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68001" pm="."><plain>Metagenomic technologies have become a powerful tool for more comprehensive assessment of microbial communities in the soils of extreme environments (Cowan et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68002" pm="."><plain>Amplicon-metagenome analysis has given good results when studying some microorganisms by amplifying a target rDNA followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68003" pm="."><plain>With advances in NGS technologies, greater sequencing depth can be obtained at relatively low cost. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68004" pm="."><plain>The amplification of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and the D1D2 domain of the large ribosomal subunit through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using universal primers (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (Lindahl et al., 2013) has been successfully used as a culture-independent approach to study soil fungal communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68005" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the incorporation of barcode sequences to primers allows high-throughput analysis of multiple samples (Tonge et al., 2014; Tedersoo et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68006" pm="."><plain>Although the Antarctic continent is considered as a dry and cold climate, the regions closer to the sea are free of snow and ice, submitted to rapid cycles of freeze/thaw, and may receive significant quantities of organic material from marine animals (Holdgate, 1977; Ruisi et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68007" pm="."><plain>Studies of Antarctica microbiota are increasing, and studies applying culture-independent methodologies suggest that micro-diversity in Antarctic terrestrial habitats is much higher than previously thought (Cowan, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68008" pm="."><plain>Thousands of species were found in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses of subglacial ice from the Vostok Lake in Antarctica; among them 6% corresponded to eukarya, predominantly closer to fungal species from the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla (Rogers et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68009" pm="."><plain>Sequences mainly belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were found in metagenomic analysis of soils from the Mars Oasis on Alexander Island (Pearce et al., 2012), and sequences close to the Flavobacterium genus were predominant in surface snow close to Russian stations in Eastern Antarctica (Lopatina et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68010" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, new genes from Antarctica have been found through metagenomic and functional analysis, such as a new cytosolic esterase from the α/β hydrolase family 6 (Berlemont et al., 2013); a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene, which was proposed as a novel reporter gene for promoter trapping (Bartasun et al., 2012); bacterial hydrocarbon-degrading genes (Luz et al., 2010); genes encoding proteins that functionally respond to environmental stress such as exopolysaccharides, cold shock proteins, and membrane modifications (Varin et al., 2012); and genes encoding enzymes with potential in industrial applications such as lipase/esterase, amylase, protease and cellulase (Berlemont et al., 2011, 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68011" pm="."><plain>The microfungal diversity in the terrestrial habitats of eight islands of the South Shetland Archipelago, two islands located on the Antarctic Peninsula and from Union Glacier, was studied in this work through amplicon-metagenome analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68012" pm="."><plain>Among our findings, the most represented fungal classes among all Antarctic localities were Lecanoromycetes and Eurotiomycetes, and species belonging to 37 fungal genera, which have not been previously cultivated from Antarctica were found, such as including Circinaria, Rhizoplaca, and Psoroma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68013" pm="."><plain>A correlation between molecular similarity and the geographic latitude of the studied localities was observed, grouping the islands of the South Shetland archipelago (latitude S61-S63) separately from localities in the Antarctic peninsula: Litchfield (S64-S65) and Lagotellerie (latitude S67-S68) islands, and Union Glacier (S79-S80). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68065" pm="."><plain>This was similar at the Locality and Site levels (Supplementary Figures S1B,C), with the exception of sequences from King George Island, where a high number of sequences were obtained but with shorter average length. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68070" pm="."><plain>Considering the distance between these Localities—Deception and King George (154 km), Dee and King George (83 km), Robert and King George (64 km), and Dee and Deception (73 km)—there is no correlation between the geographic distance among Localities and “molecular” similarity. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68138" pm="."><plain>A correlation between micro-eukaryotic diversity and distance and geographic barriers of the Antarctic localities studied in this work was observed, but only at large geographical scale finding a major molecular difference between the islands of the South Shetland archipelago (latitude S61–S63) and the localities on the Antarctic peninsula (S64–S80). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68139" pm="."><plain>However, as in any ecosystem, other abiotic and biotic factors not considered in this study may influence microbial communities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68140" pm="."><plain>Similar to our results, Lawley et al. (2004) found that the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between eukaryotic diversity and latitude was valid only in a large-scale comparison and only when maritime and continental diversity were compared. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68141" pm="."><plain>Also, an inverse relationship between bacterial diversity and latitude was observed in soils from the Falkland Islands (51°S) to the Ellsworth Mountains (78°S), but only in fell-field soils, not vegetated sites (Yergeau et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68142" pm="."><plain>In other studies, soil pH was proposed as an important factor for structuring bacterial assemblage patterns (Chong et al., 2010, 2012). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68143" pm="."><plain>Even though the present work was focused on fungal diversity using the primers LR3 and F63 (Fell et al., 2000), a 36% of the obtained sequences corresponded to green algae and diatoms found in all localities studied (Supplementary Figures S4, S5A,C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68144" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in environmental culture-independent studies, it should be considered that the primers LR3 and F63 may also amplify non-fungal DNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68145" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in studies based in amplification of fungal ITS2 region in the Antarctic active layer, a high number of sequences identified as mosses, green algae and infusoria were previously found (Kochkina et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68146" pm="."><plain>The putative algae and diatom species found in Antarctic soils in this work have been described as ubiquitous environmental species. S. bacillaris is a common terrestrial alga, with a cosmopolitan distribution that was previously described at Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic islands (Broady, 1979). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68147" pm="."><plain>The diatom H. amphioxys is a freshwater/terrestrial species that has been described worldwide, including saline lakes in the Larsemann Hills and Rauer Islands east of Antarctica (Sabbe et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68148" pm="."><plain>The diatom P. taeniata has been described as a marine species from Europe, Asia, North America and the Arctic sea (Brown et al., 2014), but to the best of our knowledge, it has not been previously described in Antarctica. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68149" pm="."><plain>Most fungi detected in this work were ascomycetes, in accordance with literature referring to terrestrial fungi from Antarctica (Arenz et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68150" pm="."><plain>Putative species belonging to 37 fungal genera were detected in this work that has not been previously described from Antarctica. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68151" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the majority of non-lichenized fungal species described in Antarctica are cosmopolitan groups (Bridge and Spooner, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68152" pm="."><plain>In this work, almost half of the fungi (excluding yeasts) identified corresponded to non-lichenized fungi, whose closest BLAST-hits were described in several countries, primarily the USA, China and Argentina. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68153" pm="."><plain>However, the closest BLAST-hits for lichenized fungi were described in several countries, primarily Sweden, United States and the United Kingdom. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68154" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 68% of the yeasts detected in this work were basidiomycetes, in agreement with our previous work on cultivable yeasts from these soils (74% corresponded to basidiomycetes) (Carrasco et al., 2012; Contreras et al., 2015; Barahona et al., 2016; Troncoso et al., 2017) and other and other studies from Antarctic terrestrial habitats (84% basidiomycetes) (Buzzini et al., 2012; Selbmann et al., 2014; Vasileva-Tonkova et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Duarte et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68155" pm="."><plain>The predominance of the yeast phylum Basidiomycota has been attributed to their ability to produce polysaccharide capsules, utilize the available nutrients in oligotrophic systems and increase the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids (Connell et al., 2008; Margesin and Miteva, 2011; Buzzini et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
