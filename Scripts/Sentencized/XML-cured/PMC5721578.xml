Taking these into account, in this version (2), we have made the following amendments:   1. We have included additional text discussing the difficulty in obtaining clonal cell lines expressing the full-length PALB2 ChAM mutants at a similar level as wild-type PALB2, and thus the possibility that ChAM missense substitutions partly destabilise the PALB2 protein, contributing to the observed PALB2 haploinsufficiency for tumour suppression.   2. We explain that, in contrast to the robust impact of ChAM mutations in disrupting the chromatin association of the GFP-ChAM fragment, the partial rescue of chromatin association of full-length PALB2 mutants was somewhat expected, as PALB2 chromatin association is mediated by both ChAM and MRG15 binding.   3. We discuss the notion that the S417Y mutation could be a low-penetrance or neutral variant.   4. We articulate that the role of ChAM in homologous recombination needs to be investigated further.   5. We adjusted our Discussion regarding the pathological impact of the T413S ChAM mutation in the development of SCLC, indicating that this link needs to be further investigated using clinical samples and/or genetic studies.   6. Scale bars have been added to Figure 4A. The statistical data comparing wild-type PALB2 to T413S or S417Y variants, and between the T413S and S417Y variants have been added to Figure 4B.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68407" pm="."><plain>BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer 1 and 2) are two of the best-known cancer susceptibility genes, and mutations in these genes are causally connected to the rare genetic disorder Fanconi anaemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68408" pm="."><plain>At the molecular level, BRCA1 and BRCA2 cooperate to promote the homology-directed repair (HDR) of highly genotoxic DNA lesions, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs) or inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs) 1– 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68409" pm="."><plain>PALB2 (Partner And Localizer of BRCA2) was more recently identified as a binding partner of BRCA2 and was subsequently shown to bridge BRCA1 and BRCA2 physically 4– 7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68410" pm="."><plain>Importantly, following studies have demonstrated a link between germline mutations in the PALB2 gene, and Fanconi anaemia and an elevated risk of developing breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancers 8– 12, identical to cancer types associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations 13– 15. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68411" pm="."><plain>To date, the majority of disease-associated PALB2 mutations are loss-of-function mutations caused by C-terminal protein truncations of various lengths 10, 16, 17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68412" pm="."><plain>The PALB2 C-terminal WD40-type β-propeller domain is known to promote interaction with BRCA2, and its structure has demonstrated that deleting only the last four residues (the consequence of the PALB2 Y1183X cancer-associated nonsense mutation) is sufficient to disrupt the proper folding of the domain and render the protein unstable 5, 18, 19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68413" pm="."><plain>Another study has revealed that cancer-associated PALB2 C-terminal truncations (such as Q988X or W1038X) can alternatively expose a hidden nuclear export signal (residues 928-945) and lead to the mis-localisation of PALB2 in the cytoplasm 20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68414" pm="."><plain>Since PALB2 forms homo-oligomers through its N-terminal coiled-coil domain 19, it is plausible that the Q988X and W1038X truncated proteins can sequester the product of a functional PALB2 allele in the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68415" pm="."><plain>These variants are hence unable to fulfil PALB2 tumour suppressor function, even in the presence of a wild-type allele. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68416" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have additionally characterised several missense mutations of PALB2 associated with human disease. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68417" pm="."><plain>For example, an in-frame exclusion of PALB2 exon 6, resulting in the deletion of residues 839-862 within the WD40 repeat domain, has been reported to give rise to a mild form of Fanconi anaemia, without the severe developmental abnormalities usually associated with the disease 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68418" pm="."><plain>In line with this observation, when exogenously expressed in U2OS cells, this hypomorphic in-frame exclusion variant of PALB2 retained BRCA2 interaction and supported RAD51 accumulation at damage-induced nuclear foci, a crucial step of DSB and ICL repair mediated by the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68419" pm="."><plain>Conversely, PALB2 sequencing in non- BRCA1/2 familial breast cancer cases led to the identification of germline missense mutations in the coiled-coil domain (L35P), identified in patients with a truncating mutation in the second allele, and WD40 repeat domain (L939W and L1143P) 22, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68420" pm="."><plain>These single-residue changes result in decreased interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively, and have been shown to reduce the cellular DSB-repair potential 22, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68421" pm="."><plain>Additionally, breast cancer-associated germline mutations in BRCA2 N-terminus (G25R, W31C and W31R) have also been reported to disrupt the PALB2-BRCA2 interaction 5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68422" pm="."><plain>These findings emphasise the critical role of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex in the maintenance of genome stability and prevention of cancer and provide evidence that heterozygosity for rare missense  variants of PALB2 may influence cancer risk. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68423" pm="."><plain>We previously described the evolutionarily conserved chromatin association motif (ChAM) of PALB2 and showed that it promotes direct interaction with nucleosomes 24, 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68424" pm="."><plain>Together with the MRG15-binding domain (MBD), which mediates PALB2 interaction with the chromodomain-containing MRG15 protein, ChAM controls PALB2 chromatin association 24, 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68425" pm="."><plain>In our latest study, we further demonstrated that the ChAM and the MBD act in concert to tether PALB2 to active genes, protecting these loci from replication-associated stress 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68426" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of missense substitutions within the MBD established that, in the absence of this mechanism, cells accumulate DNA damage at active genes, a process that may ultimately lead to the conversion of pre-cancerous to cancerous cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68427" pm="."><plain>Given the emerging evidence that missense substitutions in protein-binding domains of PALB2 are connected with disease predisposition, we aimed to elucidate whether cancer-associated missense mutations may also perturb the function of the PALB2 ChAM. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68670" pm="."><plain>To directly assess their impact on PALB2 chromatin association, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate GFP-ChAM variants bearing these missense substitutions and transiently expressed them in HEK293T cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68671" pm="."><plain>We additionally tested the effect of three published germline missense substitutions (T397S, Y408H, and S417Y) 8, 10, 34 and one variant of unknown significance referenced in the NCBI database of genetic variation (F404L) 35. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68672" pm="."><plain>These all affect highly conserved residues and are predicted to be deleterious by the PolyPhen-2 and SIFT algorithms ( Figure 2A and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68673" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, most missense substitutions affecting highly conserved residues retained a wild-type level of chromatin association ( Figure 2B and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68674" pm="."><plain>To further confirm this observation, we tested two additional variants with predicted deleterious mutations at two consecutive conserved residues (F404A/P405A and E407A/Y408A) and again were not able to detect any effect on ChAM-mediated chromatin association ( Figure 2A and Table 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68675" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, we found that T413S and S417Y substitutions dramatically reduced the chromatin association of the GFP-ChAM peptide ( Figure 2B), to a comparable extent as our previously reported ChAM null mutant, where V410 and T413 residues are replaced by two helix-disrupting prolines 25. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68676" pm="."><plain>We next set to examine the effect of T413S and S417Y missense substitutions on full-length PALB2 chromatin association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68677" pm="."><plain>Since PALB2 can form homo-oligomers 19, we used PALB2-deficient EUFA1341 cells to stably express FLAG-PALB2 variants, while avoiding interference from endogenous PALB2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68678" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, despite our best efforts to find cell lines with similar level of expression of the FLAG-PALB2 variants analysed, all missense variants displayed a lower level of expression compared to wild type FLAG-PALB2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68679" pm="."><plain>This observation raises the possibility that ChAM missense substitutions partly destabilise the PALB2 protein and could contribute to the observed PALB2 haploinsufficiency for tumour suppression 35, 36. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68680" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we observed hindered chromatin association of FLAG-PALB2 with T413S or S417Y missense substitutions, when compared to wild-type FLAG-PALB2 ( Figure 3A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68681" pm="."><plain>Compared to our analysis of GFP-ChAM variants, full-length PALB2 variants, including the ChAM null mutant, only result in a partial loss of chromatin association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68682" pm="."><plain>This is somewhat expected since PALB2 chromatin association is mediated not only by the ChAM but also through MRG15 binding 24– 26. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68683" pm="."><plain>However, when we quantified the level of chromatin-associated FLAG-PALB2, we found that only the T413S missense substitution recapitulated the phenotype of our ChAM null mutant ( Figure 3B), with 35% of the wild-type level of chromatin association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68684" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the S417Y missense substitution exhibited an intermediate phenotype, with a chromatin association level between that of the wild-type and T413S FLAG-PALB2 variants. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68698" pm="."><plain>The topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, and we recently demonstrated that loss of ChAM function sensitises cells to CPT treatment 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68699" pm="."><plain>To further assess the adverse effects of T413S and S417Y missense substitutions, we examined the ability of these PALB2 variants to support cellular resistance to genotoxic stress in response to chronic exposure to CPT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68700" pm="."><plain>EUFA1341 cells complemented with wild-type and S417Y FLAG-PALB2 displayed comparable levels of survival ( Figure 3C and D), with IC50 values of ~ 30 nM CPT and overlapping growth inhibition curves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68701" pm="."><plain>In stark contrast, T413S FLAG-PALB2 was unable to fully rescue the CPT sensitivity of EUFA1341 PALB2-deficient cells, which is reminiscent of our previously described ChAM null variant 25. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68702" pm="."><plain>We next sought to gain insights into the mechanism underlying the increased CPT-sensitivity of the PALB2 T413S mutant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68703" pm="."><plain>Since PALB2 is commonly described to play an essential role in HDR by recruiting BRCA2 in complex with RAD51, we scored RAD51 nuclear foci as a proxy to estimate the efficiency of HDR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68704" pm="."><plain>As expected, CPT-induced RAD51 nuclear foci formation was severely impaired in EUFA1341 cells ( Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68705" pm="."><plain>To our surprise, however, re-expression of wild-type, T413S, and S417Y FLAG-PALB2 in EUFA1341 cells restored similar levels of RAD51 nuclear foci formation upon CPT treatment ( Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68706" pm="."><plain>Although a moderate decrease and increase of the number of RAD51 foci are noticeable in the T413S and S417Y PALB2 variants, respectively, these variations are statistically not significant and are unlikely to explain the differences observed in our CPT survival assay ( Figure 3D and Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68707" pm="."><plain>To further verify the efficacy of the DNA stress response in each cell line, we examined the formation of S139-phosphorylated H2A.X (γH2A.X) nuclear foci, a marker of the activation of the DNA damage response ( Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68708" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated cells, the expression of wild-type, T413S, and S417Y FLAG-PALB2 equally suppressed the formation of γH2A.X nuclear foci arising from spontaneous DNA lesions in EUFA1341 cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68709" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, however, CPT treatment induced a notably less efficient γH2A.X nuclear foci formation in EUFA1341 cells complemented with FLAG-PALB2 T413S ( Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68710" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these findings demonstrate T413S as a ChAM defective variant of PALB2, yet point to an unexpected mechanism where DNA stress signalling, rather than RAD51 recruitment to DNA lesions, is altered. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="68718" pm="."><plain>Since the discovery of PALB2 in 2006, numerous studies had addressed how the development of various cancers could be linked with PALB2 mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68719" pm="."><plain>For the ~50 protein-truncating mutations classified as cancer risk variants, there is abundant evidence that BRCA2 binding is lost since these variants recapitulate many features of BRCA2 loss of function 5, 10, 16, 18. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68720" pm="."><plain>Conversely, many missense mutations remain as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs), even though the likely impact of PALB2 missense VUSs hindering BRCA2 or BRCA1 interaction is foreseeable based on the importance of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex in the maintenance of genome stability 4– 7, 22, 23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68721" pm="."><plain>There is also an indication that PALB2 is haploinsufficient for tumour suppression, since almost all PALB2 truncating mutations conferring a risk for breast/ovarian cancer are monoallelic 43, 44. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68722" pm="."><plain>This notion was further supported by the recent identification of a hypomorphic allele of PALB2, with an in-frame deletion of residues 839-862 21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68723" pm="."><plain>This variant can support PALB2 function when exogenously expressed in U2OS cells, but not in patient cells where it is expressed at a low level. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68724" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we provide additional evidence that impaired PALB2 chromatin association may be linked with cancer development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68725" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that two cancer-associated missense mutations in the ChAM of PALB2 hinder its chromatin association ( Figure 3A and B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68726" pm="."><plain>The serine to tyrosine substitution at position 417 leads to a partial reduction of ChAM-mediated PALB2 chromatin association, without affecting the cellular resistance to CPT ( Figure 3A and Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68727" pm="."><plain>However, seven independent studies reported PALB2 S417Y as a germline mutation in both cancer patients (mainly breast cancer) and healthy individuals 8, 10, 17, 39– 42, making this variant the most frequent of the subset we analysed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68728" pm="."><plain>Although further clinical evidence is required, our observations suggest that PALB2 S417Y may be a low-penetrance genetic variant associated with low cancer risk or a neutral variant. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68729" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the second variant, a conservative threonine to serine substitution at position 413 has a more deleterious effect ( Figure 3C and D), recapitulating the phenotypes of our previously described ChAM null allele 25. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68730" pm="."><plain>To start dissecting the molecular mechanism underlying the CPT-survival defect associated with PALB2 T413S missense variant, we analysed RAD51 and γH2A.X nuclear foci formation in cells challenged with CPT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68731" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, we found that PALB2 T413S supported a nearly normal level of RAD51 nuclear foci formation, but a reduced level of γH2A.X nuclear foci formation ( Figure 4B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68732" pm="."><plain>This observation is somewhat puzzling since most studies report a robust correlation between RAD51 and γH2A.X nuclear foci formation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68733" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, the exact nature, meaning and significance of DNA repair proteins nuclear foci remain unclear 45, and the RAD51 nuclear foci observed in PALB2 T413S expressing cells do not necessarily reflect regular HDR events. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68734" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that, through its interaction with BRCA1, PALB2 T413S can initiate RAD51 recruitment, but for as-yet-unknown reasons, fail to promote HDR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68735" pm="."><plain>Notably, BRCA1, in complex with BARD1, can promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of H2A.X 46, 47, and in this way, supports the attenuation of the γH2A.X-mediated damage signalling following the completion of DNA damage repair 46. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68736" pm="."><plain>In the case of PALB2 T413S, BRCA1 might be aberrantly trapped at sites of DNA damage due to unproductive HDR events, which then leads to the premature attenuation of the γH2A.X-mediated response ( Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68737" pm="."><plain>While additional studies will be required to define a potential role of ChAM in HDR, our observations support the notion that PALB2 T413S perturbs DNA stress signalling, resulting in a decreased cellular resistance to CPT treatment ( Figure 3C and D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68738" pm="."><plain>Of note, the T413S PALB2 variant change a residue potentially targeted by protein kinases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68739" pm="."><plain>Although no direct evidence indicates that kinases phosphorylate this particular residue in vivo, it is tempting to speculate that changes in ChAM phosphorylation, rather than its primary amino-acid sequence, could be deleterious, affecting productive DNA stress signalling and repair. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68740" pm="."><plain>The PALB2 T413S variant is, however, scarce and reported as a somatic mutation in a single patient with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 45. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68741" pm="."><plain>It is important to note that SCLC is an exceptionally aggressive type of cancer with poor prognosis, and camptothecin (topotecan) is currently the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat relapsed SCLC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68742" pm="."><plain>While inactivating (nonsense or essential splice-site) mutations of both TP53 and RB1 is associated with a significant fraction of SCLC cases 38, whole exome screening of the SCLC patient carrying the PALB2 T413S mutation detected only an inactivating nonsense mutation in TP53 ( Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68743" pm="."><plain>Mutations in PTEN, SOX2 and NOTCH1, which are also frequently associated with SCLC, and BRCA1/2 or other known Fanconi anaemia genes were also not detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68744" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the COSMIC database references three additional SCLC cases with rare missense VUSs within PALB2 WD40 repeat domain (Q921H, V978D and R1086G). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68745" pm="."><plain>The link between SCLC and PALB2 mutations is unidentified to date, and although further investigation will be required to assess the pathological consequences of these mutations (namely T413S, Q921H, V978D and R1086G), our findings may have implications for understanding the development of this disease. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68809" pm="."><plain>Many cancer-associated mutations truncate the encoded PALB2 protein to varying degrees, disrupting its function in the repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68810" pm="."><plain>This interesting paper builds on previous work from Dr. Esashi’s laboratory to characterize the functional impact of two mis-sense mutations (T413S and S417Y) altering residues in a PALB2 region (chromatin association motif, or ChAM) previously reported to promote nucleosome interaction. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68811" pm="."><plain>The authors find that while ChAM fragments bearing the T413S or S417Y mutations exhibit sharply reduced chromatin interaction, full-length PALB2 mutants containing T413S or S417Y still retained a significant proportion of their chromatin-interacting ability, with PALB2 T413S being more severely affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68812" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this finding, PALB2 T413S when expressed in PALB2-mutant EUFA1341 cells sensitises them to the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (CPT). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68813" pm="."><plain>In addition, PALB2 T213S (but not S417Y) reduces gamma-H2AX formation after DNA damage, although it has little effect on damage-induced RAD51 foci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68814" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that chromatin-bound PALB2 may have functions in the signalling of damage-induced stress distinct from roles in RAD51 recruitment, and that disruption of such functions may account for cancer promotion by mutations affecting the ChAM. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68817" pm="?"><plain>Therefore, is the reduction in mutant PALB2 protein expression – most severe for the functionally compromised T413S mutant – responsible for both the reduced chromatin association and the observed cellular defects? </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68835" pm="."><plain>The partial chromatin association of full-length PALB2 variants is expected, as wild-type PALB2 chromatin binding is mediated through two mechanisms: direct interaction between ChAM and nucleosomes (Bleuyard et al., 2012 EMBO Rep; this study), and the stable interaction with MRG15, which binds to trimethylated histone H3 at K36 (Bleuyard et al., 2017 PNAS). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68876" pm="."><plain>These issues are not addressed and this might explain the difficulty in reconciling a defect in DDR signalling with apparently normal recruitment of downstream repair factors but impaired survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68877" pm="."><plain>Given that PALB2 has, through BRCA1 and BRCA2, been linked to homologous recombination repair it might have been useful to quantify levels of HR and investigate sensitivity to Parp inhibitors. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="68884" pm="."><plain>This is a blotting artefact due to the bleaching of the histone H3 signal, which was used a marker of the chromatin-associated fraction. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68890" pm="."><plain>Although the role of PALB2 missense mutations in disrupting its protein interactions with complex members BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-established, the role of missense mutations in perturbing PALB2 chromatin-binding function and its contribution to tumorigenesis is unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68891" pm="."><plain>These potentially high-impact mutations were identified by mining the public cancer mutation database, COSMIC, and the literature. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68892" pm="."><plain>The fifteen identified missense mutations in the chromatin-association motif were introduced into HEK293T cells, and two mutations (T413S and S417Y) were found to have impaired chromatin binding, one of which is found to be mutated in a single case of SCLC (T413S). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68893" pm="."><plain>These two missense mutations were further introduced into full-length PALB2 and expressed in PALB2-deficient EUFA13141 cells, where only the T413S mutation was found to perturb chromatin binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68894" pm="."><plain>PALB2 T413S-expressing cells are more sensitized to camptothecin treatment, and display reduced levels of g-H2AX foci compared to cells expressing wild-type PALB2 and PALB2 S417Y while maintaining comparable levels of Rad51 foci. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68895" pm="."><plain>This suggests failure to efficiently activate DNA damage repair signalling while maintaining downstream effector recruitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="68896" pm="."><plain>Overall, the authors propose a novel mechanism through which PALB2 missense mutations could promote tumorigenesis by impairing its chromatin-binding ability, albeit found in a very limited number of tumours to date. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="68900" pm="."><plain>The comparison shown, with EV, suggests that T413S is interfering with the action of another effector protein, since it is more defective than cells lacking PALB2. </plain></SENT>
