</text></title><p id="Par9"><text><SENT sid="69052" pm="."><plain>Shoulder arthroplasty is the standard treatment for patients with severe shoulder osteoarthritis with numbers continually rising. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69053" pm="."><plain>Modern anatomically designed shoulder arthroplasty systems have proven to provide significant pain relief and improvement of function over time [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69054" pm="."><plain>Long-term survivorship is mostly affected by implant related complications [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69055" pm="."><plain>Although loosening of the glenoid component is more common than stem related problems [3], given the growing number of shoulder replacements and revision surgeries, the humeral side becomes increasingly clinically relevant. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69056" pm="."><plain>Loosening is not the only indication for revision, as removal of the humeral stem is also required for implant unrelated complications such as infection or secondary rotator cuff tear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69057" pm="."><plain>In revision surgery, complications commonly arise with difficulty of stem removal, cement extraction, bone loss or osteolysis due to polyethylene wear debris, and intraoperative fracture associated with potentially longer operating times, increased risk of infection, nerve injuries, and worse outcome [1, 4–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69058" pm="."><plain>Shaft malunion after fracture, where the deformity does not allow an anatomic positioning of the humeral stem [7, 8], is another challenging situation to treat. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="69059" pm="."><plain>An expedient alternative is humeral head resurfacing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69060" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, humeral resurfacing is a technically challenging procedure requiring at least 60% of intact humeral head [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69061" pm="."><plain>Firstly, it is mandatory to find the correct centre of rotation to avoid overstuffing and secondly with the remaining head in situ correct glenoid component implantation may be difficult [10]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="69062" pm="."><plain>A contemporary, promising alternative are stemless anatomic shoulder implants, which generally rely on metaphyseal or meta- and epiphyseal fixation, combining the advantages of humeral head resurfacing and common shoulder replacement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69063" pm="."><plain>Potential benefits are (1) the possibility of anatomic shoulder reconstruction regardless of medial and posterior offset of the proximal humerus, caput-collum-diaphyseal angle, and retrotorsion of the humeral head; (2) the ability to perform implantation in fracture sequelae with shaft malunion and secondary post-fracture situations with humeral head deformities; (3) good glenoid exposure; (4) bone stock preservation; and (5) facilitating further revision surgery. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="69064" pm="."><plain>The main purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate radiological changes around the humeral component of a stemless shoulder implant with hollow screw fixation and their influence on clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69065" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that clinical mid-term outcome after stemless humeral head replacement would be affected by radiological changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69066" pm="."><plain>Secondary objectives were to compare operating times between stemless and stemmed hemi- and total shoulder arthroplasty and to report short and mid-term clinical outcome after stemless hemi- and total shoulder arthroplasty. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="69157" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have been reporting radiological and clinical findings after stemless anatomical shoulder arthroplasty; however, to our knowledge we are the first to compare radiological findings to clinical mid-term outcome in a prospective single-centre trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69158" pm="."><plain>We were not only able to show that clinical and radiological results with the stemless shoulder prosthesis showed favourable improvements from pre- to short and mid-term outcome with no revision surgery due to humeral component loosening, we also had to reject our hypothesis that radiological changes would negatively impact clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69159" pm="."><plain>Constant scores were not significantly different between patients with and without radiological changes in the mid-term follow-up. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="69160" pm="."><plain>Recently, comparable Constant scores were detected by Habermeyer et al. [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69161" pm="."><plain>In accordance to the literature for stemmed shoulder arthroplasty, TSA showed significantly higher relative Constant Scores than HSA in this study, and values remained stable over time [16, 17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69162" pm="."><plain>As the present study and current literature [18, 19] demonstrated, stemless shoulder arthroplasty provides similar clinical results as established stemmed arthroplasty systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69163" pm="."><plain>The main focus of our study was the radiologic behaviour of the implant and its influence on clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69164" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the present results regarding radiolucencies and osteolysis are rather different to the findings of Habermeyer et al. [15], who reported an osteolysis rate of not more than 4%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69165" pm="."><plain>Such variations could be explained by the fact that radiographs were assessed and classified differently. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69166" pm="."><plain>While we adapted a rather concise nomenclature, Habermeyer did not provide detailed information regarding the classification protocol [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69167" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the presence of osteolysis did not affect clinical outcome or revision rates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69168" pm="."><plain>Comparable to Habermeyer’s findings [15], internal stress shielding occurred in half of the implants in one or more zones with the majority around the greater tuberosity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69169" pm="."><plain>Again, no influence on clinical outcome could be seen in either study. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="69170" pm="."><plain>The majority of abnormal radiological findings occurred either in the superior part of the trunion or in the inferior implant bone interface near the calcar, often leading to partial osteolysis similar to the already known phenomenon described by Raiss [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69171" pm="."><plain>Radiolucencies in the superior and inferior parts of the trunion could be explained with the results of finite element analyses (FEA) [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69172" pm="."><plain>FEA suggested that superposition of force and moment induced stresses in weak inferior cortical bone support is leading to higher migration values within the inferior trunion-bone interface and is therefore resulting in a shift of the centre of rotation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69173" pm="."><plain>The bone adaptation and resorption around the implant is mostly dependent on the stability of the hollow screw and is caused by axial bending stiffness similar to the concept explained by Nagels et al. [21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69174" pm="."><plain>Since such radiological findings were not reflected in the clinical outcome, an arbitrary definition of an implant at risk had to be established. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69175" pm="."><plain>Thus, we assumed that if an implant showed the presence of osteolysis in two or more zones, the humeral head component might become unstable. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="69176" pm="."><plain>Currently, few different stemless shoulder implant systems are on the market with sporadic report of short-term outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69177" pm="."><plain>A major strengths of the Eclipse prosthesis is that it is the only implant with a different fixation mechanism not relying on impaction implantation and therefore avoiding a potential risk of metaphyseal fracture or implant migration [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="69178" pm="."><plain>Revision surgeries followed an already well-known pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69179" pm="."><plain>In hemiarthroplasties the majority of revisions were due to secondary glenoid erosion (20.5%), which was similar to other studies [22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69180" pm="."><plain>Secondary cuff failure was the main cause for revision (15.2%) in total shoulder arthroplasty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69181" pm="."><plain>The higher revision rate due to secondary rotator cuff ruptures in the present trial compared to rates (&lt; 8%) reported by Sperling et al. [23] could be explained with the relatively high mean age in the TSA-group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69182" pm="."><plain>Other than that, reasons for revision were traumatic surgical neck of humerus fracture, undefined pain for neglected long head of biceps tendon, and symptomatic mes acromion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69183" pm="."><plain>However, no revision surgery was indicated due to humeral component loosening or polyethylene glenoid component loosening in this patient cohort. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="69184" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, but not surprisingly, revision surgery with such a stemless implant compared to stemmed prostheses were fairly easy as the removal of the humeral component does not require any special manoeuvres (e.g. osteotomy) and leaves a rather anatomic situation with the whole metaphysis in place. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="69185" pm="."><plain>Last but not least, shorter operating times, another strength of stemless humeral head surgery, with HSA as well as with TSA in comparison with a stemmed anatomic shoulder arthroplasty system could be observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69186" pm="."><plain>This fact is not surprising, but worth mentioning since 20 min less on operating time is a benefit for the patient regarding reduced anaesthesia time and blood loss, not to mention the advantage in time management and therefore cost effectiveness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69187" pm="."><plain>As the humeral component implantation is a rather easy procedure, which is also reflected by the significant shorter operating time compared to stemmed shoulder arthroplasty, the learning curve for this surgical technique is quite steep. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="69188" pm="."><plain>Although results of this mid-term trial are promising, long-term outcome regarding implant stability needs to be reported. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69189" pm="."><plain>Another limitation is that in-depth subjective assessments (e.g. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons or quality of life scores) are missing. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69190" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, assessment of bone mineral density in the humeral head prior to implantation would have been desirable as bone mineral density might influence implant ingrowth and the possible appearance of osteolysis [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69191" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, our institution does not offer the possibility to assess bone mineral density in the shoulder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69192" pm="."><plain>However, we believe that the present results outweigh these limitations by the thorough radiographic analysis demonstrating that radiological findings do not influence clinical outcome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69193" pm="."><plain>We speculate that in the future a humeral head replacement with a shaft may only be indicated under rare circumstances, while the majority of patients, at least according to our results, can be successfully treated with a stemless humeral head replacement. </plain></SENT>
