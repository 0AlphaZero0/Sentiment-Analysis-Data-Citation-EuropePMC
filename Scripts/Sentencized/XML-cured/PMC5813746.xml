The study was designed to have adequate power to compare the efficacy of this regimen with a historical benchmark. The basis for this efficacy assessment is the proportion of patients who survive progression‐free for 6 months. The justification of the sample size requirement for this study is as follows. Vredenburgh [5] reported a 6‐month progression‐free survival rate of 42.6% (97.5% confidence interval 29.6%–55.5%) among patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan. If the true 6‐month PFS with the combination of bevacizumab and vorinostat were 40% or less, there would be limited interest in developing this combination further. However, if the true 6‐month PFS were 60% or more, there would definitely be interest in further investigation of this treatment regimen. Therefore, within this patient subgroup, the study was designed to differentiate between a 40% and 60% rate of 6‐month PFS. Statistically, the hypothesis that was to be tested was H0: p &lt; 0.40 versus H1: p &gt; 0.60, where p is the proportion of patients who live 6 or more months without disease progression. Forty patients were to be enrolled in this single‐stage study. If 21 or more of these 40 patients lived 6 or more months without disease progression, the treatment regimen would be considered worthy of further investigation. Otherwise, the treatment regimen would be determined not worthy of further investigation within this patient population. The type I and II error rates associated with this testing are 0.074 and 0.13, respectively. Investigator's AnalysisInactive because results did not meet primary endpoint </sec><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="onco12302-sec-0007"><title><text><SENT sid="69288" pm="."><plain>Drug Information for Phase II Treatment Arm <p><text><SENT sid="69289" pm="."><plain>Drug 1 Generic/Working NameBevacizumabTrade NameAvastinCompany NameGenentechDrug TypeAntibodyDrug ClassAngiogenesis ‐ VEGFDose10 mg/kgRouteIVSchedule of AdministrationAdministered every 2 weeks combined with VOR 400 mg p.o. daily for 7 days, then 7 days off in a 28‐day cycleDrug 2 Generic/Working NameVorinostatTrade NameZolinzaCompany NameMerck &amp; Co.Drug TypeSmall moleculeDrug ClassHDACDose400 mg per flat doseRoutep.o.Schedule of AdministrationVOR 400 mg p.o. daily for 7 days, then 7 days off, in a 28‐day cycle </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="onco12302-sec-0008"><title><text><SENT sid="69290" pm="."><plain>Patient Characteristics for Phase II Treatment Arm <p><text><SENT sid="69291" pm="."><plain>Number of Patients, Male24Number of Patients, Female16StageNo stageAgeMedian (range): 52.4 years (32–74 years)Number of Prior Systemic TherapiesNumber: 1Performance Status: ECOG0 — 11 — 352 — 23 — 0Unknown — 2 </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="onco12302-sec-0009"><title><text><SENT sid="69292" pm="."><plain>Primary Assessment Method for Phase II Treatment Arm <p><text><SENT sid="69293" pm="."><plain>TitlePFS6Number of Patients Enrolled40Number of Patients Evaluable for Toxicity40Number of Patients Evaluated for Efficacy40Response Assessment CRn = 0 (0%)Response Assessment PRn = 9 (22.5%)(Median) Duration Assessments OS10.4 months, CI 7.6–12.8 </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="onco12302-sec-0010"><title><text><SENT sid="69294" pm="."><plain>Phase II Treatment Arm Adverse Events <p><text><SENT sid="69295" pm="."><plain>imageJohn Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.Toxicity summary of adverse events (all attributions) occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of patients.Abbreviations: *NC/NA, *No Change from Baseline/No Adverse Event; NOS, not otherwise specified. </sec></SecTag><sec id="onco12302-sec-0013"><title><text><SENT sid="69296" pm="."><plain>Serious Adverse Events <p><text><SENT sid="69297" pm="."><plain>imageJohn Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. </sec><SecTag type="METHODS,DISCUSS"><sec id="onco12302-sec-0014"><title><text><SENT sid="69298" pm="."><plain>Assessment, Analysis, and Discussion <p><text><SENT sid="69299" pm="."><plain>CompletionStudy completedPharmacokinetics/PharmacodynamicsNot collectedInvestigator's AssessmentInactive because results did not meet primary endpoint </sec></SecTag><sec id="onco12302-sec-0011"><p><text><SENT sid="69300" pm="."><plain>The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM; World Health Organization grade 4) continues to present a challenge to the neuro‐oncology community.

<SENT sid="69305" pm="."><plain>Bolstered by the initial success of bevacizumab in recurrent GBM, other clinical trials explored the role of BEV in combination with other chemotherapy and targeted agents [3]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69307" pm="."><plain>They identified 14 clinical trials in the published literature that examined the use of bevacizumab in combination with other agents for the treatment of recurrent GBM. They concluded that bevacizumab alone and in combination does improve PFS, but that there were no statistically significant changes in OS for patients with recurrent GBM. In the hope that combination therapy could provide improved outcomes for recurrent GBM, we designed our clinical trial on bevacizumab in combination with vorinostat, a derivative of hydroxamic acid that has antitumor properties by inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC). <p><text><SENT sid="69310" pm="."><plain>Vorinostat is FDA approved for the treatment of cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma and is an orally available HDAC inhibitor. Common toxicities include bone marrow suppression, fatigue, and diarrhea, and the treatment is generally well tolerated. In a phase II study by Galanis and colleagues, they evaluated the treatment of vorinostat in patients with recurrent GBM [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69313" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint for this study was 6‐month progression‐free survival with the expectation that the regimen would be considered active if the 6‐month progression‐ free survival were ≥25%, and they achieved this endpoint with 9 of the first 52 patients (of note, 66 patients participated in this study) progression‐free at 6 months. In this study, expected toxicities of vorinostat included fatigue and bone marrow as the most common toxicities. These promising results increased our interest in pursuing a clinical trial in recurrent GBM using the combination of vorinostat and bevacizumab. Using the same endpoint as the aforementioned study, we sought to improve 6‐month progression‐free survival. Vredenburgh and colleagues reported a 6‐month progression‐free survival percentage of 42.6% among patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69318" pm="."><plain>If the true 6‐month progression‐free survival with the combination of bevacizumab and vorinostat were 40% or less, there would be limited interest in developing this combination further. However, if the true 6‐month progression‐free survival were 60% or more, there would definitely be interest in further investigation of this treatment regimen. <p><text><SENT sid="69320" pm="."><plain>With the early success of bevacizumab and subsequent approval of bevacizumab by the FDA for treatment of recurrent GBM, many studies have sought to find the appropriate partner to improve outcomes beyond bevacizumab. In a randomized, controlled, phase II study, single‐agent bevacizumab or lomustine versus the combination of bevacizumab plus lomustine were studied in patients with recurrent GBM (BELOB trial) [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69322" pm="."><plain>The combination of bevacizumab and lomustine exhibited a 6‐month progression‐free survival of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29%–55%) and is strikingly similar to the study from Vredenburgh and colleagues [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69323" pm="."><plain>Of note, this was superior to the 6‐month progression‐free survival with bevacizumab alone (16%) and lomustine alone (13%). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69336" pm="."><plain>The most common grade 2 and above treatment‐related adverse events were lymphopenia (55%), leukopenia (45%), neutropenia (35%), and hypertension (33%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69337" pm="."><plain>Five patients (12.5%) experienced treatment‐related unacceptable toxicities, which the protocol defined as any treatment‐related, nonhematologic grade 4 or 5 toxicity or a grade 2 or greater central nervous system hemorrhage. Two patients died while enrolled on this study, one due to tumor progression and another possibly related as death not otherwise specified. In regards to the death not otherwise specified, the patient had been admitted to a local hospital for 1 week of progressive confusion and weakness. Imaging of the brain was obtained, which showed stable disease, and the patient was improving with physical therapy. On date of death, the patient was otherwise at baseline condition and became acutely apneic. Attempts to resuscitate the patient were performed but were unsuccessful. Cause of death is not able to be determined and no autopsy was performed. <p><text><SENT sid="69344" pm="."><plain>Although overall survival remains the critical endpoint, our study affirmed the utility of the PFS6 landmark, progression‐free survival at 6 months. Although the partial responses noted are of interest, one difficulty in assessing response is that bevacizumab can induce a “pseudoresponse” due to improvement in membrane permeability in glioblastoma. At a PFS6 of 30% versus previous reports at 40%, we concluded that, although treatment with combination bevacizumab and vorinostat was tolerable, there was no improvement in progression‐free survival at 6 months with this regimen. Based on the findings of this study, the combination of bevacizumab and vorinostat should not be pursued as an option for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. As the community of neuro‐oncology moves forward with research in antiangiogenics in the treatment of recurrent GBM, further studies are warranted to evaluate other combinations such as immunotherapy or other targeted agents. </sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="onco12302-note-0099"><p><text><SENT sid="69349" pm="."><plain>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01738646?cond=vorinostat+bevacizumab+glioma%26rank=4">NCT01738646</ext-link> <p><text><SENT sid="69350" pm="."><plain>Sponsors: Merck, Sharp, and Dohme, Corp.; Genentech, Inc. <p><text><SENT sid="69351" pm="."><plain>Principal Investigator: Katherine B.
