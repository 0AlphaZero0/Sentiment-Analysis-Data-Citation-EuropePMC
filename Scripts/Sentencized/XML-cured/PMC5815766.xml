</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69374" pm="."><plain>Insulin resistance has been shown to play important roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.[1–3] Although established evidence has documented that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with insulin resistance,[4] the factors linking NAFLD to insulin resistance are not fully understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69375" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-B, which is secreted from the liver, is the second member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors.[5,6] Fetuin-B shares some similarity in functional analysis with fetuin-A, which has been found to cause insulin resistance by activating Toll-like receptors and inducing inflammatory signaling.[6–8] Meex et al[9] recently reported that fetuin-B was increased in humans with liver steatosis and patients with type 2 diabetes, impaired insulin action in myotubes and hepatocytes, and caused glucose intolerance in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69376" pm="."><plain>Our previous data also suggest an independent association between serum fetuin-B and insulin resistance, but whether fetuin-B is causally related to insulin resistance is currently unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69377" pm="."><plain>Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis which employs genetic variants as instrumental variables under stringent assumptions to assess if the effect of a risk factor on the outcome, even in the presence of unmeasured confounding, is causal has been widely used in observational epidemiology studies.[10–12] Unlike the conventional observation studies which are subject to lots of confounding bias and reverse causality, MR approach using the genetic alleles, which are located randomly during conception and inherited independent of confounding variables as the instrumental variables, has been widely accepted for causality inference.[11] The FETUB gene encodes the protein fetuin-B, located in the human chromosome 3q27.3 with 8 exons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69378" pm="."><plain>Based on the baseline examination of our designed cohort study of 1523 community-living healthy obese Chinese adults (unpublished data), we previously found that serum fetuin-B level was positively correlated with intrahepatic triglyceride content, and elevated serum fetuin-B was independently associated with increased risk of insulin resistance in obese Chinese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69379" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we have also shown that the minor allele G for FETUB rs4686434 was significantly associated with decreased intrahepatic triglyceride content and might confer lower susceptibility of NAFLD in Chinese adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69380" pm="."><plain>In the present study, by incorporating all information of common genetic variants in the FETUB locus and serum fetuin-B concentrations with insulin resistance, we aimed to explore the potential causal relationship between fetuin-B and insulin resistance in obese Chinese adults by suing MR analysis. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69465" pm="."><plain>The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to examine the association between fetuin-B and insulin resistance using MR analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69466" pm="."><plain>We firstly confirmed that increased serum fetuin-B level was significantly associated with higher risk of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69467" pm="."><plain>Common genetic variants of FETUB SNPs (rs4686434, rs6785067, and rs3733159) were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations but were not associated with insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69468" pm="."><plain>By using the genetic variants of FETUB SNPs as instrumental variables to assess the potential causality of fetuin-B with insulin resistance, we found that the associations of measured fetuin-B and genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR were significantly different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69469" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the association between fetuin-B and insulin resistance may not be causal. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69470" pm="."><plain>Denecke et al[6] found that although fetuin-B shares some similarity with fetuin-A, the function of fetuin-B was not identical with that of fetuin-A. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69471" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-A has been found to cause insulin resistance, but the role of fetuin-B in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance has been seldom investigated after its identification. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69472" pm="."><plain>Meex et al[9] reported that fetuin-B impaired insulin sensitivity in myotubes and hepatocytes, but unlike fetuin-A, it did not induce proinflammatory signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69473" pm="."><plain>In mice, they found fetuin-B impaired significantly glucose tolerance but did not cause insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69474" pm="."><plain>However, when compared obese subjects with simple steatosis to those without steatosis, they found plasma fetuin-B correlated positively with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR.[9] In the present study of obese Chinese adults, we consistently found that elevated serum fetuin-B level was independently associated with increased risk of insulin resistance after adjusting for potential confounding factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69475" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-A has been found to inhibit insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and promote inflammation,[19,20] strengthen lipid-induced insulin resistance acting as an adaptor protein for saturated fatty acid-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling[7] and interact with free fatty acid to predict insulin resistance.[8] However, the mechanisms underlying fetuin-B for insulin resistance have not been investigated well. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69476" pm="."><plain>Meex et al[9] found fetuin-B had no effect on proinflammatory signaling or cytokine release, and they concluded that fetuin-B might induce insulin resistance in a manner quite distinct from that of fetuin-A. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69477" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence available on genetic associations of variants among FETUB locus with serum fetuin-B concentrations and insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69478" pm="."><plain>We are probably the first to identify the minor allele G in rs4686434 and A in rs6785067 were significantly associated with decreased serum fetuin-B concentration, while the minor allele G for rs3733159 showed significantly increased serum fetuin-B concentration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69479" pm="."><plain>We also found that there was no significant association between FETUB SNPs and insulin resistance in obese Chinese adults. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69480" pm="."><plain>Rather than being associated with decreased risk of insulin resistance as would be expected based on association observed between minor alleles of rs4686434 and rs6785067 with lower serum fetuin-B concentrations, these 2 minor alleles tended to be associated with increased risk of insulin resistance, although none reached statistical significance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69481" pm="."><plain>How the FETUB SNP variants are likely to affect serum fetuin-B is currently unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69482" pm="."><plain>It should be noted that our genetic association results are very preliminary and should be validated in different ethnic populations with much larger sample size. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69483" pm="."><plain>In most observational studies, the direction of observed associations cannot be determined due to unmeasured confounding and the possibilities of reverse causation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69484" pm="."><plain>One possible approach to strengthen causal inferences is to use instrumental variable if the randomized controlled trial is in unpractical situation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69485" pm="."><plain>MR study is one form of instrumental variable analysis for observational studies which employs the germline genetic variants as instruments for environmental exposure and has been considered as analogous to randomized controlled trial.[11] To perform MR analysis, a few stringent assumptions should be met well.[21,22] First, the instrumental variable is associated with the risk of interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69486" pm="."><plain>Second, the instrumental variable is not associated with any confounding of the risk factor–outcome association. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69487" pm="."><plain>Third, the instrumental variable is conditionally independent of the outcome given the risk factor and confounding.[23] In the present study, the FETUB SNP variants were found to be associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations only but not with any of the potential confounding factors or the outcome of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69488" pm="."><plain>By using the FETUB SNP variants which were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations as instrumental variables to assess the potential causal association of fetuin-B with insulin resistance, we found that the associations of measured fetuin-B and genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR were significantly different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69489" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot exclude a potential association of genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR, the estimate was significantly different from the positive association of the measured fetuin-B with HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69490" pm="."><plain>There are several possibilities for the discrepancy on the associations of measured fetuin-B and genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69491" pm="."><plain>First, our subjects are all adults with central obesity and older ages, and we may not have recruited appropriate population if the FETUB SNP variants affect insulin resistance earlier before they have been becoming old and obese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69492" pm="."><plain>The second possibility of the discrepancy is that subjects who carry the risk alleles of FETUB SNP with elevated serum fetuin-B may have developed compensatory mechanisms against the risk of insulin resistance, as our obese subjects were all community-living and relatively healthy without apparently diagnosed diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69493" pm="."><plain>The third explanation is that the observed association between serum fetuin-B concentrations and insulin resistance may be confounded by other determinants of fetuin-B and meanwhile FETUB SNP variants are not confounded by the same determinants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69494" pm="."><plain>For example, fetuin-B is correlated with severity of hepatic steatosis which itself is also independently associated with insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69495" pm="."><plain>But the FETUB SNP variants have not been found to be associated with severity of hepatic steatosis, which has not been appropriately adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69496" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that the association of serum fetuin-B with insulin resistance is through other different mechanisms, and more pathway analysis for this association is warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69497" pm="."><plain>Although MR analysis that is less susceptible to confounding bias and reverse causality was used in the present study, a few limitations still need to be acknowledged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69498" pm="."><plain>First, our subjects were all obese, and we may underestimate the association between serum fetuin-B and insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69499" pm="."><plain>Second, insulin resistance was determined by HOMA-IR calculated with fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels rather than the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, which remains the “gold standard” for accurately determining insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69500" pm="."><plain>Third, FETUB rs4686434 significantly deviated from HWE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69501" pm="."><plain>But we believed this would not change our main findings, as the other 3 tagging SNPs (rs3733159, rs1047115, and rs6785067) obeyed the HWE, and there were no genotyping errors detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69502" pm="."><plain>Fourth, only 4 tagging SNPs were selected and rare SNPs with MAF &lt;0.05 were not considered in the present study; the number of the genotyped SNPs was limited and explained only a small fraction (9.2%) of serum fetuin-B variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69503" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some rare SNPs among the FETUB locus are associated with insulin resistance and may underestimate the true association between genetically predicted fetuin-B levels and HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69504" pm="."><plain>So for future studies on the possible causal relationship between fetuin-B and insulin resistance using MR analysis, more genetic variants, including both common and rare SNPs, should be included as the instrumental variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69505" pm="."><plain>And the fifth limitation was that we have not replicated our findings, as there was no another independent cohort available for us at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69506" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results should be confirmed in different populations with much larger sample size in future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69507" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study provided for the first time that the genetic variants in the FETUB locus were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations but were not associated with insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69508" pm="."><plain>Although we found that the elevated serum fetuin-B concentration was significantly associated with increased risk of insulin resistance, results from MR analysis suggested that this association may not be causal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69509" pm="."><plain>Future studies on the nongenetic determinants of serum fetuin-B concentration to assess if such unmeasured factors in the present study may confound the association between fetuin-B and insulin resistance are needed. </plain></SENT>
