In this study the genes encoding hyperthermophilic archaeal starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, α-amylase and amylopullulanase from Pyrococcus furiosus and glucoamylase from Sulfolobus solfataricus, together with the gene encoding a modified ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (glgC) from Escherichia coli, were simultaneously expressed in cassava roots to enhance starch accumulation and its subsequent hydrolysis to sugar. A total of 13 multigene expressing transgenic lines were generated and characterized phenotypically and genotypically. Gene expression analysis using quantitative RT-PCR showed that the microbial genes are expressed in the transgenic roots. Multigene-expressing transgenic lines produced up to 60% more storage root yield than the non-transgenic control, likely due to glgC expression. Total protein extracted from the transgenic roots showed up to 10-fold higher starch-degrading activity in vitro than the protein extracted from the non-transgenic control. Interestingly, transgenic tubers released threefold more glucose than the non-transgenic control when incubated at 85°C for 21-h without exogenous application of thermostable enzymes, suggesting that the archaeal enzymes produced in planta maintain their activity and thermostability. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group><kwd>cassava</kwd><kwd>hyperthermophilic archaeal</kwd><kwd><italic>glgC</italic></kwd><kwd>starch self-processing</kwd><kwd>bioethanol</kwd><kwd>multigene-expression</kwd><kwd>starch-hydrolyzing enzymes</kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">U.S. Department of Agriculture<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000199</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">2008-35504-04557</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">U.S. Department of Agriculture<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000199</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">2011-38821-30974</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">U.S. Department of Agriculture<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000199</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">2014-38821-22417</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="103"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="69554" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69555" pm="."><plain>Global energy consumption is predicted to increase by 48% from 580 quadrillion KJ in 2012 to 860 quadrillion KJ in 2040 (U.S. EIA, 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69557" pm="."><plain>However, given the increasing concerns of environmental pollution and climate change due to production and use of petroleum-based fuels and chemicals (Mei and Rakhmatov, 2014), there is a need to develop alternative and renewable energy sources to meet the demands. Bioethanol as biofuel has been widely produced from sugarcane and corn in Brazil and United States, respectively, (Mei and Rakhmatov, 2014; Lopes et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69559" pm="."><plain>In the 2010/2011 crop season alone, grain ethanol refineries consumed 40% of the total United States corn production (Du and McPhail, 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69560" pm="."><plain>This large diversion of grain to ethanol has led to growing concern over crop-based bioethanol due to its competition with food and feed supplies. Hence, there is a strong interest in second and third generation biofuels (e.g., lignocellulosic biomass and algae) whose technologies are still expensive due to the cost of feedstock production and processing (Carriquiry et al., 2011; Balan, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69562" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need to identify alternative plant species that can be economically more viable in the near term, are compatible with existing starch-based biofuel technologies, and are high yielding, resilient, and multipurpose (Sanchez and Cardona, 2008; Cooke and Traore, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69563" pm="."><plain>Starch-rich feedstocks such as cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) offer great potential to address these needs. Given the ever-increasing demand for food, feed, and energy, as well as continuous changes in our societal demands, there is a need for cost-effective and sustainable starch-processing routes. Recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the transfer of starch hydrolytic enzymes from the processing tank to starchy feedstock by directly producing enzymes in the biomass (Hebelstrup et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69566" pm="."><plain>This transfer requires the use of thermostable and thermoactive enzymes isolated from hyperthermophiles, which have very low activity at ambient temperatures, and thus do not compromise normal plant growth and development. <p><text><SENT sid="69567" pm="."><plain>Cassava is one of the most important food crops, feeding more than a billion people in about 105 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It can be grown by resource-poor farmers due to its outstanding adaptation to and productivity on marginal lands (El-Sharkawy, 2004; Chetty et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69569" pm="."><plain>Increasing demands for food, feed, and fuel throughout the tropics has led to a 24% increase in land committed to cassava cultivation since 1990, surpassing the Solanum genus potato (Taylor et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69570" pm="."><plain>Cassava is an important source of starch in tropical and subtropical countries, ranking second to corn (De Souza et al., 2016; Karlstrom et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69571" pm="."><plain>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 8.5 million tons of cassava starch and flour were exported globally in 2015 (FAO, 2015), of which Thailand contributed the largest share (7.9 million tons). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69572" pm="."><plain>The demand from ethanol sectors in Asia is driving rapid growth in world cassava production by an estimated 100 million tons (∼35% of total production) since 2000 (FAO, 2013), with at least 780 million liters of cassava ethanol produced annually in China alone (Xuan et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69573" pm="."><plain>Cassava is inherently able to produce very high harvestable yields (&gt;070 tons/ha) of starchy roots in optimum environments, compared to corn (20 tons/ha), sorghum (13 tons/ha), rice (26 tons/ha), sweet potato (65 tons/ha), and wheat (12 tons/ha) (El-Sharkawy, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69574" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its remarkable tolerance to adverse conditions, such as poor soils, drought, and high temperature (El-Sharkawy and Cock, 1984; Angelov et al., 1993; El-Sharkawy, 1993; Fermont et al., 2009), where most other staple food crops would fail to produce reasonable yields (Jarvis et al., 2012), makes cassava one of the most promising crops in the face of climate change. <p><text><SENT sid="69575" pm="."><plain>Improvement of cassava through traditional breeding has been challenging due to high heterozygosity, low natural fertility, erratic flowering and the lack of agronomically important genes in sexually compatible germplasm (Puonti-Kaerlas et al., 1999; Ihemere et al., 2006; Que et al., 2010; Ceballos et al., 2015; Chavarriaga-Aguirre et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69576" pm="."><plain>Therefore, genetic engineering is a preferred approach for trait improvement. Several laboratories have genetically engineered cassava for agronomically important traits such as vitamin content (Welsch et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015), virus resistance (Vanderschuren et al., 2009, 2012; Beyene et al., 2017), extended shelf-life (Zidenga et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013), reduced toxic cyanogenic glycoside content (Siritunga and Sayre, 2004; Jorgensen et al., 2005), improved starch quality (Zhao et al., 2011), and increased cold-tolerance (Xu et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69578" pm="."><plain>Likewise, enhanced starch content has been reported in transgenic cassava expressing a mutated Escherichia coli ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase; glgCGly336Asp), which is less sensitive to its activator (fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate) and inhibitors (AMP and inorganic phosphate) (Stark et al., 1992; Meyer et al., 1998; Ballicora et al., 2003; Ihemere et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69579" pm="."><plain>AGPase catalyzes the first dedicated and rate-limiting step in starch biosynthesis (Preiss, 1988; Tiessen et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69580" pm="."><plain>Given that cassava is inherently able to produce high yields (El-Sharkawy, 2004), and has the highest annual bioethanol yield compared to other starchy feedstocks such as sweet sorghum, rice, maize, and wheat (Wang, 2002; Ziska et al., 2009), there is a need to develop novel cultivars with increased starch yields and starch self-processing ability for enhanced bioethanol production. <p><text><SENT sid="69581" pm="."><plain>Hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea growing optimally at temperatures above 80°C and have been a source of thermostable industrial enzymes (Richardson et al., 2002; Egorova and Antranikian, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69582" pm="."><plain>Complete starch breakdown to glucose requires the synergistic action of thermostable amylases, pullulanases, and glucoamylases (Egorova and Antranikian, 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69583" pm="."><plain>Archaeal amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) have been isolated and characterized from Pyrococcus furiosus, P. woesei, Thermococcus profundus, and T. hydrothermalis (Dong et al., 1997a; Jorgensen et al., 1997; Bertoldo and Antranikian, 2001; Mehta and Satyanarayana, 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69584" pm="."><plain>Similarly, pullulanases (EC 3.2.1.41) have been isolated and characterized from the archaea P. furiosus, P. woesei, and Desulfurococcus mucosus (Rudiger et al., 1995; Dong et al., 1997b; Duffner et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2006; Hii et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69585" pm="."><plain>Glucoamylases (E.C. 3.2.1.3), which convert partially processed starch/dextrin to glucose, have also been isolated from archaea such as Sulfolobus solfataricus, Picrophilus torridus, and Thermoplasma acidophilum (Bertoldo and Antranikian, 2001; Kim et al., 2004; Kumar and Satyanarayana, 2009) and characterized. <p><text><SENT sid="69587" pm="."><plain>Several laboratories have successfully expressed thermostable bacterial α-amylase/amyllopullulanase in plants, including corn (Lanahan et al., 2006), rice (Chiang et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2008) and sweet potato (Santa-Maria et al., 2011) to induce starch self-processing ability. However, it remains unclear as to whether increased starch self-processing ability could be conferred by heterologous expression of a suite of hyperthermophilic archaeal enzymes in planta. Moreover, expressing multigene starch-degrading genes in cassava from a single T-DNA has never been reported before. <p><text><SENT sid="69590" pm="."><plain>In this study, mutated E. coli glgCG336D as well as the genes encoding three archaeal starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, α-amylase and amylopullulanase from P. furiosus and glucoamylase from S. solfataricus, were simultaneously expressed in cassava to enhance yield and starch self-processing ability. Transgenic lines were phenotypically and genotypically characterized. Our findings reveal that simultaneous expression of the archaeal and bacterial genes improves starch self-processing ability and storage root yield, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of in planta production and activation of multiple archaeal enzymes that led to increased starch hydrolysis directly in the biomass. This approach has a vast potential to improve cassava and other starch-rich feedstock for the production of bioethanol and industrial products. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title><text><SENT sid="69595" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>

To study whether the archaeal enzymes are produced in the roots, the genes were targeted to the roots using root-specific promoters. A total of 11 lines expressing the three starch-degrading enzymes and the mutated bacterial AGPase (designated as 4-G-lines), two lines expressing the starch-degrading enzymes (3-G-lines), and five empty vector control (NPTII) lines were obtained. During in vitro growth and 3 weeks after transplanting to soil, the performance of the transgenic lines expressing multiple genes was not different from the non-transgenic control plants (Figure 2F). </plain></SENT>

Plants were propagated in vitro on agar media and allowed to grow for at least 1 month until sufficient fibrous roots were obtained for protein extraction. Total protein from the roots was extracted and purified by heating, and used for saccharification of purified potato starch in vitro.

<SENT sid="69704" pm="."><plain>Protein extracts from the majority of transgenic lines released more glucose from starch than those from wild-type and empty vector control lines. The enzyme cocktail from 4-G-L62 coexpressing the three starch-hydrolyzing enzymes (α-amylase, amylopullulanase, and glucoamylase) and E. coli AGPase showed the highest starch-degrading activity, releasing about sixfold more glucose than the wild-type control. Likewise, 3-G-L3, which expresses only the starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, released about fourfold more glucose than the wild-type control. This finding suggests that hyperthermophilic archaeal enzymes maintain their activity and thermostability when heterologously expressed in cassava roots. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="69708" pm="."><plain>Starch-degradation assay as determined by the DNS method.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69815" pm="."><plain>In this study, expression of a suite of archaeal starch-degrading enzymes was targeted to the roots of cassava. To understand whether the enzymes are accumulated in their active forms, total protein was extracted from storage roots was used for saccharification of carbohydrates including starch, pullulan, maltose/maltotriose as substrates for amylase, amylopullulanase and glucoamylase, respectively. <p><text><SENT sid="69817" pm="."><plain>The findings revealed that recombinant enzyme cocktails extracted from storage roots of the transgenic line showed significantly more carbohydrate-hydrolyzing activity, as compared to the cocktail extracted from the non-transgenic control (Figures 3, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69818" pm="."><plain>This increase in carbohydrate saccharification establishes that the archaeal enzymes maintain their activity and thermostability when produced in cassava roots. The amount of glucose released from starch and pullulan by the 4-G-L62 enzyme cocktail was over 10-fold more than the enzyme cocktail from WT. Higher activity of the cocktail on starch and pullulan is likely due to higher expression of α-amylase and amylopullulanase (Table 2) as compared to glucoamylase, since amylopullulanase is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both pullulanase and amylase activities (Kim et al., 1993; Chiang et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69821" pm="."><plain>The amount of glucose released from both maltose and maltotriose was much lower than those released from starch or pullulan, which is likely due to low level of gene expression. Taken together, our findings establish that active forms of a suite of thermophilic carbohydrate-degrading enzymes can be produced in planta. Note, though, that this conclusion is based on the cumulative activity of the enzyme mix, and that the specific activity of each recombinant enzyme needs to be determined separately in the future. Furthermore, since the assays were performed at 85°C, a temperature typically used for starch hydrolysis, assay conditions such as temperature, pH, buffer, and ions need to be optimized for the three enzymes in the cocktail. <p><text><SENT sid="69825" pm="."><plain>The observed increase in saccharification of several carbohydrates due to targeted accumulation of the archaeal enzymes in the tubers suggests a potential of the tubers for commercial-scale production of high-value enzymes because tubers have specialized molecular environment for product stability as previously reported in potato (Sparrow et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69830" pm="."><plain>To validate starch hydrolyzing activity of the recombinant hyperthermophilic enzymes directly in the tubers, the tubers were pulverized, incubated at 85°C overnight to activate the enzymes, and the total reducing sugar yield in the hydrolysate was quantified. The result shows that transgenic tubers release three-times more reducing sugars as compared to the wild-type control, suggesting that the recombinant enzymes can hydrolyze starch in situ. A number of thermostable starch-hydrolyzing genes from bacteria have been expressed in transgenic plants. For example, coexpression of Bacillus stearothermophilus bifunctional α-amylase and glucose isomerase in potato tuber (Solanum tuberosum) (Beaujean et al., 2000), B. stearothermophilusα-amylase in transgenic rice seeds (Xu et al., 2008), Thermotoga maritima α-amylase in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) (Santa-Maria et al., 2011), and T. thermohydrosulfuricus truncated amylopullulanase in corn (Nahampun et al., 2013) induced starch saccharification at high temperatures. Interestingly, in all these studies the transgenes have not been shown to affect plant development and metabolism, and harvestable yield. However, cases in which thermostable starch-degrading enzymes modulated plant composition have also been reported, for example, increasing the expression level of thermostable Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus amylopullulanase in rice modified the starch composition by reducing the amylose content (Chiang et al., 2005). <p><text><SENT sid="69836" pm="."><plain>Recombinant hyperthermophilic archaeal glycosyl hydrolases have been produced in bacteria and their carbohydrate degrading activity has been established (Dong et al., 1997a,b; Kim et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69838" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this study reports for the first time on heterologous expression of archaeal genes in plants for an in situ activation to enhance starch self-processing ability. This novel approach should lead to a sustainable route for starch conversion to sugars for biofuels and other industrial products. Given that cassava is the highest yielding starchy feedstock (Ziska et al., 2009; El-Sharkawy, 2012), and the most resilient crop to environmental variability (El-Sharkawy, 2012; Jarvis et al., 2012), transgenic cassava with improved traits will attract tremendous commercial interest. </sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="69841" pm="."><plain>Potential Applications of This Study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69844" pm="."><plain>The vector system used in this study offers a platform for multiple gene insertion into these crops to engineer traits that require a suite of enzymes, for example, polysaccharide conversion to sugars for biofuels or other industrial purposes (as in this study), disease resistance (Tricoli et al., 1995; Beyene et al., 2017), pest resistance (Santamaria et al., 2012), enhanced vitamin content (Ye et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2013; Pons et al., 2014), molecular farming of industrial and pharmaceutical products (De Martinis et al., 2016), and simultaneous improvement of two or more traits. <p><text><SENT sid="69845" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that cassava-derived bioethanol has economic advantages over other starchy feedstocks including corn (Dai et al., 2006; Ziska et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69846" pm="."><plain>The annual bioethanol yield of cassava is three-times that of corn (Wang, 2002; Ziska et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69847" pm="."><plain>Therefore, introducing starch self-processing trait in cassava will further increase its demand as bioethanol feedstock, and will have great economic and environmental benefits. Starch processing to sugar for bioethanol production or in food processing industries is a multistep process that requires the application of commercial enzymes such as α-amylase and glucoamylase. Considering the cost of large-scale enzyme production and applications to bioprocessing, the current approach whereby starch-degrading enzymes are directly produced and accumulated in the plant starchy biomass, and are heat-activated in situ to break down starch, would tremendously cut the cost of starchy feedstock processing. This technology has the potential to attract commercial interest, as observed for the genetically modified corn developed by Syngenta (Enogen) that expresses microbial α-amylase for ethanol production (Johnson et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69851" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the current approach reduces energy/labor cost and increases process efficiency in many ways; (1) the archaeal hyperthermophilic enzymes with temperature optima above 90°C (Dong et al., 1997a,b; Jorgensen et al., 1997; Kim et al., 2004) will circumvent the need for the expensive cooling step normally required before saccharification step in the case of fungal glucoamylases with lower temperature optima (50–70°C) (Norouzian et al., 2006), (2) transgenic storage roots may be processed directly and require less water for grinding, omitting further processing such as drying which requires space, and is labor intensive, (3) provided that the recombinant enzymes are accumulated at higher levels, the transgenic biomass may be blended with non-transgenic biomass to reduce enzyme cost and the need to allocate more land for genetically engineered plants. Moreover, glucose produced by this potentially cheap route can serve as a feedstock for a plethora of industrial products. A number of products including succinic acid, itaconic acid, adipic acid, 3-hydroxypropanoic acid/aldehyde, isoprene/farmesene, glutamic acid and aspartic acid can be produced from glucose through biological fermentation (Sanchez et al., 2005; de Jong et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="69856" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report on the production of a suite of hyperthermophilic archaeal enzymes that lead to enhanced starch self-processing ability directly in the transgenic biomass. However, to realize the full potential of this technology, recombinant enzyme production should be enhanced, for example, by codon-optimizing the native gene sequences, by using stronger promoters, translation enhancers, and/or by targeting the proteins to cellular compartments, such as apoplast and ER. All of these approaches have been shown to increase protein expression and storage levels elsewhere. To compensate for any potential harvestable yield penalty due to expression of multiple genes, there may be a need to co-express genes that enhance biomass/starch yield. Furthermore, future research will characterize the transgenic lines under well-controlled growth conditions, and establish optimum reaction conditions for the enzyme cocktail, including processing media, temperature, pH and cofactor additions. Moreover, the fermentability of the saccharification product by yeast needs to be investigated. Overall, this study reports on a novel approach for sustainable and inexpensive route to produce fermentable sugars from cassava, which can easily be transferred to other low-input tuber/root crops such as sweet potato, Solanum genus potato, and other tropical root crops including yam, taro, and arrowroot. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="AUTH_CONT"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="69863" pm="."><plain>Author Contributions </plain></SENT>
