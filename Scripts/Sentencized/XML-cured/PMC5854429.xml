The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, however, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although this unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details of the process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. A free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. This simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelicdal turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. At one end of the DNA, the first five bps unwrap, after which a second five bps unwrap at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 bps are unwrapped. During further unwrapping of 15 bps, the unwrapping advances at one of the ends, after which the other end of the DNA unwraps to complete the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title><text><SENT sid="70301" pm="."><plain>Author summary <p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="70302" pm="."><plain>The eukaryotic genome is compactly packaged into the cell nucleus. Within the nucleus, DNA forms protein-DNA complexes called nucleosomes. The nucleosome is the fundamental structural unit of chromatin. It is composed of a histone octamer around which DNA wraps about twice. During cellular processes such as DNA transcription, replication and repair, the DNA must be unwrapped from the structure. This unwrapping has been investigated experimentally, but details of the process at the atomic level are not yet well understood. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations using an enhanced sampling method to obtain free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of the nucleosomal DNA. Our analysis shows that some energy cost is required to unwrap the first 5 bps at one end of the DNA, after which a second 5 bps unwrap with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA for up to 10 bps. In this way, DNA unwrapping occurs asymmetrically from one end. These findings provide insight into how DNA dynamics are related to gene regulation. </p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (JP)</institution></funding-source><award-id>JP25116003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-8707</contrib-id><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Hidetoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>MEXT</institution></funding-source><award-id>hp120309, hp130003, hp140029, hp150233, hp160223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-8707</contrib-id><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Hidetoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research has been funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Strategic Programs for Innovative Research, Computational Life Science and Application in Drug Discovery and Medical Development (hp120309, hp130003, hp140029, hp150233, hp160223) and by JSPS KAKENHI(No. JP25116003).

Its crystal structure revealed that within the nucleosome, 146 or 147 bps of DNA wrap 1.75 times around an octameric histone core [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70316" pm="."><plain>However, for proper gene function, such as transcription, duplication and repair, this nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, at least partially. <p><text><SENT sid="70317" pm="."><plain>Single-molecule experiments showed that the energetics of protein-DNA interactions depend to varying degrees on the protein-DNA contact positions. FRET experiments[2–6] showed that in the absence of salt, the outer superhelical turn of DNA (hereinafter referred to as “outer DNA”) within the nucleosome repeats spontaneously and repeatedly unwrapping and rewrapping. Rewrapping is about 5 times faster than unwrrapping, which is within about 10 to 50 ms [7, 8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70320" pm="."><plain>Single-molecule experiments in which the two ends of the DNA in a nucleosomal array [2, 5] or individual nucleosome [6] are mechanically pulled in opposite directions demonstrated that the outer DNA is more easily unwrapped than the inner super-helical turn.

<SENT sid="70322" pm="."><plain>This single molecule experiment showed that distinct histone-DNA interactions occur at intervals of about five bps, indicating that the two phosphate backbones of double-stranded DNA interact independently with the histones. It is difficult, however, to determine at the atomic level details such as which interaction is lost first during unwrapping and then second and so on. <p><text><SENT sid="70324" pm="."><plain>All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided detailed information about the dynamics of the nucleosome [9–16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70325" pm="."><plain>Ettig et al. were the first to carry out all-atom MD simulations of the nucleosome to investigate unwrapping energetics [17] and Gribkova et al. calculated histone-DNA binding energies with a concept similar to this study [18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70326" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the unzipping experiment, Ettig et al. observed a 5-bp periodicity. However, because of the limited amount of time that could be computationally processed, a large force was imposed on the DNA during the unwrapping process, which caused unrealistic distortion of the DNA and histones. <p><text><SENT sid="70328" pm="."><plain>Coarse-grained MD is an attractive method because it enables processing time spans not achievable in all-atom simulations using current state-of-the-art computer systems. Kenzaki and Takada performed a coarse-grained MD simulation that captured residue-level structural details, and exhibited spontaneous unwrapping and rewrapping of the outer DNA [19]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70330" pm="."><plain>In addition, their simulation showed that the unwrapping is mostly asymmetric, with one end unwrapping while the other end remains wrapped. Using a similar coarse-grained model, Lequieu et al. calculated the tension-dependent free energy surface and found that the contributions of histone tails to DNA stability differed between the H3/H4 and H2A/B tails [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70332" pm="."><plain>Whereas H3/H4 contributes more to the stability of the outer DNA, H2A/B stabilizes the inner DNA. The results of these simulations are consistent with the experimental findings [2–6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70334" pm="."><plain>However, coarse-grained MD requires adjustable parameters for the target of interest and is still less reliable in dynamics than all-atom simulations with an explicit solvent model due to the nature of the simplification. <p><text><SENT sid="70335" pm="."><plain>Here, we carried out MD simulations with an enhanced sampling method to obtain conformational ensembles. We report the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer-turn of nucleosomal DNA. The obtained profiles based on the ensembles show that unwrapping of the outer-turn costs about 11.5 kcal/mol. Comparison of the numbers of unwrapped base pairs at the two ends of the DNA shows that the unwrapping occurs asymmetrically, though the nucleosome has a pseudo-symmetric structure and a symmetric DNA sequence. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="RESULTS"><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title><text><SENT sid="70339" pm="."><plain>Results <p><text><SENT sid="70340" pm="."><plain>We carried out simulations of unwrapping outer superhelical turn DNA (outer DNA) to obtain the free energy profiles.

A “flooding time” τ determines how fast the current position is destabilized. A larger drop of biasing energy given by a smaller flooding time can save computational time because energy wells along the reaction coordinate are filled faster. However, a short flooding time, for instance τ = 1 ps, often corrupted the dsDNA structure of the nucleosomal DNA. We tested three τ values, 1, 10 and 100 ps, with 100 walkers and found that 10 ps was mostly acceptable from a structural point of view. However, to further ensure proper dsDNA structure was maintained, we set τ to 100 ps. Note that the flooding time, τ value has to be determined considering the total number of walkers used in ABMD simulation because the total energy dropped during the simulation is proportional to the product of 1/τ and the total number of walkers. With this τ value, ABMD simulations with 100 walkers were carried out for 15 ns (1.5 ms in total), until the dropped energy converged at every point over the entire range of the reaction coordinate (S1A and S2A Figs). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70564" pm="."><plain>For that reason, umbrella sampling was done to enhance equilibrium sampling. In the umbrella sampling, the reaction coordinate was divided into 71 windows with a width of 2 Å, which covered 40 to 180 Å in stage 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70566" pm="."><plain>In stage 2, it was divided into 26 windows with a width of 2 Å, covering 125 to 175 Å. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70567" pm="."><plain>We prepared the initial conformations for umbrella sampling as follows. First, we sorted 100 walkers according to end-to-end distance in ABMD. Then, out of the 100 walkers, we picked up walkers whose end to end distance was closest to difix where difix = 40 Å + 2.0 Å × i (i = 0, 1, 2, …, 70) in stage 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70570" pm="."><plain>Likewise, for stage 2, we picked up walkers according to difix = 125 Å + 2.0 Å × i (i = 0, 1, 2, …, 25). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="70572" pm="."><plain>Note that the sampled conformations in ABMD at less than 40 Å and more than 180 Å on the reaction coordinate in stage1 and more than 175 Å in stage 2 were discarded because their DNA structures were clearly corrupted or highly distorted (S3 Fig). <p><text><SENT sid="70573" pm="."><plain>The weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) [68, 69] was used to refine the free-energy landscape from the sampled trajectories in the umbrella sampling simulations. With the WHAM approach, the unbiased probability distribution P(R) is calculated from the biased probability distribution of the sampled coordinates as: P(R)=∑i=1Nwinni(R)Pi(b)(R)×[∑j=1Nwinnj(R)exp([Fj−Vj(R)]/kBT)]−1,(1) where R is the atomic coordinates, Nwin is the number of windows, ni(R) is the number of data points in the i-th window, Pi(b)(R) is a biased probability from the raw data obtained in the umbrella sampling simulation, Vj(R) is the biasing potential in the j-th window, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the constant temperature. In this study, Vj(R) was selected to be the sum of a harmonic potential and the ABMD biasing potential in the final stage of the ABMD simulation, which has the form: Vi(R)=ki(d(R)−difix)2+Uabmd,(2) where d(R) is the distance between the centers of mass of the two terminal nucleotides of the nucleosomal DNA. difix is a fixed distance to maintain d(R) within the range of 40 to 180 Å with intervals of 2 Å (i = 0,…, Nwin = 70) in stage 1 and 125 to 175 Å with intervals of 2 Å (i = 0,…, Nwin = 25) in stage 2. ki is an arbitrary harmonic force constant, which was set at 0.2 kcal/mol/Å2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70576" pm="."><plain>The umbrella sampling simulation was carried out for 15 ns. The conformation of the nucleosome for the analysis was stored every 1 ps. <p><text><SENT sid="70578" pm="."><plain>The coefficient Fj is defined by: Fj=−kBTln{∑windowsP(R)exp([−Vj(R)]/kBT)},(j=1,…Nwin)(3) where the summation includes all the coordinates of R, which were sampled in any windows. By iterating Eqs (1) and (3) to achieve self-consistency (using a tolerance of 10−8), the relative free energy F(R) at a given R is obtained as: F(R)=−kBTlnP(R).(4) To visualize the free-energy profile, the dimension of R in Eq (4) was reduced to 1 or 2 dimensions by defining an appropriate coordinate (reaction coordinate). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70580" pm="."><plain>The reaction coordinate could be simply selected to be d(R); however, d(R) may not be a good reaction coordinate, as it is not a direct indicator of how far the unwrapping of the nucleosomal DNA has progressed from the initial state. Instead, the total number of base pairs unwrapped from the histone core would be a good indicator for interpreting the DNA unwrapping. Consequently, the first reaction coordinate, R1, was defined as d(R), and the second reaction coordinate, R2, was defined as the total number of unwrapped base pairs. Unwrapping was defined when the center of mass of a base pair was shifted outward by more than 4 Å from the crystal structure. The probability of the trajectories on R2, P(R2), can be written as: P(R2)=∫P(R')δ(R2−R2'(R'))dR',(5) where δ(X) is the Dirac delta-function, and R2'=R2'(R). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="70585" pm="."><plain>The free-energy profile in 1 dimension has the same form as Eq (4): F(R2)=−kBTlnP(R2).(6) <p><text><SENT sid="70586" pm="."><plain>To describe the changes in a physical quantity, A, such as the distance between atoms along R2, the averaged quantity at R2, Ā(R2), is calculated by weighing the unbiased probability of the quantity A(R) as: A¯(R2)=∫A(R′)P(R′)δ(R2−R2'(R′))dR′P(R2).(7) The root mean square deviation (rmsd) from Ā(R2) is σ2(R2)=A2¯(R2)−A¯(R2)2(8) The probability and the 2-dimensional free-energy landscape with regard to R1 and R2, P(R1, R2) and F(R1, R2), respectively, are expressed as: P(R1,R2)=∫P(R′)δ(R1−R1'(R'))δ(R2−R2'(R')dR′,(9) F(R1,R2)=−kBTlnP(R1,R2).(10) </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title><text><SENT sid="70587" pm="."><plain>Supporting information <supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006024.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="70588" pm="."><plain>Dropped energy per 1 ns along the reaction coordinate (energy per 1 ns) in stage 1. <p><text><SENT sid="70589" pm="."><plain>(b) Changes in the positions of 100 walkers along the reaction coordinate against time in stage 1. <p><text><SENT sid="70590" pm="."><plain>(TIF) </caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006024.s001.tif"><caption><p><text><SENT sid="70591" pm="."><plain>Click here for additional data file. </caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006024.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="70592" pm="."><plain>Dropped energy per 1 ns along the reaction coordinate (energy per 1 ns) in stage 1. <p><text><SENT sid="70593" pm="."><plain>(b) Changes in the positions of 100 walkers along the reaction coordinate against time in stage 2. <p><text><SENT sid="70594" pm="."><plain>(TIF) </caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1006024.s002.tif"><caption><p><text><SENT sid="70595" pm="."><plain>Click here for additional data file. </caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1006024.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title><text><SENT sid="70596" pm="."><plain>DNA end-to-end distance plotted as a function of distance between two phosphorus atoms in base pairs of 100 walkers in ABMD simulations. <p><text><SENT sid="70597" pm="."><plain>(a) Plot at every 1 ns from 15 to 20 ns of ABMD in stage 1. </plain></SENT>
