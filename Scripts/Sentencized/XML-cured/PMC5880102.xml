<SENT sid="71524" pm="."><plain>Even within a defined tumor entity, the variation of biomarker expression between different patients and across different tumor regions of the same individual specimen (e.g. center versus periphery) needs to be considered. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71525" pm="."><plain>Particularly the latter is of immediate clinical importance, when only a small tumor fraction can be obtained in the setting of a diagnostic/pretreatment biopsy, and thus the region of withdrawal could directly impact the acquired expression profile. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71526" pm="."><plain>Routine diagnostics of tumors involves evaluation of histomorphological features by conventional microscopy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71527" pm="."><plain>Although it is often combined with immunohistochemical staining (IHC)1 of marker proteins, the number of proteins that can be quantitatively analyzed by IHC is rather limited by the availability of suitable antibodies and the experimental throughput. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71528" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables the quantitative analysis of protein abundances on a proteome-wide scale, but the majority of previous proteomic analyses of cancer specimens have only focused on the bulk tumor, not taking the spatial context within an individual specimen into account (2, 3). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71529" pm="."><plain>Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer tissue offers the best possible material to routinely study intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) because: (1) FFPE specimens provide excellent integrity of the tissue architecture (superior to frozen specimens), which allows, in combination with Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), the precise and reproducible spatial separation of local tissue regions; (2) human FFPE specimens are the central part of the clinico-pathological workflow and reflect the standard processing of tissue specimens in pathological routine diagnostics worldwide; (3) FFPE tissues are intrinsically linked to clinical records and often associated with additional pathological data (genomics, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry etc.). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71530" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been already used to study FFPE cancer tissue specimens (4, 5), but rarely in combination with spatial resolution (6–8), because the amount of material that can be obtained from a specific region of an FFPE specimen limits the comprehensiveness, i.e. number of identified and quantified proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71531" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the great advantage of excellent spatial preservation of FFPE material has not yet been exploited to systematically and jointly analyze inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity across multiple specimens. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71532" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a universal workflow that is based on LCM to separate different tumor regions, followed by ultrasensitive and rapid peptide isolation using the paramagnetic bead technology named SP3 (9), and high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71533" pm="."><plain>This workflow enables the reproducible proteomic analysis of FFPE material with very good proteomic coverage and spatial resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71534" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the power of this workflow, we investigated both inter- and intratumoral proteomic heterogeneity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71535" pm="."><plain>HCC is the 5th most frequent cancer worldwide (10), represents the 2nd most frequent cause of cancer related death, and shows a rapidly rising incidence rate, with an annual increase of 2% in the US (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71536" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic options for HCC patients are still limited with less than 20% of HCC patients being amenable for a curative treatment (partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71537" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the prognosis of symptomatic HCC patients is extremely poor, with a five-year-survival of less than 5%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71538" pm="."><plain>Important insights into the molecular basis and diversity of HCC have been provided by genomic and transcriptomic approaches (12–14), including prediction of tumor relapse (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71539" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, disease relevant alterations at the proteomic level (directly shaping the tumor phenotype), particularly in a spatial context, remain poorly defined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71540" pm="."><plain>Notably, the heterogeneity of HCCs is less apparent at the histomorphological level, in contrast to other tumor entities, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71541" pm="."><plain>Here we analyzed the spatial abundance of thousands of proteins across different tumor sectors, nontumorous tissue and across interindividual HCC samples. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71542" pm="."><plain>We show that spatial proteomic analysis accurately recovers known factors associated with HCC, but also identifies novel potential therapeutic candidates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71543" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that various, often functionally related proteins, display heterogeneous expression within a tumor that is not reflected on the genetic or gene expression level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71544" pm="."><plain>Among these, there are known prognostic markers for HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71545" pm="."><plain>Thus, dissecting the “submorphological” inter- and intratumor spatial proteomic heterogeneity may critically support and improve conventional diagnostic procedures, prognosis estimation and ultimately therapeutic options in precision liver oncology. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="71926" pm="."><plain>The aim of the presented study was to comprehensively analyze the spatial proteome of HCC on multiple levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71927" pm="."><plain>First, we compared neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue microdissected from 5 FFPE specimens of HCC of different etiology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71928" pm="."><plain>We provide a comprehensive resource of the HCC proteome by integrating gene and protein expression changes of human HCCs with alterations in protein expression observed in multiple murine HCC models of different, cancer-relevant, genetic background. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71929" pm="."><plain>We identified 755 proteins that show consistent expression changes (with the same sign) except for one tumor entity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71930" pm="."><plain>The observed differences for this specimen are higher than expected from just an interpatient heterogeneity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71931" pm="."><plain>Careful post-analysis examination of the specimen and clinical records revealed that the corresponding patient received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment before the surgery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71932" pm="."><plain>We therefore speculate that the unusual proteome profile of this specimen may be a consequence of the preoperative treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71933" pm="."><plain>However, further investigations are required to characterize the impact of chemoterapeutic treatment on the HCC proteome in vivo. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71934" pm="."><plain>The set of identified proteins includes multiple factors that have been already connected to HCC, but also some that have not been studied in context of liver tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71935" pm="."><plain>We observed strong enrichment of ribosomal components, suggesting increased translational activity within neoplastic hepatocellular tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71936" pm="."><plain>In fact, multiple oncogenic pathways have been shown to induce (de)-regulation of translational machinery, and increased protein synthesis is required to promote cellular transformation (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71937" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that increased translational activity facilitates HCC development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71938" pm="."><plain>We also identified functionally related proteins, such as NADH dehydrogenase complex I members, to be down-regulated in HCC at the protein level without being affected at the level of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71939" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in some of the analyzed specimens, we observed a general decrease of mitochondrial proteins indicating that the total number of mitochondria in HCC is lower than in normal hepatocytes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71940" pm="."><plain>This is supported by a corresponding decrease in mtDNA content in tumor regions as compared with adjacent tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71941" pm="."><plain>A potential explanation for the reduced abundance of mitochondria is an increased mitophagy activity that selectively removes defective mitochondria from the tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71942" pm="."><plain>In the future, it would be worthwhile to investigate further the impact of mitophagy inhibition on HCC development, as suggested for other cancer types (52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71943" pm="."><plain>However, it is important to consider that the observed reduction in mitochondrial proteins and mtDNA content could also derive from a rearrangement of the mitochondrial network and structure in cancer cells, as observed in aging tissues (53). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71944" pm="."><plain>Second, we identified proteins responsible for intratumor proteome heterogeneity in HCC and highlight the relevance of ITH for biomarker discovery studies and diagnostics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71945" pm="."><plain>ITH is a well-characterized feature of many tumors, which to date has been mainly investigated at the morphological and genetic level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71946" pm="."><plain>Here we identified proteins that are differentially expressed between the center and the periphery of the same tumor, indicating spatially defined metabolic and functional heterogeneity of tumor cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71947" pm="."><plain>We identified several proteins that are significantly changed in multiple specimens of HCC, however the spatial patterns of these changes are not always consistent across the examined tumors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71948" pm="."><plain>For example, ribosomal proteins are not only affected by ITH, but they are also one of the most prominent features up-regulated in HCCs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71949" pm="."><plain>The same is true for the fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), which is known to be involved in other diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction (54), but to the best of our knowledge has not been studied in context of HCC. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71950" pm="."><plain>According to our proteomics data, FABP4 appears to be overexpressed in the tumor in comparison to the nonneoplastic tissue, and at the same time displayed an uneven distribution across sectors in two of the analyzed specimens (up to 9-fold in one of the tumors). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71951" pm="."><plain>Our comparative analysis indicates that proteomic ITH in HCC is, at least in part, functionally related to the alterations that distinguish tumor and nonneoplastic tissues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71952" pm="."><plain>This observation might indicate the existence of heterogeneous cancer cell populations that are confined in spatially defined regions of the tumor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71953" pm="."><plain>These different cell populations might at least to some extent resemble the nonneoplastic tissue of origin, and therefore display a variable sensitivity to drug treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="71954" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we describe a strategy that can be universally applied to FFPE samples to investigate the abundance of thousands of proteins in solid tumors with excellent spatial resolution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="71955" pm="."><plain>Our strategy can be used jointly with other approaches based e.g. on MALDI imaging (55–59) or epitope-based tissue imaging (60), to deconvolute the complexity of tumor specimens and help incorporate ITH information in the design of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. </plain></SENT>
