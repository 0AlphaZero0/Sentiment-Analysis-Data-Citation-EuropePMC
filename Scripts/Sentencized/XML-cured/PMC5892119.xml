</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72241" pm="."><plain>Microbial communities that reside inside halite nodules from Salars in the Atacama Desert, Chile, are under extreme environmental pressures due to hypersalinity, intense solar radiation, and frequent desiccation-hydration cycles, which all generate high levels of oxidative stress (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72242" pm="."><plain>Oxidative stress occurs when the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in cells overwhelms antioxidant defense mechanisms and damage accumulates (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72243" pm="."><plain>Through metagenomic studies, we found the dominant populations in these salt rocks to be haloarchaea such as Haloferax and Halobacterium (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72244" pm="."><plain>These halophilic microorganisms are members of the third domain of life, the Archaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72245" pm="."><plain>Haloarchaea have previously been shown to be highly resistant to ROS damage, withstanding many times what Escherichia coli and other radiation-sensitive organisms can survive (5â7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72246" pm="."><plain>The haloarchaeon Halobacterium salinarum has been shown to use a wide range of strategies to combat damage from oxidative stress, including multiple copies of genomes (polyploidy) as the substrate for DNA repair, functional redundancy of DNA repair and detoxification enzymes (e.g., catalase), increased cytosolic manganese complexes to scavenge ROS, and differential regulation of genes in response to stress (5â9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72247" pm="."><plain>However, pathways for DNA repair and protein turnover in haloarchaea are nearly identical to those in nonresistant bacteria and eukarya, suggesting that the regulation of these processes in response to oxidative stress might be key to their robustness. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72248" pm="."><plain>Previous work with H. salinarum oxidative stress gene regulatory networks revealed that a single transcription factor, RosR, regulates the appropriate dynamic response of nearly 300 genes to reactive oxygen species stress (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72249" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrated that the oxidative stress response in H. salinarum impacted a wide array of cellular processes, engaging at least 50% of all the genes (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72250" pm="."><plain>These results underline the importance of gene regulation in haloarchaea for responding to and counteracting the damage caused by oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72251" pm="."><plain>In addition to transcription factors, small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) similarly act as global gene regulators (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72252" pm="."><plain>Small RNAs (sRNAs) are ubiquitously found in Bacteria and Eukarya, playing large-scale roles in gene regulation, transposable element silencing, defense against disease state, and foreign elements (11â14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72253" pm="."><plain>Several types of sRNAs have been identified in the Eukarya (microRNAs [miRNAs], small interfering RNAs [siRNAs], and Piwi-interacting RNAs [piRNAs]) and they are typically 20 to 25 nucleotides (nt) long. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72254" pm="."><plain>Their major mode of interaction is through base pairing to the 3â² untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs, inhibiting translation or triggering target degradation with associated protein components (Argonautes) (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72255" pm="."><plain>Bacterial sRNAs have been shown to modulate core metabolic functions and stress-related responses, such as nutrient deprivation, by binding target mRNAs and causing their degradation or preventing translation (11, 15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72256" pm="."><plain>Most of the functionally characterized sRNAs in Bacteria bind the 5â² UTR of their target mRNA and are longer than their eukaryal counterparts, with sizes ranging from 50 to 500 nt. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72257" pm="."><plain>These sRNAs can target multiple genes, including key transcription factors and regulators (11, 15, 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72258" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, a single sRNA can modulate the expression of large regulons and thus have a significant effect on metabolic processes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72259" pm="."><plain>For example, the bacterial sRNA OxyS, which is dramatically induced by oxidative stress, regulates the expression of approximately 40 genes and interacts directly with eight target mRNAs (11). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72260" pm="."><plain>sRNAs have been discovered to be abundant in Archaea, more specifically in haloarchaea, in response to a variety of environmental conditions, but the functional roles of these RNAs still remain poorly understood and a link between sRNAs expression and oxidative stress response has not been established (13, 17â24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72261" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies on sRNAs in hyperthermophiles, methanogens, and the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii have been reported so far (13, 17â24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72262" pm="."><plain>In H. volcanii, large numbers of intergenic and antisense-encoded sRNAs, 145 and 45, respectively, were discovered by using microarray in addition to a novel class of sRNAs recently described in eukaryotes, tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), and a new study found thousands of sRNAs present in this organism (19, 24, 25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72263" pm="."><plain>In Sulfolobus solfataricus, 125 trans-encoded sRNAs and 185 cis-antisense sRNAs were identified using high-throughput sequencing (HTS), suggesting that 6.1% of all genes in S. solfataricus are associated with sRNAs (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72264" pm="."><plain>A comparative genome analysis of Methanosarcina mazei, M. barkeri, and M. acetivorans revealed that 30% of the antisense and 21% of the intergenic sRNAs identified were conserved across the 3 species (27). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72265" pm="."><plain>Coimmunoprecipitation with the Lsm protein (archaeal Hfq homolog) was used to âcaptureâ sRNAs (17), but its functional role remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72266" pm="."><plain>While Ago homologs have also been found in archaeal genomes, there is no evidence for eukaryote-like RNA interference in these organisms (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72267" pm="."><plain>Rather, a defensive role against foreign genetic material was recently proposed, whereby archaeal Ago proteins direct guide-dependent cleavage of foreign DNA (29â31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72268" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these studies suggest that sRNAs are as widespread and abundant in the Archaea as in the Bacteria and Eukarya. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72269" pm="."><plain>Target mRNA identification of sRNAs has proven to be difficult within the Archaea but is a necessary task for uncovering sRNA functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72270" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) in M. mazei cultures, grown under nitrogen starvation conditions, showed the differential expression of a number of sRNAs in response to nitrogen availability and enabled the identification of the first in vivo target for archaeal intergenic sRNAs (27, 32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72271" pm="."><plain>The potential target for sRNA162 is a bicistronic mRNA encoding a transcription factor involved in regulating the switch between carbon sources and a protein of unknown function (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72272" pm="."><plain>In Pyrobaculum, 3 antisense sRNAs were found opposite a ferric uptake regulator, a triose-phosphate isomerase, and transcription factor B, supporting a potential role for archaeal antisense sRNA in the regulation of iron, transcription, and core metabolism (33). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72273" pm="."><plain>sRNA deletion mutants can be used to identify potential biological functions and target genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72274" pm="."><plain>Deletion strains were successfully generated for H. volcanii, and phenotyping of the sRNAs deletion mutants revealed several severe growth defects under high temperatures, low salt concentrations, or specific carbon sources (9, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72275" pm="."><plain>While these studies revealed that sRNAs likely play essential roles in the physiological responses to environmental challenges in the Archaea, the functional roles and mechanisms of action of these important posttranscriptional regulators still remain unknown. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72276" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no work has been done to investigate archaeal sRNAs in response to oxidative stress, a universal and frequent stressor in all domains of life that results in extensive cellular damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72277" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of sRNAs during the oxidative stress response, we assessed the H. volcanii transcriptional landscape under no-challenge and oxidative stress conditions using comparative strand-specific small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72284" pm="."><plain>Following quality control and reference-based read mapping, we intersected the mapped reads against the H. volcanii reference genome to discover sRNA transcripts that we classified as antisense (overlapping a gene and/or its regulatory elements on the opposite strand) (Fig. 1A) and intergenic (in a noncoding region between two genes) (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72285" pm="."><plain>We were unable to identify previously described cis-internal sRNAs (24), because with our RNA-seq strategies, those transcripts would be confounded with the corresponding gene transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72286" pm="."><plain>To further validate the sRNAs we identified and reduce transcriptional noise in our data, we applied a rigorous two-pronged in silico approach. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72287" pm="."><plain>First, we used a stringent threshold requiring an sRNA (i) to be present in at least four of five biological replicate libraries, and (ii) to have a minimum expression of 40 transcripts per million ([TPM] average with standard deviation from replicates) for antisense sRNAs (asRNAs) and 14 TPM for intergenic sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72288" pm="."><plain>Second, we used the genome browser IGV to inspect visually and confirm each sRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72289" pm="."><plain>These novel transcripts represented 25 to 30% of the total transcriptome and were 50 to 1,000 nt in length (Fig. 2; see also Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72290" pm="."><plain>Putative mRNA targets for asRNAs were identified as the cis mRNAs encoded on the opposite strands with a minimum overlap of 8 nt, on the basis of IGV confirmation and reports for bacterial asRNAs (34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72291" pm="."><plain>However, we found in our data that the median overlap between sRNAs and putative cis-mRNA targets was 221 nt, with only a small number having a minimum overlap length of 8 nt (see Fig. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="72407" pm="."><plain>Previous studies of sRNAs in Archaea revealed the abundance of sRNAs within the third domain of life and have been pivotal in establishing a working hypothesis on archaeal sRNA functionality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72408" pm="."><plain>These studies have been limited to (i) microarray studies that do not enable de novo discovery of sRNAs, (ii) differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) approaches, which select only for primary transcripts and do not provide length (nt) information nor expression information (only coverage), and (iii) individual sRNA studies, which do not give a holistic view of the pathways being regulated within the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72409" pm="."><plain>Using a custom strand-specific sRNA-seq library preparation and analysis pipeline, we have developed a method to perform high-throughput analysis of the sRNA transcriptional landscape, expression, and regulatory effects, and to identify regulated gene pathways in response to environmental stressors within the Archaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72410" pm="."><plain>In this study, we propose that sRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation is key in regulating stress responses to environmental challenges, such as oxidative stress, in the haloarchaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72411" pm="."><plain>sRNAs have the potential to carry out large-scale regulation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response, resulting in increased resistance to extreme environmental stressors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72412" pm="."><plain>The discovery that sRNAs comprised nearly one-third of the total transcriptome of H. volcanii and included basal transcriptional promoters, under both no-challenge and oxidative stress conditions, suggests that sRNAs have an important functional role under a variety of environmental conditions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72413" pm="."><plain>We discovered thousands of sRNAs expressed in H. volcanii, with the majority being antisense to genes, indicating that antisense transcription was ubiquitous within the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72414" pm="."><plain>This is in stark contrast to most of the literature reporting that a majority of sRNAs discovered in Archaea were intergenic (9, 13, 22, 39). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72415" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy is likely due to previous studies being limited to microarray approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72416" pm="."><plain>Indeed, a recent study using directional RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) to map all transcription start sites (TSS) in H. volcanii found thousands of novel TSS, with 1,244 of these TSS being antisense to mRNAs (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72417" pm="."><plain>Most of the TSS (75%) of the sRNAs we discovered in H. volcanii had the same TSS (Â±10 nt) as those found in the dRNA-seq study by Babski et al. (24), further confirming our results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72418" pm="."><plain>This underlines the importance of HTS studies, especially strand-specific RNA-seq such as in our study, to discover the full extent of antisense sRNA expression in Archaea. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72419" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggests that a priori cis-acting sRNAs may play a larger role than trans-acting sRNAs within the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72420" pm="."><plain>It should not be overlooked that the difficulty in finding in silico targets for intergenic sRNAs, because these sRNAs do not form 100% complementarity with their targets, might suggest that they have multiple mRNA targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72421" pm="."><plain>Antisense and intergenic sRNAs are broad classifications used in the archaeal small noncoding RNA field, but our data revealed that further classifications can be made on the basis of sRNA-mRNA binding characteristics (5â² UTR, 3â² UTR, and CDS), differential expression, and regulatory effects. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72422" pm="."><plain>We found that only a small fraction of asRNAs targeted the 5â² UTRs of mRNAs, which is in concurrence with work demonstrating that most mRNAs in H. volcanii are leaderless (lacking a 5â² UTR). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72423" pm="."><plain>A majority of the 5â² UTR-binding sRNAs targeted transposons, providing further evidence that they may constitute their own class of sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72424" pm="."><plain>Within this context, 3â² UTR-binding sRNAs should also be considered another class of sRNAs, resembling eukaryotic sRNAs, which likely lead to the degradation of their target transcripts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72425" pm="."><plain>The majority of the asRNAs we identified in H. volcanii had 100% complementarity within the CDS of their target mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72426" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of such a finding in any domain of life and might constitute an attribute unique to archaeal sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72427" pm="."><plain>We could not identify any âseedâ binding region for these CDS-binding sRNAs, indicating that they likely have full occupancy on the mRNA. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72428" pm="."><plain>It is worth noting that there were only a few instances (&lt;20) where sRNAs overlapped more than the full length of the target mRNA (i.e., the asRNA is longer than the mRNA) or overlapped multiple cis-mRNA targets (i.e., the asRNA overlaps the 3â² UTR of one mRNA and the 5â² UTR of an adjacent mRNA), which is novel in the Archaea. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72429" pm="."><plain>Most H. volcanii sRNAs had a normalized expression value of 200 TPM or less, indicating that sRNA transcripts are relatively abundant in the cell. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72430" pm="."><plain>The use of a stringent thresholding approach resulted in a smaller number of more highly expressed sRNAs but avoided potentially reporting false positives with low TPM values or transcriptional noise. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72431" pm="."><plain>In comparison, most mRNAs within H. volcanii had TPM values of 20 or less. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72432" pm="."><plain>We found a population of antisense sRNAs with significantly higher expression than their putative cis-mRNA targets, suggesting a potential negative regulatory role in sRNA-mRNA interactions (Fig. 3 and 4B) (40â42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72433" pm="."><plain>This trend extended to many asRNAs (under both no-challenge and oxidative stress conditions), down to sRNAs with expression levels of 40 TPM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72434" pm="."><plain>Stronger evidence for a negative regulatory effect lies with a population of upregulated sRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72435" pm="."><plain>A group of significantly upregulated asRNAs had target mRNAs that were downregulated during oxidative stress, indicating these asRNAs could potentially negatively regulate mRNA targets at the transcript level. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72437" pm="."><plain>All the asRNAs targeting transposons at the 5â² UTR were upregulated, and the transposon mRNAs were downregulated (Fig. 4D), suggesting that these asRNAs might have a similar mechanistic function (6, 43, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72438" pm="."><plain>If indeed these asRNAs are negatively regulating their target mRNAs in H. volcanii, we expected to find that downregulated asRNAs have upregulated target mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72439" pm="."><plain>Some downregulated asRNA targets exhibited this pattern, further supporting a potential negative regulation (Fig. 4C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72440" pm="."><plain>Many mRNA targets of both up- and downregulated asRNAs exhibited the same regulatory pattern, suggesting a potential nonnegative regulatory role for a group of asRNAs (Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72441" pm="."><plain>Alternative hypotheses, reflecting the complexity of transcriptional regulation in the Archaea, can be formed: (i) these asRNAs may have a positive regulatory effect, such as stabilizing target mRNAs and masking them from degradation as seen with an intergenic sRNA (itsRNA) in M. mazei (23), (ii) trans-acting intergenic sRNAs might be targeting these mRNAs, negatively regulating them, and (iii) some may have an unknown function (23). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72443" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that transposons are opportunistic, and under stress conditions, they can wreak havoc by hopping around in the genome causing double-strand breaks and hence need to be silenced (6, 43, 44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72444" pm="."><plain>A functional enrichment of IS4 transposon genes that are downregulated during oxidative stress supports our observation that the upregulated sRNAs can potentially negatively regulate transposons and suggests that transposon activity is tightly regulated during oxidative stress in H. volcanii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72445" pm="."><plain>sRNA-mediated regulation of chemotaxis transducer proteins during oxidative stress suggests interesting implications in sensing ROS and motility. H. volcanii expresses genes coding for a flagellum analog named âarchaellum,â which are organized into an operon and are regulated by a network of regulators called the archaellum regulatory network (arn) (identified in crenarchaea) (45, 46). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72446" pm="."><plain>The regulation of these motility genes is still under investigation and so far is restricted to a few examples, such as under H2 or nitrogen limitation conditions in Methanococcus jannaschii and Methanococcus maripaludis (46â49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72447" pm="."><plain>No direct transcriptional regulators of the archaellum have been identified in Euryarchaeota, but the deletion of archaellin genes, the presence of the H-domain set of type IV pillins, and Agl proteins have been shown to affect the assembly of the archaellum in H. volcanii (46, 50â52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72448" pm="."><plain>Integral to how microorganisms maintain homeostasis in stressful and fluctuating environments are the gene regulatory networks composed of interacting regulatory transcription factors and their target gene promoters (53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72449" pm="."><plain>Our discovery that sRNAs are targeting transcription factors provides evidence that sRNAs are likely deeply interlaced within complex gene regulatory networks of H. volcanii, and these sRNAs are key to maintaining homeostasis during environmental stresses such as oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72450" pm="."><plain>Many mRNA targets of differentially regulated sRNAs were hypothetical proteins, indicating that much remains to be elucidated in this organism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72451" pm="."><plain>Our whole transcriptional analysis demonstrated that close to one-third of the genes (â¼1,100 [30%]) in H. volcanii were differentially regulated during constant H2O2-induced oxidative stress at â¼80% survival, which is in agreement with the transcriptional response of H. salinarum during constant H2O2-induced (929 genes [38%]) and paraquat-induced (1,099 genes [45%]) oxidative stresses at â¼80% survival (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72452" pm="."><plain>This indicates that transcriptional regulation is crucial in order to mount this oxidative stress response via gene activation and repression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72453" pm="."><plain>Two single-stranded DNA binding proteins (RpaB and RpaC) were found necessary for the increased survival of H. volcanii under ionizing radiation (a proxy for desiccation) and UV radiation, stressors that both cause oxidative stress (54, 55) (J. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="72455" pm="."><plain>In H. salinarum, Rpa operons were upregulated under ionizing radiation as well and contributed to resistance (56, 57). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72456" pm="."><plain>In conjunction with previous findings, we observed that two of the most upregulated genes during H2O2 oxidative stress were RpaB1 (HVO_RS10725, 23-fold change) and RpaB2 (HVO_RS06105, 8-fold change), confirming their roles in oxidative stress resistance in H. volcanii and likely other haloarchaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72457" pm="."><plain>One gene, a reactive intermediate/imine deaminase RidA-homolog (HVO_RS12485), was upregulated orders of magnitude more than any other gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72458" pm="."><plain>The encoded protein is known to be involved in the synthesis of branched-chain amino acids by speeding up the IlvA-catalyzed deamination of threonine into 2-ketobutyrate (58, 59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72459" pm="."><plain>Previous work has shown that in the presence of reactive chlorine species (RCS), such as HOCl, imine deaminase seemed to inhibit IlvA activity suggesting that imine deaminase may have a different function in the presence of RCS (58, 60). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72460" pm="."><plain>Further studies found that imine deaminase can sense RCS and, in doing so, becomes a chaperone that prevents protein aggregation (58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72461" pm="."><plain>Reactive oxygen species in hypersaline environments produce RCS (61). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72462" pm="."><plain>In addition, ROS cause extensive irreversible protein damage such as carbonylation, which in turn causes protein aggregation (62, 63). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72463" pm="."><plain>This reactive intermediate/imine deaminase is the most upregulated protein-encoding gene, suggesting that it may be playing a similar chaperone role to prevent protein aggregation, by sensing either ROS or RCS produced by H2O2 (58, 60). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72464" pm="."><plain>This study is the first to report on the transcriptional response of H. volcanii to oxidative stress, and while we found similar responses to H2O2 exposure as previously reported for H. salinarum (2), further validating our work and providing evidence that haloarchaea have evolved similar strategies to survive their environmental stresses, we also found responses that were unique to H. volcanii. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72465" pm="."><plain>Similarities to H. salinarum include the upregulation of genes encoding ROS scavenging proteins (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and iron sulfur assembly proteins (SufB and SufD), as well as proteasome genes, indicating high protein turnover, and many DNA repair genes (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72466" pm="."><plain>Most of the downregulated genes were involved with metabolism, such as sugar/phosphate/peptide ABC transporters, electron carriers (halocyanin), and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, possibly to halt growth until damage is repaired (2, 64). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72467" pm="."><plain>The most downregulated gene was for an iron ABC transporter, most likely to limit further production of ROS via Fenton reactions (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72468" pm="."><plain>Of the unique responses to oxidative stress in H. volcanii, we found that genes encoding all of the RNA polymerase subunits and transcription elongation factors and seven basal transcription initiation factors (HVO_RS12755, 18.4-fold change; HVO_RS01380, 8.6-fold; HVO_RS09745, 6.5-fold; HVO_RS01840, 2.1-fold; HVO_RS05475, 1.74-fold; HVO_RS11835, 1.5-fold; HVO_RS05475, 1.3-fold change) were significantly upregulated in response to oxidative stress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72469" pm="."><plain>The increase in sRNAs during oxidative stress could be attributed to this increase in transcription machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72470" pm="."><plain>The majority of the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits were downregulated, in contrast to that in H. salinarum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72471" pm="."><plain>The upregulations of genes coding for histidine biosynthesis and catabolism into glutamate and 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism were unknown to be involved in the oxidative stress response, which further demonstrates there are still more mechanisms to uncover for oxidative stress resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72472" pm="."><plain>RosR was identified as a global transcriptional regulator in H. salinarum, and it was strongly upregulated during oxidative stress (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72473" pm="."><plain>RosR demonstrated no differential expression during oxidative stress in H. volcanii, indicating that it may play another role in this organism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72474" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle genes (parA and cdc6) involved in chromosome segregation (65) were downregulated, further suggesting that division is being arrested (halting growth) in order to repair damage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="72475" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed for the first time that small noncoding RNAs are specifically associated with the oxidative stress response in archaea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72476" pm="."><plain>During oxidative stress, asRNAs were prevalently transcribed, comprising nearly 30% of the transcriptome of H. volcanii, and many upregulated asRNAs imparted a correlative negative regulatory effect on putative target mRNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72477" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that some asRNAs in Archaea behave similarly to cis-acting bacterial sRNAs and eukaryotic siRNAs, which negatively regulate mRNAs by sharing extensive complementarity and facilitating RNA degradation (66, 67). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72478" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism(s) of sRNA-mRNA mediated regulation, in particular, whether proteins are required to complex with sRNAs in order to mediate gene regulation, such as in Bacteria (Hfq) and Eukarya (Ago), remains to be elucidated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72479" pm="."><plain>We also identified several classes of asRNAs, on the basis of their mRNA-binding patterns (3â² UTR, 5â² UTR, and CDS) and showed that CDS targeting of mRNAs was the predominant mode of action for sRNA hybridization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="72480" pm="."><plain>The mechanistic differences between these classes of sRNAs, as well as the regulatory roles of sRNAs in archaea and their functional importance in adaption to extreme environments, still need to be investigated. </plain></SENT>
