<SENT sid="76031" pm="."><plain>Levels of RNA methylation are finely balanced through an interplay among m6A methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers), and binding proteins (readers) [6]. m6A has been shown to regulate RNA processing, including RNA splicing [7, 8], nuclear export [9], RNA degradation [10, 11], and translation [12–14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76032" pm="."><plain>In agreement with its functions in RNA metabolism, m6A is an important regulatory factor in different cellular processes, including heat shock response [13], DNA damage response [15], cell fate determination [16–19], and innate immunity [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76033" pm="."><plain>In addition to its functions in these cellular processes, in vivo studies in model organisms have revealed crucial roles of m6A in spermatogenesis [9, 21–23], embryogenesis [24, 25], and T-cell homeostasis [26]. <p id="Par24"><text><SENT sid="76034" pm="."><plain>Although m6A is abundant in the brain, its dynamic regulation and biological significance for brain development remain largely unknown [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76035" pm="."><plain>Among the m6A-related genes identified, the RNA demethylase FTO is proven to be crucial for various brain functions, including D2R-D3R-GIRK-mediated signaling [27], adult neurogenesis [28], and memory formation [29, 30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76036" pm="."><plain>A recent report confirms the role of m6A methylation in temporal progression of mammalian cortical neurogenesis and in regulating axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system [31, 32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76037" pm="."><plain>To better understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the temporal and spatial complexity of the brain, it is important to characterize the physiological functions of m6A in a context-dependent manner. However, the biological functions of other m6A-related genes in different brain regions remain unclear. <p id="Par25"><text><SENT sid="76039" pm="."><plain>The cerebellum consists of a multi-layered structure, rendering it an important model for the study of neuronal cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation [33]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="76048" pm="."><plain>To understand the biological impact of m6A in mouse cerebellum, we first performed m6A analysis using postnatal cerebella at day 7 (P7), P14, P21, and P60 (Additional file 1: Table S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76049" pm="."><plain>We identified 10,449, 10,266, 10,419, and 10,783 methylated poly(A) RNAs at the four stages, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2, Additional file 1: Figure S1a–c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76050" pm="."><plain>Data analysis showed that UGGACU was the most conserved consensus sequence among all m6A peaks (Additional file 1: Figure S1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76051" pm="."><plain>Distribution analysis of all the m6A peaks in mRNAs revealed that their methylation patterns were similar from P7 to P60 (Additional file 1: Figure S1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76052" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, we observed significant enrichment of m6A peaks in start codon regions in addition to the coding sequence (CDS) and stop codon regions. A statistical analysis of the m6A peaks located in different transcript segments showed that the proportion of m6A peaks in start codon regions increased gradually from P7 to P60 (Additional file 1: Figure S1f and Additional file 1: Table S3). <p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="76054" pm="."><plain>To explore how m6A changes in postnatal mouse cerebellum, m6A peaks were subjected to pairwise comparison between each two adjacent stages. In total, we identified 12,452 “ON” switches (emerging m6A peaks in the later stage) and 11,192 “OFF” switches (resolving m6A peaks from the former to the later stage) (P &lt; 0.05, enrichment score &gt; 1.5) during the postnatal development (Fig. 1a, b and Additional file 1: Figure S1g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76056" pm="."><plain>The m6A ON and OFF switches also exhibited apparent differences in their distribution patterns. The m6A ON switches were more likely to be enriched in start codon regions rather than stop codon regions. In contrast, the numbers of m6A OFF switches surrounding stop codon regions were higher than that of ON switches (Fig. 1c and Additional file 1: Figure S1h). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76059" pm="."><plain>Together, these data imply that m6A marks occurring at earlier or later stages of cerebellar development have different preferences with regard to their distribution along with the whole mRNA transcripts.Fig. 1Developmentally regulated RNA methylation during mouse cerebellar development. a Numbers of ON or OFF m6A switches between P7, P14, P21, and P60 cerebella pairwise comparisons.

<SENT sid="76062" pm="."><plain>The genes with different types of switches appeared to possess different functions. For example, the genes containing P7–P14 OFF switches were mostly annotated to biological processes such as cell cycle, cell division, and DNA repair (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76064" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the newly occurring methylation at P14, P21, and P60 represented by the ON switches was detected in many genes involved in signal transduction, cell adhesion, learning, and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76065" pm="."><plain>Together, these data confirm that extensive RNA methylation and demethylation occur over the course of neuronal differentiation in vivo, in both proliferating and fully differentiated neural cells. Moreover, the distinct functions of genes containing m6A OFF or ON switches suggest that m6A is a prerequisite for those genes to exert their functions at each developmental stage. </sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><text><SENT sid="76067" pm="."><plain>Temporal-specific m6A methylation acts in concert with cerebellar developmental control </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="76068" pm="."><plain>As m6A is developmentally regulated in mouse cerebella, we next analyzed the methylation profiles over the four postnatal stages. We found 8367 continuously methylated RNAs (CMRs) throughout cerebellar development, together with 634, 260, 315, and 512 specifically methylated RNAs (SMRs) at P7, P14, P21, and P60, respectively (Fig. 2a, b and Additional file 1: Figure S2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76070" pm="."><plain>We then investigated whether the SMRs and CMRs possessed different features in their methylation during postnatal cerebellar development. Compared with the SMRs, the CMRs exhibited higher levels of both methylation and expression throughout the developmental process. Moreover, the methylation levels of SMRs displayed a gradual reduction from P7 to P60, while their expression levels changed in the opposite direction (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1: Figure S2b–c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76073" pm="."><plain>Given the different distribution between ON and OFF switches (Fig. 1c and Additional file 1: Figure S1h), we further analyzed the distribution of m6A peaks in continuously and temporal-specifically methylated mRNAs. In the mouse cerebellum of P7, the temporal-specific m6A peaks were significantly enriched at stop codon regions, while the P60-specific m6A peaks were mostly enriched in start codon regions. The P14- or P21-specific m6A peaks displayed an apparent transition from stop codon to start codon during progression of cerebellar development (Fig. 2d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76076" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we quantified the numbers of temporal-specific m6A peaks located in the five regions of mRNA transcripts. From P7 to P60, we observed a sharp increase in the numbers of temporal-specific m6A peaks in start codon regions, as well as a decrease in the CDS and stop codon regions (Additional file 1: Figure S2d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76078" pm="."><plain>To ensure that these changes were real rather than artifacts, we randomly extracted the same numbers of CMR peaks as those of temporal-specific peaks and repeated the distribution analysis. Unlike the temporal-specific peaks shown in Fig. 2d, these CMR peaks displayed similar distribution patterns from P7 to P60 (Additional file 1: Figure S2e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76080" pm="."><plain>The majority of cells in the cerebellum of P7 are proliferating and immature, while the cells in the cerebellum at P60 are fully differentiated. To confirm that such a dynamic distribution pattern was related to the cell states, we compared the RNA methylation profiles in mouse cerebellum at P7 and P60 directly using the peaks identified by exomePeak. Although the proportion of m6A peaks located in CDS were similar between the two stages, we observed a higher percentage of P7-specific m6A peaks near stop codon regions, but a higher percentage of P60-specific m6A peaks in start codon regions (Additional file 1: Figure S2f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76083" pm="."><plain>These data show that for those temporal-specifically methylated RNAs, the patterns of m6A deposition onto RNA exhibit significant changes along with the progression of cerebellar development.Fig. 2Distinct features of temporal-specific m6A methylation during postnatal development of the mouse cerebellum. a Venn diagram showing the numbers and relationship of methylated poly(A) RNAs in the mouse cerebellum from P7 to P60. b IGV plots showing examples of continuous and temporally specific methylation.

In line with the progression of cerebellar development, the four groups of genes containing temporal-specific m6A marks were annotated to different biological processes (Fig. 2e and Additional file 3: Table S5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76086" pm="."><plain>Genes with P7-specific methylation (such as Aspm in Fig. 2b) were enriched in processes such as cell cycle, cell division, and DNA damage response, which are prerequisites in proliferating neural cells. In contrast, many genes displaying P60-specific methylation (such as Glra1 in Fig. 2b) were annotated to biological processes including transport, oxidation-reduction process, and metabolic processes, which are required for mature neuronal activities.

Temporal-specific methylation differs from continuous methylation in its methylation level, biological functions, and dynamic distribution of m6A marks. Furthermore, we uncovered that abnormal expression of m6A methyltransferases (METTL3) and demethylases (ALKBH5) caused imbalanced RNA methylation, which further led to defective cerebellar development.

<SENT sid="76177" pm="."><plain>Given the role of m6A in fate determination of embryonic stem cells and mammalian cortical neurogenesis [16, 17, 31, 45], we hypothesized that m6A also participates in neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation in the mouse cerebellum. In this study, we show that a considerable number of RNAs in the mouse cerebellum exhibit developmentally regulated methylation. GO analysis implied that numerous genes regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, or metabolism acquire m6A marks in a temporal-specific manner, among which the expression of 839 RNAs was under tight regulation by their methylation status. Notably, we found that the number of differentially methylated RNAs is much higher than that of differentially expressed RNAs as observed during cerebellar development and in Alkbh5 KO mice. We speculate that this is probably due to the additional functions of RNA methylation in RNA splicing, nuclear export, and protein translation [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76182" pm="."><plain>For example, although the hypermethylated RNAs presented in Fig. 6e did not change in their expression levels, their nuclear export was enhanced by Alkbh5 deficiency. Since it is the transcripts in the cytoplasmic pool that are utilized for RNA translation to protein and RNA degradation, appropriate m6A levels are necessary for maintaining RNA nuclear export in a balanced state. These results imply that the selective m6A marks, through their various modulatory effects on RNA processing, function as epitranscriptomic switches that either activate or suppress a series of physiological events during mouse cerebellar development. In line with our findings in the mouse cerebellum, dynamic changes in m6A RNA methylation were also observed during postnatal liver development in pig [46] and mouse spermatogenesis [22]. <p id="Par44"><text><SENT sid="76186" pm="."><plain>The dynamic RNA methylation levels in the developing cerebellum reveal how important it is to maintain the balance of RNA methylation in the developing mouse cerebellum, which is accomplished by both the m6A methyltransferases and demethylases. The morphological changes observed upon transient knockdown or overexpression confirm that METTL3 is involved in regulating cerebellar development. In addition to methyltransferase, RNA m6A demethylase is another important factor to maintain RNA methylation at appropriate levels. The important role of FTO in the mouse cerebellum was shown in a previous report using a Fto-knockout mouse model, which is characterized by a cerebellum that is significantly smaller than that in WT litter mates [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76190" pm="."><plain>ALKBH5, another demethylase identified earlier, regulates spermatogenesis [20] and maintains tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem-like cells [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76191" pm="."><plain>However, its function in the brain remains unclear. Here we only observed defects in cerebellar development in Alkbh5-deficienct mice upon exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. It is likely that ALKBH5, FTO, and probably other undefined demethylases overlap in their demethylation activity and can partially substitute for each other’s functions under normal conditions [37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76194" pm="."><plain>On the other side, our results also reveal the distinct functions between ALKBH5 and FTO. In line with a previous report [9], we provide in vivo evidence that ALKBH5 regulates the nuclear export of the hypermethylated RNAs, while FTO regulates RNA splicing in a methylation-dependent manner [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76196" pm="."><plain>In this study, we observed increased cell proliferation in the Alkbh5-deficienct mouse cerebellum exposed to hypobaric hypoxia. In contrast, Fto deficiency in adult mouse hippocampus led to reduced cell proliferation in adult neural stem cells [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76198" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in these results confirmed that RNA methylation constitutes a complex process and suggests that the regulation and function of m6A methylation in the mouse brain should be investigated in a more precise spatiotemporal-dependent manner. <p id="Par45"><text><SENT sid="76199" pm="."><plain>In the WT mouse cerebellum at P7, the m6A modification selectively marked a group of RNAs responsible for cell cycle control and cell division. In Alkbh5 KO mice exposed to hypobaric hypoxia, we detected many of these types of RNAs with aberrant methylation, which may further disturb RNA metabolism, such as RNA splicing, nuclear export, RNA decay, or translation. In agreement with these findings, we observed an increase in the numbers of mitotic cells in the cerebellum of Alkbh5 KO mice upon exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. Mechanistically, we showed the hypermethylation and enhanced nuclear export of Mphosph9, which encodes a centrosomal protein related to cell division and cell cycle control [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76203" pm="."><plain>Therefore, abnormal RNA methylation is likely one of the reasons resulting in dysregulated cell proliferation and cell cycle progression observed in the Alkbh5-deficient cerebellum.

<SENT sid="76205" pm="."><plain>In another study, deletion of Mettl14 in embryonic mouse brain also led to prolonged cell cycle of cortical neural progenitors [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76206" pm="."><plain>Together, these phenotypes provide strong evidence that balanced m6A levels are essential for cell cycle control. Moreover, we found that a higher number of RNAs were hypermethylated in Alkbh5-deficient cerebella of P7, which were originally methylated only in fully differentiated, mature neural cells in WT cerebellum. Such untimely and aberrant methylation finally appears to result in premature differentiation and aberrant neurogenesis in the cerebellum. This may explain the phenotypes of lower numbers of mature granule neurons in IGLs, together with disorganized Purkinje cells, and astrocytes. Generally, cell fate determination requires a burst of expression of a distinct group of genes at each specified stage, which is spatially and temporally regulated throughout the whole developmental process. Our results show that the positive or negative regulation of m6A marks on these cell fate-determining genes is important to drive the proper progression of postnatal cerebellar development. <p id="Par46"><text><SENT sid="76212" pm="."><plain>Different from previous in vitro analysis showing that m6A marks are predominantly located near stop codons and 3′ UTRs, previous in vivo methylation analysis of mouse cerebellum and cerebral cortex identified the m6A marks in start codon regions as well as stop codons and 3′ UTRs [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76213" pm="."><plain>Here, we identified similar patterns of m6A distribution throughout the process of postnatal cerebellar development. Importantly, we observed a significant change in the distribution of temporal-specific m6A marks from P7 to P60. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76215" pm="."><plain>We deduce that the distribution patterns of temporal-specific m6A peaks possibly reflect the difference in methylation sites between proliferating, immature and fully differentiated, mature neural cells. In the mouse cerebellum of P7, during which the majority of neural cells are actively proliferating, the temporal-specific m6A peaks were enriched in CDS, stop codons, and 3′ UTRs, which was similar to the results obtained from the m6A-seq analysis performed using cell lines [2, 3, 48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76217" pm="."><plain>In contrast, distribution of temporal-specific m6A peaks in start codon regions was most significant in mouse cerebellum at P60, which mainly consists of well-differentiated and mature neural cells. In support of our findings, m6A marks in start codon regions were also observed in the fully differentiated tissues from mouse cerebral cortex [36] (unpublished data), A. thaliana [49], rice [50], liver [46], and muscles [51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="76219" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these data imply that the methylation in start codon regions occurs not only in mature neural cells of the mouse cerebellum, but also in many other types of fully differentiated cells in diverse organisms. We thus propose that the position of m6A marks included in the transcript may be an important factor that determines the functions mediated by m6A. Further investigation will be necessary to clarify the precise roles of m6A in different physiological processes. However, the m6A-IP-seq used in this study was unable to identify the exact position of the m6A marks. We cannot rule out the possibility that the m6A marks located in 5′ UTR may be misclassified into start codon regions for those poly(A) RNAs with a very short 5′ UTR. Thereby, single nucleotide-resolution m6A analysis [48, 52] should be utilized next to identify the exact positions of m6A marks, which will further enable exploration of the functions and regulatory mechanism of m6A deposited in different regions of the transcripts. In addition, the different patterns of m6A observed between cell lines and tissues indicates the complexity of in vivo temporal regulation of RNA methylation, suggesting the necessity to characterize RNA methylation in a context-dependent manner. <p id="Par47"><text><SENT sid="76226" pm="."><plain>Gene regulation in the brain is characterized by its considerable cellular heterogeneity, including gene expression [53], DNA hydroxymethylation [34], and m6A RNA methylation [36]. </plain></SENT>

We also provide the first in vivo evidence that ALKBH5-induced abnormal RNA methylation affects RNA nuclear export. Further studies will be necessary to uncover the detailed molecular mechanism of the regulation and biological functions of m6A during mouse cerebellar development. In addition, characterization of the role of m6A in the cerebellum will offer a new viewpoint to elucidate the mechanism of related neurological diseases. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec id="Sec9"><title><text><SENT sid="76237" pm="."><plain>Methods </plain></SENT>
