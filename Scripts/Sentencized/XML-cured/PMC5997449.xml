</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78020" pm="."><plain>Multicellular development relies on the formation of cell-type-specific gene expression programmes that support differentiation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78021" pm="."><plain>At the most basic level, these expression programmes are defined by cell signaling pathways that control how transcription factors bind DNA sequences in gene regulatory elements and shape RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII)-based transcription from the core gene promoter (reviewed in [Spitz and Furlong, 2012]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78022" pm="."><plain>In eukaryotes, the activity of RNAPolII is also regulated by a large multi-subunit complex, Mediator, which can directly interact with transcription factors at gene regulatory elements and with RNAPolII at the gene promoter to modulate transcriptional activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78023" pm="."><plain>The Mediator complex functions through regulating pre-initiation complex formation and controlling how RNAPolII initiates, pauses, and elongates. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78024" pm="."><plain>Therefore, Mediator is central to achieving appropriate transcription from gene promoters (reviewed in [Allen and Taatjes, 2015; Malik and Roeder, 2010]). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78025" pm="."><plain>In mammalian genomes, CpG dinucleotides are pervasively methylated and this epigenetically maintained DNA modification is generally associated with transcriptional inhibition, playing a central role in silencing of repetitive and parasitic DNA elements (Klose and Bird, 2006; Schübeler, 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78026" pm="."><plain>Most gene promoters, however, are embedded in short elements with elevated CpG dinucleotide content, called CpG islands, which remain free of DNA methylation (Bird et al., 1985; Illingworth and Bird, 2009; Larsen et al., 1992). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78027" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, mammalian cells have evolved a DNA-binding domain, called a ZF-CxxC domain, which can recognize CpG dinucleotides when they are non-methylated (Lee et al., 2001; Voo et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78028" pm="."><plain>This endows ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins with the capacity to recognize and bind CpG islands throughout the genome (Blackledge et al., 2010; Thomson et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78029" pm="."><plain>There are 12 mammalian proteins encoding a ZF-CxxC domain, most of which are found in large chromatin modifying complexes that post-translationally modify histone proteins to regulate gene expression from CpG islands (Long et al., 2013a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78030" pm="."><plain>This has led to the proposal that CpG islands may function through chromatin modification to affect transcription (Blackledge et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78031" pm="."><plain>One of the first characterised ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins was lysine-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A) (Blackledge et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78032" pm="."><plain>KDM2A is a JmjC-domain-containing histone lysine demethylase that removes histone H3 lysine 36 mono- and di- methylation (H3K36me1/2) from CpG islands (Blackledge et al., 2010; Tsukada et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78033" pm="."><plain>Like DNA methylation, H3K36me1/me2 is found throughout the genome and is thought to be repressive to gene transcription (Carrozza et al., 2005; Keogh et al., 2005; Peters et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78034" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was proposed that KDM2A counteracts H3K36me2-dependent transcriptional inhibition at CpG island-associated gene promoters (Blackledge et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78035" pm="."><plain>Sequence-based homology searches revealed that KDM2A has two paralogues in vertebrates, KDM2B and FBXL19 (Katoh and Katoh, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78036" pm="."><plain>KDM2B, like KDM2A, binds to CpG islands and can function as a histone demethylase for H3K36me1/2 via its JmjC domain (Farcas et al., 2012; He et al., 2008). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78037" pm="."><plain>However, unlike KDM2A, it physically associates with the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to control how transcriptionally repressive polycomb chromatin domains form at a subset of CpG island-associated genes (Blackledge et al., 2014; Farcas et al., 2012; He et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78038" pm="."><plain>These observations have suggested that, despite extensive similarity between KDM2A and KDM2B and some functional redundancy in histone demethylation, individual KDM2 paralogues have evolved unique functions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78039" pm="."><plain>FBXL19 remains the least well characterized and most divergent of the KDM2 paralogues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78040" pm="."><plain>Unlike KDM2A and KDM2B, it lacks a JmjC domain and, therefore, does not have demethylase activity (Long et al., 2013a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78041" pm="."><plain>Previous work on FBXL19 has suggested that it plays a role in a variety of cytoplasmic processes that affect cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, TGFβ signalling, and regulation of the innate immune response (Dong et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78042" pm="."><plain>More recently, it has also been proposed to have a nuclear function as a CpG island-binding protein (Lee et al., 2017), but its role in the nucleus still remains poorly defined. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78043" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigate the function of FBXL19 in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and show that it is predominantly found in the nucleus where it localizes in a ZF-CxxC-dependent manner to CpG island promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78044" pm="."><plain>Biochemical purification of FBXL19 revealed an association with the CDK-containing Mediator complex and we discover that FBXL19 can target CDK-Mediator to chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78045" pm="."><plain>Conditional removal of the CpG island-binding domain of FBXL19 in ES cells leads to a reduction in the occupancy of CDK8 at CpG islands associated with inactive developmental genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78046" pm="."><plain>FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator appear to play an important role in priming genes for future expression, as these genes are not appropriately activated during ES cell differentiation when the CpG island-binding capacity of FBXL19 is abolished or CDK-Mediator is disrupted. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78047" pm="."><plain>Consistent with an important role for FBXL19 in supporting normal developmental gene expression, removal of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 leads to perturbed development and embryonic lethality in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78048" pm="."><plain>Together, our findings uncover an interesting new mechanism by which CDK-Mediator is recruited to gene promoters in ES cells and demonstrate a requirement for FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator in priming developmental gene expression during cell lineage commitment. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78051" pm="."><plain>FBXL19 shares extensive sequence similarity and domain architecture with the other KDM2 paralogues which are predominantly nuclear proteins (Figure 1A, [Blackledge et al., 2010; Farcas et al., 2012]), yet the function of FBXL19 has largely been described in the context of cytoplasmic processes (Dong et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78052" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we first examined the subcellular distribution of FBXL19 to understand whether it was unique amongst KDM2 paralogues in localizing to the cytoplasm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78053" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, we generated a mouse ES cell line expressing epitope-tagged FBXL19 (FS2-FBXL19) and carried out immuno-fluorescent staining. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78054" pm="."><plain>This revealed that FBXL19 was almost exclusively nuclear (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78055" pm="."><plain>When we carried out subcellular biochemical fractionation, FBXL19 was also enriched in the nuclear fractions in agreement with the immuno-fluorescent staining (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78056" pm="."><plain>Importantly, FBXL19 was found not only in the soluble nuclear extract but also in the insoluble nuclear pellet, which contains chromatin-bound factors (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78057" pm="."><plain>This suggested that FBXL19 may associate with chromatin, like other ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78091" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the association of FBXL19 with CpG islands is dependent on this domain, we generated ES cell lines expressing either a mutant version of FBXL19, in which a key lysine residue was substituted to alanine (K49A, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) to disrupt the recognition of non-methylated CpGs, or a truncated version of FBXL19, where the ZF-CxxC domain was deleted (ΔCXXC) (Figure 1G). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78100" pm="."><plain>To investigate this, we affinity-purified epitope-tagged FBXL19 from ES cell nuclear extract and identified associated proteins by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, and Figure 2—source data 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78101" pm="."><plain>This revealed that FBXL19 interacts with SKP1, a known F-box-binding protein that also associates with KDM2A and KDM2B (Bai et al., 1996; Farcas et al., 2012), and the nuclear proteasome activator PSME3 (Wójcik et al., 1998). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78102" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also identified multiple subunits of the Mediator complex that appeared to interact with FBXL19 in a sub-stoichiometric manner (Figure 2A,B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78103" pm="."><plain>Biochemical purifications of Mediator have identified two distinct assemblies (Liu et al., 2001; Mittler et al., 2001; Taatjes et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78104" pm="."><plain>The first is characterized by the presence of the MED26 subunit which associates with the middle region of Mediator and this form of the complex interacts with RNAPolII (Näär et al., 2002; Paoletti et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2004; Takahashi et al., 2011). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78105" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, a kinase module, composed of CDK8/CDK19, MED12/12L, MED13/13L, and CCNC, can bind to Mediator in a manner which is mutually exclusive with MED26 (Taatjes et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78106" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, our FBXL19 purification identified subunits of the kinase-containing Mediator complex (CDK-Mediator), but not MED26 or RNAPolII (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78107" pm="."><plain>This suggests that FBXL19 interacts preferentially with CDK-Mediator, however, we cannot exclude the possibly it may also interact with MED26-Mediator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78108" pm="."><plain>CDK8 and its paralogue CDK19 share 77% amino acid identity (89% similarity) (Audetat et al., 2017; Galbraith et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2004; Tsutsui et al., 2008) and four out of the five peptides identified by mass spectrometry were common between the two proteins (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78109" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that FBXL19 is able to interact with both CDK8- and CDK19-containing Mediator complexes. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="78361" pm="."><plain>Here, we discover that FBXL19 recognizes CpG islands throughout the genome in a ZF-CxxC-dependent manner (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78362" pm="."><plain>Unlike other ZF-CxxC proteins which associate with chromatin-modifying complexes, we show that FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex (Figure 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78363" pm="."><plain>This uncovers an unexpected link between CpG islands and a complex that regulates gene expression through interfacing with the transcriptional machinery. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78364" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that FBXL19 can recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin (Figure 3) and, via recognition of CpG islands, plays an interesting role in supporting CDK8 occupancy at a subset of promoters associated with developmental genes, which are inactive in ES cells (Figure 4 and Figure 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78365" pm="."><plain>At these CpG islands, FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator function to prime the associated genes for activation during ES cell differentiation (Figure 6 and Figure 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78366" pm="."><plain>Consistent with an important role of FBXL19 in supporting normal developmental gene expression, removal of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 leads to perturbed development and embryonic lethality in mice (Figure 8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78367" pm="."><plain>Together these new discoveries reveal that CpG islands and FBXL19 can interface with CDK-Mediator to orchestrate normal gene expression during lineage commitment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78368" pm="."><plain>Previously, another F-box protein, FBW7, was shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate selector for the MED13/13L subunit of CDK-Mediator and to regulate its stability through proteasomal degradation (Davis et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78369" pm="."><plain>By controlling CDK-Mediator abundance, one could envisage how this might shape Mediator function in gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78370" pm="."><plain>FBXL19 also encodes an F-box domain and associates with SKP1, a central component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78371" pm="."><plain>However, we do not find evidence that FBXL19 regulates CDK-Mediator stability via the proteasome (Figure 2—figure supplement 1H). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78372" pm="."><plain>Instead, we discover that FBXL19 can recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin and, more specifically, to CpG islands via its ZF-CxxC domain to support gene activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78373" pm="."><plain>Although we currently do not know the defined subunits and surfaces in CDK-Mediator that FBXL19 interacts with, our biochemical experiments indicate that this relies on an intact F-box domain in FBXL19 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78374" pm="."><plain>It is tempting to speculate that FBXL19 could interact directly with MED13/13L given their recognition by the related F-box protein, Fbw7 (Davis et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78375" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a key observation in our work is that FBXL19 appears to have functionally diverged from other F-box proteins during vertebrate evolution by acquiring a DNA-binding domain that allows it to recruit proteins to chromatin, instead of targeting them for ubiquitylation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78376" pm="."><plain>This general feature is shared with the FBXL19 paralogue, KDM2B, which associates with and recruits the PRC1 complex to CpG islands (Farcas et al., 2012; He et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78377" pm="."><plain>In agreement with our observations, a large-scale proteomics screen previously suggested that an interaction between FBXL19 and Mediator may also exist in cancer cells (Tan et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78378" pm="."><plain>Given that CDK8 can function as an oncogene (Adler et al., 2012; Firestein et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2008), it will be interesting to understand whether FBXL19 plays a role in targeting CDK-Mediator to CpG islands in non-embryonic tissues, and whether this activity may promote CDK8-driven tumorigenesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78379" pm="."><plain>Individual Mediator subunits have been shown to interact with DNA-binding transcription factors that recruit the Mediator complex to specific DNA sequences in regulatory elements and support gene expression (Black et al., 2006; Blazek et al., 2005; Fondell et al., 1996; Malik and Roeder, 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78380" pm="."><plain>In part, Mediator is thought to achieve this by bridging enhancer elements to the core gene promoter and RNAPolII (Allen and Taatjes, 2015; Jeronimo et al., 2016; Petrenko et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78381" pm="."><plain>However, in mammals these proposed mechanisms are extrapolated from studying only a subset of transcription factors and genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78382" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the defined mechanisms that shape Mediator occupancy on chromatin remain very poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78383" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence for a completely new gene promoter-associated CDK-Mediator targeting mechanism that relies on FBXL19 and CpG island recognition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78384" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, although FBXL19 localizes broadly to CpG islands throughout the genome (Figure 1), we only observed a reliance on FBXL19 for CDK8 binding at a subset of sites (Figure 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78385" pm="."><plain>Similarly, KDM2B binds broadly to CpG islands, yet has a specificity in shaping PRC1 recruitment and polycomb repressive chromatin domain formation at a subset of developmental genes in mouse ES cells (Farcas et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78386" pm="."><plain>We have previously suggested that this could result from ZF-CxxC domain-containing proteins broadly sampling CpG islands, with their activity or affinity for certain sites being shaped by local gene activity or chromatin environment (Klose et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78387" pm="."><plain>In keeping with these general ideas, FBXL19 is required for appropriate CDK8 binding at bivalent genes in ES cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78388" pm="."><plain>In future work, it will be important to understand whether this unique chromatin state and/or the absence of transcriptional activity at these sites define the requirement for FBXL19 in CDK8 recruitment, or whether FBXL19 targeting occurs at most CpG islands sites but is masked through redundancy with transcription factor and gene activity-dependent targeting modalities. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78389" pm="."><plain>Historically, CDK-Mediator has been associated with gene repression (Akoulitchev et al., 2000; Chi et al., 2001; Elmlund et al., 2006; Hengartner et al., 1998; Knuesel et al., 2009; Pavri et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78390" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were not surprised to observe that CDK8 occupied the promoters of repressed developmental genes in ES cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78391" pm="."><plain>While abrogating the CpG island-binding activity of FBXL19 or deletion of MED13/13L resulted in reduced CDK8 binding at these sites, it did not lead to an appreciable effect on gene expression in the ES cell state (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78392" pm="."><plain>This suggests that CDK-Mediator is not required for the repression of these genes in ES cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78393" pm="."><plain>Instead, these genes fail to properly activate during differentiation (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, and Figure 7D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78394" pm="."><plain>These observations are in line with several reports that support the idea that CDK-Mediator is also involved in gene activation (Alarcón et al., 2009; Donner et al., 2007; Hirst et al., 1999; Donner et al., 2010; Galbraith et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78395" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the context of mouse ES cells, we propose that CDK-Mediator may be required to prime silent developmental genes for future gene activation through a mechanism that relies on the recognition of CpG island promoters by FBXL19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78396" pm="."><plain>This priming could contribute to gene activation during differentiation through one of the several mechanisms by which CDK-Mediator has been proposed to affect gene transcription, including regulating RNAPolII pre-initiation complex assembly, polymerase pausing/elongation, or through mediating long range interactions with distal regulatory elements (Allen and Taatjes, 2015; Belakavadi and Fondell, 2010; Donner et al., 2010; Galbraith et al., 2013; Kagey et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78397" pm="."><plain>Clearly, understanding the defined mechanism by which FBXL19-dependent CDK-Mediator recruitment supports normal gene activation during differentiation remains an important question for future work. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78398" pm="."><plain>Our finding that FBXL19 can target CDK8 to gene promoters and that this is required to prime the expression of developmental genes during ES cell differentiation is conceptually reminiscent of recent work in yeast and human systems which suggested that CDK8 is required for appropriate re-induction of inducible genes following an initial activation stimulus (D'Urso et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78399" pm="."><plain>In this study, CDK8 was found to associate with the promoters of inducible genes following initial activation, even in the absence of appreciable ongoing gene transcription, thereby acting as a form of transcriptional memory (D'Urso et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78400" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this requirement for CDK8 in normal gene activation appears shared in the context of our developmental gene induction paradigm. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78401" pm="."><plain>However, we find that, in the case of developmental genes, previous gene activation may not be required for the recruitment of CDK8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78402" pm="."><plain>Instead, this could be achieved by FBXL19 directly recognising and targeting CDK8 to CpG islands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78403" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we prefer to view this as priming as opposed to memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78404" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, collectively these observations point to an important role for CDK-Mediator binding to gene promoters prior to activation and as a way of supporting subsequent gene induction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78405" pm="."><plain>This provides new evidence that the roles of CDK-Mediator in gene regulation are more complicated than simply conveying activation signals to RNAPolII through recruitment by transcription factors and suggests the complex may have evolved to play a unique role in regulating gene expression in stem cells and during development. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78662" pm="."><plain>Summary: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78663" pm="."><plain>The reviewers considered the manuscript to be strong, reporting a thorough characterization of FBXL19, the least-well studied of three proteins that contain a ZF-CxxC domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78664" pm="."><plain>The authors demonstrate that over-expressed FBXL19 accumulates in the nucleus, and that a majority of its genome-wide binding is at sites associated with CpG islands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78665" pm="."><plain>Affinity purification of FS2-tagged FBXL19 indicated a physical association with CDK8-containing Mediator complex, and a TetR-FBXL19 fusion protein was able to recruit CDK8 to a chromosomally-integrated artificial TetO array, suggesting that FBXL19 can recruit CDK8 to chromatin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78666" pm="."><plain>Conditional deletion of the ZF-CxxC domain of FBXL19 led to reduction of CDK8 binding at CpG islands in ES cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78667" pm="."><plain>Many of these sites are associated with silent developmental genes that are no longer activated during ES cell differentiation in the FBXL19 mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78668" pm="."><plain>Finally, deletion of the ZF-CxxC domain was shown to be embryonic lethal in mice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78669" pm="."><plain>Together, these findings suggest that FBXL19 may prime developmental genes for subsequent activation during differentiation, possibly involving recruitment of CDK8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78670" pm="."><plain>Overall, this represents an interesting finding and potentially a novel role for CDK8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78671" pm="."><plain>However, concerns about the degree to which this represents a significant advance over previous FBXL19 studies, some missing controls, and a lack of a direct test of CDK8 requirement for expression of these genes resulted in lessened enthusiasm for this manuscript. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78672" pm="."><plain>The reviewers discussed these concerns and summarized their critiques into the following points. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78673" pm="."><plain>Essential revisions: </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78674" pm="."><plain>1) A key conclusion of the manuscript is that CDK8-Mediator is required for induction of developmental genes regulated by FBXL19, but this is actually not proven in the manuscript. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78675" pm="."><plain>The authors should deplete CDK8 (and/or CDK19, see comment #2 below) and test for the impact on induction of FBXL19-dependent genes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78676" pm="."><plain>2) Throughout the paper, the authors refer to CDK8-Mediator. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78677" pm="."><plain>Given that there are two paralog kinases associated with the Mediator complex, CDK8 and CDK19, the authors should test for the presence of CDK19 and clarify whether the interaction is exclusive to CDK8-containing complexes or not. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78678" pm="?"><plain>In Figure 2A, are the CDK8 peptides identified unique to CDK8 or could they map to CDK19 as well? </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78708" pm="."><plain>The revised manuscript by Dimitrova et al., is an excellent report describing the characterization of FBXL19, a member of the ZF-CxxC domain-containing family of proteins, and its role in recruiting CDK-Mediator to developmental genes in stem cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78709" pm="."><plain>As for other members of this family, the authors show that FBXL19 recognizes unmethylated CpGs in a ZF-CxxC-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78710" pm="."><plain>Unlike the lysine demethylases KDM2A and KDM2B in this protein family, FBXL19 lacks a JMJ-C domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78711" pm="."><plain>Instead, the authors report that FBXL19 interacts with the CDK-Mediator complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78712" pm="."><plain>The authors then embark on an experimental tour-de-force to demonstrate that FBXL19 is required for recruitment of CDK-Mediator to a subset of genes containing CpG islands in ES cells, mostly genes involved in lineage commitment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78713" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, these genes are transcribed at low levels in ES cells when bound by FBXL19 and CDK-Mediator, but their induction is compromised in the absence of FBXL19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78714" pm="."><plain>This indicates that FBXL19-CDK8-Mediator is required to 'prime' these genes in ES cells and their subsequent induction upon differentiation stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78715" pm="."><plain>Finally, the authors demonstrate that FBXL19 depletion is embryonic lethal. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78750" pm="."><plain>We chose to delete both MED13 and MED13L because they are thought to play an interchangeable role in physically linking the CDK subunits to the core Mediator and to be required to form an intact CDK-Mediator complex (Kuesel et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78751" pm="."><plain>To achieve this, we exploited gene targeting to insert loxP sites around essential exons in both MED13 and MED13L. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78752" pm="."><plain>We also engineered these cells to express a tamoxifen inducible form of Cre recombinase allowing inducible deletion of MED13/13L (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78753" pm="."><plain>In new Figure 7, we demonstrate that the addition of tamoxifen leads to complete loss of MED13/13L protein. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78755" pm="."><plain>We then examined FBXL19 target genes after loss of CDK-Mediator binding and found that they are no longer appropriately induced during differentiation (Figure 7D), in keeping with a requirement for CDK-Mediator in FBXL19dependent gene activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78756" pm="."><plain>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this important experiment as it now robustly supports and strengthens our key argument that FBXL19 recruits the CDK-Mediator complex to the CpG islands of inactive developmental genes to prime them for appropriate activation during differentiation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="78821" pm="."><plain>(2) Using conditional genetic ablation, de novo targeting strategies, and genomics, we go on to show that FBLX19 can recruit CDK-Mediator to chromatin and the CpG island promoters of silent developmental genes in ES cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78822" pm="."><plain>(3) In the absence of FBXL19, these genes are no longer appropriately activated upon differentiation, providing an explanation for why normal differentiation cannot be achieved in the absence of FBXL19. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78823" pm="."><plain>(4) In the revised study, based on the reviewer’s suggestions (point 1), we now demonstrate that FBXL19 target genes also rely on CDKMediator for their activation, validating our biochemistry and genomics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78824" pm="."><plain>(5) Finally, we discover that loss of FBXL19 leads to abnormal development and early embryonic lethality, in agreement with the inability of cells to appropriately regulate gene expression during development. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="78825" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our discoveries are novel in describing a completely new modality by which FBXL19 and CpG islands prime genes for future expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78826" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we provide compelling new evidence that CDKMediator can be recruited to gene promoters independently of classical transcription factors and transcription itself to prime CpG island-associated genes for activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78827" pm="."><plain>These new discoveries force us, and the field, to think differently about how CpG islands integrate and regulate gene expression, while also provide new insight into the poorly understood mechanisms by which CDK-Mediator is targeted to genes and functions to control gene expression. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></disp-quote><p><text><SENT sid="78944" pm="."><plain>One could test whether inducible MED13/13L deletion in the Fbxl19CxxCfl/fl background would not lead to any further effect on gene activation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78945" pm="."><plain>However, this would require a significant amount of time to generate and characterise a new Med13fl/fl, Med13lfl/fl, and Fbxl19CxxCfl/flcell line. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78946" pm="."><plain>While this is an interesting experiment, we believe that the robust and extensive series of observations in Figure 6 and Figure 7 more than adequately support our conclusion that FBXL19 target genes rely on CDK-Mediator for activation during differentiation. </plain></SENT>

</text></p></disp-quote><p><text><SENT sid="78948" pm="."><plain>We have not observed any significant difference between WT and heterozygous mutant embryos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78949" pm="."><plain>It is common to have some stage variations until around 12 dpc, even within embryos of the same litter. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78950" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we often find small differences in size and developmental status among embryos regardless of genotypes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78951" pm="."><plain>Both the WT and heterozygous mutant embryos presented in Figure 8 appear healthy with normal development for this stage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78952" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the defects observed in the homozygous Fbxl19ΔCxxC embryos cannot be explained by such stage variations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><text><SENT sid="78953" pm="."><plain>11) The authors demonstrated that the CXXC-domain mediates the binding of FBXL19 at NMIs, where F-Box mediates its interaction with the CDK-Mediator complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78954" pm="?"><plain>What about CDK8 chromatin binding or gene expression patterns upon F-Box deletion of FBXL19? </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78955" pm="?"><plain>Will the authors see the same results as what they found in CXXC-domain deletion mutant? </plain></SENT>
</text></p></disp-quote><p><text><SENT sid="78956" pm="."><plain>This is an interesting experiment and we hypothesize that disrupting the interaction between CDK-Mediator and FBXL19 via deleting the F-box domain would yield similar results to removing the CxxC domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78957" pm="."><plain>However, as described above in response to reviewer point 2, despite exhaustive efforts we have been unable to generate cell lines stably expressing FBXL19 with a deletion of the F-box, precluding us from addressing this point. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="78958" pm="."><plain>It will be interesting in future work to see if we can engineer a cell line where we are able to remove the F-box in an inducible manner and examine the effects on CDK8 binding and induction of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
