<SENT sid="79003" pm="."><plain>It has broad substrate specificity, recognizing several glycerophospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79004" pm="."><plain>In the presence of lipophilic alcohols, such as N-acetyl-sphingosine (NAS), LPLA2 acts as an acyltransferase, generating O-linked acyl alcohols. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79005" pm="."><plain>If no acceptor other than water is present, LPLA2 acts as a phospholipase and only a lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid are formed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79006" pm="."><plain>LPLA2 is localized to late endosomes and lysosomes and, like other lysosomal hydrolases, has an acidic pH optimum. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79007" pm="."><plain>LPLA2 null mice are characterized by the early development of increased surfactant phospholipid levels and alveolar macrophage foam cells, similar to that observed in drug-induced phospholipidosis (5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79008" pm="."><plain>Other studies have identified a role for LPLA2 in host defense (6, 7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79009" pm="."><plain>The acidic pH is important for the binding of the enzyme to liposomes or membranes and is mediated through a distinct membrane binding domain (8, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79010" pm="."><plain>This binding domain may be the basis by which LPLA2 mediates amiodarone-associated phospholipidosis (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79011" pm="."><plain>However, the enzyme is active against water-soluble truncated oxidized phospholipids at neutral pH (11), suggesting that some substrates may directly access the catalytic domain, and that there may be a biological role for secreted LPLA2 (12). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79012" pm="."><plain>In an earlier study, the specificities of LPLA2 toward sn-1 versus sn-2 fatty acyl groups were evaluated by separating and identifying distinct species of 1-O-acyl-ceramides formed as the product of its lipase and transacylase reactions (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79013" pm="."><plain>We reported that both sn-1 and sn-2 fatty acyl groups of phosphatidylcholine were subject to hydrolysis depending on the fatty acyl species present, with preference for unsaturated acyl chains, which are typically found at the sn-2 position of phospholipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79014" pm="."><plain>However, at the time of that study, the structure of LPLA2 had not yet been discovered and thus, the molecular basis for fatty acid selectivity was unknown. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79015" pm="."><plain>Recently, our groups reported the structure of LPLA2 and LCAT, a structurally related phospholipase A2 with transacylase activity (9, 14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79016" pm="."><plain>The crystal structure confirmed that the catalytic core of LPLA2 is an α/β hydrolase domain but with distinct membrane binding and “cap” domains (Fig. 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79017" pm="."><plain>The catalytic triad and adjacent oxyanion hole are found at the base of a largely hydrophobic bowl that is at least partially shielded from solvent by a loop that extends from the cap domain, and is the binding site for glycerophospholipids and lipophilic alcohols (Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79018" pm="."><plain>Both the lipase and acyltransferase reactions of LPLA2 proceed sequentially with the transient acylation of the catalytic serine by the scissile fatty acyl group. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79026" pm="."><plain>We further proposed that the observed acyl chain length preference of LPLA2 is determined by two hydrophobic grooves, termed the A and B tracks, leading away from the catalytic triad of the enzyme, with the A track likely to be that occupied by the scissile acyl chain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79027" pm="."><plain>Asp13 is a conspicuous residue located next to the oxyanion hole and contributes to the A track in a position typically conserved as hydrophobic residue (M/V/L) in type I lipases (16–18). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="79342" pm="."><plain>When the unsaturated acyl chain is in the sn-2 position, D13F variant enhances selectivity for transfer of the unsaturated chain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79343" pm="."><plain>Conversely, D13F is less selective than WT for unsaturated acyl chains when they are in the sn-1 position (Figs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79344" pm="."><plain>4, 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79345" pm="."><plain>Although modeling indicates that phospholipids can dock with either acyl chain in track A, the molecular basis for the opposing effects of D13F on selectivity for unsaturated acyl chains is unclear. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79346" pm="."><plain>Our data shows that the identity of residue 13 does not seem to influence selectivity for acyl acceptors or the phospholipid head group. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79347" pm="."><plain>The former result is somewhat surprising given its proximity to the acyl transfer site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79348" pm="."><plain>The head group of the glycerophospholipid, on the other hand, docks relatively far away from Asp13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79349" pm="."><plain>Electrostatic repulsion between the phosphate group common to all phospholipids and deprotonated Asp13 may, however, also contribute to its lower activity at high pH. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="79350" pm="."><plain>The closely related enzyme LCAT has a cysteine instead of aspartate in the analogous position (Cys31). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79351" pm="."><plain>This is the most prominent difference between LCAT and LPLA2 in the active site other than the dynamic lid that partially covers the hydrophobic bowl of the active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79352" pm="."><plain>However, neither the D13C substitution nor the D13C substitution along with other conservative changes in the active site (ToLCC) were as adept as D13F in recovering acyltransferase activity at neutral pH where LCAT is the most active (although D13C did have low measurable activity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79353" pm="."><plain>D13C and ToLCC were also unable to demonstrate activity against a cholesterol-like substrate in a synthetic HDL-based activity assay. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79354" pm="."><plain>These results, along with a lack of obvious effects on acyl acceptor identity with the D13F variant (Fig. 7), indicate that acyl acceptor preference may be most strongly dictated by the dynamic lid element in the LCAT/LPLA2 family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79355" pm="."><plain>Conversely, their selectivity for glycerophospholipid substrates is strongly dictated by interactions by features within the active site cavity, including track A and the identity of the residue at position 31/13, respectively, with the acyl chains. </plain></SENT>
