</text></title><p id="Par20"><text><SENT sid="79545" pm="."><plain>Several heart failure (HF) patients have limited physical activity due to early fatigue and dyspnea, which have been associated with low oxygen uptake and inspiratory muscle dysfunction, suggesting that physical deconditioning and respiratory muscle weakness might be underlying attenuated increased ventilation during hyperpnoea [1]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par21"><text><SENT sid="79546" pm="."><plain>Over the last years, a reduced performance capacity has been associated with some additional factors that might be connected to the limited exercise response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79547" pm="."><plain>Some studies have focused on the role of maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and inspiratory muscle endurance, which have been associated to low quality of life (QoL) and worse clinical prognosis [2–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79548" pm="."><plain>In a randomized placebo-controlled trial with HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW), inspiratory muscle training markedly improved inspiratory muscle strength and endurance, incrementing submaximal and maximal functional capacity as well as QoL. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79549" pm="."><plain>In addition, heart rate variability (HRV) is also decreased by cardiovascular diseases and might result either from a direct central up-regulation of cardiovagal activity, or as a secondary effect of baroreceptor activation, or changes in respiration [5]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par22"><text><SENT sid="79550" pm="."><plain>However, respiration has not been emphasized, despite evidence that breathing characteristics (rate and amplitude) markedly affect beat-to-beat cardiovascular variability [6–8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79551" pm="."><plain>Within this context, yoga breathing might combine abdominal, thoracic, and clavicular breathing phases in order to maximize breathing volume and therefore increase oxygen uptake. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79552" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that very and moderately slow yoga breathing creates a significant change in HRV frequency bands along and after exercise in healthy men and women [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79553" pm="."><plain>Recently, a study reported the comparative effectiveness of several forms of lifestyle modifications and found smoking cessation and yoga to be the most effective forms of cardiovascular disease prevention [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79554" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, yoga techniques without breathing control have shown to improve oxygen uptake in patients showing HF, especially HFrEF [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79555" pm="."><plain>However, even considering that almost half of HF patients show heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF), few studies have been performed with such patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79556" pm="."><plain>It has been recently demonstrated that HFpEF induces significant molecular, mitochondrial, histological, and functional alterations in the diaphragm and soleus, which were attenuated by exercise training [13]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par23"><text><SENT sid="79557" pm="."><plain>With respect to cardiovascular disease and aging, several authors have shown a significant reduction of HR variability in the frequency ranges associated with breathing by using spectral analysis of HR and respiration [14, 15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79558" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present randomized clinical trial will be conducted primarily in order to test the hypothesis that an 8-week program of yoga and specific breathing techniques with various respiratory rhythms might be associated with improved inspiratory muscle responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79559" pm="."><plain>Secondly, changes in functional capacity, oxygen uptake efficiency slope, circulatory power, oscillatory ventilation, oxygen uptake kinetics in the recovery period, distinct features of the autonomic nervous system, natriuretic peptides, echocardiographic measurements, and QoL will be assessed in HFpEF patients, both with and without IMW. </plain></SENT>
