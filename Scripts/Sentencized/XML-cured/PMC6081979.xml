Previous efforts include the analysis and comparison of about 2,200 Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) flavoring substances (discrete chemical entities only) with compound databases relevant in drug discovery and natural product research e.g., drugs approved for clinical use, compounds in the ZINC database, and natural products from different sources ( Burdock &amp; Carabin, 2004; González-Medina et al., 2016; González-Medina et al., 2017; Martinez-Mayorga et al., 2013; Medina-Franco et al., 2012; Peña-Castillo et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>

Widely characterized compound databases such as GRAS, approved drugs and screening compounds used in drug discovery projects were employed as references. We used well-established and novel (but validated) chemoinformatic methods to analyze compound collections. Although most of these approaches are commonly used in drug discovery, this and previous works show they can be readily applied for food chemicals ( Peña-Castillo et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>

As expected, due to the large structural diversity, distribution of PCP in FooDB is broad, in many cases overcoming even approved drugs. For most properties, except RB, several compounds in FooDB share the properties of drugs, and drug-like natural products in ZINC. The comparable physicochemical properties between compounds from FooDB and DrugBank encourages additional systematic investigations for bioactivity of food components. Of course, during this search one needs to consider that compounds with similar properties may have different activity profile. In turn, GRAS consists mostly of small-sized compounds.

The four criteria were analyzed in an integrated manner through a Consensus Diversity Plot generated as described in the Global diversity section of the Methods. The Consensus Diversity Plot in Figure 4 shows that FooDB has about average diversity both by fingerprints and relatively low diversity by scaffolds. Although PCP (represented with the color of the data points) are extremely diverse, structural motifs seem to reappear with slight variations. Figure 4 shows the overall large fingerprint and scaffold diversity of approved drugs (e.g., data points towards the lower left region of the plot). </plain></SENT>

To date, it is the most informative public resource of food compounds. Visual representation of the chemical space revealed that FooDB largely contains and upgrades structural information from GRAS. Indeed, most of GRAS is contained in FooDB. Compounds in FooDB have a large diversity of physicochemical properties. The distributions of most physicochemical properties of FooDB compounds overlap with those of approved drugs and natural products in ZINC. GRAS mostly contains small-sized compounds. The global diversity indicates that FooDB has a large structural diversity as measured by molecular fingerprints, though it has relatively low scaffold diversity. One third of the compounds in FooDB are acyclic. The most frequent cyclic scaffolds are monocyclic. Of note, polyphenols represent a large fraction of FooDB. The list of 3,228 polyphenolic compounds identified in this work to enhance the on-going polyphenol-protein interactome studies. Analysis of the chemical complexity revealed that compounds in FooDB are more complex than approved drugs and natural products and have complexity comparable to GRAS compounds. A next step of this work is to compare the chemical space of FooDB with that of natural products from different sources, e.g., plants, terrestrial, cyanobacteria. A second suggested future study is to perform the virtual screening of FooDB across a range of targets, for instance, the increasingly important epigenetic targets ( Naveja &amp; Medina-Franco, 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79904" pm="."><plain>Virtual screening can be done using multiple methods, for instance, using similarity searching. In this case one needs to consider, however, the potential presence of activity cliffs i.e., compounds with similar structure but different activity ( Stumpfe et al., 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79906" pm="."><plain>The goal of such study would be to identify systematically dietary components that may be participating in epigenetic regulatory processes ( Martinez-Mayorga et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="79907" pm="."><plain>These efforts are ongoing in our group and will be reported in due course. Other perspective of this work is integrating the knowledge of FooDB with other large databases with the aim of identifying food-disease associations and food-drug interactions such as the works previously published by Jensen et al. ( Jensen et al., 2014; Jensen et al., 2015). </sec></SecTag><sec><title><text><SENT sid="79909" pm="."><plain>Data availability <p><text><SENT sid="79910" pm="."><plain>The data referenced by this article are under copyright with the following copyright statement: Copyright: © 2018 Naveja JJ et al. <p><text><SENT sid="79911" pm="."><plain>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public domain dedication). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"/> <p><text><SENT sid="79912" pm="."><plain>Dataset 1: (Schneidermatch.sdf).

The authors could include the dataset from Phenol-explorer in a consensus diversity plot (like Figure 4) to clearly represent their reults.   <p><text><SENT sid="79986" pm="."><plain>I have read this submission.
