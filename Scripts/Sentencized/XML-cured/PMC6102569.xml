<SENT sid="80046" pm="."><plain>In this context, docking allows predicting the preferred pose of a ligand inside a receptor binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80047" pm="."><plain>However, the selection of the “best” solution is not a trivial task, despite the widely accepted selection criterion that the best pose corresponds to the best energy score. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80048" pm="."><plain>Here, several rigid-target docking methods were evaluated on the same dataset with respect to their ability to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations, to test if the best energy score is a reliable criterion for selecting the best solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80049" pm="."><plain>For this, two experiments were performed: (A) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in its own crystal structure receptor (defined as self-docking), and (B) to reconstruct the ligand-receptor complex by performing docking of the ligand in a crystal structure receptor that contains other ligand (defined as cross-docking). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80056" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80057" pm="."><plain>Molecular docking is a computational method that predicts the binding orientations of the ligands into a receptor-binding site; in this sense, it is a popular method in medicinal chemistry research [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80058" pm="."><plain>It has become essential for developing different rational drug design protocols including structural-based virtual screening for identifying novel candidates and the understanding of the most important chemical elements that guide ligand-protein interactions in relevant biological targets [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80059" pm="."><plain>The principal issues of docking are the accurate predictions of binding orientations and affinities [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80060" pm="."><plain>For this, docking algorithms explore different ligand poses corresponding to different conformations and orientations within the receptor binding site, and they detect the “best docking solution” among these orientations by using a scoring function which evaluates binding energies [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80061" pm="."><plain>There are many reports which have assessed and compared different docking protocols using different docking programs [5,6,7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80062" pm="."><plain>It is accepted in literature that docking methods can identify right solutions, since they reproduce X-ray crystallographic structures [8,9,10,11,12,13,14], however, the best solution is not always detected as the best ranked scored energy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80063" pm="."><plain>In general, docking predicts the preferred binding orientation of a ligand into a receptor [15,16,17]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80064" pm="."><plain>The simpler case is when the docking of ligand is performed inside its own crystal structure, because the binding site have the optimal size to receive the ligand; we will refer to this process as a ‘self-docking’. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80065" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, docking is named ‘cross-docking’ when ligands are docked into receptor structure that is bound to a different ligand in the crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80066" pm="."><plain>The last practice is more common, since docking is more relevant when it is used as a tool for investigating novel ligands. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80067" pm="."><plain>Previous reports comparing different docking protocols are commonly focused to self-docking tests; although it may highlight the work of Sutherland et al. [6], where cross-docking accuracy was assessed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80068" pm="."><plain>In a recent paper, we warned scientists about the use of docking predicted binding energies to compare the activities of pairs of molecules [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80069" pm="."><plain>The present work is oriented to prevent about the selection of the best scoring energy as the best solution of a more common docking experiment: rigid-target docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80070" pm="."><plain>With this in mind, we used self-docking (to dock ligands into their own crystallographic structure) and cross-docking (to dock ligands in crystallographic structures that are bound to other ligands) to evaluate the ability of docking methods to reproduce crystallographic binding orientations at the top first scoring position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80071" pm="."><plain>Two different docking software packages, Glide [18,19,20] and AutoDock [21], were employed for the tests. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-23-01038"><title><text><SENT sid="80074" pm="."><plain>2.1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80075" pm="."><plain>Self-Docking </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80076" pm="."><plain>It is common in medicinal chemistry literature to use rigid-target docking methods to explore the binding positions of novel synthesized ligands inside a known target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80077" pm="."><plain>In order to carry out these tasks, an X-ray crystallographic structure of the target, which is often in presence of a previously reported ligand, is needed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80078" pm="."><plain>When several crystallographic structures are present, one of them is selected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80079" pm="."><plain>The next task is to demonstrate that the selected protein structure is reliable to accomplish docking experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80080" pm="."><plain>A common test to justify the selection is to try to reproduce the orientation of the ligand that is inside the selected crystallographic structure: self-docking according to our definition in the Materials and Methods section. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80081" pm="."><plain>In our experiment, each ligand from Table 1 was self-docked inside its own binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80082" pm="."><plain>The top 10 poses (according to the scoring function energies) were selected to further structural analysis by calculating the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of each pose against its conformation in the crystal structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80083" pm="."><plain>We used three different RMSD classifications for docking solutions: (a) good solution when RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å [8,22], (b) acceptable solutions when RMSD is between 2.0 and 3.0 Å, and (c) bad solutions when RMSD ≥ 3.0 Å. For one ligand-protein pair, when a pose is classified as a good solution, this means that the scoring function reproduced the crystallographic binding orientation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80085" pm="."><plain>To verify that RMSD classifications were adequate, compounds a1, g2 and b3 (Table 1) were docked in their respective targets (MAO-B, thrombin and B-RAF, respectively). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80086" pm="."><plain>Selected docking solutions are represented in Figure 1 (three of the ten poses are displayed) including good, acceptable and bad solutions according to above mentioned RMSD criteria. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80087" pm="."><plain>It is clear that an RMSD &lt; 2.0 Å corresponds to good docking solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80088" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, docking solutions with RMSD between 2.0 and 3.0 Å deviate from the position of the reference, but they keep the desired orientation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80089" pm="."><plain>Finally, docking solutions with RMSD &gt; 3.0 Å are completely wrong. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80090" pm="."><plain>The self-docking experiments were performed for the 30 different ligands from Table 1 into their own binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80091" pm="."><plain>Each docking was performed in triplicate to have a most representative exploration of the docking solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80092" pm="."><plain>For each protein-ligand complex, the ten better obtained poses according to scoring functions (in Glide HTVS, Glide SP, Glide XP, and AutoDock methods) were analyzed by using the RMSD with respect to the reference complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80093" pm="."><plain>The best solution s2 was defined for each complex (and for each docking method) as the docking solution with RMSD &lt; 2.0 Å at the best scoring position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80094" pm="."><plain>At the same time, the best solution s3 was defined for each complex (and for each docking method) as the docking solution with RMSD &lt; 3.0 Å at the best scoring position. s2 only accounts for good solutions, while s3 accounts for good or acceptable solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80095" pm="."><plain>For each s2 and s3 values, the specific scoring position between 1 and 10 was annotated to construct a plot of the percentage of recurrence of the best solution at each scoring position for the targets MAO-B, thrombin and B-RAF; Figure 2 shows these plots for the used docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80096" pm="."><plain>For a protein-ligand complex, when none of the scoring positions contain a solution that complies with s2 or s3, then it is annotated as a bad solution (BS), which indicates that there are no good poses for this case. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80097" pm="."><plain>Self-docking results in Figure 2 allow the analysis of the recurrence of the best solution in the top first scoring position for different targets by using different docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80098" pm="."><plain>At first, it is clear that none of the docking methods obtained the best solution (under s2 or s3 criteria) at top first scoring position for all the ligands in interaction with the three targets under study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80099" pm="."><plain>This means that it is not completely reliable to select the top first scoring solution in the simplest docking experiment: the self-docking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80100" pm="."><plain>If a rigorous criterion is selected, where the best solution s2 is defined, the best solution in the top 1st scoring position have different recurrences according to the target and selected docking method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80101" pm="."><plain>With regard to this, it is possible to extract some conclusions from the bottom part of the Figure 2:(a)The recurrence of the top first scoring position was higher for B-RAF inhibitors by using all the docking methods.(b)The recurrence of the top first scoring position was higher when the docking methods Glide SP and XP were used.(c)In the self-docking study, Autodock was the worst method to get the best solution at the top first scoring position. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80102" pm="."><plain>If the less rigorous criterion is selected, where the best solution s3 is defined (Figure 2 top), there are no big changes in the analysis; except for the ability of AutoDock for detecting the best solutions at the top first scoring position for B-RAF inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80103" pm="."><plain>This means that AutoDock yielded acceptable solutions for this specific target. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80104" pm="."><plain>Other important point is the recurrence of BSs when self-docking is performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80105" pm="."><plain>When the best solution s2 is defined (Figure 2 bottom), there are many BSs for different combinations of docking method with a specific target. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80106" pm="."><plain>For instance, there were many BSs when Glide XP was applied to study MAO-B inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80107" pm="."><plain>This means that there were many MAO-B X-ray crystallographic structures that give no good solutions when the simplest self-docking was applied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80108" pm="."><plain>It should be recalled that s2 excludes acceptable solutions; therefore, when the best solution s3 is defined for self-docking (Figure 2 top), there are less BSs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80109" pm="."><plain>Several lessons are provided from the self-docking experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80110" pm="."><plain>The reliability on the top first scoring position as the best solution depends on the target under study and the docking method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80111" pm="."><plain>In our study, B-RAF seems to be the more adequate target for self-docking; meanwhile, MAO-B seems to have difficulties during self-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80112" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, Glide SP and XP seem to be the most adequate methods for self-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80113" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, it is no gain when the more precise XP version is used; in fact, SP is better for MAO-B and B-RAF inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80114" pm="."><plain>When the best solution is not found at the top first scoring position, it is possible to find it at the second, third or other position, but, in several cases, there are no good solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80115" pm="."><plain>It is not clear why several crystallographic structures fail during self-docking, and the consequences of that for a cross-docking experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80116" pm="."><plain>However, it sounds logical and prudent not to take a structure for performing cross-docking if we know in advance that it failed when self-docking was done. </plain></SENT>
</text></p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-23-01038"><title><text><SENT sid="80117" pm="."><plain>2.2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80118" pm="."><plain>Cross-Docking </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80119" pm="."><plain>The most common practice in docking experiments is the inclusion of novel ligands inside a binding site occupied by a previous reported molecule: cross-docking according to our definition in Materials and Methods section. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80120" pm="."><plain>To test if cross-docking deteriorates the recurrence of the best solution in the top first scoring position for different targets by using different docking methods, we used the three compounds that yielded the best solutions in the self-docking experiments applied to each target for performing additional cross-docking experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80121" pm="."><plain>The selected compounds were b1, h1, j1 (MAO-B inhibitors), b2, g2, h2 (thrombin inhibitors), b3, f3, and g3 (B-RAF inhibitors). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80122" pm="."><plain>They were cross-docked against the remaining nine receptor crystal structures, and the obtained poses were compared with the conformation and orientation of the compound in the original crystal structure by means of RMSD measures. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80123" pm="."><plain>Each cross-docking was performed in triplicate to have a most representative exploration of the docking solutions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80124" pm="."><plain>For each protein-ligand complex, the ten better obtained poses according to scoring functions (in Glide HTVS, Glide SP, Glide XP and AutoDock methods) were analyzed by using the RMSD with respect to the reference complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80125" pm="."><plain>The best solutions s2 were defined for each complex (and for each docking method) as in previous self-docking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80126" pm="."><plain>Figure 3 shows the ability of the docking methods to find a good solution in cross-docking experiments inside the binding sites of the crystallographic structures of the studied targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80127" pm="."><plain>Dark gray squares represent self-docking, light gray squares represent instances with at least one good solution, and black squares represent instances with only BSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80128" pm="."><plain>The analysis reflects some interesting points: (a)There are compounds that are well oriented in most of the crystal structures, but there are others that are conflictive. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80129" pm="."><plain>For instance, compound h2 had good orientations in almost all the crystallographic structures of thrombin, but b2 and g2 cross-docking experiments failed in most of the instances.(b)The selection of the docking method was crucial in some cases; for instance, h1 had good orientations in almost all the crystallographic structures of MAO-B when AutoDock was used, but almost all cross-docking experiments for this compound failed when Glide HTVS, SP and XP were used. (c)B-RAF was a conflictive target for cross-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80130" pm="."><plain>All its inhibitors were bad oriented in almost all crystallographic structures by using all docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80131" pm="."><plain>Particularly, compound b3 failed in all the instances. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80132" pm="."><plain>The recurrence of the best solution at the first scoring position was also analyzed for cross-docking experiments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80133" pm="."><plain>For this, the specific scoring positions between 1 and 10 (considering s2 and s3 criteria) were annotated to construct a plot of the percentage of recurrence of the best solution at each scoring position for the targets MAO-B, thrombin, and B-RAF; Figure 4 shows these plots for the used docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80134" pm="."><plain>BSs were also annotated for the cases that have no good poses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80135" pm="."><plain>Once again, it is clear that none of the docking methods obtained the best solution during cross-docking experiments (under s2 or s3 criteria) at top first scoring position for all the ligands in interaction with the three targets under study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80136" pm="."><plain>This means that it is not completely reliable to select the top first scoring solution when cross-docking is achieved without an additional analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80137" pm="."><plain>If a rigorous criterion is selected, when the best solution s2 is defined, the best solution at the top 1st scoring position have different recurrences according to the compound, target and selected docking method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80138" pm="."><plain>With regard to this, it is possible to conclude from the bottom part of the Figure 4 that the recurrence of the top first scoring position was higher for a few combinations of compound and docking method. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80139" pm="."><plain>For instance, the MAO-B inhibitors b1 and j1 had around 65% and 80% of recurrences of the top first scoring position when Glide HTVS and AutoDock are used, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80140" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the thrombin inhibitors g2 and h2 had around 50% of recurrences of the top first scoring position when Glide XP and Glide HTVS are used, respectively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80141" pm="."><plain>The remaining cases had small recurrences of the top first scoring position. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80142" pm="."><plain>In general, it is possible to see that cross-docking was characterized by a poor recurrence of the top first scoring position and many BSs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80143" pm="."><plain>It suggests that it is not reliable to select the top first scoring position as the best solution when cross-docking is performed. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80144" pm="."><plain>If the less rigorous criterion is selected, where the best solution s3 is defined (Figure 4 top), there are subtle changes in the analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80145" pm="."><plain>More combinations of compound and docking method yielded the best solution at the top first scoring position; however, it is necessary to remember that this improvement is due to the addition of acceptable cases with no optimal orientation in many cases. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80146" pm="."><plain>Another important point is the recurrence of BSs when cross-docking is performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80147" pm="."><plain>When the best solution s2 is defined (Figure 4 bottom), there are many BSs for different combinations of compounds with docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80148" pm="."><plain>For instance, there were many BSs when all the docking methods were applied to study the three B-RAF inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80149" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a special care should be taken when cross-docking is performed for novel B-RAF inhibitors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80150" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the number of BSs is low for the thrombin inhibitor h2 by using all the docking methods. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80151" pm="."><plain>This suggests that there are compounds more likely to be well oriented inside different conformations of the binding site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80152" pm="."><plain>The inclusion of acceptable solutions (s3 criterion) reduces the number of BSs (Figure 4 top), at the expense of lower quality of the orientations. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80153" pm="."><plain>Several lessons are provided from the cross-docking experiment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80154" pm="."><plain>We observed for self-docking that the reliability on the top first scoring position as the best solution depends on the target under study and the docking method, but further experiments show that it is not possible to rely on the top first scoring when cross-docking is done. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80155" pm="."><plain>Previously, we observed that B-RAF seemed to be the more adequate target for self-docking; but further experiments show that B-RAF is the less adequate target when cross-docking was done. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80156" pm="."><plain>MAO-B had difficulties during self-docking, but it was the target with a better performance during cross-docking. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80157" pm="."><plain>The main reason of the success rate reduction for cross-docking method is that, even though the structures correspond to the same protein (MAO-B, thrombin or B-RAF in our work), the global shape of the binding site varies for different crystal structures of the same protein due to different orientations of the side chains of several residues. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80158" pm="."><plain>To observe the principal differences between different structures of the same protein, the crystallographic MAO-B, thrombin and B-RAF structures were aligned, and the RMSD values for comparison between residues were calculated to study how different are the binding sites (results are represented in the Electronic Supplementary Material, Figures S1–S3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80185" pm="."><plain>However, analysis of the Figure 3 does not give evidence that the differences in MAO-B BSVs caused the failures in cross-docking. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80206" pm="."><plain>Discussion and Recommendations </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80207" pm="."><plain>Here, we must point out that cross-docking is the most common practice in docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80208" pm="."><plain>According to our definition (in the Materials and Methods section), when a crystallographic structure is used to perform docking of a novel ligand (a different one to what is found in the original structure), we have a cross-docking experiment, but the most serious problem is that the novel ligands typically have no reference structure to help in the selection of the best solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80209" pm="."><plain>Therefore, if top first scoring position cannot be relied upon to select the best docking solution, other criteria should be taken into account. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80210" pm="."><plain>In the work of Sutherland et al. assessing cross-docking accuracy [6], the authors found that using the protein structure from the complex that contains the bound ligand most similar to the docked ligand increased docking accuracy for all methods (defined as “similarity selection”). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80211" pm="."><plain>Another interesting point authors found is that there is no relationship between resolution and cross-docking accuracy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80212" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the common practice of choosing structures for docking based on their resolution appears to be unfounded. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80213" pm="."><plain>It is well known that the predictive power of a docking method depends on several factors connected with the docking program used as well as on the studied system; no general rules of thumb exist. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80214" pm="."><plain>Verkhivker et al. [48] distinguished docking hard failures when the crystallographic pose cannot be sampled and soft failures when the crystallographic pose can be sampled but is not the top scoring one. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80215" pm="."><plain>They considered that soft failures in self-docking are mainly due to limits in the scoring functions and scoring schemes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80216" pm="."><plain>According to our experience, an option is the use of previous literature and crystallographic information to define constraints to the solution. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80217" pm="."><plain>These constraints, stated as Essential Chemical Interactions Described for Analogue Ligands (ECIDALs) [49], contain the chemical interactions that seem to be essential after a comprehensive inspection of the crystallographic data available in PDB, considering the target under study or other proteins from the same family. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80218" pm="."><plain>Under this strategy, the best solution of a cross-docking must be selected by considering the most negative scoring energy which complies with ECIDALs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80219" pm="."><plain>It is important to discuss about the rigidity of the binding site in the receptor during cross-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80220" pm="."><plain>The standard cross-docking practice considers that ligands are docked into a rigid receptor, although this assumption could lead to misleading results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80221" pm="."><plain>However, it is known that many proteins undergo side-chain as well as backbone movements, upon ligand binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80222" pm="."><plain>The possibility to consider these movements is the application of flexibility to residues in the binding site of the protein during docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80223" pm="."><plain>This methodology is referred to as induced fit docking and allows the receptor to alter the shape of the active site and BSV due to conformational changes induced by the bound ligand [50]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80224" pm="."><plain>A more realistic description of the complex can be obtained by using this method, but the movement of the residues lead to a very computationally expensive process; therefore, a more reasonable strategy is the selection of a few flexible residues; but after this selection, the consideration of the ECIDALs is also needed to select the best solution. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80229" pm="."><plain>Let us check definitions of self-docking and cross-docking in this work. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80230" pm="."><plain>For a unique target protein A, we selected the crystallographic structure of a protein-ligand complex Aαα deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB), where Aα represents the receptor with the optimal conformation to bound the ligand α in its active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80231" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, α is the ligand contained in this crystallographic structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80232" pm="."><plain>The self-docking is the process of docking α inside Aα (Equation (1)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80233" pm="."><plain>This process should be simpler since Aα binding site have a contoured shaping for perfect fit of α and the residues in the binding site are present in conformations that allow establishing all the chemical interactions without needing large scale movements of their side chains: (1)Aα(Receptor)+ α(Ligand)=Aαα(Complex) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80234" pm="."><plain>When docking methodology is employed to dock the ligand α into the receptor Aα we assume this practice as self-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80235" pm="."><plain>For the same target protein, we can select other crystallographic structure Aββ deposited in PDB, where Aβ represents the same receptor with the optimal conformation to bound the ligand β in its active site. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80236" pm="."><plain>Self-docking can be applied to dock the ligand β into the receptor Aβ. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80237" pm="."><plain>However, when the ligand β is docked into a different crystallographic structure of the same receptor (for instance Aα) we assume this practice as cross-docking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80238" pm="."><plain>The last process is represented in Equation (2):(2)Aα(Receptor)+ β(Ligand)=Aαβ(Complex) </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80239" pm="."><plain>In this process, it is important to consider that Aα binding site does not necessarily have a contoured shaping for perfect fit of β since the residues in its binding site are present in conformations that maybe need large scale movements of their side chains for establishing the optimal chemical interactions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80240" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to highlight that the last process, cross-docking, is the habitual goal in docking experiments, where a ligand have to be docked in a protein which is complexed with a molecule different from the one used for the docking. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80288" pm="."><plain>In general, the docking methods proved to efficiently reproduce crystallographic binding orientations when self-docking was performed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80289" pm="."><plain>However, we found that right predictions of the binding orientations at the top first scoring position depend on the target under study, the ligand, and the software. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80290" pm="."><plain>To approach our experiment to the real docking practice, since users usually dock ligands into receptor crystal structures fitted to a different ligand, we performed cross-docking by exploring three of the studied ligands inside the remaining crystallographic structures. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="80292" pm="."><plain>We found that the success rates in reproducing the known bound conformation of the ligand at the top first scoring position was significantly lower in cross-docking than in self-docking because the binding site of each receptor is fitted to its own ligand. </plain></SENT>
