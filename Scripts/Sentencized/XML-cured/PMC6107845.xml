Human respiratory paramyxoviruses, for example parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), are common causes of respiratory diseases both in infants and a subset of adults. HPIV3 recognizes sialic acid (SA)-containing receptors on host cells. In contrast to human influenza viruses which have a preference for α2,6-linked sialic acid, HPIV3 preferentially recognize α2,3-linked sialic acids. Group B streptococci (GBS) are colonizers in the human respiratory tract. They contain a capsular polysaccharide with terminal sialic acid residues in an α2,3-linkage. In the present study, we report that HPIV3 can recognize the α2,3-linked sialic acids present on GBS. The interaction was evident not only by the binding of virions to GBS in a co-sedimentation assay, but also in the GBS binding to HPIV3-infected cells. While co-infection by GBS and HPIV3 had a delaying effect on the virus replication, it enhanced GBS adherence to virus-infected cells. To show that other human paramyxoviruses are also able to recognize the capsular sialic acid of GBS we demonstrate that GBS attaches in a sialic acid-dependent way to transfected BHK cells expressing the HN protein of mumps virus (MuV) on their surface. Overall, our results reveal a new type of synergism in the co-infection by respiratory pathogens, which is based on the recognition of α2,3-linked sialic acids. This interaction between human paramyxoviruses and GBS enhances the bacterial adherence to airway cells and thus may result in more severe disease. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group><kwd>sialic acids</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein</kwd><kwd>parainfluenza virus</kwd><kwd>mumps virus</kwd><kwd>group B streptococci</kwd><kwd>co-infection</kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001659</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">He1168/15-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">He1168/19-1</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">Va2391/7-1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">China Scholarship Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004543</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">201608080211</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6565"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><text><SENT sid="80905" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80906" pm="."><plain>Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) were first isolated in the late 1950s from children sick with lower respiratory diseases. The virus differed from influenza viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae by a non-segmented genome (Numazaki et al., 1968) and therefore, was assigned to a different virus family, Paramyxoviridae. (Burton, 1964; Cooney et al., 1975), HPIV3 causes acute respiratory infections (ARI) worldwide that are associated with a mortality of nearly 20% in children under 5 years-old (Glezen et al., 1984). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80982" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that the α2,3-linked sialic acids on the capsular polysaccharide of GBS are recognized by several avian influenza viruses but not by human and porcine influenza viruses that have a preference for the α2,6-linkage type (Cundell and Tuomanen, 1994; Strohal et al., 1994; Tong et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80983" pm="."><plain>In contrast to human influenza viruses, HPIV3 utilizes α2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor determinant for binding to and infection of cells (Suzuki et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80984" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we were interested whether this virus is able to interact with encapsulated GBS in a sialic acid-dependent manner. In a co-sedimentation experiment, HPIV3 was incubated for 1 h with either GBS or, as a control, with S. suis. The latter bacterium contains a similar capsular polysaccharide as does GBS, but differs in the terminal sialic acid residue which is attached in an α2,6 rather than in an α2,3-linkage (Charland et al., 1996; Van Calsteren et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80987" pm="."><plain>Bacteria were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation and the supernatants were analyzed for the presence of virus. The infectivity titer was not affected by the presence of S. suis. However, a reduction by about 50% was determined for the sample containing GBS (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80990" pm="."><plain>The amount of virus remaining in the supernatant could not be further decreased by increasing the amount of bacteria (Supplemental Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80991" pm="."><plain>When the presence of virus was analyzed by HA titration, a four-fold reduction was obtained for the sample containing GBS (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80992" pm="."><plain>It is not clear why a substantial amount of virus remained in the supernatant. Possible reasons may be related: (i) to the centrifugation procedure, (ii) to the presence of a viral subpopulation that recognizes the capsular sialic acid only with low affinity, (iii) to the fact that in the case of paramyxoviruses —in contrast to influenza viruses - the sialic acid binding and the neuraminidase activity are located on the same surface protein (HN) which may make it more difficult to control the sialidase activity; or (iv) to a combination of the above reasons. To get direct evidence for the presence of virus in the pellet fraction, the sediment was suspended and subjected to plaque assays. The highest infectivity titer was found in the pellet fraction obtained after co-sedimentation of HPIV3 and GBS (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80996" pm="."><plain>We further analyzed whether bound virus can elute from GBS. The GBS-HPIV3 mixtures were incubated at 37°C, followed by sedimentation of bacteria by low-speed centrifugation. After suspension of the sedimented bacteria, HA titration indicated that a substantial amount of virus had eluted from bacteria after 40 min (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80999" pm="."><plain>The viral neuraminidase activity of the HN protein was sufficient for this effect (green line, indicated as HPIV+GBS), because elution could not be enhanced by addition of exogenous bacterial neuraminidase [orange line, indicated as (HPIV+GBS) + NA]. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="81000" pm="."><plain>HA activity and infectivity of HPIV3 after co-sedimention with GBS or S. suis.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81070" pm="."><plain>Many influenza and paramyxoviruses use sialic acid as a receptor determinant for binding to and initiating infection of target cells. The binding of the respective viral proteins to the sugar alone, N-acetylneuraminic acid, is characterized by a low affinity. The binding to the cell surface receptors occurs with higher affinity because viruses recognize the terminal sialic acid as part of the larger oligosaccharide motif present on glycoproteins or glycolipids. The interaction with viral proteins is dependent not only on the type of sialic acid but also on other factors, e.g., the linkage to the neighboring sugar which most often is galactose (Matrosovich et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81074" pm="."><plain>Influenza viruses are well-known for their differential interaction with sialic acid; thus, avian viruses recognize α2,3-linked sialic acid and human viruses prefer α2,6-linked sialic acid (Rogers and Paulson, 1983; Connor et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81075" pm="."><plain>This binding specificity is not observed on human paramyxoviruses (Moscona and Peluso, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81076" pm="."><plain>Most members of the genera Respirovirus, including HPIV3, and Rubulavirus, including MuV, appear to attach to glycoconjugates containing α2,3-linked sialic acid, though some strains/variants have been reported to recognize α2,6-linked sialic acid (Reyes-Leyva et al., 2007; Kubota et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81077" pm="."><plain>Whereas the recognition of α2,3-linked sialic acid is a common feature of human paramyxoviruses, differences have been reported with respect to the neighboring sugars. The binding affinity may depend on whether the glycan is branched or unbranched, or whether the following sugars are modified by sulfate groups or fucose residues (Amonsen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81079" pm="."><plain>In this way the viruses may interact with a broader or with a narrower spectrum of glycan structures, and therefore they may also differ in the spectrum of target cells. <p><text><SENT sid="81080" pm="."><plain>Because of the considerations mentioned above, it was not possible to predict whether HPIV3 and MuV glycoproteins are able to interact with GBS. The capsular polysaccharide of this microorganism contains a rhamnose residue that is not found in glycoconjugates of vertebrate cells. Glycan arrays used to characterize the binding activity of viral proteins usually do not include glycans with a rhamnose. Our results demonstrate that the rhamnose residue does not affect the conformation of the respective glycan structure in a way that prevents the recognition by either HPIV3 or MuV. In fact, the interaction of the two paramyxoviruses with GBS occurs with the same sialic acid specificity as does the interplay between these viruses and their host cells. Viral-bacterial co-sedimentation or bacterial adherence to HN-expressing cells was observed only with GBS which contains α2,3-linked sialic acid, but not with S. suis which has a similar capsular polysaccharide but differs in the terminal sialic acid which is present in an α2,6-linkage (Van Calsteren et al., 2010). <p><text><SENT sid="81086" pm="."><plain>The binding of the paramyxoviruses to GBS appears to occur with similar affinity as does the interaction with cell surface receptors. This conclusion is based on our finding that GBS is able to inhibit the hemadsorption activity of the MuV-HN protein competitively. Efficient attachment of influenza and paramyxoviruses to the cell surface depends not only on the specific recognition of cellular receptors, but also on the establishment of multiple binding sites. Multivalent interactions between viruses and cells can be achieved because a virion contains hundreds of surface glycoproteins and cells usually expose a large number of sialylated glycan motifs on their surface. In our case, multivalent interactions can also be achieved with GBS because this microorganism contains many α2,3-linked sialic acids in the capsule. <p><text><SENT sid="81091" pm="."><plain>Recently we reported that co-infection of cells by avian influenza viruses and GBS results in a delay of the viral replication (Tong et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81092" pm="."><plain>A similar result was obtained in the present study with HPIV3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81093" pm="."><plain>This negative effect may be due to binding of bacteria to virus infected-cells which may delay the budding process and virus egress. An alternative explanation is that binding of bacteria to virions released from infected cells may impede virus entry into uninfected cells and thus delay the spread of infection. <p><text><SENT sid="81095" pm="."><plain>Whereas viral-bacterial co-infection had a negative effect on the replication of HPIV3, adherence of GBS was greatly enhanced. Several components of GBS have been described to mediate the adherence to host factors (for a review see Wang et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81097" pm="."><plain>Most important for binding to and colonization of epithelial cells appear to be the adhesins BsaB, HvgA, the Alpha C proteins (ACP), the serine-rich repeat (Srr) proteins as well as the pili. We do not know which of these proteins is involved in the adherence of GBS to HEp-2 cells, but our results show that sialic acid-mediated binding to HN proteins exposed on the cell surface is a more efficient way of adherence. Previously, sialic acids of GBS have mainly been associated with immune evasion by interaction with lectins on immune cells which prevents complement activation and counteracts the bactericidal activity of the host cells (Chang et al., 2014; Landwehr-Kenzel and Henneke, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81100" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the capsular sialic acids of GBS enhance the adherence to paramyxovirus-infected cells which is consistent with our recent report that the HA proteins of avian influenza viruses expressed on infected cells enhance the adhesion properties of GBS. As shown with influenza virus-infected cells, enhanced adherence is paralleled by enhanced invasion. GBS is a commensal bacterium that asymptomatically colonizes mucosal surfaces. To cause disease, the microorganism has to invade the host. Therefore, via increased adherence and invasion, co-infection with influenza viruses or paramyxoviruses that recognize α2,3-linked sialic acid may contribute to the severity of disease caused by GBS. It will be interesting in the future, to see how co-infection by GBS and HPIV3 contributes to viral/bacterial replication and pathogenesis in a small animal model. <p><text><SENT sid="81106" pm="."><plain>Mumps virus infections are limited in developed countries because of vaccination programmes. Therefore, information about bacterial co-infections is lacking. However, they may play a role in developing countries. Furthermore, our results show that sialic acid-dependent interactions with GBS are not limited to HPIV3 but can occur also with other viruses, and this type of interaction can also be demonstrated by a different method, i.e., with transfected cells. The latter approach may be interesting for viruses that are difficult to amplify in cell cultures. <p><text><SENT sid="81111" pm="."><plain>Another streptococcal partner for viral bacterial co-infections is S. pneumoniae. This pathogen contains a neuraminidase to release sialic acid from the cell surface and therefore does not contain sialic acid residues in the capsular polysaccharide. In co-infections with influenza viruses, it may also use the viral neuraminidase for desialylation purposes. It will be interesting in the future to compare the strategies of GBS and S. pneumoniae to increase the adherence and invasion, the sialic acid-dependent interaction of GBS and the neuraminidase-based strategy of S. pneumoniae. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="AUTH_CONT"><sec id="s6"><title><text><SENT sid="81115" pm="."><plain>Author contributions </plain></SENT>
