</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="80906" pm="."><plain>Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) were first isolated in the late 1950s from children sick with lower respiratory diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80907" pm="."><plain>The virus differed from influenza viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae by a non-segmented genome (Numazaki et al., 1968) and therefore, was assigned to a different virus family, Paramyxoviridae. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80908" pm="."><plain>(Burton, 1964; Cooney et al., 1975), HPIV3 causes acute respiratory infections (ARI) worldwide that are associated with a mortality of nearly 20% in children under 5 years-old (Glezen et al., 1984). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80909" pm="."><plain>HPIV has become one of the most threatening childhood infectious agents around the world due to insufficient vaccines or treatments (Counihan et al., 2001; Moscona, 2005; Garg et al., 2017). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80910" pm="."><plain>HPIV3 and some other viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae share the common feature of recognizing sialic acid (SA)-containing receptors on host cells (Suzuki et al., 2001, 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80911" pm="."><plain>Two surface glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein and the fusion (F) protein, are involved in the initial steps of viral-cell interactions (Moscona and Peluso, 1992; Porotto et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80912" pm="."><plain>For optimal infection conditions, a balanced interaction between the sialic acid binding activity and the neuraminidase activity of the HN protein is essential (Tappert et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80913" pm="."><plain>HPIV3, the clinically most prevalent HPIV subtype, recognizes α2,3-linked sialic acids in branched and unbranched oligosaccharides present on either glycoproteins or glycolipids (Suzuki et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80914" pm="."><plain>Most efficient binding was observed with a sialylated tetrasaccharide (Amonsen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80915" pm="."><plain>Mumps virus (MuV), another paramyxovirus, has recently been reported to use a trisaccharide containing α2,3-linked sialic acid in unbranched sugar chains as a receptor determinant (Kubota et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80916" pm="."><plain>Some strains especially neurovirulent variants may show an increased binding activity for α2,6-linked sialic acid (Reyes-Leyva et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80917" pm="."><plain>With respect to the sialic acid binding activity, the human paramyxoviruses HPIV3 and MuV differ from human influenza viruses which have a clear preference for the α2,6 linkage (Rogers and Paulson, 1983). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="80918" pm="."><plain>In the complex microenvironment of the human respiratory tract, different kinds of microorganisms may synergistically interact with each other resulting in viral-bacterial co-infections that are often associated with more severe disease than the respective mono-infections (Beadling and Slifka, 2004; Franz et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80919" pm="."><plain>Apart from influenza A viruses, paramyxoviruses including HPIV also have been frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia in humans (Korppi et al., 1990; Juvén et al., 2000). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80920" pm="."><plain>Among the bacterial pathogens involved in respiratory co-infections, streptococci play a prominent role and S. pneumonia being a well-known representative. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80921" pm="."><plain>Group B streptococci (GBS, Streptococcus agalactiae), the causative agent of infant meningitis and pneumonia in non-pregnant adults have been found to colonize the human airway epithelium (Fallon and Sonnenwirth, 1978; Christensen et al., 1983; Doran et al., 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80922" pm="."><plain>In a previous study, we demonstrated that GBS is able to interact with influenza viruses which have a preference for avian type receptors (α2,3-linked sialic acids). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80923" pm="."><plain>Streptococcal binding to the influenza hemagglutinin expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells enhances the bacterial adhesion and invasion properties (Tong et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80924" pm="."><plain>However, avian influenza viruses only occasionally infect humans (Stevens et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2013). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80925" pm="."><plain>In contrast to human influenza viruses which have a preference for α2,6-linked sialic acid, human paramyxoviruses recognize α2,3-linked sialic acid. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="80926" pm="."><plain>Therefore we analyzed the interactions between GBS and a human paramyxovirus, HPIV3. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81070" pm="."><plain>Many influenza and paramyxoviruses use sialic acid as a receptor determinant for binding to and initiating infection of target cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81071" pm="."><plain>The binding of the respective viral proteins to the sugar alone, N-acetylneuraminic acid, is characterized by a low affinity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81072" pm="."><plain>The binding to the cell surface receptors occurs with higher affinity because viruses recognize the terminal sialic acid as part of the larger oligosaccharide motif present on glycoproteins or glycolipids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81073" pm="."><plain>The interaction with viral proteins is dependent not only on the type of sialic acid but also on other factors, e.g., the linkage to the neighboring sugar which most often is galactose (Matrosovich et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81074" pm="."><plain>Influenza viruses are well-known for their differential interaction with sialic acid; thus, avian viruses recognize α2,3-linked sialic acid and human viruses prefer α2,6-linked sialic acid (Rogers and Paulson, 1983; Connor et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81075" pm="."><plain>This binding specificity is not observed on human paramyxoviruses (Moscona and Peluso, 1996). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81076" pm="."><plain>Most members of the genera Respirovirus, including HPIV3, and Rubulavirus, including MuV, appear to attach to glycoconjugates containing α2,3-linked sialic acid, though some strains/variants have been reported to recognize α2,6-linked sialic acid (Reyes-Leyva et al., 2007; Kubota et al., 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81077" pm="."><plain>Whereas the recognition of α2,3-linked sialic acid is a common feature of human paramyxoviruses, differences have been reported with respect to the neighboring sugars. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81078" pm="."><plain>The binding affinity may depend on whether the glycan is branched or unbranched, or whether the following sugars are modified by sulfate groups or fucose residues (Amonsen et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81079" pm="."><plain>In this way the viruses may interact with a broader or with a narrower spectrum of glycan structures, and therefore they may also differ in the spectrum of target cells. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81080" pm="."><plain>Because of the considerations mentioned above, it was not possible to predict whether HPIV3 and MuV glycoproteins are able to interact with GBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81081" pm="."><plain>The capsular polysaccharide of this microorganism contains a rhamnose residue that is not found in glycoconjugates of vertebrate cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81082" pm="."><plain>Glycan arrays used to characterize the binding activity of viral proteins usually do not include glycans with a rhamnose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81083" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the rhamnose residue does not affect the conformation of the respective glycan structure in a way that prevents the recognition by either HPIV3 or MuV. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81084" pm="."><plain>In fact, the interaction of the two paramyxoviruses with GBS occurs with the same sialic acid specificity as does the interplay between these viruses and their host cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81085" pm="."><plain>Viral-bacterial co-sedimentation or bacterial adherence to HN-expressing cells was observed only with GBS which contains α2,3-linked sialic acid, but not with S. suis which has a similar capsular polysaccharide but differs in the terminal sialic acid which is present in an α2,6-linkage (Van Calsteren et al., 2010). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81086" pm="."><plain>The binding of the paramyxoviruses to GBS appears to occur with similar affinity as does the interaction with cell surface receptors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81087" pm="."><plain>This conclusion is based on our finding that GBS is able to inhibit the hemadsorption activity of the MuV-HN protein competitively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81088" pm="."><plain>Efficient attachment of influenza and paramyxoviruses to the cell surface depends not only on the specific recognition of cellular receptors, but also on the establishment of multiple binding sites. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81089" pm="."><plain>Multivalent interactions between viruses and cells can be achieved because a virion contains hundreds of surface glycoproteins and cells usually expose a large number of sialylated glycan motifs on their surface. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81090" pm="."><plain>In our case, multivalent interactions can also be achieved with GBS because this microorganism contains many α2,3-linked sialic acids in the capsule. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81091" pm="."><plain>Recently we reported that co-infection of cells by avian influenza viruses and GBS results in a delay of the viral replication (Tong et al., 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81092" pm="."><plain>A similar result was obtained in the present study with HPIV3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81093" pm="."><plain>This negative effect may be due to binding of bacteria to virus infected-cells which may delay the budding process and virus egress. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81094" pm="."><plain>An alternative explanation is that binding of bacteria to virions released from infected cells may impede virus entry into uninfected cells and thus delay the spread of infection. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81095" pm="."><plain>Whereas viral-bacterial co-infection had a negative effect on the replication of HPIV3, adherence of GBS was greatly enhanced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81096" pm="."><plain>Several components of GBS have been described to mediate the adherence to host factors (for a review see Wang et al., 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81097" pm="."><plain>Most important for binding to and colonization of epithelial cells appear to be the adhesins BsaB, HvgA, the Alpha C proteins (ACP), the serine-rich repeat (Srr) proteins as well as the pili. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81098" pm="."><plain>We do not know which of these proteins is involved in the adherence of GBS to HEp-2 cells, but our results show that sialic acid-mediated binding to HN proteins exposed on the cell surface is a more efficient way of adherence. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81099" pm="."><plain>Previously, sialic acids of GBS have mainly been associated with immune evasion by interaction with lectins on immune cells which prevents complement activation and counteracts the bactericidal activity of the host cells (Chang et al., 2014; Landwehr-Kenzel and Henneke, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81100" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the capsular sialic acids of GBS enhance the adherence to paramyxovirus-infected cells which is consistent with our recent report that the HA proteins of avian influenza viruses expressed on infected cells enhance the adhesion properties of GBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81101" pm="."><plain>As shown with influenza virus-infected cells, enhanced adherence is paralleled by enhanced invasion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81102" pm="."><plain>GBS is a commensal bacterium that asymptomatically colonizes mucosal surfaces. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81103" pm="."><plain>To cause disease, the microorganism has to invade the host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81104" pm="."><plain>Therefore, via increased adherence and invasion, co-infection with influenza viruses or paramyxoviruses that recognize α2,3-linked sialic acid may contribute to the severity of disease caused by GBS. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81105" pm="."><plain>It will be interesting in the future, to see how co-infection by GBS and HPIV3 contributes to viral/bacterial replication and pathogenesis in a small animal model. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81109" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results show that sialic acid-dependent interactions with GBS are not limited to HPIV3 but can occur also with other viruses, and this type of interaction can also be demonstrated by a different method, i.e., with transfected cells. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="81112" pm="."><plain>This pathogen contains a neuraminidase to release sialic acid from the cell surface and therefore does not contain sialic acid residues in the capsular polysaccharide. </plain></SENT>
