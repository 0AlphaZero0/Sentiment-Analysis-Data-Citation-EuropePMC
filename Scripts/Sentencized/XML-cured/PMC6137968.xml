</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81379" pm="."><plain>Chloroplasts are semi-autonomous organelles responsible for the conversion of energy from sunlight, and for the synthesis of organic molecules by means of photosynthesis in higher plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81380" pm="."><plain>Chlorophyll is the primary photosynthetic pigment, and functions in the absorption and transformation of light energy into energy-storage molecules, carbohydrates, and oxygen; it is thus fundamental to the survival and reproduction of all living organisms (Fromme et al., 2003). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81381" pm="."><plain>In higher plants, defective chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism lead to changes in chlorophyll content and leaf colour. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81382" pm="."><plain>Leaf-colour mutants are not only useful as markers in hybrid breeding, but can also be used to study development-related processes such as photosynthesis, chlorophyll metabolism, and chloroplast development, and thus have considerable potential for research and practical application (Du et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81383" pm="."><plain>In higher plants, variation in leaf colour is conspicuous, and in rice its diverse phenotypes include virescent, albino, stripe, chlorina, stay-green, zebra, and yellow variegated forms (Yoo et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81384" pm="."><plain>A substantial number of leaf-colour genes have been mapped, but only a few have been cloned. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81385" pm="."><plain>The two CAO homologous genes in rice, OsCAO1 and OsCAO2, encode a chlorophyll a oxygenase, which catalyses the conversion of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81386" pm="."><plain>Mutation of OsCAO1 causes a pale-green leaf phenotype (Lee et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2016). OsChlD, OsChlH, and OsChlI encode Mg-chelatase subunits that catalyse the chelation of Mg2+ into protoporphyrin IX. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81387" pm="."><plain>Mutations of these three genes all cause a yellow-green leaf phenotype to different degrees of severity (Jung et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). YELLOW-GREEN LEAF 1 (YGL1) encodes a chlorophyll synthase that catalyses the esterification of a chlorophyllide to complete the final step of chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81388" pm="."><plain>The mutant ygl1 displays yellow-green leaves in young plants owing to decreased chlorophyll accumulation (Wu et al., 2007). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81389" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned genes all affect the development of leaf pigmentation by regulating the synthesis and degradation of chlorophyll. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81390" pm="."><plain>Defective chloroplast development can also lead to the formation of leaf-colour mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81391" pm="."><plain>For example, VIRESCENT 1 (V1) encodes a chloroplast protein that regulates chloroplast RNA metabolism and promotes the establishment of the plastid genetic system in rice. VIRESCENT 2 (V2) encodes a novel type of guanylate kinase and is essential for chloroplast development in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81392" pm="."><plain>The v1 and v2 mutants each develop chlorotic leaves at restrictive temperatures (Sugimoto et al., 2007). VIRESCENT 3 (V3) and STRIPE 1 (St1) respectively encode the large and small subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, which is required for chloroplast biogenesis in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81393" pm="."><plain>The v3 and st1 mutants show chlorotic leaves in a growth stage-dependent manner under field conditions (Yoo et al., 2009). OsPPR1 encodes a novel pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, which is essential for chloroplast biogenesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81394" pm="."><plain>Antisense transgenic plants display typical chlorophyll-deficient mutant phenotypes of albinism and lethality (Gothandam et al., 2005). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81395" pm="."><plain>Thus, mutations in genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism and chloroplast development result in abnormal leaf-colour phenotypes. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81396" pm="."><plain>The de novo synthesis of the purine nucleotide is crucial for all living organisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81397" pm="."><plain>The synthetic pathway is composed of 11 enzymatic steps, leading to the formation of inosinate, and provides the adenine and guanine purines necessary for almost all biochemical processes, including DNA and RNA metabolism, the biosynthetic intermediates ATP and GTP, co-enzymes, and cytokinins, as well as being a vital metabolic regulator in cell signalling (Smith and Atkins, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81398" pm="."><plain>Although purine plays an important role in plant growth and development, limited information on the synthetic pathway in plants is available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81399" pm="."><plain>The Arabidopsis PURINE BIOSYNTHESIS 4 (PUR4) gene encodes a formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase, which is the fourth enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81400" pm="."><plain>The pur4 mutation is lethal to the male gametophyte and homozygous pur4 plants cannot be obtained, which indicates that de novo purine synthesis is specifically necessary for pollen development (BerthomÃ© et al., 2008). CIA1 encodes a Gln phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase 2 (ATase2), which is one of the three ATase isozymes responsible for the first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81401" pm="."><plain>The loss-of-function mutant in Arabidopsis and ATase2-RNAi transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants show normal green cotyledons but small and albino/pale-green mosaic leaves and reduced chloroplast protein import, which indicates that de novo purine biosynthesis is important for chloroplast development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81402" pm="."><plain>In addition, de novo synthesis of purine plays a crucial role in cell division (Hung et al., 2004). PHOSPHORIBOSYLAMINE-GLYCINE LIGASE (PurD) is the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, and catalyses the conversion of 5â²-phosphoribosylamine (PRA) to 5â²-phosphoribosyl-l-glycinamide (GAR) (Smith and Atkins, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81403" pm="."><plain>In recent years, the biological function of PurD in mycelial growth and the virulence of bacterial strains has been extensively studied. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81404" pm="."><plain>For example, strains of Gibberella zeae (Kim et al., 2007), Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Park et al., 2007), and Brucella abortus (Truong et al., 2015) harbouring mutations in PurD show reduced virulence against plants, which indicates that purD plays a vital role in the growth and virulence of bacterial strains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81405" pm="."><plain>However, investigation of the biological functioning of purD in plants is incomplete. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81406" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that purD is a single-copy and mono-functional enzyme in Arabidopsis, and the gene shows a high degree of conserved homology to purD in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (Schnorr et al., 1994). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81407" pm="."><plain>However, studies on the physiological characteristics and biological function of purD in plants are still required. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81408" pm="."><plain>In this study, we isolated a virescent-albino leaf 1 (val1) mutant, which exhibits a chlorotic and narrow-leaf phenotype, decreased quantities of chlorophyll and carotenoids over the entire growth period, and abnormal chloroplast development on the albino side of the leaf. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81409" pm="."><plain>Map-based cloning revealed that VAL1 encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase, the enzyme involved in the second step of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81410" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in chloroplasts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81411" pm="."><plain>VAL1 plays a crucial role in the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and pigment metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81412" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to implicate involvement of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway in the development of leaf pigmentation and in cell division, and provides novel insights into the mechanisms underlying chloroplast development, pigment accumulation, and cell division in rice. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="81670" pm="."><plain>In our present study, VAL1 was shown to encode a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase, the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81671" pm="."><plain>Subcellular localization indicated that the VAL1 protein was localized in the chloroplast (Fig. 3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81672" pm="."><plain>VAL1 is a novel regulator that regulates chloroplast development, pigment metabolism, and cell division, and thereby affects the development of leaf colour and blade width in rice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81673" pm="."><plain>Many genes associated with leaf colour have been cloned in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81674" pm="."><plain>Metabolic pathways associated with chlorophyll synthesis and degradation, and chloroplast development have been elucidated, and mutation of genes involved in these metabolic pathways leads to changes in leaf colour. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81675" pm="."><plain>For example, mutations in the genes OsCHlH (Jung et al., 2003), OsCHlD and OsCHlI (Zhang et al., 2015), OsDVR (Wang et al., 2010), OsGluRs (Liu et al., 2007), YGL1 (Wu et al., 2007), OsCAO1 and OsCAO2 (Lee et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2016), OsPPR1 (Gothandam et al., 2005), YSA (Su et al., 2012), SGR (Jiang et al., 2007), NYC1 (Kusaba et al., 2007), V1 (Kusumi et al., 2011), V2 (Sugimoto et al., 2004), and V3 and st1 (Yoo et al., 2009) produce different types of leaf-colour mutants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81676" pm="."><plain>In the val1 mutant, the expression levels of chlorophyll- and photosynthesis-associated genes were significantly reduced, and chloroplast development was defective (Figs 2D, 6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81677" pm="."><plain>Thus, similar to the above-mentioned leaf-colour mutants, the green-revertible albino phenotype of the val1 mutant was caused by disruption of chlorophyll metabolism and chloroplast development. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81678" pm="."><plain>Previous research has indicated that the phenotypes of the majority of green-revertible albino leaf-colour mutants are regulated by temperature and development, or by a combination of the two. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81679" pm="."><plain>For example, the temperature-sensitive seedling-colour mutant tsc-1 displays a white, light-yellow, and normal green leaf when grown at 23.1 Â°C, 26.1 Â°C, and 30.1 Â°C, respectively (Dong et al., 2001). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81680" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the albino leaf phenotype of the val1 mutant at the early seedling stage was not affected by temperature, which indicated that val1 is a temperature-insensitive mutant (Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81681" pm="."><plain>S1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81682" pm="."><plain>Developmentally regulated mutants, such as the ysa mutant, develop albino leaves before the three-leaf (L3) stage and gradually turn green and recover to the normal green leaf colour at the six-leaf stage (Su et al., 2012). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81683" pm="."><plain>The temperature-conditional and developmentally-regulated mutants v3 and st1 largely exhibit a normal green-leaf phenotype up to the L3 stage and develop chlorotic leaves until the maximum tiller stage, but recover to develop mostly green leaves after heading. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81684" pm="."><plain>At temperatures of 20 Â°C or 30 Â°C, these mutants produce chlorotic leaves, whereas under an alternate light/dark cycle (12 h light at 30 Â°C/12 h dark at 20 Â°C), these mutants develop leaves of an almost normal green colour (Yoo et al., 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81685" pm="."><plain>In our present study, the val1 mutant initially produced albino new leaves, but these subsequently turned green and only a small number of leaves showed marginal albinism at later developmental stages (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81686" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that val1 is a novel green-revertible albino mutant, for which the phenotype is regulated by development and is independent of temperature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81687" pm="."><plain>Nucleotide metabolism is a crucial process in all living organisms (Smith and Atkins, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81688" pm="."><plain>Although the de novo biosynthesis of purine nucleotides is essential for plant growth and development, little information is available on the molecular mechanism of the purine biosynthesis pathway in plants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81689" pm="."><plain>The Arabidopsis gene CIA1 encodes a Gln phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase 2 (ATase2), which is one of three ATase isozymes responsible for the first step of de novo purine biosynthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81690" pm="."><plain>The cia1 mutant displays normal green cotyledons, together with small and albino/pale-green mosaic leaves that contain slightly smaller cells but only half the cell number of the WT, which indicates that de novo purine biosynthesis is important for chloroplast biogenesis and cell division (Hung et al., 2004). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81691" pm="."><plain>Our present study showed that VAL1 encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase, the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81692" pm="."><plain>In the val1 mutant, chloroplast development was severely defective and chlorophyll metabolism was disrupted, which resulted in the dynamic green-revertible albino leaf phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81693" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the findings indicated that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme that regulates the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, which may be involved in the development of leaf colour in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81694" pm="."><plain>In addition, the val1 mutant developed narrow leaves, caused by diminished cell division owing to the reduced content of cytokinins in the leaf (Fig. 7), and led to a reduced number of vascular bundles and fewer cells between the small vascular bundles (Fig. 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81695" pm="."><plain>Thus, the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway may also be involved in the process of cell division in rice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81696" pm="."><plain>The location of the pathway within plant cells is presently still in dispute, although the subcellular localization of multiple enzymes provides convincing evidence (Smith and Atkins, 2002). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81697" pm="."><plain>Our current study showed that VAL1 contained a chloroplast transit peptide and was localized in the chloroplast (Fig. 3), which indicated that at least part of the de novo purine biosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts in rice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="81698" pm="."><plain>It is worth considering why the mutation of VAL1 caused a dynamic green-revertible albino phenotype. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81699" pm="."><plain>One hypothesis is that VAL1 paralogs might perform the same or similar functions at later growth stages, and eventually offset the loss caused by mutation in the VAL1 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81700" pm="."><plain>This explanation was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81701" pm="."><plain>There was one VAL1-like gene, LOC_Os12g09540, which showed high similarity to VAL1 at the amino acid level (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81702" pm="."><plain>S2), and LOC_Os12g09540 was also highly expressed in leaves, with the highest levels detected in L3U (Fig. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81703" pm="."><plain>S3A, B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81704" pm="."><plain>One reasonable interpretation is that there is a threshold level of purine nucleotides that needs to be met for normal chloroplast biogenesis and chlorophyll metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81705" pm="."><plain>Under rapid growth conditions, purine nucleotides are channelled into cell division, the purine nucleotide level in the mutant drops below the threshold, and chloroplasts fail to develop normally, causing the mutant to display albino leaves. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81706" pm="."><plain>When the division and growth rate of leaf cells are slower, purine nucleotides have time to accumulate in the mutant cells, eventually reaching the threshold level, and the mutant leaves subsequently turn green in the later stages. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81707" pm="."><plain>In val1 seedlings, the contents of the de novo purine biosynthesis products adenine nucleotide (AMP) and guanine nucleotide (GMP) were lower than those of the WT seedlings (Fig. 5B), which indicated that the purine nucleotide level in the mutant dropped below the threshold. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81708" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the val1 mutant, application of AMP, GMP, and AMP and GMP together partially restored the accumulation of chlorophyll in the val1 mutant (Fig. 5D, E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81709" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicated that the dynamic green-revertible albino process may be regulated by the threshold level of purine nucleotides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81710" pm="."><plain>In addition, purine nucleotides are maintained in intracellular pools through a combination of de novo synthesis and salvage pathways (Zrenner et al., 2006). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81711" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated that the strong demand for nucleotides in growing and dividing cells is met by de novo synthesis, whereas non-growing cells may be able to maintain their pools of nucleotides by salvaging (Ashihara and Crozier, 1999; Zrenner et al., 2006). VAL1 achieved the highest expression levels in the WT leaves at the L3 stage, and accumulated more in L3L but decreased dramatically in L3U (Fig. 3C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81712" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that VAL1 might play an important role at the early leaf development stage, with a relatively minor role in the mature leaf. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="81713" pm="."><plain>Thus, another reasonable interpretation is that the de novo purine biosynthesis process regulates chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism at the early leaf development stage, and the salvage pathway regulates chloroplast development and chlorophyll metabolism in mature leaves. </plain></SENT>
