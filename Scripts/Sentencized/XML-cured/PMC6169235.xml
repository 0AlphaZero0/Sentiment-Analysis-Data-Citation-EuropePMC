<SENT sid="83132" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83133" pm="."><plain>In the modern poultry industry, reproductive traits of laying hens, such as age at first egg, egg number, and egg weight, are major factors of economic concern [1–4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83134" pm="."><plain>Studies on genes related to chicken reproductive traits are of great importance in terms of revealing genetic mechanisms affecting egg-laying performance and for breeding the laying hens with high productivity and quality. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83135" pm="."><plain>The candidate gene approach is a method used frequently for genetic dissection of complex and quantitative traits [5–9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83136" pm="."><plain>This method is based on using information regarding physiological and biochemical processes in the organism to select related genes and explore their relationship with phenotypes [3, 6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83137" pm="."><plain>Several crucial genes in livestock and poultry have been identified using this approach, such as the sex-linked dwarf gene in chicken [10], insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) in swine [11], growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8) in sheep [12], and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT1) in cattle [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83138" pm="."><plain>Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), involved in growth and differentiation and secreted by oocytes, belongs to the transforming growth factor β superfamily and plays a critical role in ovarian follicular development and ovulation rate in mammals [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83139" pm="."><plain>Further studies have shown that GDF9 regulated hyaluronic acid synthesis, gonadotrophin-stimulated progesterone production, cumulus expansion, and the maintenance of an optimal oocyte microenvironment through synergistic action along with BMP15 (bone morphogenetic protein 15) [16–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83140" pm="."><plain>Besides granulosa cells closely adjacent to oocytes in some primates, the GDF9 gene is exclusively expressed in oocytes within the ovary of most animals [19–23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83141" pm="."><plain>Recently, several studies have suggested that GDF9 polymorphisms are associated with animal reproductive performance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83142" pm="."><plain>Dag et al. [9] detected that a missense mutation (c.1111G&gt;A) in GDF9 causing a Val→Met substitution was significantly associated with litter size in sheep. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83143" pm="."><plain>The FecGE allele of a novel GDF9 polymorphism significantly increased ovulation rate and prolificacy in sheep [24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83144" pm="."><plain>Additionally, GDF9 polymorphisms have also shown significant correlations with high prolificacy in goats [8, 25], the number of transferable embryos and ova in cows [26], and sperm quality traits in bulls [27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83145" pm="."><plain>However, most studies implicating effects of GDF9 on reproductive performance have been conducted in mammals, and there are limited data regarding its role in the reproductive system of poultry. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83146" pm="."><plain>Thus, we hypothesized that the GDF9 gene was involved in the reproductive traits of laying hens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83147" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are DNA sequence polymorphisms resulting from variation of a single nucleotide at the genomic level, including insertions, deletions, transversions, and transitions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83148" pm="."><plain>SNPs comprise the latest generation of genetic markers and are often applied in animal breeding programs owing to their advantages such as high frequency, stability, and ease of genotyping [6, 28, 29]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83149" pm="."><plain>To validate our hypothesis, in this study, we identified chicken GDF9 SNPs via pooled DNA sequencing and investigated these SNPs association with reproductive traits in Luhua chicken and Dongxiang blue-shelled chicken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83150" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we analyzed expression levels of GDF9 mRNA in different chicken tissues and different breeds using quantitative real-time PCR. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83242" pm="."><plain>Numerous studies have shown that GDF9 is a candidate gene involving reproductive performance and plays a critical role in animal reproductive biology [40–43]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83243" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of these reports on the relationship between GDF9 polymorphisms and reproductive traits have focused on swine, sheep, and goats. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83244" pm="."><plain>Zhang et al. [7] found 12 polymorphisms including three SNPs in coding regions and one 314-bp indel in the noncoding region of the swine GDF9 gene. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83245" pm="."><plain>Hanrahan et al. [40] reported eight SNPs in the GDF9 coding region through direct sequencing of Cambridge and Belclare sheep DNA, three of which were nonsense mutations and four of which were G&gt;A mutations. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83246" pm="."><plain>Dong et al. [44] detected four SNPs in the coding sequence of goat GDF9, comprising C183A, C719T, A959C, and G1189A. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83252" pm="."><plain>Association between GDF9 and Chicken Reproduction Traits </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83253" pm="."><plain>Several different types of mutations and polymorphisms in GDF9 have been reported to cause significant negative effects inducing infertility, ovulation impairment, and susceptibility to premature ovarian failure in some mammalian species [40, 42, 45]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83254" pm="."><plain>In addition, positive effects on the ovulation rate in sheep and cows have been reported [24, 26, 46], and an increase in occurrence of dizygotic twins was reported in humans [47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83255" pm="."><plain>In this study, three mutations were found to have effects on reproductive traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83256" pm="."><plain>There are several possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83257" pm="."><plain>Promoter regions specifically identify and bind to transcription factors that recruit RNA polymerase, controlling the initiation of transcription and gene expression [48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83258" pm="."><plain>The two mutations located in the GDF9 promoter region could influence transcriptional efficiency and subsequently alter the gene expression level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83259" pm="."><plain>In the case of the SNP g.17156703A&gt;C, it caused the amino acid substitution of Ile→Leu, which may subsequently result in a change of function in the GDF9 protein. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83260" pm="."><plain>In our study, BWFE, WFE, BWTA, EWTA, and EN were greater in LH than in DX chickens, whereas AFE was greater in DX than in LH chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83261" pm="."><plain>This provided valuable evidence for differences in reproductive traits between the two breeds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83262" pm="."><plain>We performed further association analyses and found that three SNPs affected several reproductive traits in DX hens, whereas only g.17156387C&gt;T was significantly associated with two reproductive traits (AFE and WFE) in LH chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83263" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that GDF9 polymorphisms exert relatively stronger effects in DX than in LH chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83264" pm="."><plain>Compared with LH chickens, DX chickens possess enormous potential for selective breeding because of their low productivity [30–32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83265" pm="."><plain>Thus, when major mutations related to reproductive traits are positively selected, DX chickens may experience greater relative genetic improvement. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="83266" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no SNPs were associated with BWTA in either breeds or with EN in LH chickens, which are major traits of laying hens [3], but the integrated diplotype derived from the three SNPs significantly affected the two traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83267" pm="."><plain>A possible reason for this is positive synergy among these mutations, which may have small effects individually. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83268" pm="."><plain>This finding is consistent with previous observations of Cao et al. [49], who found that combined genotypes had more significant effects on body weight in chicken than individual genotypes did. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83269" pm="."><plain>In DX chickens, we found that the mutations g.17156387C&gt;T, g.17156427A&gt;G, and g.17156703A&gt;C had significant effects on partial reproductive traits, including AFE, WFE, BWTA, EWTA, and EN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83270" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those of some previous reports showing that GDF9 polymorphisms were associated litter size in goat [50], ovulation rate and prolificacy in sheep [24], and superovulation performance in cows [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83271" pm="."><plain>Several studies are in agreement that diplotype analysis provides more information into the complex relationships between phenotypes and DNA variation [6, 51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83272" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that certain diplotypes significantly affected AFE, BWFE and EN in laying hens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83273" pm="."><plain>Birds with the diplotype D2 exhibited the highest EN value, and those with D7 had the lowest AFE and BWTA values. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83274" pm="."><plain>The diplotype analysis found different effect sizes of the three mutations in the chicken GDF9 gene with respect to reproductive traits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83275" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found that laying hens with an earlier AFE had a higher EN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83276" pm="."><plain>These results are consistent with a negative correlation between egg number and age at first egg often observed in quantitative genetics studies [1]. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="83279" pm="."><plain>The GDF9 gene is expressed in human, rodent, and ruminant oocytes and is an essential factor that regulates development of ovarian follicles [17, 52, 53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83280" pm="."><plain>However, the expression pattern of GDF9 differs across species. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83281" pm="."><plain>For example, GDF9 expression was first reported in the primordial follicles of possum, hamsters, sheep, and cattle [19–21] and in the primary follicles of humans, mice, and rats [22, 23]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83282" pm="."><plain>In this study, GDF9 mRNA was found to be expressed in the STR, WF, YF, SYF, and all hierarchical follicles in chickens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83283" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that GDF9 also plays an important role in ovary function and follicle development in chicken. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83284" pm="."><plain>Chicken GDF9 mRNA was most abundant in the STR and was relatively highly expressed in the WF and YF, consistent with previous studies in mammals, implying that GDF9 is responsible for early development and differentiation of the ovarian follicles [41, 43, 54]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="83285" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that GDF9 mainly affected the prehierarchal follicles in chicken. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="83297" pm="."><plain>In addition, certain diplotypes significantly affected AFE, BWTA, and EN in both breeds.
