<SENT sid="84549" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="84550" pm="."><plain>Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of serious chronic metabolic disorders, characterized by hyperglycemia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84551" pm="."><plain>Nowadays, diabetes mellitus has emerged as a major global public health problem. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84552" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus have been experiencing rapid growth over recent decades. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84553" pm="."><plain>It is estimated that the total number of diabetes aged 20–79 years will rise from 415 million in 2015 to 642 million in 2040 [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84554" pm="."><plain>Moreover, approximately 90–95% of diabetic individuals suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84555" pm="."><plain>T2DM is characterized by impairment in pancreatic β-cell and insulin resistance in target organs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84556" pm="."><plain>Insulin resistance can cause many severe complications, for example, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and so on. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84557" pm="."><plain>Thus, the treatments of insulin resistance seem to be worthy of more attention and investigation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84558" pm="."><plain>Propolis is often defined as natural complex substance collected by Apis mellifera and widely used as the medical and healthcare due to a wide range of biological properties. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84559" pm="."><plain>Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that propolis possesses antimicrobial [2], antioxidative [3], anti-inflammatory [4], and antitumor [5] capacities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84560" pm="."><plain>In recent years, a strong relationship between propolis and insulin resistance has been reported in the literatures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84561" pm="."><plain>For instance, Chinese propolis can have an appreciable impact on controlling blood glucose, modulating lipid metabolism, and improving insulin sensitivity in T2DM rats [6]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84562" pm="."><plain>In addition, the extract of Brazilian propolis did not impact body weight gain and food intake in ob/ob mice, but insulin resistance was significantly reduced [7]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84563" pm="."><plain>Overall, the findings indicate that propolis seem to play an essential role in the treatment of insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84564" pm="."><plain>However, these studies have tended to focus on the effect of propolis or propolis extract rather than individual propolis compounds. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84565" pm="."><plain>Flavonoids present widely in certain food and healthcare products and have been applied in ameliorating insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84566" pm="."><plain>Previous research has noted that flavonoids play a critical role in signaling pathways related to insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84567" pm="."><plain>For example, cocoa flavonoids can modulate AMPK signaling pathway to relieve insulin resistance of high glucose-treated HepG2 cells [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84568" pm="."><plain>In addition, quercetin can also regulate AMPK signaling to alleviate high fructose-induced insulin resistance in humans [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84569" pm="."><plain>Besides AMPK signaling pathway, other signaling pathways seem to be related to insulin resistance, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [10], mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [11], and protein kinases B/mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR) [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84570" pm="."><plain>Akt/mTOR is an important pathway of intracellular insulin transduction and energy metabolism in the liver and plays a very central role in glycolysis [14, 15], gluconeogenesis [14], and glycogen synthesis [16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84571" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether propolis flavonoids ameliorate insulin resistance via Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="84572" pm="."><plain>In this paper, based on their specific and abundance in propolis, we selected pinobanksin, galangin, chrysin, and pinocembrin to investigate their effects on insulin resistance and Akt/mTOR signaling. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84573" pm="."><plain>In addition, variations of glucose consumption, glycogen content, hexokinase, and pyruvate kinase activities were measured in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells by enzyme immunoassay kit. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84574" pm="."><plain>The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key Akt/mTOR signaling proteins were tested using the MILLIPLEX® MAP Akt/mTOR 11-plex Panel. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84719" pm="."><plain>Insulin is the only hormone in the body to lower blood glucose, and to promote glycogen, fat, and protein synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84720" pm="."><plain>Insulin resistance represents a decreased sensitivity and reactivity of target tissues to insulin in maintaining the balance and stability of body's glucose level. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84721" pm="."><plain>Therefore, insulin resistance can decrease glucose consumption and glycogen synthesis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84722" pm="."><plain>In recent years, natural products have drawn more and more attention due to their positive effects in the treatment of insulin resistance, for example, cocoa [25], onion [26], Tetrastigma obtectum [27], and propolis [28]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84723" pm="."><plain>Prior work has documented the effectiveness of propolis in reducing blood glucose levels and ameliorating insulin resistance in organism; Wataru Aoi, for example, reports that dietary propolis reduced blood glucose levels in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats and improved insulin sensitivity in the early stage of insulin resistance development [28]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84727" pm="."><plain>Our results reveal that galangin and pinocembrin can significantly increase glucose consumption (Figure 1) and glycogen synthesis (Figure 2) by enhancing the activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase (Figure 3). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="84757" pm="."><plain>Dephosphorylation of p70S6K may cause a decrease in IRS serine phosphorylation and an increase in its tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in upregulating Akt phosphorylation to alleviate insulin resistance [39]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="84758" pm="."><plain>Some studies have shown that RPS6 was involved in maintaining glucose stability and insulin sensitivity [40]. </plain></SENT>
