</text></title><p id="Par2"><text><SENT sid="85283" pm="."><plain>Caspase-8 is a cysteine protease that initiates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in response to cell surface death receptor activation1,2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85284" pm="."><plain>Procaspase-8 exists in the cytosol within the cell as an inactive monomer, which is characterized by an N-terminal tandem death effector domains (DEDs) and a C-terminal catalytic protease domain3,4. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85285" pm="."><plain>The activation of procaspase-8 is proposed to occur through an induced proximity mechanism5–7. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85286" pm="."><plain>Upon engagement with the death ligand such as Fas Ligand (FasL), the clustering death receptor Fas recruits the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to its cytoplasmic tail8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85287" pm="."><plain>The inactive procaspase-8 is then recruited to FADD via homotypic interactions between the DEDs of procaspase-8 and the adaptor protein FADD, leading to the dimerization and activation of procaspase-89. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85288" pm="."><plain>During this process, dimeric FasL trimers potentially serve as a minimal unit fully capable of activating the Fas pathway10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="85289" pm="."><plain>The current induced proximity model is proposed based on early studies using drug-induced dimerization of a truncated procaspase-8 without the DEDs11,12, or chimeric caspase-8 that Fpk3 or FKBP is fused to truncated procaspase-8 without the DEDs5,9,13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85290" pm="."><plain>In these early studies, kosmotrope-induced dimerization of the caspase domain of procaspase-8 leads to its activation in vitro12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85291" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the cell-permeable ligand-induced dimerization of the FKBP domain also drives the activation of the chimeric procaspase-8 in the intact cell9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85292" pm="."><plain>However, the function of the DEDs in the activation of procaspase-8 cannot be fully addressed based on these studies using the truncated procaspase-8 that lacks the DEDs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85293" pm="."><plain>It remains unclear whether the DEDs of procaspase-8 forms dimer, if true, how the DEDs forms the dimeric structure within the DISC. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="85294" pm="."><plain>To address these questions, we tried to determine the structure of the DEDs of caspase-8, but the structural study of the DEDs is markedly hindered by the low solubility and high aggregating propensity for the tandem DEDs of caspase-814. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85295" pm="."><plain>Through mutant screening, we recently solved the structure of the monomeric DEDs of caspase-8 for a soluble F122A/I128D mutant (DEDF122A/I128D)15, which closely resembles the structure of viral FLIP MC15916,17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85296" pm="."><plain>However, the monomeric DEDF122A/I128D mutant provides limited clues about the homotypic interactions between the DEDs of caspase-8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85297" pm="."><plain>More recently, the cryo-EM structure of caspase-8 tandem DED filaments was determined18, which provides an elegant structural framework to understand interactions between the DEDs of caspase-8 itself and that between caspase-8 and other proteins such as FADD, cFLIP, and vFLIP. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85298" pm="."><plain>This structure also takes a significant step forward in understanding the mechanism underlying death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) assembly. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85299" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the filament formation generally occurs under high concentrations of DEDs in vitro18 or intracellularly19–22, it is unclear how the engagement of FasL triggers the downstream filament formation of caspase-8 under physiological condition. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85300" pm="."><plain>Moreover, further studies are still needed to address how the filament structure accommodate the requirement for dimerization in the activation of caspase-8, and how this structure reconciles with the observation that dimeric FasL trimer is a minimal unit fully capable of activating the Fas pathway10. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="85301" pm="."><plain>In this study, we determined the crystal structures of the DEDs of caspase-8 illustrating a novel domain-swapped dimer, which adopts either open or closed conformations in terms of the solvent-exposure of the conserved hydrophobic patch Phe122/Leu123 that is proposed to bind with the DED of FADD. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85302" pm="."><plain>Together with the biochemical data and the computational modeling, the domain-swapped structures of the dimeric DEDs of caspase-8 provide an alternative model to understand the dimerization-driven activation of caspase-8 in the Fas pathway mediated by a minimal dimeric FasL trimer. </plain></SENT>
