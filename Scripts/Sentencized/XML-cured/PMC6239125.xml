</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85628" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), also known as mesenchymal stem cells, have the potential for self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation.1 Considering the source, MSCs can be isolated from multiple tissues, such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, blood, placenta, and adipose tissue.2–5 It was reported that bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) that originated from the bone marrow can secrete a diverse variety of bioactive factors in an autocrine and/or paracrine way, which was expected to become a non-cellular therapy for the treatment of various diseases, especially tumors.6–9 Of them, an important paracrine factor of BMSCs is the exosome, which is a lipid membrane wrapped vesicle with a diameter of 40–200 nm. Exosome is abundant in miRNA, mRNA, lipids, and proteins. It has been reported that exosomes enter the recipient cells by endocytosis, or directly fuse with the recipient cells to exchange information between cells.10–13 Exosomes derived from BMSCs have been able to treat proangiogenic, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, lung injury, and kidney injury.14–18 Indeed, there are two opposite viewpoints on the role of exosome in the treatment of tumors. Some studies have suggested that exosomes have a strong anti-tumor effect, while other studies have shown that exosomes derived from MSCs can promote the growth and metastasis of cancer cells. Disappointingly, the mechanism of antitumor effect of MSC-derived exosomes remains unclear.19 <p><text><SENT sid="85633" pm="."><plain>Malignant tumors cause an extremely large burden around the world, second only to cardiovascular disease.20,21 Despite using combinations of various strategies of diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of cancer patients remains poor.22 Therefore, it is necessary to explore multiple effective early diagnostic and prognostic markers. Recently, it has been reported that exosomes are involved in cancer development, progression, and resistance; therefore, they may be used as multiple targets for the development of a diagnostic tool for early detection of cancer.23–26 Along with the advances in microarray and life molecules sequencing technology, high-throughput research methods are widely used in biomedicine. High-throughput and corresponding bioinformatics analysis of exosomes is helpful to guide the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, especially cancer.27,28 In this study, our goal was to identify the prognostic roles of differentially expressed genes originating from exosomes derived from BMSCs in common cancers, which provide new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancers. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><text><SENT sid="85636" pm="."><plain>Materials and methods </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85677" pm="."><plain>Malignant tumor is a major public health problem that threatens human health and is second only to cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, tumors lack early diagnostic and prognostic markers with a high sensitivity and specificity. Our study focuses on the critical role of mRNA of exosome derived from BMSCs. In our study, by extracting the gene expression information from GEO database, we obtained 386 DEGs, including 150 upregulated genes and 236 downregulated genes from the exosome derived from BMSCs. Next, we uncovered that those DEGs were mainly involved in proliferation and angiogenesis, such as VEGF and VEGFR signaling pathway. By constructing PPI network and identifying the hub genes, we obtained three hub proteins, including PODN, ZNF521, and CFI. These three genes are closely related to the clinical prognosis of common malignant tumors, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer, based on KM online platform. In addition, three hub proteins have been reported less in the context of BMSCs. Moreover, the multiple roles of the three genes in common malignant neoplasm were also less studied. As illustrated in Figure 3, the upregulation of PODN, ZNF521, and CFI indicated good survival in breast cancer (Figure 3A–C) and lung cancer (Figure 3G–I), compared with the downregulation of three hub genes. Downregulation of PODN and ZNF521 indicated a good outcome in ovarian cancer (Figure 3D and E), while the upregulation of CFI indicated a good survival in ovarian cancer (Figure 3F). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85688" pm="."><plain>Besides, the downregulation of PODN and ZNF521 indicated a good outcome in gastric cancer (Figure 3J and K), while the upregulation of CFI indicated a good survival in gastric cancer (Figure 3L). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85689" pm="."><plain>As we know, malignant tumor is a group of diseases with high heterology. Moreover, a gene whether it is a tumor promoter or inhibitor depends on the microenvironment of the tumor. <p><text><SENT sid="85691" pm="."><plain>However, we have noticed that the upregulation of PODN, ZNF521, and CFI indicated good survival in breast cancer (Figure 3A–C) and lung cancer (Figure 3G–I), compared with the downregulation of three hub genes. We make a bold assumption: the three hub genes may be used in the clinic for breast and lung cancers. <p><text><SENT sid="85693" pm="."><plain>PODN was a seed gene in the first key modules. PODN, which is an important component of the extracellular matrix protein, belongs to the small leucine-rich repeat protein family.29 It was reported that PODN may bind type 1 collagen, thereby reducing the cell growth and migration in kidney. It is unfortunate that no literature has reported the role of PODN in tumors. ZNF521 was a seed gene in the second modules. ZNF521 is a zinc finger protein that consists almost entirely of 30 C2H2 Kruppel-like zinc fingers. Moreover, ZNF521 has been characterized as a potent inhibitor of EBF1 and is emerging as a potentially relevant contributor to the development of B-cell leukemias.31,32 ZNF521 contributes to clonogenic growth, migration, and tumorigenicity in medulloblastoma cells through the recruitment of the NuRD complex.30 Furthermore, ZNF521 sustains the differentiation block in myeloid-lymphoid leukemia-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia. CFI was a seed gene in the fourth modules. CFI is a serum protease that inhibits all complement pathways. The common variant rs10033900 near the CFI gene is associated with age-related macular degeneration risk in Han Chinese population. Based on the gene expression profile, we found that upregulated CFI indicates good prognosis, while Okroj et al suggested that high expression of CFI is associated with poor prognosis and recurrence in breast cancer.33 <p><text><SENT sid="85703" pm="."><plain>In our study, we systematically characterized DEGs from the exosomes derived from BMSCs and identified certain hub proteins and their PPI networks. Taken together, our findings suggested that three genes may be potential prognostic markers in common malignant tumors. However, the study results were obtained based on bioinformatics, which only previously considered datasets. However, further studies are required with large samples and for experimental verification. </sec></SecTag></body><back><SecTag type="ACK_FUND"><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p><text4fund><text><SENT sid="85707" pm="."><plain>The authors would like to thank Hai-Ying Ma for his useful suggestions during this work. </p></ack></SecTag><fn-group><fn><p><text><SENT sid="85708" pm="."><plain>Author contributions <p><text><SENT sid="85709" pm="."><plain>All authors contributed to data analysis, drafting and revising the article, gave final approval of the version to be published, and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work. </fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><text><SENT sid="85710" pm="."><plain>Disclosure <p><text><SENT sid="85711" pm="."><plain>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work. </fn></fn-group><SecTag type="REF"><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ott-11-7979"><text><SENT sid="85712" pm="."><plain>1HanXLiXZhongGLiuZRegulation of osteogenic differentiation by DNA methylation of the dishevelled gene in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cellsAm J Transl Res20179114848485529218084 </plain></SENT>
