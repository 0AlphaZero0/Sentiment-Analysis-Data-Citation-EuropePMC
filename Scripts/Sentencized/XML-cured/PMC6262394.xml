</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85890" pm="."><plain>World-wide, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 5.9% of all deaths and is a causal factor in a larger number of disease and injury conditions (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85891" pm="."><plain>Alcohol dependence is a common disorder characterized most often by chronic relapses to heavy alcohol consumption (2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85892" pm="."><plain>Comorbidity of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and mental illness such as major depression are highly prevalent in treatment settings (3, 4) and these individuals present with greater symptom complexity and poorer outcomes (3, 5). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85893" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological treatment options for these complex patients are limited and little is known about the effectiveness of current pharmacological approaches for alcohol problems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85894" pm="."><plain>Many of the randomized controlled trials exclude patients that are concurrently receiving antidepressants and/or with comorbid major depression despite the fact that a substantial percentage of treatment-seeking AUD patients fall into these categories. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85895" pm="."><plain>In our previous clinical trials, up to 50% of alcohol dependent patients were receiving anti-depressants prior to treatment seeking for alcohol problems (6–9). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85896" pm="."><plain>Baclofen, a selective GABAB receptor agonist, has emerged as a potential treatment for alcohol dependence (10). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85897" pm="."><plain>There has been expanded utilization including increased use in primary care (11). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85898" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, there has been several reports of adverse events in AUD patients with psychiatric comorbidity including mood disorders (12) and also a higher rate of self-poising in those with concomitant borderline personality disorder and AUD (13). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85899" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a recent report from the Australian Poisons Information Centre (PIC) observed that antidepressants represented 17% of co-ingestants associated with baclofen toxicity (14). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85900" pm="."><plain>Thus, although treatment with baclofen appears to be popular in the community, there remain several important clinical issues in need of exploration. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85901" pm="."><plain>Improvement in the ability to predict baclofen response particularly among those with common comorbid mood conditions or concurrent receipt of antidepressants would be of clinical importance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85902" pm="."><plain>No clinical trials have examined the role of antidepressants during treatment of alcohol dependence with baclofen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="85903" pm="."><plain>The current study thus aimed to retrospectively examine the moderating role of concurrent antidepressant use on baclofen treatment response. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85904" pm="."><plain>We conducted a secondary analysis of the Baclofen in the treatment of Alcohol Liver Disease (BacALD) randomized controlled trial (15) which demonstrated a beneficial effect of baclofen on treatment outcomes (6). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="85907" pm="."><plain>The main study rationale, design, and methods have been previously detailed (15) and the primary outcomes reported (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85908" pm="."><plain>In brief, after baseline assessment, eligible alcohol-dependent individuals were randomized to placebo, baclofen 30 mg (10 t.i.d.) and baclofen 75 mg (25 t.i.d.) for 12 weeks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85909" pm="."><plain>Of the 104 individuals randomized in the main trial, 57 individuals were receiving concurrent antidepressants (AD) prior to randomization (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85910" pm="."><plain>The list of antidepressants prescribed is depicted in Table 1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="85911" pm="."><plain>No individuals commenced AD while on the trial. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86160" pm="."><plain>The main aim of the current study was to examine the role of concurrent antidepressant use in baclofen treatment response in a randomized, placebo-controlled double blind study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86161" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a significant baclofen vs. placebo effect as per previously described (6). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86162" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated that ADs did not have a significant moderating effect on treatment outcomes at follow-up. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86163" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated a trend for a significant interaction effect of AD (AD vs. non-AD) × baclofen (BAC vs. PL) on days to relapse, days to lapse and alcohol consumption outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86164" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed that this effect is observed in the AD group whereby allocation to placebo resulted in poor outcomes such as shorter time to relapse and lapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86165" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, these trends were diminished when controlling for significantly different baseline characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86166" pm="."><plain>It is likely that any potential interaction effect is not due to the action of baclofen and ADs per se but pre-existing comorbidity in those participants already receiving ADs which lead to shorter relapse in the absence of active treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86167" pm="."><plain>One retrospective analysis of a clinical trial exploring the relationship between antidepressant use and the alcohol pharmacotherapy naltrexone observed that, for those receiving antidepressants, there was a naltrexone vs. placebo effect on drinking outcomes but this effect was absent for those not receiving antidepressants (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86168" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to the trends found in our current results with baclofen (without controlling for pre-exisiting factors) whereby for those receiving anti-depressants, the placebo group displayed shorter times to lapse and relapse that were not seen in those randomized to baclofen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86169" pm="."><plain>One interpretation is that in these studies patients receiving antidepressants, and presumably with comorbid depression, respond poorly in the absence of active treatment. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86170" pm="."><plain>We also observed that there were no significant differences on frequency of specific commonly reported adverse events across the AD × baclofen groups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86171" pm="."><plain>These results should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size, limitations with measuring frequency rather than severity and that the adverse events examined were only those commonly reported across the entire sample. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86172" pm="."><plain>Neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions such as mania were not systematically examined in this analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86173" pm="."><plain>It is imperative to note that this data was derived from a structured monitored clinical trial with low doses of baclofen whereby patients with an active major mental disorder including bipolar, psychosis or unstable mood, history of suicide attempt or recent commencement of ADs were excluded from the trial. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86174" pm="."><plain>Indeed, there have been case reports of baclofen-induced manic symptoms in the literature yet these have generally occurred at higher doses of baclofen during the dose-increase phase (e.g., up to 180 mg/d) but mainly in patients with a history of bipolar disorder (20). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="86175" pm="."><plain>There are several limitations of the current study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86176" pm="."><plain>Given the trend for significance of interaction effects it is possible that we had limited power to detect a significant effect. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86177" pm="."><plain>In addition, the study is a retrospective analysis and was not designed to examine ADs and baclofen such that baseline characteristics were not balanced. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86178" pm="."><plain>However, we did control for these in our analyses which suggested that the trends for interaction effects were due to pre-existing factors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86179" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal modeling of symptoms of depression comparing AD and non-AD groups during baclofen treatment would further elucidate this relationship. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86180" pm="."><plain>Further, it would be important to determine any interaction effect of the two medications including mood and side effects in participants that commence ADs in conjunction or within a similar time frame to baclofen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86181" pm="."><plain>Indeed, participants receiving ADs in the current study were required to be stable and to have commenced more than 2 months prior to baclofen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86182" pm="."><plain>Participants in the current study were provided a thorough assessment of mood stability before enrolment and monitored for safety throughout as part of the clinical trial schedule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86183" pm="."><plain>It is possible that this level of monitoring may not be provided in the wider community which may limit the generalizability of these results. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86184" pm="."><plain>Finally, while we have some diagnostic information regarding mood and anxiety disorders in this sample, we do not have direct evidence regarding the clinical indication for why the antidepressants were initially prescribed. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="86186" pm="."><plain>This is the first study to investigate the moderating role of anti-depressant use on response to baclofen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86187" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the concurrent receipt of antidepressants commenced more than 2 months prior to baclofen treatment in less complex alcohol dependent patients (with no history of bipolar or suicide attempt) does not negatively impact on drinking outcomes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86188" pm="."><plain>Trends for an interaction effect between antidepressants and baclofen that were observed for all drinking outcomes may be due to pre-existing factors in the antidepressant group which lead to poor outcomes in the absence of active treatment (i.e., placebo allocation). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86189" pm="."><plain>Well-controlled prospective clinical research examining the effect of commencing antidepressants on neuropsychiatric adverse events during baclofen treatment is required. </plain></SENT>
