</text></title><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="86242" pm="."><plain>Most patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are currently treated with drug-eluting stents (DES) that elute an antiproliferative drug from their coating [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86243" pm="."><plain>But the life-long presence of durable polymers (DP) on the metallic stent struts may induce vessel wall inflammation and delay arterial healing, which can result in adverse clinical events such as stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction (MI) [3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="86244" pm="."><plain>Novel very thin-strut biodegradable polymer DES (BP-DES) were designed to overcome these limitations of DP-DES and merely leave a bare metal stent in place after the polymer has been absorbed [1, 2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86245" pm="."><plain>International guidelines recommend the use of contemporary DES over first-generation DES and bare metal stents in all patients undergoing PCI [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86246" pm="."><plain>There is no preference for newer-generation BP-DES over DP-DES, as both DES groups have shown to improve clinical outcome as compared to first-generation DES and bare metal stents. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86247" pm="."><plain>Despite the theoretical advantage of BP-DES, meta-analyses of clinical trials showed no unequivocal benefit of BP-DES over contemporary DP-DES [5–8], but there might still be an advantage for BP-DES in high-risk subgroups. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86248" pm="."><plain>Patients who are at high bleeding risk (HBR) may represent such a patient population. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par13"><text><SENT sid="86249" pm="."><plain>In clinical practice, a substantial proportion of PCI patients are at HBR [9, 10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86250" pm="."><plain>They also have an increased risk of ischemic events and thus, represent a population with an overall high risk of adverse clinical outcome [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86251" pm="."><plain>Comparative studies of HBR patients treated with BP-DES versus DP-DES are lacking, and potential benefits of BP-DES for treating this high-risk subgroup are undetermined. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86252" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed the clinical outcome data at 1-year follow-up of the large-scale BIO-RESORT randomized all-comer trial [12] to evaluate in HBR patients the safety and efficacy of PCI with very thin-strut BP-DES versus thin-strut DP-DES. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par14"><text><SENT sid="86255" pm="."><plain>The present study is an explorative analysis of the BIO-RESORT trial (Comparison of Biodegradable Polymer and Durable Polymer Drug-Eluting Stents in an All-Comers Population) [TWENTE III]) [12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86256" pm="."><plain>The study design and population, as well as the main 1-year results have been published previously [12, 13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86257" pm="."><plain>In brief, BIO-RESORT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT01674803) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in 3514 all-comers who were treated with PCI. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86258" pm="."><plain>The study was performed at four clinical sites in the Netherlands (Thoraxcentrum Twente, Medisch Spectrum Twente, Enschede; Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem; Haga Hospital, The Hague; Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86259" pm="."><plain>Patients were eligible if they were 18 years or older, capable of providing informed consent, and required a PCI with DES implantation according to clinical guidelines or the operators’ judgment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86260" pm="."><plain>All coronary syndromes were permitted and there was no limit for the number of lesions to be treated or for lesion characteristics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86261" pm="."><plain>Only few exclusion criteria were applied [13]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86262" pm="."><plain>Web-based computer-generated allocation sequences randomly assigned study participants in a 1:1:1 fashion to treatment with a very thin-strut, biodegradable polymer everolimus-eluting stent (Synergy; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA), a very thin-strut, biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (Orsiro; Biotronik AG, Bülach, Switzerland), or a thin-strut, durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity; Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86263" pm="."><plain>For the present analysis, HBR patients treated with BP-DES (i.e., Synergy and Orsiro) were compared to patients treated with DP-DES (i.e., Resolute Integrity). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86264" pm="."><plain>Dual antiplatelet therapy was generally prescribed for 6–12 months, according to international and local guidelines. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86265" pm="."><plain>The only exception was patients on oral anticoagulation therapy, in whom aspirin was usually discontinued after 1–6 months, while clopidogrel was often prescribed for 1 year. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86266" pm="."><plain>The trial complied with the CONSORT 2010 Statement and Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee Twente and the institutional review boards of all participating centers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86267" pm="."><plain>All trial participants provided written informed consent. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par15"><text><SENT sid="86268" pm="."><plain>As there is no generally accepted definition of HBR for patients with coronary artery disease who undergo PCI, we applied the vast majority of HBR criteria applied in previous HBR studies [10, 14, 15], using data available in the BIO-RESORT study database. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86269" pm="."><plain>Patients in the present analysis were classified as HBR if they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: (1) age ≥ 75 years; (2) current use of oral anticoagulation therapy; (3) hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dl; (4) platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3; (5) pevious gastro-intestinal bleeding within last 12 months before the index procedure; (6) previous stroke within 12 months before the index procedure; (7) previous intracranial bleeding; (8) severe renal insufficiency requiring dialysis; (9) current use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86270" pm="."><plain>As (10) planned major surgery in the next 6 months after the index PCI had been an exclusion criterion of the BIO-RESORT trial, none of the BIO-RESORT patients fulfilled this criterion. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86271" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the previous HBR trials, we did not have information of previously diagnosed malignancy and severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) available in our database, and therefore, we might have missed some of these HBR patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86272" pm="."><plain>However, if patients with severe liver disease had reduced levels of hemoglobin or platelet count, they anyway were classified as HBR. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86339" pm="."><plain>In our HBR patients, event rates were lower than in the drug-coated stent arm of LEADERS FREE [14] for: death (all-cause: 3.8 versus 8.0%; cardiac: 1.4 versus 4.2%); MI (any: 2.9 versus 6.1%); revascularization (TLR: 1.6 versus 5.1%; TVR: 2.1 versus 5.8%); stent thrombosis (definite or probable: 0.5 versus 2.2%); and major bleeding (3.3 versus 7.2%) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86340" pm="."><plain>These differences may be explained by dissimilarities in: (1) follow-up duration (360 versus 390 days); (2) MI definitions (extended historical ARC versus third universal definition); (3) DAPT duration (almost two thirds of BIO-RESORT HBR patients still on DAPT after 1 year versus 1 month DAPT in LEADERS FREE); (4) strut thickness (uncoated, 60–91 versus 120 μm) which might be relevant as thicker struts increase stent thrombosis, restenosis, and reintervention risk that theoretically could have contributed to the higher bleeding rate in LEADERS FREE; (5) the number of HBR criteria per patient (1.2 versus 1.7) [14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86341" pm="."><plain>In addition, in our HBR patients, event rates were lower than in the zotarolimus-eluting DP-DES arm of the ZEUS trial [15] for: death (all-cause: 3.8 versus 15.8%; cardiac: 1.4 versus 11.8%); revascularization (TLR: 1.6 versus 5.2%; TVR: 2.1 versus 5.9%); and stent thrombosis (definite or probable: 0.5 versus 2.6%). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86342" pm="."><plain>These higher event rates may partly be explained by the higher risks of re-stenosis and repeat revascularization associated with the use of Endeavor as compared to newer-generation DP-DES [21, 22], while the very high mortality is related to the old age (80.4 years) in ZEUS participants [15]. </plain></SENT>
