<SENT sid="86848" pm="."><plain>However, there is significant variation in the prevalence of these diseases in different regions, suggesting that there may be location-specific factors such as environment and microbial exposure affecting allergic disease prevalence [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86849" pm="."><plain>The difference in rates of allergic diseases between genetically similar populations in different parts of the world further emphasizes the differences in environmental risk factors that may play an influential role in the development of allergy [3]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86850" pm="."><plain>However, most of the literature in the field focused on gut microbiota, with limited information on environmental microbiota and its influence on disease development [4–9]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="86851" pm="."><plain>The hygiene hypothesis states that cleaner environments result in a decrease in “natural” Th1/ Treg-trophic microbial signals resulting in a shift to a pro-inflammatory Th2 environment [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86852" pm="."><plain>It is thought that a lack of exposure to microbial or infectious agents increases the susceptibility to atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and/ or allergic asthma by suppressing the natural development of the immune system [11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86853" pm="."><plain>However, recent literature in the field has been conflicting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86854" pm="."><plain>While there are various studies in different populations demonstrating an inverse relationship between microbial exposure and development of allergic symptoms such as atopy and asthma [12–14], others showed a positive correlation between microbial exposure and allergy [15–18]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86855" pm="."><plain>A study conducted in Germany that analyzed the mattress dust from 489 children showed that increased exposure to a rich microbial environment protects against atopy and asthma in children aged between 6 and 13 years old living in rural and sub-urban environments [12] while another study conducted in USA that recruited children from 308 homes showed an increase in bacterial diversity/abundance in the homes of asthmatic patients, aged 2.4 ± 0.9 years (mean ± SD) [19]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par12"><text><SENT sid="86856" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, most of these studies that specifically investigated the bacterial composition of house dust have dust sampling carried out at a single site, mainly from the bed [12, 20, 21]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86857" pm="."><plain>In addition, the studies are mostly conducted in the Western countries [12, 14, 19, 22–25] where lifestyle and environmental factors differ from Asian countries. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="86858" pm="."><plain>Hence in this study, we determined if there is a difference in microbiota composition, and allergen concentration of household dust collected from 3 different sites in the houses of 25 non-allergic and 25 allergic subjects from the Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort at the 5.5 year follow up. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="86868" pm="."><plain>Allergen sensitization was determined by skin prick testing (SPT) to house dust mite allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Blomia tropicalis) and food allergens (egg, peanut and cow’s milk) at 18, 36 and 60 months. </plain></SENT>
