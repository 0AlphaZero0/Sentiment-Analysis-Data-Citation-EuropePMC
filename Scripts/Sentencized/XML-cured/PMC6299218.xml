</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="87142" pm="."><plain>Argonaute (Ago) proteins play the key role in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in eukaryotes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87143" pm="."><plain>All known eukaryotic Agos (eAgos) bind small RNA molecules and use them as guides for sequence-specific recognition of long RNA targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87144" pm="."><plain>Upon recognition of the target, it can be cleaved by the intrinsic endonuclease activity of the Ago protein (1–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87145" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, Ago proteins, especially the members of the family that lack nuclease activity, can recruit partner proteins to the target RNA, leading to its degradation and/or repression of its translation (5–7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87146" pm="."><plain>Recognition of nascent RNA by some eAgos can also lead to modification of the chromatin structure—DNA and histone methylation—of the target locus (8–10). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87147" pm="."><plain>The proteins that belong to the Ago family are also present in the genomes of many bacterial and archaeal species (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87148" pm="."><plain>Structural and biochemical studies of prokaryotic Agos (pAgos) have provided key insights into the mechanisms of RNAi in eukaryotes and revealed that Ago proteins directly bind short nucleic acid guides and can cleave complementary targets (13–21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87149" pm="."><plain>The same studies showed that pAgos can associate with short DNA guides and preferentially recognize DNA targets, in contrast to all known eAgos (17, 20, 22–28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87150" pm="."><plain>Despite these differences, solved structures of several pAgos and eAgos combined with their sequence alignments revealed a conserved domain organization of these proteins (reviewed in references 12 and 59). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87151" pm="."><plain>All eAgos and all pAgos except one that were experimentally characterized to date possess four domains that are organized in a bilobal structure, with N- and PAZ (PIWI-Argonaute-Zwille) domains forming one lobe and MID (Middle) and PIWI (P-element Induced Wimpy Testis) domains forming another lobe (16, 18, 20, 29–34). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87152" pm="."><plain>The nucleic acids are bound between the lobes; the MID and PAZ domains interact with the 5′ and 3′ ends of the small nucleic acid guide, respectively, and the PIWI domain contains an RNase H-like fold with a catalytic tetrad of conserved amino acid residues involved in the target cleavage (18, 19, 23–25, 27, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87153" pm="."><plain>The N-domain is the least conserved in Ago proteins; it was proposed to facilitate RNA duplex unwinding during guide loading by eAgos (35) and prevent extended duplex formation during target recognition by some pAgos (23). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87154" pm="."><plain>Until now only a few pAgos were characterized by structural or biochemical approaches (see Fig. 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87155" pm="."><plain>At the same time, earlier genomic studies revealed that up to 32% of the Archaea and 9% of the Eubacteria with sequenced genomes contain genes encoding proteins from the Ago superfamily and showed that the diversity of pAgos is far greater than that of eAgos (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87156" pm="."><plain>Indeed, many pAgos contain substitutions of key catalytic residues in the PIWI domain (and are probably inactive), and a large class of pAgos lack the N- and PAZ domains (“short pAgos”), while many pAgos contain additional domains absent in eAgos, either in the same protein or as a part of putative operons. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87157" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, previous studies of the genomic context of pAgo genes revealed that catalytically inactive pAgos are usually associated with several types of nucleases from the SIR2, TIR, PLD, Mrr (which include proteins with novel RecB-like and RecB2 domains), or Cas4 family (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87158" pm="."><plain>Mrr and Cas4 are related to a highly divergent family of PD-(D/E)XK nucleases (36, 37). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87159" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a subclass of pAgos was found in association with Cas1 and Cas2 nucleases within the CRISPR loci (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87160" pm="."><plain>The diversity of pAgos revealed by genomic studies together with few examples of biochemically characterized proteins suggested new cellular functions for these proteins (38–41). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87161" pm="."><plain>Beyond understanding functions of pAgos in their host cells, analysis of pAgos may yield new proteins that can be potentially harnessed for biotechnology, in particular as an alternative to the CRISPR/Cas genome editing tools (42). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87162" pm="."><plain>Previous genomic studies identified a nonredundant set of 261 pAgos (11, 12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87163" pm="."><plain>However, since their discovery the number of bacterial strains with sequenced genomes has more than tripled, and many previously sequenced genomes have been revised, resulting in the removal of some pAgo genes from the databases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87164" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have undertaken comprehensive exploration of the diversity of pAgos using the latest version of the RefSeq protein database for bioinformatic search. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87165" pm="."><plain>The results of the search almost tripled the number of identified pAgo genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87166" pm="."><plain>Our analysis supports the previously reported separation of pAgos into short pAgos and long pAgos (which by themselves can be separated into two distinct clades) and reveals several subclasses with significant differences in the domain organization. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87167" pm="."><plain>These include variations in the MID and PAZ domains involved in guide binding and substitutions of catalytic residues in the PIWI domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87168" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of pAgos, including those that lack intrinsic endonuclease activity, are associated with putative nucleases and other DNA binding proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87169" pm="."><plain>Overall, the great diversity of pAgos revealed by our analysis opens a way for exploration of their biochemical properties and cellular functions, as well as their use as potential tools in genome engineering. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87455" pm="."><plain>The availability of new sequenced genomes allowed identification of an almost 3-fold-larger set of pAgos than previous analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87456" pm="."><plain>Analysis of this expanded set demonstrated that pAgos are highly diverse and can be separated into three large clades, short, long-A and long-B, which diverged early in evolution (Fig. 1B; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87457" pm="."><plain>While this division is based solely on sequence alignments of the MID-PIWI domains, these groups also reveal characteristic variations in specific structural elements involved in nucleic acid binding and processing. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87462" pm="."><plain>The exact relationship between the three clades is ambiguous, with two possible alternative scenarios (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87463" pm="."><plain>In one scenario, short and long pAgos diversified first, followed by a further split of long pAgos into two clades. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87469" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the nucleic acid binding pockets of the MID domain revealed that the majority of pAgos that belong to all three clades (short, long-A, and long-B) likely bind small nucleic acid guides with monophosphorylated 5′ ends. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87470" pm="."><plain>At the same time, we discovered significant variations in the conserved 5′-guide binding motifs in the long-A pAgos, including substitutions of key residues involved in the 5′-phosphate interactions (i.e., YK, YY, KR, YR, MID*, and MID-OH variants). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87471" pm="."><plain>While most these variants likely interact with 5′-P-guides, some proteins might bind guides with an alternative 5′-end structure, as already shown for the MID-OH pAgos, or not use nucleic acid guides at all. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87472" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, almost all members of the short pAgo clade have MID variants that are close to the consensus (HK/RK), suggesting that the canonical MID pocket structure is essential for their function in the absence of the PAZ domain. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87473" pm="."><plain>Future biochemical comparisons of the long and short pAgos with various noncanonical MID motifs should find out if the observed differences in the 5′-end pockets may influence the specificity, affinity, and kinetics of their interactions with guide and target molecules. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87474" pm="."><plain>While all known eAgos use small RNA guides to recognize RNA targets, the majority of proteins in a relatively small sample of pAgos characterized so far prefer to bind small DNA as a guide, except for RsAgo (38) and MpAgo (24), which associate with small RNAs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87475" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, all studied pAgos preferably interact with DNA targets. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87476" pm="."><plain>Few amino acid residues involved in the binding of ribose and deoxyribose backbone of the guide and target molecules were identified in the structures of experimentally characterized pAgos (17, 23–25, 28); however, these residues are not well conserved. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87477" pm="."><plain>Therefore, sequence analysis is not able to predict preference for DNA versus RNA binding, and this information has to be obtained experimentally. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87478" pm="."><plain>The PAZ domain of most studied eAgo and pAgo proteins is composed of two subdomains that together form the 3′-end guide binding pocket (16, 18, 20, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87479" pm="."><plain>However, our results revealed different organizations of the PAZ domain among long pAgos, indicating that a single conserved structure of PAZ may not be required for guide binding. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87480" pm="."><plain>The structure is not conserved even among the few experimentally characterized pAgos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87481" pm="."><plain>While AaAgo and TtAgo contain both subdomains (18, 20), the PAZ* domains of MpAgo and RsAgo lack the second subdomain and therefore do not possess the PAZ pocket (24, 25, 28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87482" pm="."><plain>While no three-dimensional structure of the binary complex is available for RsAgo, the guide 3′ end still interacts with PAZ in the binary complex of MpAgo but is differently oriented (Fig. 4) (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87483" pm="."><plain>Formation of the extended guide-target base-pairing during target recognition is accompanied by guide release from PAZ (19, 23, 24, 26, 48). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87484" pm="."><plain>Thus, structural characteristics of PAZ may have an important role in the recognition and binding of nucleic acid targets by pAgo proteins, for example, by influencing the kinetics of target recognition and cleavage (19, 23, 24, 26, 48, 49). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87485" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the incomplete PAZ* domain is characteristic for the long-B clade of catalytically inactive pAgos, suggesting that the stepwise guide-target annealing controlled by full-length PAZ may be more important in the active long-A pAgos, e.g., for prevention of premature nonspecific target cleavage. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87486" pm="."><plain>All short pAgos and a small but significant fraction of long pAgos lack the PAZ domain entirely, raising the question of how nucleic acid guides can be bound by these proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87487" pm="."><plain>Structural and functional analysis of the truncated long-A AfAgo lacking the PAZ domain demonstrated that it can nevertheless bind and stabilize short guide-target duplexes (14, 15, 22). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87488" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since the guide 3′ end is released from the PAZ domain upon target recognition, PAZ may be important for protection of the guide from cellular nucleases until the target is found—and the protection may be less important for short pAgos or truncated long pAgos that use DNA guides. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87489" pm="."><plain>However, it remains to be established whether any accessory proteins may facilitate guide and target binding by such pAgos. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87490" pm="."><plain>The finding of association between short pAgos and the APAZ domain led to the suggestion that APAZ might play the role of PAZ in short pAgos (11). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87495" pm="."><plain>However, the lack of catalytic activity in PIWI* does not rule out the possibility that such pAgos are involved in processing of target nucleic acids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87496" pm="."><plain>Indeed, our analysis confirmed and expanded previous observations on the association of catalytically inactive pAgo with proteins that might have nuclease activity (11, 12). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87498" pm="."><plain>The proteins in one branch of short pAgos have the SIR2 domain with potential nuclease function, while many more pAgos that belong to the short and long-B clades of catalytically inactive pAgos harbor in their operons separate proteins with predicted nuclease activities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87499" pm="."><plain>The absence of the catalytic tetrad in the PIWI* domain in such pAgos and their tight association with proteins containing SIR2, TIR2, DUF4365 (novel RecB-like nuclease of the Mrr subfamily), RecB2, Cas4, PLD, and HNH nuclease domains suggest that these domains might replace the intrinsic endonuclease activity of the Ago protein. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87500" pm="."><plain>Although the APAZ domain is not related to any nuclease, its strong association with short pAgos and the proteins with nuclease domains suggests that APAZ might also be involved in the nuclease activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87513" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests several possibilities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87514" pm="."><plain>First, transposons may not be the main targets of all pAgos, most of which may instead target phages and plasmids. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87515" pm="."><plain>Second, the presence of pAgos in genomes with increased transposon numbers might be beneficial for these strains because pAgos suppress the transposon expression or their further detrimental transpositions. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87518" pm="."><plain>As reported previously (11, 12) and in this work, the pattern of distribution of pAgos among eubacterial and archaeal species does not correspond to the phylogeny of host species, suggesting their spread by horizontal gene transfer. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87519" pm="."><plain>While we could not build a conserved operon structure for any group of pAgo proteins, their strong association with genes encoding proteins involved in DNA processing suggests their common function and joint horizontal transfer. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87523" pm="."><plain>While it is attractive to suggest that most pAgos use associated nucleic acid guides for sequence-specific recognition of foreign DNA targets in order to repress them, other scenarios of their action are possible as well. </plain></SENT>
