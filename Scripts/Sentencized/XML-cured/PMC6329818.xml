</text></title><p id="Par3"><text><SENT sid="87821" pm="."><plain>Females and males display distinct behavioral patterns. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87822" pm="."><plain>These differences in behavioral patterns are the outcome of the intersex differences in neural circuits1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87823" pm="."><plain>In Drosophila, it has well been documented that sexual dimorphisms in neural circuits result, in principle, from sex differences in the number, structure and function of individual cells composing the circuit2–6. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87824" pm="."><plain>The development of these cellular sex differences relies primarily on either or both of two sex determination genes, fruitless (fru) and doublesex (dsx)5. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87825" pm="."><plain>However, it is largely unknown how fru and dsx produce sex differences in individual cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87826" pm="."><plain>We discovered that the longitudinals lacking (lola) gene is an essential mediator for the fru action to masculinize the mAL cell structure. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87827" pm="."><plain>The lola locus generates extraordinarily large numbers of mRNA variants (Supplementary Fig. 1), each of which encodes a unique protein isoform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87828" pm="."><plain>The majority of Lola isoforms share an N-terminal BTB domain implicated in protein-protein interactions7 and in anchoring ubiquitin proteasome components, followed by an isoform-specific sequence containing a C-terminal zinc finger motif that is a putative DNA-binding region8. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87829" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the fru gene product FruM represents another, BTB-zinc finger protein group, which includes a set of male-specific proteins (i.e., FruAM, FruBM and FruEM: nomenclature according to Ref. 9; Supplementary Fig. 1) that function to masculinize certain neurons10–12 presumably via chromatin remodeling9. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87830" pm="."><plain>For example, FruM represses transcription from roundabout1 (robo1), a negative regulator gene for neuritogenesis, thereby allowing male-specific neurite formation in males13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87831" pm="."><plain>Here we demonstrate that the male-biased Lola29M isoform forms a complex with FruBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87832" pm="."><plain>We further demonstrate that Lola29M is a precursor of the female-specific Lola29F isoform, an N-terminal truncation product of Lola29M that counteracts Lola29M action so as to inhibit male-specific neurite formation in females. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87833" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the male-specific transcriptional repressor FruBM protects Lola29M from its N-terminal truncation, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin1 (Cul1) and 26S proteasome. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87834" pm="."><plain>Thus, by making the masculinizing protein Lola29M resistant to degradation, the male-specific transcription factor FruBM prevents the production of the feminizing protein Lola29F. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87835" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the male program for dimorphic circuit formation turns on and the female program turns off in the male brain. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par4"><text><SENT sid="87836" pm="."><plain>In humans, sexually biased incidence of certain neurological disorders has been well recognized, yet the origin of such sex differences remains largely an enigma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87837" pm="."><plain>For instance, the male-to-female incidence ratios have been reported to vary from 1.37 to 3.7 in Parkinson’s disease, the etiology of which likely involves mitochondrial dysfunction due to defects in the proteasomal degradation system14. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87838" pm="."><plain>Our finding in Drosophila that the neuronal sex-type specification involves proteasomal protein processing will shed light on the hitherto unknown mechanistic link among posttranslational protein modification, neural sex differentiation and complex neurobehavioral traits under normal and disordered conditions. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par5"><text><SENT sid="87841" pm="."><plain>To obtain insights into the mechanism of fru actions on neural sex-type specification, we here screened for fru modifier genes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87842" pm="."><plain>In this screen, we took advantage of a gain-of-function effect of fru+ to disrupt the compound eye structure when overexpressed in the developing eye disc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87843" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide searches for genes that can modify the fru eye phenotype were conducted by the Gene-Search (GS) system15. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87844" pm="."><plain>In this system, a P-element vector carrying the GAL4-responsive DNA sequence UAS (the GS-element) was randomly inserted into the genome of a fly so that transcription units that happened to flank the GS-element insertion could be transcribed in the presence of an arbitrarily chosen GAL4 transgene (Supplementary Fig. 2a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87845" pm="."><plain>This study used GMR-GAL4 to drive transcription via the GS-element as well as UAS-fruB+ in the developing eye disc (Supplementary Fig. 2b), yielding several enhancers of the fruB+-induced eye phenotype, which included lola (Supplementary Fig. 2c-e; for other fru modifiers see Ref. 16). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87846" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a loss-of-function lola mutation dominantly suppressed the fru-induced distortion of the eye (Supplementary Fig. 2f,g). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87847" pm="."><plain>In subsequent analyses, we will focus on lola because: (1) it encodes proteins of the BTB-zinc finger superfamily to which Fru also belongs and (2) its functions in neurite guidance have been well established17. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87848" pm="."><plain>Indeed, we found that reduced courtship toward a female in fru hypomorphic males was dominantly enhanced by two different lola null alleles (lola03089 and lolaORE76), which are both homozygous lethal18,19 (Fig. 1a), and lola knockdown per se attenuated male courtship activities (Fig. 1b). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par6"><text><SENT sid="87861" pm="."><plain>We suspected that Fru (more specifically, FruBM, see below) might affect expression of lola to exert its neural masculinizing effect in, for example, sexually dimorphic mAL interneurons in the brain (Supplementary Fig. 2h), although no sex differences in the structure or expression of Lola isoforms has been reported and despite the numerousness of Lola isoforms identified to date20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87862" pm="."><plain>To obtain hints as to which of the Lola isoforms might have a role in the fru-dependent sexual differentiation, we examined possible effects of isoform-specific knockdown for isoforms 11, 17, 22, 26, 28 and 29, for which UAS-RNAi transgenic strains were publicly available, and found that isoforms 22 and 29 interfered with the sex-specific development of fru-expressing neurons (see below). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87863" pm="."><plain>Our extensive analyses of Lola expression with an antibody raised against an exon29-specific sequence (anti-Lola-exon 29; Supplementary Fig. 3) revealed two isoforms, Lola29M of ~110kD and Lola29F of ~80kD, the relative amounts of which were different between the sexes in wandering stage third instar larvae (Fig. 1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87864" pm="."><plain>The isoform containing the sequence encoded by exon 29 was formally designated as type-Q20. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87865" pm="."><plain>We found that Lola29M is more abundant in males than females whereas Lola29F is detectable only in females (Fig. 1d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87866" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining of the wandering-stage larval CNS with the anti-Lola-exon 29 antibody revealed that Lola29M/F expression is confined to differentiating neurons, including those expressing FruM, but not detected in neuroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87867" pm="."><plain>The Lola29M and Lola29F isoforms shared exon29, which was connected to the same 5’ exons, and transcribed from the same promoters. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87868" pm="."><plain>Because no sex difference was detected in the mRNA species with exon 29 by 5’ and 3’ RACE (Supplementary Fig. 5), the size difference between the Lola29F and Lola29M proteins was considered to result from posttranslational modification of a protein product. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87869" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, fru mutant (fruM-) males that are null for male-specific FruM proteins expressed the female-specific Lola29F isoform with a concomitant reduction in Lola29M (Fig. 1c, d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87870" pm="."><plain>In contrast, females sexually transformed into males by the transformer1 (tra1) mutation lost Lola29F with an elevated level of Lola29M (Fig. 1c, d). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87871" pm="."><plain>These results imply that the posttranslational modification of the Lola protein is under the control of the sex-determination cascade downstream of tra and fru. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par7"><text><SENT sid="87873" pm="."><plain>To examine whether female-specific Lola29F is a truncation product of male-enriched Lola29M, we attempted to determine the structures of Lola29F and Lola29M and the mechanism whereby these two isoforms are produced in a sex-dependent manner. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87874" pm="."><plain>We presumed that Lola29F might be a proteolytic product of Lola29M. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87875" pm="."><plain>To test this idea, we overexpressed a lola29m gene decorated with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal V5 tag in flies under the control of fru-GAL4, and analyzed the lysates from CNS cells by western blotting with antibodies against HA and V5 (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87876" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, the anti-V5 antibody detected a shorter band similar to Lola29F (referred to as Lola29F-like hereafter) in addition to the full-length Lola29M, whereas the anti-HA antibody detected only the latter (Fig. 1e). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87877" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the difference between the two isoforms must reside in their N-termini. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87878" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of a series of N-terminal deletants of lola29m in fru-GAL4-positive cells resulted in the expression of mutant Lola29 proteins; deletion of the N-terminal 300 (Δ1-300) residues yielded a single band of a size similar to that of Lola29F on western blots (Fig. 1f). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87879" pm="."><plain>We infer that Lola29F is produced by the truncation of Lola29M somewhere between residues 250 and 300 of Lola29M, and later analyses by Edman degradation revealed that this is indeed the case (see below). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par8"><text><SENT sid="87880" pm="."><plain>Because lola plays an important role in neurite patterning, the effects of lola knockdown on courtship behavior (Fig. 1b) likely result from a disturbance in the formation of courtship circuits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87881" pm="."><plain>It has been established that FruM plays a key role in the courtship circuit formation in the male CNS, and some of the fru mutant defects in mating behavior have been ascribed to impairments of sex-specific development of fru-expressing neurons10–12. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87882" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to examine the possible role of Lola29F/M on the courtship circuit formation, we next examined fru-expressing mAL interneurons, which exhibit remarkable sex-differences (Supplementary Fig. 2h), which have been shown to play a role in the processing of sex pheromone information21–23. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87883" pm="."><plain>One of the prominent sex differences found in mAL neurons is the absence (in females) or presence (in males) of the ipsilateral neurite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87884" pm="."><plain>In a subsequent analysis, therefore, we focused on the male-specific ipsilateral neurite formation, where male-specific FruM directly represses transcription of robo1 in males, thereby allowing mAL neurons to extend the male-specific neurite13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87885" pm="."><plain>Gain of the male-specific ipsilateral neurite (i.e., masculinization) in females or fruM-null mutant males can be assessed in neuroblast clones that contain up to 5 mAL neurons, because none of the mAL neurons in control females and control fruM-null males possesses this neurite. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87886" pm="."><plain>Loss of the male-specific neurite (i.e., feminization) in males, in contrast, is only detectable in single-cell clones, because any remaining ipsilateral neurite of unaffected cells hinder the neurite loss from affected cells13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87887" pm="."><plain>We therefore examine neuroblast clones for quantifying the masculinizing effect of genetic manipulations and single-cell clones for the feminizing effect. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="87890" pm="."><plain>Notably, the expression of RNAi targeting lola-exon29 markedly increased the formation of mAL neurons without the male-specific ipsilateral neurite in male mAL neurons (Fig. 1m-q). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87891" pm="."><plain>It is noteworthy that the lola-exon29 RNAi used here effectively inhibited Lola29M production in flies, which retained a high level of expression of other lola isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 6). </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88045" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that males have only the full-length protein Lola29M, because male-specific FruBM binds to Lola29M and protects it from truncation, whereas females have, in addition to full-length Lola29M, N-terminally truncated Lola29F due to the absence of FruBM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88046" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, the Lola29M action is inhibited by Lola29F in females. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88048" pm="."><plain>Female neurons (left-hand side) lack FruBM, and consequently Lola29F is produced in sufficient abundance to impede the masculinizing action of Lola29M, leading to the production of mAL neurons without the ipsilateral neurite. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88052" pm="."><plain>The robo1 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, Robo130, which is a key effector to prevent the male-specific ipsilateral neurite from forming in females13. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88053" pm="."><plain>Lola29M induces the male-specific ipsilateral neurite by transcriptional repression of robo1 (acting as a negative regulator of neuritogenesis) in males, whereas Lola29F appears to compete with Lola29M, allowing robo1 to be transcribed, and as a result, Lola29F blocks the male-specific neurite formation in females. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88056" pm="."><plain>It might be that Lola29M and FruBM each bound to their own binding sites interact in trans, leading the robo1 promoter to a conformation unfavorable for transcriptional activation. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88058" pm="."><plain>We also showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul1 is required for the N-terminal truncation of Lola29M, and that the male-specific neurite formation is induced by Cul1 knockdown in female mAL neurons. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88066" pm="."><plain>An intriguing possibility is that Lola proteins are vulnerable to rapid degradation through ubiquitination, unless their ubiquitination target sites are masked by a binding partner, such as FruBM, that interacts through the BTB domain. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="88069" pm="."><plain>A growing body of evidence indicates that fate changes in a variety of cell lineages in both vertebrates and invertebrates are induced by rapid epigenetic remodeling by chromatin regulators, such as BTB-zinc finger transcription factors, some of which are known to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to the chromatin-modifying complex and thus alter its ubiquitination pattern. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88070" pm="."><plain>It is therefore plausible that the proteolytic removal of the N-terminal BTB domain from these transcription factors within the chromatin-modifying complex is a prevalent means to convert the epigenetic marks. </plain></SENT>
