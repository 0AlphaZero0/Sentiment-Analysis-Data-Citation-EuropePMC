</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="88809" pm="."><plain>Domains are fundamental subunits of proteins, and while they play major roles in facilitating protein–DNA, protein–RNA and other protein–ligand interactions, a systematic assessment of their various interaction modes is still lacking. A comprehensive resource identifying positions within domains that tend to interact with nucleic acids, small molecules and other ligands would expand our knowledge of domain functionality as well as aid in detecting ligand-binding sites within structurally uncharacterized proteins. Here, we introduce an approach to identify per-domain-position interaction ‘frequencies’ by aggregating protein co-complex structures by domain and ascertaining how often residues mapping to each domain position interact with ligands. We perform this domain-based analysis on ∼91000 co-complex structures, and infer positions involved in binding DNA, RNA, peptides, ions or small molecules across 4128 domains, which we refer to collectively as the InteracDome. Cross-validation testing reveals that ligand-binding positions for 2152 domains are highly consistent and can be used to identify residues facilitating interactions in ∼63–69% of human genes. Our resource of domain-inferred ligand-binding sites should be a great aid in understanding disease etiology: whereas these sites are enriched in Mendelian-associated and cancer somatic mutations, they are depleted in polymorphisms observed across healthy populations.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88817" pm="."><plain>The rate at which new genomes are sequenced has long since outpaced our ability to experimentally characterize the biological functions of the encoded genes and their protein products. Leveraging the fact that similar protein sequences or subsequences tend to share similar functions, computational approaches have been developed to mitigate this sequence-to-function discrepancy by rapidly detecting and modeling the sequence similarity between proteins (1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88819" pm="."><plain>Such homology-driven analyses of large-scale protein sequence databases have revealed many thousands of recurrent, probabilistically modelable protein subsequences called ‘domains’ (2–4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88820" pm="."><plain>These sequence-derived domains correspond to evolutionarily and functionally related substructures of proteins and are found in various modular combinations within proteins from species across the tree of life (5). <p><text><SENT sid="88821" pm="."><plain>Individual protein domains are associated with specific functionalities, among the most important of which are mediating the interactions proteins make with nucleic acids, other proteins and various other molecules in the cell. Indeed, protein–DNA and protein–RNA interactions have been found to occur via domain interfaces so frequently that factors associated with transcriptional and post-transcriptional activity are regularly classified according to their incorporation of particular nucleic acid-binding domains (6,7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88823" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant proportion of protein–protein interactions in signaling pathways are mediated by modular binding domains (8). <p><text><SENT sid="88824" pm="."><plain>Although simply knowing which domains mediate various ligand interactions has already accelerated our ability to annotate protein functions (9), pinpointing the ligand-contacting positions within these domains would enable a more precise analysis of the many thousands of sequenced proteins across species that contain domain instances but lack further biological characterizations. Indeed, more comprehensive knowledge of protein interaction interfaces will have considerable implications for investigating the evolution and natural variation of interaction network connectivities (10), for determining the mechanistic impact of coding variants (11), for prioritizing germline and somatic perturbations to uncover disease etiology (12,13), and for designing targeted therapeutic drugs (14). <p><text><SENT sid="88826" pm="."><plain>Identifying positions within domains that interact with ligands from sequence alone is nontrivial, as a minority of positions within a domain may be involved with ligand binding, and these positions may not be proximal with respect to the linear protein sequence (e.g. of 264 positions in the tyrosine kinase domain, only 16 non-contiguous positions contact adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) (15). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88827" pm="."><plain>Further, while some ligand-binding positions are largely invariant across domain instances—for example, the zinc-contacting positions in the Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) domain are required for proper domain folding and thus are highly conserved—other binding positions are not: amino acids within DNA-contacting positions in these same C2H2-ZF domains, for example, vary dramatically across domain instances to confer diverse binding specificities, and thus cannot be identified by conservation-based analyses (16). <p><text><SENT sid="88828" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, analyses of three-dimensional structures of proteins co-complexed with ligands are highly accurate in identifying positions comprising interaction interfaces. Previously, co-complex structures of a single or a few manually-selected domain instances have been used as models to distinguish domain positions involved in ligand binding from those that are not (17,18). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88830" pm="."><plain>However, binary classifications of domain binding positions determined from single structures are not always generalizable; indeed, analyses of structurally distinct instances of some domain families have revealed that the positions involved in binding peptides or other domains can vary (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88831" pm="."><plain>As such, although various databases have associated domain families with corresponding structures and bound ligands, particularly in the context of domain–domain interactions, they have largely avoided attempts to systematically determine, across multiple ligand types, the positions within these domains that mediate interactions (19–23). <p><text><SENT sid="88832" pm="."><plain>Here we introduce a robust, large-scale structural aggregation approach to systematically identify positions within domains that are likely to interact with ligands. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we analyze over 91000 protein–ligand co-complex structures in the context of domains and develop a proximity-based scoring function that determines real-valued ligand-binding frequencies across individual positions in 4128 domains; we compute per-position binding frequencies separately for DNA, RNA, peptide, ion, metabolite and other small molecule ligands. Second, we show via cross-validation testing that the resultant per-domain-position binding frequencies can accurately reveal positions that bind ligands in held-out structures. Third, we utilize these Interaction Domains, which we refer to collectively as the InteracDome, to infer interaction sites across ∼63% of human genes with high confidence, and up to ∼69% of human genes more broadly; this represents the most comprehensive resource of this type to date. Fourth, we uncover that these domain-inferred interaction sites across human proteins exhibit significant functional constraints: they are depleted for natural variants across healthy human populations, while they are enriched for Mendelian disease-associated and cancer somatic mutations. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how our InteracDome resource can be leveraged to provide valuable, medically-relevant insights by detecting and interpreting the mechanistic effects of disease-associated coding mutations. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title><text><SENT sid="88839" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88841" pm="."><plain>In this section, we describe our framework for systematically evaluating how different positions within domains are involved in mediating various ligand interactions. Briefly, we first obtain from BioLiP (24) a comprehensive collection of structures of proteins co-complexed with various ligands (Figure 1A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88843" pm="."><plain>Each of these structures contains the three-dimensional locations of all atoms within a protein chain and all atoms within a ligand; the protein chains are also represented linearly as sequences of amino acids. We then use probabilistic sequence matching to find instances of protein domains within these protein sequences (Figure 1B). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88845" pm="."><plain>For those domain families with instances across multiple protein sequences, we aggregate their instances into a multiple sequence alignment such that each column of the alignment corresponds to a ‘core’ domain position (i.e. a match state in the corresponding HMM profile (2)), and each row corresponds to a different domain instance (Figure 1C). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88846" pm="."><plain>Next, we analyze the structure corresponding to each domain instance. For each amino acid residue in that instance corresponding to a core domain position, we calculate the minimum Euclidean distance between any of the atoms in that residue’s side chain to any atoms in a ligand. This process leaves us with a distribution of minimum residue-to-ligand distances observed across structural instances for each domain position (Figure 1D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88849" pm="."><plain>Finally, we distill each of these per-domain-position distance distributions into a single ‘binding frequency’ value that reflects that domain position’s tendency to bind a particular ligand (Figure 1E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88850" pm="."><plain>We describe each of these steps in more detail next. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="88851" pm="."><plain>Workflow for computing per-position binding frequencies for domains.

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88861" pm="."><plain>We classify BioLiP ligands into biologically relevant groups. Protein residues responsible for determining DNA- and RNA-binding specificity often contact nucleic acid bases, whereas residues that primarily contact the backbones of nucleic acid molecules may be more important for the stability and affinity of the binding complex (17,26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88863" pm="."><plain>As BioLiP groups all DNA and RNA ligand molecules together, we reanalyze the original co-complex structures to characterize ligand atoms based on the presence (RNA) or absence (DNA) of the 2’-hydroxyl in the ribose sugar; these ligands respectively occur in 2718 and 4377 co-complex structures. We further group these ligand atoms into RNA base, RNA backbone, DNA base or DNA backbone. <p><text><SENT sid="88865" pm="."><plain>The 123 ligands from 38234 co-complex structures with ‘ion’ in their full names are assigned to the ion group; the remaining 23829 ligands from 64918 co-complex structures are grouped as small molecules. BioLiP already excludes molecular artifacts from crystallization buffers, yet does not explicitly differentiate cognate (i.e. naturally occurring in vivo) from non-cognate ligands. To highlight domain positions whose residues comprise metabolically relevant and/or potentially druggable binding pockets, we further categorize small molecules as follows. Any small molecule ligand with a Tanimoto coefficient ≥ 0.9 (Open Babel Package, v2.4.1) (27,28) between its SMILES string (wwPDB’s Chemical Component Dictionary, v3.30) and the SMILES strings of one of 102 639 endogenous human metabolites (Human Metabolome Database, v4.0) (29) and/or 9296 drugs (DrugBank, v5.1) (30) is respectively classified as metabolite and/or druglike; these ligand types respectively occur in 35262 and 42947 co-complex structures. We note that previously a Tanimoto coefficient cutoff of 0.9 was shown to efficiently reduce molecular database search spaces while still enabling accurate molecule matching (31); further, we find that cutoffs as low as 0.8 to classify small molecules as metabolite and/or druglike do not substantially alter the numbers of domains found to be in complex with these ligand types. </sec><sec id="SEC2-4"><title><text><SENT sid="88870" pm="."><plain>Computing proximity-based positional binding frequencies </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88871" pm="."><plain>We define the representable set of domain–ligand interactions as those with at least one corresponding domain–ligand co-complex structure in BioLiP. We require that these structures give coordinates for residue side-chain atoms—as opposed to just backbone carbon atoms—but do not otherwise consider structural resolution. For each domain in the representable set, we assess the ligand-binding frequencies of individual domain positions by aggregating protein–ligand atom proximity information across their corresponding co-complex structures (Figure 1C–E). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88874" pm="."><plain>For structures that have multiple chains or chain orientations with identical sequences, we select the single chain with the smallest Euclidean distance to the ligand of interest. For each instance of the domain in a BioLiP structure that contains at least one residue in contact with a particular ligand type, for each of its residues corresponding to a Pfam domain match state, we compute the minimum Euclidean distance between heavy (i.e. non-hydrogen) side-chain atoms to any heavy ligand atom. We aggregate these distances by domain position across all BioLiP instances for the same domain–ligand type pair, resulting in a per-domain-position distribution of minimum distances to the ligand (Figure 1C–D). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88877" pm="."><plain>We next determine what fraction of these distances are within 3.6Å of the ligand (Figure 1E); however, to proportionally minimize the contribution of structural instances with highly redundant sequences, we apply the Henikoff and Henikoff sequence weighting scheme (32) to the domain instances. Thus, intuitively, our per-domain-position binding frequency computes the (weighted) fraction of times a residue in that position is within 3.6Å of the ligand type considered. Note that the distance of 3.6Å will capture both hydrogen bonds (2.6–3.3Å) and van der Waals contacts (2.8–4.1Å), but will eliminate water-mediated interactions (as in (33)). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88880" pm="."><plain>We find that residue-to-ligand proximity cutoffs between 2.5 and 5.0Å do not substantially alter which positions have the top 10–15% of ligand-binding frequency values per domain. </sec><sec id="SEC2-5"><title><text><SENT sid="88881" pm="."><plain>Cross-validation testing of domain-to-ligand distance consistencies and positional binding frequencies </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88882" pm="."><plain>We refer to each domain–ligand type pair with at least three distinct (i.e. non-redundant) sequences across separate PDB entries as belonging to the representable-NR set. For each domain–ligand pair in the representable-NR set, we evaluate both the consistency of its structural interface as well as the accuracy of our aggregation approach in identifying ligand-binding positions in cross-validation. <p><text><SENT sid="88884" pm="."><plain>First, to evaluate consistencies of domain–ligand structural interfaces, for each domain–ligand pair in the representable-NR set, we first randomly split its structural instances into two folds. We next compute, across all instances within each fold, the average minimum residue-to-ligand distance at each domain position. Finally, we compute the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) between the two resulting domain-length vectors. We report the average PCC achieved across ten repetitions of this process as the consistency of the domain–ligand structural interface. <p><text><SENT sid="88888" pm="."><plain>Second, to test the power of our approach in identifying binding positions across previously unseen domain instances, for each domain–ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we randomly divide its structural instances into up to 10 folds. For each domain instance i in each hold-out fold in turn, we examine the structure to assign a binary vector where 1 and 0 respectively indicate domain positions whose residues are or are not in contact with the ligand (i.e. as annotated by BioLiP). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88890" pm="."><plain>Binding frequencies are then calculated as before from instances in the remaining folds. For each position in each instance in the hold-out fold, we use the corresponding positional binding frequency, computed from the other folds, as its ‘score.’ We then rank in descending order all positions within the hold-out fold by score, with higher ranking positions corresponding to the more confident predictions of binding. As we iteratively decrease the score threshold used to predict whether a position is binding, we compute precision and recall with respect to the known binding (true positive) and non-binding (true negative) positions inferred from the actual structures in the held-out set. This allows us to compute a precision-recall curve (PRC) for each domain–ligand interaction. We refer to the set of domain–ligand interactions that achieved a cross-validated precision of at least 0.5 at some threshold as the confident set. We also compute the area under under the PRC (AUPRC), and compare it to an average baseline AUPRC corresponding to the fraction of binding positions in the held-out set. <p><text><SENT sid="88896" pm="."><plain>We note that instances of the same domain family have by definition clearly identifiable sequence similarity and thus can have highly similar amino acid sequences. Nevertheless, as an alternate cross-validation test, for each domain–ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we also try to divide all its instances within BioLiP into groups such that the amino acid sequence identity between instances in different groups is &lt;90%. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88898" pm="."><plain>We repeat the steps above to determine domain–ligand structural consistencies and cross-validated precisions and recalls by dividing these groups of BioLiP instances with sequence identity ≥90%—rather than individual instances—into folds as before; these results are reported in the ‘Supplementary Data’ section. </sec><sec id="SEC2-6"><title><text><SENT sid="88899" pm="."><plain>Human protein, natural variation and disease mutation datasets </plain></SENT>

We determine if K—the number of sites of interest observed to overlap with the putative binding sites—is significantly greater than or less than we would expect by chance by respectively computing Pr(X ≥ K) and Pr(X ≤ K) using the Poisson binomial implemented in R’s poibin package (39).

<SENT sid="88923" pm="."><plain>Of these, 2375 domain families have at least three non-redundant instances in complex with the same ligand type across distinct PDB structures; these domain–ligand interactions comprise the representable-NR set. Within the representable set of domain interactions, 564 domain families are co-complexed with DNA, 490 are co-complexed with RNA, 830 are co-complexed with other peptides, 2557 are co-complexed with ions and 2847 are co-complexed with one or more small molecules. In the representable-NR set, 257, 244, 299, 1204 and 1634 domain families are respectively co-complexed with DNA, RNA, peptides, ions and/or small molecules. Note that the same domain family can be found to interact with multiple ligand types (e.g. the RRM domain interacts with both DNA and RNA across instances). <sec id="SEC3-1"><title><text><SENT sid="88927" pm="."><plain>Case studies: InteracDome includes well-known interaction domains and recapitulates known ligand-binding domain positions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88928" pm="."><plain>We begin by ascertaining how well the interaction domains profiled in the InteracDome cover known ligand-binding domains. Toward this end, we compiled a list of 54 DNA-binding domain families from the Thornton Lab review (40), 12 RNA-binding domain families from the review by (41) and 78 human peptide-binding domain families listed on the Pawson Lab site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pawsonlab.mshri.on.ca">http://pawsonlab.mshri.on.ca</ext-link>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88930" pm="."><plain>We find that our representable set of domain–ligand interactions includes all the DNA-binding domain families, all the RNA-binding domain families and ∼85% of postulated protein-binding domain families, many of which have been particularly difficult to structurally characterize due to the low affinity and transience of protein–protein interactions in signaling pathways (42). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88931" pm="."><plain>Of these known ligand-binding domains, 42 (78%) DNA-binding domains, 9 (75%) RNA-binding domains and 47 (60%) peptide-binding domains are found in the representable-NR set; these numbers are 42 (78%), 8 (67%) and 43 (55%), respectively, for known ligand-binding domains found in the confident set. <p><text><SENT sid="88932" pm="."><plain>Next, we turn our attention to how well our per-domain-position binding frequencies identify manually curated ligand-binding domain positions. In particular, domain positions involved in ligand binding have previously been established for a few well-studied domains using one or a few structural co-complexes. Intuitively, our method automates this approach at a much larger scale; thus, we expect that domain positions assigned high binding frequencies by our method will largely be in agreement with previous knowledge of domain binding. We highlight below a few well-studied nucleic acid-, peptide- and metabolite-binding domains to show that indeed, when we compare InteracDome binding frequencies with literature-curated knowledge of domain–ligand binding, domain positions with high binding frequency values recapitulate known interaction positions. <p><text><SENT sid="88936" pm="."><plain>We first consider three nucleic acid binding domains. The C2H2-ZF domain is known to specify its DNA targets via four DNA-base contacting positions (-1, 2, 3 and 6 in the α-helix contacting DNA) (33); these four positions have the highest DNA base-binding frequencies for this domain in the InteracDome. Additionally, there are two highly conserved cysteines and histidines that coordinate the zinc ion—required for proper domain folding—and these four positions have our highest ion-binding frequencies (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88939" pm="."><plain>In the DNA-binding homeodomain, our highest DNA base-binding frequencies correspond to positions 45–46, 49–50 and 53–54 in the DNA recognition helix, followed by positions 1–4 in the N-terminal arm (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1b); these are known specificity-determining positions in the domain (18,43). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88940" pm="."><plain>In the RNA-binding pumilio domain, the highest RNA base-binding frequencies are found in positions 14, 16, 17 and 20 of the repeating α-helix section (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S1c). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88941" pm="."><plain>Indeed, positions 16, 17 and 20 confer RNA-binding specificity, and position 14 contacts RNA backbone ribose rings, likely affecting binding (26). <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="88942" pm="."><plain>Examples of domains scored according to ligand-binding frequency.

In the WW domain, our highest peptide-binding frequencies are found at positions 17, 19, 21, 24, 26 and 28—all corresponding to known binding residues. The next highest peptide-binding frequencies identify positions 8, 10 and 11—all known to confer binding specificity differences between type I and IV domains (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S1d) (44). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88947" pm="."><plain>Sites with high binding frequencies for the SH3 domain are also relevant for peptide binding. In particular, positions with the highest binding frequency values are 4, 6, 32 and 47—the four most conserved peptide-binding sites—and positions 9–13, 27–30, 34 and 45—all known to be important for distinct peptide-binding specificities (Figure 2E and Supplementary Figure S1e) (45). <p><text><SENT sid="88949" pm="."><plain>Finally, our approach also recapitulates ATP-binding positions in the kinase domain. Our high small molecule binding frequencies include several residues from subdomains I–VII that are responsible for interacting with and anchoring ATP’s adenine ring (i.e. positions 7, 15, 28, 77–80, 84), α, β and γ phosphates (i.e. positions 11–13, 30, 128, 141), and ribose hydroxyl group (i.e. position 127) (15). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="88953" pm="."><plain>We next show, in a systematic analysis, that structural interfaces between domains and their ligands in the representable-NR set tend to be conserved. Briefly, we compare the residue-to-ligand distances across different structural instances of a domain–ligand interaction type to each other (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88955" pm="."><plain>We find that analogous positions across domain instances indeed tend to have similar distances to ligands: the median PCC of domain–ligand interactions is 0.98 and the PCC ≥ 0.8 for 91% of domain–ligand interactions (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88956" pm="."><plain>Thus, domains tend to have highly consistent structural interaction interfaces with the same ligand type across instances. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="88957" pm="."><plain>Domain-to-ligand distance consistencies.

Relative domain-to-ligand distances across domain positions tend to be highly consistent between structural instances of the same domain–ligand pair. Total number of domain–ligand interactions included in each boxplot are listed above the corresponding distributions. </caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1224fig3"/></fig></SecTag><p><text><SENT sid="88962" pm="."><plain>As we have just shown, domains generally tend to interact with their ligands in a relatively consistent fashion. However, some interaction domains are also known to have multiple binding modes, where different combinations of domain positions are in contact with the ligand (44,45); these cases cannot be detected by examining structural domain instances in isolation, but may be revealed using our aggregation approach. To get a better idea of how much domain positions vary with respect to their roles in ligand binding, for each domain–ligand type pair in the representable-NR set, we use empirical bootstrapping of structural instances with 1000 repetitions to obtain standard errors of all binding frequencies. Smaller standard errors indicate a domain position’s consistent role in binding, whereas larger bootstrapped standard errors indicate that the measured binding frequency of that position is highly dependent upon the specific groups of structures being considered, and thus the position plays a more variable role in ligand binding. Importantly, standard errors tend to be low for the full range of ligand-binding frequencies (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3a). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88967" pm="."><plain>Moreover, as expected, positions with more extreme binding frequency values (i.e. ≥0.95 or ≤0.05) tend to have lower standard errors. Conversely, positions with intermediate binding frequencies also exhibit more variation in their estimates in bootstrapped samples. We also show that with more sequentially-distinct structural examples of domain–ligand complexes, the standard errors of computed binding frequencies decrease overall (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S3b). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88970" pm="."><plain>This latter finding indicates that aggregating information across structural domain instances allows us to infer which positions within domains bind particular ligands more confidently than we could if we were limited to only one or a few structural examples. We note that whereas positions with positive binding frequencies are, by definition, known to interact with ligands in some contexts, positions with 0-value binding frequencies may also sometimes be involved in binding, but are not yet represented in the set of solved structures. Thus, overall, we expect that our aggregation approach will continue to improve as more structures of previously unobserved domain binding modes are experimentally determined. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="88973" pm="."><plain>Bootstrapped standard errors of binding frequencies.

To measure this, we employ cross-validation to compute PR curves for each domain–ligand pair in the representable-NR set, and compare the AUPRCs to corresponding baseline AUPRCs (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88981" pm="."><plain>We find that the average (across folds) actual AUPRCs are typically substantially higher than their corresponding baseline AUPRCs, particularly for domain–ion interactions which tend to involve far fewer domain binding positions and thus have lower baseline AUPRCs (median fold improvement of actual over baseline AUPRCs = 19.9, fold improvement ≥ 5 for 94.2% of domain–ligand interactions, Figure 5A). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="88982" pm="."><plain>We also note that the cross-validated precisions for domain–ligand type pairs in the representable-NR set tend to be high across a range of binding frequency cutoffs (Figure 5B). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89101" pm="."><plain>We have introduced here a fully automated approach for aggregating protein co-complex structural data in the context of domains to reveal how positions within these domains are generally involved in mediating interactions with DNA, RNA, ions, peptides, metabolites and other small molecules (Figure 1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89102" pm="."><plain>This collection of 4128 interaction domains, called the InteracDome, can be applied to pinpoint putative interaction sites in various proteins across species; here we show how a subset of 2152 domains with confident ligand interactions can be used to infer functionally relevant interaction sites across the greatest proportion of human genes to date (Figure 6A). <p><text><SENT sid="89103" pm="."><plain>Previously, interaction site information has been transferred from structurally modeled proteins to uncharacterized proteins with similar sequences or subsequences using various homology-based approaches (13,46,47). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89104" pm="."><plain>Sequence motifs have also been semi-manually annotated with highly conserved metal ion binding or catalytic site information for use in identifying functional sites in new proteins, although such approaches are limited due to their rigid sequence match requirements (54). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89105" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the ability of traditional homology-based approaches to infer binding information across larger, more diverse sets of protein sequences using existing structural templates is restricted in general because even as the number of resolved protein structures is increasing, the diversity of their sequences is not. Here, we develop a structurally-aware, domain-based approach to calculate real-valued binding frequencies across individual domain positions. These probabilistically-modeled domain profiles are better able to capture conserved residues required for proper domain folding and thus can be used to accurately transfer binding site knowledge across a far more diverse set of proteins. <p><text><SENT sid="89108" pm="."><plain>Determining the binding positions within these domains represents a challenging task due to biases inherent in structural data: structures often harbor confounding experimental artifacts, are dominated by non-cognate drug interactions, and can have highly redundant sequences to each other (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89109" pm="."><plain>We show that by addressing each of these issues in turn, our systematic approach models binding positions across thousands of domains—including nearly all known DNA-, RNA- and peptide-binding domains—that are highly indicative of ligand-binding positions in well characterized domains as well as in structural instances that were held out in cross-validation testing (Figures 2 and 5). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89110" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we find that aggregating domain co-complex structures to develop a general understanding of how a domain participates in interactions is superior to using only one or a few structures for this task (Figure 4B). <p><text><SENT sid="89111" pm="."><plain>Some domains can bind different types of ligands, though one of these may be rare or nonstandard; for instance, the C2H2-ZF and HTH domains predominantly bind DNA but sometimes bind RNA or peptides. Other domains may bind the same ligand type via multiple, diverse binding modes; for example, though the PAZ domain primarily binds RNA, the positions within the domain mediating RNA interactions vary across structural instances. We mitigate these two concerns in our aggregation approach by conservatively restricting domain–ligand interactions to those with substantial structural representation that bind consistently across instances as demonstrated via cross-validation testing (i.e. ‘confident’ domain–ligand interactions). <p><text><SENT sid="89114" pm="."><plain>Substantial previous work has focused on detecting and characterizing the domain–domain interactions that mediate a number of protein–protein interactions across cellular interaction networks (19,55–58). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89115" pm="."><plain>We make the distinction that in our work, we focus not on detecting the particular domain-mediated interfaces between specific protein partners, but rather on understanding which positions within protein domains mediate a variety of interactions in general with nucleic acids, peptides, metabolites, and a wide range of small molecules. Though we do not consider proteins in complex with other whole proteins here, our framework can be naturally extended to characterize domain–domain interactions in more depth. <p><text><SENT sid="89117" pm="."><plain>Overall, we believe that our structural aggregation framework and resultant InteracDome resource lay the groundwork for many future domain-centric analyses and thus will be of broad use for the community. Not only can knowledge of domain binding positions be used to further group, subtype, subdivide or functionally annotate domain families themselves, but the putative interaction sites inferred across proteins using the InteracDome should be relevant in understanding disease etiology. Indeed, we find that these sites are globally conserved across healthy human individuals yet preferentially perturbed in tumor samples and disease populations. As such, we anticipate that future approaches that utilize InteracDome to detect interaction-altering protein coding variants will be a great aid in both prioritizing disease-associated mutations as well as reasoning about their molecular effects. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><text><SENT sid="89121" pm="."><plain>Supplementary Material </plain></SENT>
