</text></title><p id="Par10"><text><SENT sid="89240" pm="."><plain>Gut microbiota (GM) composition is known to strongly influence host health by a wide range of mechanisms ranging from control of immune functions [1], metabolic homeostasis [2, 3] and drug metabolism [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89241" pm="."><plain>Even if generally stable within a species, the GM composition is strongly impacted by environmental exposure (nutrition, xenobiotics and infection) and any modification of this ecosystem can affect host health by altering the symbiotic relationship existing between the host and its gut microbes [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89242" pm="."><plain>For instance, presence of an opportunistic pathogen in the digestive tract can be asymptomatic but also induce severe health damage. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89243" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, infection is generally associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the digestive track [6], but the impact of such modification on the host metabolism and development of symptom such as weight loss is still poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89244" pm="."><plain>Improvement of symptoms is generally observed post antibiotic treatment due to reduction in the number of pathogenic bacteria and the decline of the sequelae of their infection. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89245" pm="."><plain>However, antibiotic use is also associated with a reduction of GM diversity that has been linked to further host metabolic weakening [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par11"><text><SENT sid="89246" pm="."><plain>Avian intestinal Spirochaetosis (AIS) is caused by the colonization of bird’s lower digestive tract by the pathogen Brachyspira pilosicoli (phylum Spirochaetes; class Spirochaetes; order Spirochaetales; family Bracyspiraceae) [8, 9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89247" pm="."><plain>The bacterium attaches to the cell wall and may trigger diarrhea associated with decreased growth rate and egg production [10]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89248" pm="."><plain>The most common treatment used to tackle infection is Tiamulin™, an antibiotic of the pleuromutilin family that inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S region of the ribosome [11, 12]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89249" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies have evaluated its efficiency in chickens despite its intensive use to treat avian flocks in industry [13, 14]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89250" pm="."><plain>To date this disease and its treatment have been little studied and remain poorly understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89251" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the cause for symptoms such as weight loss and decreased egg production are still unclear. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89252" pm="."><plain>In a recent study [15], the efficiency of three doses of Tiamulin™ to treat laying hens orally challenged with B. pilosicoli B2904 was evaluated and revealed that infection was associated with decreased growth rate and that birds treated with Tiamulin™ recovered from infection regardless of the dose used while weight maintenance was only observed in response to the two highest doses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89253" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Tiamulin™ reduced significantly other infection-associated symptoms as well as systemic spread of B. pilosicoli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89254" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, three weeks after antibiotic treatment ended, colonization of the digestive track by the pathogen was still observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89255" pm="."><plain>Thus, we concluded that this study represented an interesting infection model to understand host systemic metabolic and gut microbiota response to colonization of the digestive tract by a pathogen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89256" pm="."><plain>In addition, the experimental design allows a longitudinal exploration of the effects of antibiotic treatment on a superorganism (i.e. the host and its gut microbiota). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89257" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we present results obtained following the analysis of biopsy and biofluid samples collected during the previous study [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89258" pm="."><plain>To evaluate host systemic metabolic response to infection and antibiotic treatment we used 1H-NMR-based metabolomics that allows a non-targeted evaluation of metabolic fluctuations occurring in biological systems. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89259" pm="."><plain>As the gut microbiota are inextricably linked to host’s metabolic responses, its composition in response to infection and treatment was monitored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S NGS). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89260" pm="."><plain>Both analyses provided new insights into the impact of infection and antibiotic treatment on host health, explaining physiological response to both bacterial and chemical exposure. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="89319" pm="."><plain>Gastro-intestinal infections often trigger gut microbiota dysbiosis, as does treatment by antibiotics [21, 22]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89320" pm="."><plain>Gut microbiota composition is recognized for having an important role to play in host growth and severe dysbiosis can be responsible for abnormal development [23, 24]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89321" pm="."><plain>We determined that the intervention study aiming at an evaluation of the efficacy of Tiamulin™ against AIS [15] would allow us to evaluate whether the decreased growth rate associated with infection was triggered by caecal microbiota dysbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89322" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that modifications of the gut microbiota by infection would result in modulations of host metabolic homeostasis that was corrected in this study using Tiamulin™ treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89323" pm="."><plain>Materials used for this paper were sampled from a study that showed significantly decreased growth rates amongst other clinical sequelae of egg laying chickens in response to B. pilosicoli infection [15]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par26"><text><SENT sid="89324" pm="."><plain>The infection resulted in an increase in Proteobacteria of which many are opportunistic pathogens associated with increased risk of diarrhea. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89325" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, Proteobacteria enrichment has been associated with metabolic syndrome [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89326" pm="."><plain>Increase in Proteobacteria has previously been observed in response to Penicillin in mice that was linked to increased body weight, percentage fat mass and diabetes incidence [26]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par27"><text><SENT sid="89327" pm="."><plain>In the present study, infection and bacterial dysbiosis were concurrent with profound host systemic metabolic changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89328" pm="."><plain>The range of tissues affected by infection (liver, spleen, kidney and plasma) indicates a systemic metabolic response of the organism to B. pilosicoli colonization and dysbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89329" pm="."><plain>Interestingly increased glycerol levels were noticeable in all aforementioned compartments. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89330" pm="."><plain>Systemic glycerol increase is a marker of lipolysis in adipose tissues where triglycerides are lysed into free fatty acids and glycerol by lipase enzymes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89331" pm="."><plain>Glycerol is then released in the general circulation to be used as a glucose precursor in the liver and/or the kidney. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89332" pm="."><plain>This mechanism is generally activated by prolonged low plasma glucose levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89333" pm="."><plain>In addition, GI infection can impair glucose absorption due to gut barrier disruption and it thus possible that this phenomenon was also triggered by reduced intestinal glucose uptake. B. pilosicoli is known to strongly disrupt the intestinal wall [27], which was further supported by the observation of higher glucose levels in feces of infected birds. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89334" pm="."><plain>The increased polysaccharides in feces may also be associated with the ability of B. pilosicoli to degrade mucin [28–30]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89335" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the concomitant increase in butyrate and acetate observed during the infection attests higher carbohydrate fermentation and therefore a modification of the GM metabolic activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89336" pm="."><plain>Plasma glucose concentration is highly controlled and regulated since its level needs to be maintained to sustain essential functions such as brain and muscular activity. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89337" pm="."><plain>To maintain glucose levels gluconeogenesis from glycerol is activated during fasting, which requires fat storage to release non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol in plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89338" pm="."><plain>This reduction of fat mass is likely to be related to the decreased growth rate observed in chickens colonized by B. pilosicoli [15, 31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89339" pm="."><plain>However, the drop in plasma glucose level observed at PM2 following recovery of glycerol levels, suggests that this alternative metabolic pathway cannot sustain the energy demand for a long time. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par28"><text><SENT sid="89340" pm="."><plain>Complete recovery of host metabolic homeostasis in response to infection was reached at the end of the study (PM3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89341" pm="."><plain>This coincided with a net decrease in percentage of infected birds in all groups [15] and a stabilization of the caecal microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89342" pm="."><plain>Hence, symptoms and noticeable metabolic responses of the host to infection occurred only when microbiota dysbiosis was observed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89343" pm="."><plain>Such an observation suggests that both presence of the pathogen and modification of gut microbial community are necessary to trigger host metabolic responses. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89344" pm="."><plain>The idea that the GM might act as a buffer regulating host metabolic response to infection by a pathogen has been partially explored by Khosravi et al. [32], who showed that Helicobacter pylori infection triggered a stronger host metabolic response (modification of insulin, ghrelin and leptin levels) in germ free mice than in conventional animals and that infection-induced decreased growth rate was only observed in absence of GM. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89345" pm="."><plain>This tolerance to pathogen has been associated with the training of the immune system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89346" pm="."><plain>Thus, an infection can be considered as a response to an ecosystem variation rather than to colonization by a single pathogen. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par29"><text><SENT sid="89347" pm="."><plain>In this set of results, Tiamulin™ was able to reduce infection-induced metabolic response, the betaine increase and glucose drop in plasma. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89348" pm="."><plain>Although a dose response was observed on the level of infection measured by positive swabs [15], this was not true for the plasma betaine levels. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89349" pm="."><plain>It is likely that increased betaine levels in response to infection was related to the central osmoprotectant role of this molecule [33]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89350" pm="."><plain>Betaine has been used previously as food supplement for chickens due to its ability to protect the gut barrier against pathogens such as Coccidia [34]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89351" pm="."><plain>Indeed, B. pilosicoli cell invasion induces swelling and disturbance of the osmotic balance [9, 27]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89352" pm="."><plain>Increased quantities of betaine (generally coming from kidneys) may therefore be transported from other tissues towards the gut barrier via general circulation explaining its increased level in plasma. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par30"><text><SENT sid="89353" pm="."><plain>We observed that normal ‘metabolic aging’ (decreased HDL/VLD and glucose plasma levels) occurring at puberty was accelerated by Tiamulin™ treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89354" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, decreased of the HDL/VLDL ratio and glucose levels in the general circulation have been associated with increased levels of steroid hormones and more specifically progesterone [35–37]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89355" pm="."><plain>Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A, an important enzyme family present in the liver involved in drug detoxification) are involved in steroid hormone metabolism (progesterone, estrogen and testosterone). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89356" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was shown in several studies that a decrease in CYP3A activity generally resulted in increased plasma steroid hormone concentrations [38–40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89357" pm="."><plain>Antibiotics are active molecules that can interact directly with the host if able to cross the gut barrier. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89358" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that Tiamulin™ interacts with CYP3A, forming a complex that results in the inactivation of the cytochrome in vitro and in vivo [41–44]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89359" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the observed pre-puberty metabolic shift resulted from the interaction of Tiamulin™ with progesterone metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89360" pm="."><plain>This was further supported by the fact that egg laying onset, which highly depends on steroids metabolism maturation, occurred earlier in the two groups receiving the highest doses of Tiamulin™ [15]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89361" pm="."><plain>Altogether, this supports the potential interaction of Tiamulin™ with steroid metabolism. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par31"><text><SENT sid="89362" pm="."><plain>Finally, the lipoprotein shift may also be caused by the gut microbiota modifications due to antibiotic treatment. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89363" pm="."><plain>The host-GM metabolic interplay has been widely investigated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89364" pm="."><plain>Indeed, many studies have reported that obesity and energy metabolism homeostasis are strongly associated with gut microbiota composition [24, 45–47]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89365" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the use of antibiotics before puberty in humans and mice can be associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders due to modulations of the gut microbiota [26, 48, 49]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89366" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a low Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio has been reported to be related to a lean phenotype and lower risk of developing disorders characterized by modification of cholesterol metabolism [2, 50, 51]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89367" pm="."><plain>However, this is contrary to our observations which suggests that the VLDL/HDL modification detected might be driven by the Tiamulin™ itself rather than by microbiota modifications: whether this is a generalizable phenomenon for some or all classes of antibiotic is clearly very worthy of future study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89368" pm="."><plain>Also we need be mindful that other bacterial changes may be responsible for modification of cholesterol metabolism: indeed some lactic acid bacteria are known to be able to metabolize cholesterol [52] and their use as feed supplement in broiler chickens resulted in decreased plasma cholesterol concentrations [53]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89369" pm="."><plain>Hence, further experimentation would be needed to tease these aspects apart. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par32"><text><SENT sid="89371" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates that gut microbiota composition can be associated with perturbations of host systemic metabolism that lead towards phenotypical changes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89372" pm="."><plain>We observed that infection was associated with dysbiosis, decreased nutrient absorption and host energy metabolic disorder that resulted in significantly reduced growth rate. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89373" pm="."><plain>Two systemic biomarkers of infection were identified as glycerol and betaine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89374" pm="."><plain>Increased systemic glycerol clearly illustrated host metabolic adaptation to intestinal infection directed towards providing sufficient energy supplies for survival. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89375" pm="."><plain>However, impaired weight gain was still observed presumably, as glycerol was likely to be supplied from adipose tissue. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89376" pm="."><plain>In addition, symptoms due to colonization by the pathogen were only observed when associated with gut microbial dysbiosis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89377" pm="."><plain>This finding strongly supports the potential protective role of the gut microbiota against opportunistic pathogens. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89378" pm="."><plain>This indicates that further studies should be undertaken to understand the ecological context in which a pathogenic bacterium might become harmful for its host. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89379" pm="."><plain>In this study, the antibiotic treatment reduced infection and associated symptoms while modifying cholesterol metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89380" pm="."><plain>From our results, and previously published work we hypothesized that host metabolic response to antibiotic treatment resulted from a co-occurring modification of the gut microbiota composition and steroids metabolism. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89381" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that impact of antibiotic consumption on host energy metabolism should be studied as a response of a direct interaction and through mediation of the gut microbiota. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89382" pm="."><plain>Finally, antibiotic triggered a decrease in α-diversity followed by dysbiosis that might lead to higher vulnerability to colonization by pathogen and favor relapse. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89383" pm="."><plain>Therefore, antibiotic treatment coupled to food supplements such as pre/pro/symbiotic should be considered in order to recover a ‘healthier’ gut microbiota post intervention. </plain></SENT>
