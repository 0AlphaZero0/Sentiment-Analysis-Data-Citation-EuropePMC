</text></title><p><SecTag type="ABS"><text><SENT sid="89533" pm="."><plain>Eustigmatophytes, a class of stramenopile algae (ochrophytes), include not only the extensively studied biotechnologically important genus Nannochloropsis but also a rapidly expanding diversity of lineages with much less well characterized biology. Recent discoveries have led to exciting additions to our knowledge about eustigmatophytes. Some proved to harbor bacterial endosymbionts representing a novel genus, Candidatus Phycorickettsia, and an operon of unclear function (ebo) obtained by horizontal gene transfer from the endosymbiont lineage was found in the plastid genomes of still other eustigmatophytes. To shed more light on the latter event, as well as to generally improve our understanding of the eustigmatophyte evolutionary history, we sequenced plastid genomes of seven phylogenetically diverse representatives (including new isolates representing undescribed taxa). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89537" pm="."><plain>A phylogenomic analysis of plastid genome-encoded proteins resolved the phylogenetic relationships among the main eustigmatophyte lineages and provided a framework for the interpretation of plastid gene gains and losses in the group. The ebo operon gain was inferred to have probably occurred within the order Eustigmatales, after the divergence of the two basalmost lineages (a newly discovered hitherto undescribed strain and the Pseudellipsoidion group). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89539" pm="."><plain>When looking for nuclear genes potentially compensating for plastid gene losses, we noticed a gene for a plastid-targeted acyl carrier protein that was apparently acquired by horizontal gene transfer from Phycorickettsia. The presence of this gene in all eustigmatophytes studied, including representatives of both principal clades (Eustigmatales and Goniochloridales), is a genetic footprint indicating that the eustigmatophyte–Phycorickettsia partnership started no later than in the last eustigmatophyte common ancestor. </p></abstract><SecTag type="KEYWORD"><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>acyl carrier protein</kwd><kwd>Eustigmatophyceae</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>Ochrophyta</kwd><kwd>Phycorickettsia</kwd><kwd>plastid genome</kwd></kwd-group></SecTag><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program</named-content></funding-source><award-id>642575</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Czech Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100001824</named-content></funding-source><award-id>18-13458S</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Feasibility Programme</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Science Foundation</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/100000001</named-content></funding-source><award-id>DEB1145414</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><SecTag type="INTRO"><sec sec-type="intro"><title><text><SENT sid="89541" pm="."><plain>Introduction </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89542" pm="."><plain>Eustigmatophytes are an interesting group of unicellular, primarily freshwater algae. These organisms generally have a simple coccoid morphology, yet they exhibit a suite of cytological and biochemical features making them unlike any other algal taxon (Eliáš et al. 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89545" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetically they constitute a well-delineated lineage, typically classified as an independent class of ochrophytes, a prominent algal phylum that emerged within the stramenopiles by acquisition of a plastid (pt) through a higher-order endosymbiotic event (Dorrell et al. 2017; Dorrell and Bowler 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89547" pm="."><plain>Although recognized as a separate phylogenetic unit nearly five decades ago, eustigmatophytes were long considered a relatively insignificant taxon with limited species diversity and minor ecological importance (Graham et al. 2009). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89549" pm="."><plain>Hence, until recently, research on fundamental aspects of eustigmatophyte biology was essentially limited to taxonomic studies that slowly expanded the number of eustigmatophyte taxa, combined with basic characterization of eustigmatophyte morphology, ultrastructure, and composition of photosynthetic pigments (reviewed in Eliáš et al. [2017]). <p><text><SENT sid="89551" pm="."><plain>More recently, a renewed interest in algae as resources for biotechnologies has sparked an extensive research program on eustigmatophytes, but attention has been given almost exclusively to a single eustigmatophyte lineage traditionally classified as the genus Nannochloropsis (e.g., Ma et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89553" pm="."><plain>These studies include not only physiological, biochemical, and cell biological investigations but also application of genomic approaches yielding complete or draft genome sequences for nearly all species of the genus (Pan et al. 2011; Radakovits et al. 2012; Vieler et al. 2012; Corteggiani Carpinelli et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89559" pm="."><plain>For the sake of taxonomic accuracy, it should be stressed that two Nannochloropsis species have recently been segregated into a separate (yet related) genus Microchloropsis (Fawley et al. 2015), so the whole group will hereafter be referred to as the Nanno-/Microchloropsis clade. <p><text><SENT sid="89561" pm="."><plain>In this article, we are primarily concerned with pt genomes. The first eustigmatophyte pt genomes were sequenced as part of the genome project for Microchloropsis (then Nannochloropsis) gaditana (Radakovits et al. 2012), but more detailed analyses came only with two subsequent studies that collectively provided pt genome sequences from nearly all known species of the Nanno-/Microchloropsis group (Wei et al. 2013; Starkenburg et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89566" pm="."><plain>These investigations yielded a number of important findings concerning the gene repertoire of pt genomes in eustigmatophytes and indicated the degree of variation in their pt genome architecture and coding capacity across different species of the single eustigmatophyte lineage. However, a question remained as to what extent the findings from the Nanno-/Microchloropsis clade are representative of eustigmatophytes across their actual phylogenetic breadth. <p><text><SENT sid="89568" pm="."><plain>Eustigmatophytes are indeed much more than Nannochloropsis. Presently, the class comprises ∼30 species classified in 15 different genera, but molecular markers obtained from a number of unidentified isolates revealed a much higher taxonomic diversity that yet needs to be properly studied (Fawley et al. 2014; Eliáš et al. 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89572" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetically, the class is deeply divided into two major monophyletic clades, one of them being the order Eustigmatales and the other presently referred to as the clade Goniochloridales. This clade was defined according to the PhyloCode but (for technical taxonomic reasons) so far lacks a standing in the traditional Linnaean taxonomy governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Fawley et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89574" pm="."><plain>However, for the purpose of this study, we will consider the group having the same rank as the order Eustigmatales and will refer to it simply to as Goniochloridales (not italicized). <p><text><SENT sid="89575" pm="."><plain>The order Eustigmatales includes all eustigmatophytes defined by the pioneering work of Hibberd (1981), whereas Goniochloridales comprise more recently recognized eustigmatophytes, including taxa transferred to eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes based on molecular and other supporting evidence (e.g., Přibyl et al. 2012; Fawley and Fawley 2017) or described anew (Nakayama et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89578" pm="."><plain>However, the majority of known Goniochloridales representatives are unidentified algal isolates, many of which probably represent species and genera yet to be described (Fawley et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89580" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rRNA and rbcL gene sequences led to the recognition of four main (generally well supported) Goniochloridales lineages, specifically the genus Pseudostaurastrum and clades IIa, IIb, and IIc, but their relationships remain unresolved (Fawley et al. 2014; Fawley and Fawley 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89582" pm="."><plain>Eustigmatales include three robustly supported main clades. One of them corresponds to the family Monodopsidaceae (which includes the Nanno-/Microchloropsis group and other taxa), whereas the other two lineages are not yet recognized in the formal taxonomy of the group and are informally referred to as the Eustigmataceae group and the Pseudellipsoidion group (Fawley et al. 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89585" pm="."><plain>18S rDNA phylogenies suggest that the Pseudellipsoidion group is basal to the other two lineages, but this branching order is only moderately supported (Eliáš et al. 2017; Fawley and Fawley 2017; supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), whereas the rbcL marker suggests the basal position of Monodopsidaceae (supplementary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89589" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses based on more markers are clearly needed to resolve the relationships within both Eustigmatales and Goniochloridales. <SecTag type="FIG"><fig id="evz004-F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><sc>Fig</sc>. 1.</label><caption><p><text><SENT sid="89590" pm="."><plain>—Eustigmatophyte phylogeny inferred from pt genome data.

As part of a such an endeavor, we recently reported on both pt and mitochondrial (mt) genomes of three eustigmatophytes representing three lineages progressively more distantly related to the Nanno-/Microchloropsis group, namely the genus Monodopsis, the Eustigmataceae group, and the Goniochloridales clade IIa (Ševčíková et al. 2015, 2016; Yurchenko et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89601" pm="."><plain>These data enabled us to obtain various additional interesting insights into the evolution of the eustigmatophyte organellar genomes as such, as well as of eustigmatophytes themselves. For example, by carrying out a phylogenomic analysis utilizing pt genome data from three eustigmatophytes representing both principal clades of the group, that is, Eustigmatales (Nannochloropsis oceanica and Microchloropsis gaditana) and Goniochloridales (Trachydiscus minutus), we could solidify the phylogenetic relationship of eustigmatophytes to other ochrophytes, supporting their classification within the group Limnista together with chrysophytes (Ševčíková et al. 2015). <p><text><SENT sid="89604" pm="."><plain>The most striking discovery came, however, with sequencing the pt genomes of Vischeria sp. CAUP Q 202 and Monodopsis sp. MarTras21. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89607" pm="."><plain>Both turned out to harbor a unique six-gene cluster never seen before in any pt genome, yet homologous to a novel operon, denoted ebo. The operon occurs in diverse bacteria and encodes enzymes of an uncharacterized biochemical pathway that was hypothesized to produce a specific secondary metabolite (Yurchenko et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89610" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the ebo operon was introduced via a single horizontal transfer event into the pt genome of a common ancestor of Vischeria and Monodopsis, implying its secondary loss from the Nanno-/Microchloropsis lineage (Monodopsis is more closely related to this lineage than to Vischeria). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89611" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the putative donor of the ebo operon was suggested to be a bacterium belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes (Yurchenko et al. 2016). <p><text><SENT sid="89613" pm="."><plain>An interesting new twist in this story came with our recent discovery of a novel bacterial endosymbiont of T. minutus and characterization of its genomes (Yurchenko et al. 2018). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89615" pm="."><plain>The endosymbiont, described as Candidatus Phycorickettsia trachydisci (P. trachydisci for short), represents a new genus-level lineage of the family Rickettsiaceae, a group of obligate intracellular endosymbionts, primarily parasites, of various eukaryotes. Close relatives of P. trachydisci were detected in several other eustigmatophytes, representing both Goniochloridales and Eustigmatales, suggesting a widespread and possibly specific association of the Phycorickettsia lineage with eustigmatophytes. Most strikingly, the P. trachydisci genome also harbors a copy of the ebo operon (uniquely among the whole order Rickettsiales) and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the ebo operons from P. trachydisci and eustigmatophyte pt genomes are specifically related. We proposed that eustigmatophytes gained the ebo operon from their rickettsiacean endosymbiont, which was the actual recipient of the operon from a Bacteroidetes-related donor. Given the presumed antiquity of the transfer event from Phycorickettsia to the pt genome of the Vischeria and Monodopsis ancestor, we hypothesized that Phycorickettsia and eustigmatophytes have been engaged in a long-term evolutionary partnership (Yurchenko et al. 2018). <p><text><SENT sid="89621" pm="."><plain>Further studies are obviously required to test this hypothesis. One of the key questions is how widespread the ebo operon is in eustigmatophyte pt genomes. Knowing this is critical for pinpointing the operon transfer event in eustigmatophyte phylogeny and may also give insights into the functional significance of the presence of the ebo operon. To answer this question, pt genome data from a wider array of phylogenetically diverse eustigmatophyte lineages are needed. With this in mind, we used the Illumina technology to generate large volumes of DNA sequence data from several phylogenetically diverse eustigmatophytes, which allowed us to extract and assemble complete sequences of their pt genomes. We exploited the new sequences to build a robust “backbone” phylogeny of the group and to address salient questions of pt genome evolution, including but not restricted to the origin and distribution of the ebo operon. In addition, analyses of partial nuclear genome data generated alongside the pt genome sequences enabled us to shed light on specific aspects of coevolution of the pt and nuclear genomes in eustigmatophytes, providing an unexpected new insight into the history of Phycorickettsia–eustigmatophyte interaction. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="89628" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>

Full assemblies of seven pt genome sequences were obtained manually with the aid of iterative read mapping with Bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) onto intermediate and final assemblies. The presence of two copies of inverted repeats was considered, supported by the coverage of the respective scaffolds being two times higher than scaffolds representing single-copy regions of the same pt genome. Finally, all assemblies were validated by visual inspection of mapped reads in Tablet 1.14.04.10 (Milne et al. 2013). </sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="89668" pm="."><plain>Annotation of pt Genome Sequences </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89767" pm="."><plain>The highly improved sampling of eustigmatophyte pt genomes and the robustly resolved phylogeny of the group enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the changes of the pt gene content in the eustigmatophyte lineage in an unprecedented detail. We start with a description of the inference of the ancestral eustigmatophyte pt gene complement. A gene was considered ancestral if it was present in at least some representatives of both principal eustigmatophyte groups (Eustigmatales and Goniochloridales) or if it was shared by pt genomes of at least some eustigmatophytes and another algal group. <p><text><SENT sid="89770" pm="."><plain>This reasoning yielded at least 167 genes, including 135 protein-coding genes (counting the split clpC gene as two separate genes, see below) and 32 genes specifying noncoding RNAs evidently present in the pt genome of the last eustigmatophyte common ancestor (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89771" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of them are typical conserved genes with readily identifiable orthologs in other taxa, whereas establishing orthology of a few genes required a more careful analysis. Specifically, the expanded sampling now enabled us to recognize that the eustigmatophyte gene previously referred to as orf60 (Yurchenko et al. 2016) is in fact an ortholog of secG. The assignment is supported by an HHpred search and a position of the gene just downstream of petM that is shared with many other ochrophyte pt genomes. Considering synteny as a clue we were able to identify a previously missed (unannotated) secG gene in the pt genomes of pelagophytes, Heterosigma akashiwo, and Ochromonas sp. CCMP 1393 (supplementary fig. S11, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89778" pm="."><plain>The secG gene thus belongs to the core of ubiquitous ochrophyte pt genes (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). <p><text><SENT sid="89779" pm="."><plain>Another update concerns the eustigmatophyte gene previously referred to as orf403/457 (Yurchenko et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89781" pm="."><plain>The gene is rapidly evolving, as evident from the fact that simple BlastP searches are not sensitive enough to reveal homology of the respective sequences from distantly related eustigmatophytes, and no candidate homologs outside eustigmatophytes could previously be identified even when using more sensitive methods. However, the substantially expanded sampling of orf403/457 sequences improved the sensitivity of an HHpred search, which suggested homology of the C-terminal half of the Orf403/457 protein to the Pfam TIC20 family (PF16166) with the probability value &gt;90. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89783" pm="."><plain>The TIC20 family includes not only the key component of the TIC translocon at the inner plastidial membrane but also the Ycf60 protein encoded by pt genomes of several algal groups including rhodophytes, haptophytes, and, notably, some ochrophytes, namely phaeophytes and xanthophytes (Le Corguillé et al. 2009), but arguably not eustigmatophytes (Yurchenko et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89786" pm="."><plain>To better understand the distribution of the ycf60 gene in ochrophytes, we employed the known Ycf60 sequence from the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus as a query for a PSI-Blast search, which led to the identification of previously unrecognized ycf60 genes in pt genomes of pelagophytes and the bolidophyte Triparma laevis. Interestingly, the ycf60 gene in the T. laevis pt genome is positioned (in the head-to-head orientation) next to the secA gene, exactly as the “orf403/457” gene in strain Mont 10/10-1w and P. edaphicum CAP Q 401; the relative position of secA and “orf403/457” in other eustigmatophytes differs only by an insertion of an extra gene (orf1_eust and orf1_gon, see below) between them (supplementary fig. S12A, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89789" pm="."><plain>In addition, the pt genome from Ochromonas sp. CCMP 1393 includes an unannotated gene (orf215) occupying the same position with respect to secA as the ycf60 gene in T. laevis and eustigmatophytes (supplementary fig. S12, Supplementary Material online) yet lacking any significant hits when investigated by BlastP. We aligned it with homologs identified in chrysophyte transcriptome assemblies and carried out an HHpred search, which indicated homology to the TIC20 family with the probability value &gt;94. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89793" pm="."><plain>The respective eustigmatophyte and chrysophyte proteins all include multiple predicted transmembrane helices, similar to known Ycf60 proteins (supplementary fig. S12, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89795" pm="."><plain>The most parsimonious interpretation of these observations is that the eustigmatophyte “orf403/457” and the chrysophyte “orf215” genes are highly divergent forms of the ancestrally present ycf60 gene; hence, we reannotated them accordingly. The functional significance of the N-terminal extension acquired by the eustigmatophyte Ycf60 proteins (see supplementary fig. S12, Supplementary Material online) remains unknown. <p><text><SENT sid="89798" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that the eustigmatophytes are the only ochrophyte lineage that has retained the ycf49 gene in their pt genome (Ševčíková et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89800" pm="."><plain>Here, we not only document that this still holds true despite the substantially improved sampling of the ochrophyte pt genomes, but we unveil one more such gene. The trnL(caa) gene, so far known only from the T. minutus pt genome (Yurchenko et al. 2016), has orthologs in other Goniochloridales as well as two of the newly sequenced Eustigmatales species (P. edaphicum and C. acuta), so we can infer that it was present in the ancestral eustigmatophyte pt genome (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89803" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite being absent from all other ochrophyte pt genomes sequenced so far, it has homologs in pt genomes from some other algal groups, including red algae and cryptophytes. The similarly patchy distribution of ycf49 led Dorrell and Bowler (2017) to propose that the gene was introduced into the eustigmatophyte lineage by a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) event, so the same explanation is analogously applicable to the trnL(caa) gene. However, as previously discussed for ycf49 (Ševčíková et al. 2015) and as pointed to here for trnL(caa), both genes in eustigmatophyte pt genomes occupy positions that are syntenic with the location of the genes in pt genomes of other algae. Specifically, ycf49 is flanked by petL and ycf4 in both eustigmatophytes and cyanidiophytes, and trnL(caa) is upstream of the sufB gene in both eustigmatophytes and cryptophytes. In our view, this favors the scenario invoking vertical inheritance of these genes in the eustigmatophyte lineage (and multiple losses in other ochrophytes) over the alternative explanation employing HGT. <p><text><SENT sid="89809" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the eustigmatophyte pt genomes do include genes that seem to have been created or acquired more recently. We previously documented stepwise additions to the pt gene number in the Limnista lineage by fragmentation of the ancestral clpC gene, initiated by separation of regions encoding the N- and C-terminal parts of the ClpC protein before the divergence of chrysophytes and eustigmatophytes, followed by separation of the region encoding the very N-terminal domain of the ClpC protein in the eustigmatophyte stem lineage (Ševčíková et al. 2015). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89812" pm="."><plain>Our expanded sampling documents that the state with the three separate genes encoding different parts of the ClpC protein is common to all eustigmatophytes (supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). <p><text><SENT sid="89813" pm="."><plain>Further potential novelties of the eustigmatophyte pt genome are found among some of the remaining unidentified ORFs. One encodes a protein of ∼120 amino acids conserved in all eustigmatophyte pt genomes sequenced (supplementary fig. S13, Supplementary Material online), but we could not identify any candidate homologs outside of this group even when using HHpred or when considering its position relative to other genes as a clue. Following the convention for naming conserved pt genes of unknown function (Hallick and Bairoch 1994) and considering ycf94 being the most recently described gene in this category (Song et al. 2018), we designate the respective ORF as ycf95. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89818" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the encoded Ycf95 mediates some eustigmatophyte-specific pt function, but we cannot rule out the possibility that ycf95 is a highly divergent ortholog of some of the standard pt genes apparently missing from eustigmatophytes (such as some of the broadly conserved ycf genes; supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). <p><text><SENT sid="89819" pm="."><plain>All eustigmatophytes, except for P. edaphicum and the strain Mont 10/10-1w, additionally exhibit an unidentified ORF located at the syntenic position upstream of the ycf60 gene (supplementary figs. S3–S9, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89821" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the encoded protein sequences supports homology of the ORFs within Goniochloridales and within Eustigmatales, but there is no indication (other than synteny) that the proteins would be homologous across eustigmatophytes as a whole. Hence, it remains unclear whether this is an ancestral eustigmatophyte gene that has followed very different evolutionary trajectories in the two main eustigmatophyte lineages, or whether the ORFs emerged independently in Goniochloridales and Eustigmatales. Given this uncertainty, these genes are provisionally annotated as orf1_gon and orf1_eust, depending on which undeniable group of homologs they belong to. </sec><sec><title><text><SENT sid="89824" pm="."><plain>Pinpointing the Acquisition of the ebo Operon in Eustigmatophyte Evolution </plain></SENT>

However, differential occurrence of 4.5S RNA in ochrophyte plastids (with eustigmatophytes not considered) was noticed previously and the absences were linked to specific mutations in the protein SRP component, the protein cpSRP54, that presumably abolish the ability of the protein to bind the RNA partner (Träger et al. 2012). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="89909" pm="."><plain>Gene loss from organellar genomes is a pervasive phenomenon, but each individual loss raises a question whether and how it is functionally compensated. Some losses may manifest a degree of inherent redundancy of the system. For example, the loss of the trnL(caa) gene from several Eustigmatales probably reflects the ability of the product of the trnL(uaa) gene (common in eustigmatophyte pt genomes) to decode the UUG codon thanks to wobble pairing of the first anticodon position with the third codon position. Other losses of pt genes perhaps signify true loss of the respective functionality, entailing simplification of metabolic or regulatory functions in the organelle. Finally, specific adaptations providing direct or alternative functional complementation are associated with still other organellar gene losses. These are typically ensured by targeting into the organelle specific proteins encoded by nuclear genes, often homologous to the missing pt genes. We exploited available nuclear genomic data from diverse representatives of the group (both published genome assemblies from Nanno-/Microchloropsis species and the partial data obtained by us as part of the pt genome sequencing) to illuminate the functional significance of the gene losses that have impacted eustigmatophyte pt genomes. For the sake of focus, we ignored losses that seem to predate the divergence of eustigmatophytes from other ochrophyte classes. We searched for homologs of the missing pt genes and evaluated the presence of the characteristic N-terminal bipartite presequence that would indicate plastid targeting. The results are summarized in table 2 and the most interesting cases are discussed below. <p><text><SENT sid="89919" pm="."><plain>In most cases, no functional compensation is readily apparent in the eustigmatophyte genomic data. One example is the ilvH gene inferred to have been lost in the eustigmatophyte stem lineage (fig. 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89921" pm="."><plain>The IlvH protein is a regulator of acetohydroxyacid synthase, an enzyme coded for by the ilvB gene (present in eustigmatophyte pt genomes) and catalysing the committed step of the branched amino acid biosynthesis. It was previously noted that the ilvH gene is likewise absent from the Nannochloropsis nuclear (and mt) genomes (Starkenburg et al. 2014), and we now extend this observation to eustigmatophytes as a whole. Similarly, neither of the losses specific for different eustigmatophyte subgroups, except for acpP (see the next section), seem to have been compensated by emergence of nucleus-encoded pt-targeted versions of the respective proteins, suggesting genuine lineage-specific simplification of the plastidial functioning. For example, the loss of the psbZ gene in the Eustigmataceae group indicates a change in the antenna–core interface of the photosystem II (see Wei et al. 2016). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89927" pm="."><plain>Another case of photosystem II simplification likely occurred due to apparent pseudogenization of the psb28 gene in Vischeria sp. CAUP Q 202 and the lack of a homologous gene in the nuclear genome of this organism (see Weisz et al. 2017). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89930" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to some diatoms, which have been reported to exhibit a nuclear gene encoding a pt-targeted Psb28 homolog, in addition to the standard Psb28 encoded by the pt genome (Jiroutová et al. 2010). <p><text><SENT sid="89932" pm="."><plain>The syfB gene, another gene probably lost in the eustigmatophyte stem lineage, encodes the beta subunit of a dimeric plastidial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, that is, a protein mediating a function essential for plastidial translation.

<SENT sid="89936" pm="."><plain>A possible transfer of the syfB gene into the eustigmatophyte nuclear genome was ruled out by our searches of available genome and transcriptome data, which also demonstrated the lack of the nuclear syfH gene in this group.

However, the tree suggests that the nuclear FtrB genes in ochrophytes are likely derived from two different sources. One group, including genes from diatoms, bolidophytes, pelagophytes, and dictyochophytes, that is, Diatomista (see Derelle et al. 2016), is contained in a well-supported clade together with nuclear FtrB genes from a variety of algal (and plant) lineages with both primary and secondary plastids. This suggests that the pt ftrB gene missing from all Diatomista studied (supplementary tables S2 and S3, Supplementary Material online) was replaced by a nuclear version gained by HGT from another algal lineage (although its exact identity cannot be resolved at present). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="89948" pm="."><plain>The second ochrophyte nuclear ftrB gene group is restricted to eustigmatophytes, but it seems to be specifically related to nuclear genes from the “chrompodellid” algae Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis (supplementary fig.

<SENT sid="89950" pm="."><plain>This is curious in light of a previous hypothesis that these algae obtained their plastid via a higher-order endosymbiosis of an ochrophyte alga (Ševčíková et al. 2015), possibly a specific relative of eustigmatophytes (Sobotka et al. 2017). </plain></SENT>

However, searches of the eustigmatophyte nuclear genomic data returned only an L24 homolog that carries an apparent mitochondrion-localization signal (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the rpl24 absence is compensated for by a nuclear copy of the gene.

<SENT sid="89958" pm="."><plain>Significantly, one of the paralogs carries an N-terminal extension with characteristics of the typical ochrophyte bipartite pt-targeting signal and hence is likely localized in the eustigmatophyte plastid (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). </plain></SENT>

Three observations lead us to favor the transfer being from the Phycorickettsia lineage to eustigmatophytes. First, the eustigmatophyte nuclear ACP genes possess introns, so invoking eustigmatophytes as the donor lineage necessitate to postulate that the transfer into the Phycorickettsia lineage must have happened before the acquisition of introns or that the transfer was mediated by a retrotranscribed intron-less copy of the eustigmatophyte gene. Second, the Phycorickettsia lineage must have always possessed an ACP gene (encoding an essential component of the fatty acid biosynthesis machinery), whereas the eustigmatophyte nuclear ptACP gene, whatever its origin, is an evolutionary innovation initially redundant with the pt acpP gene. Third, the genomic context of the Phycorickettsia ACP gene is conserved with other Rickettsiales. Specifically, the ACP gene in these organisms is flanked by two genes encoding enzymes also involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, FabB (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase II) upstream and FabG (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier protein] reductase) downstream. The Phycorickettsia FabB and FabG genes are undeniably of rickettsiacean origin, so despite its considerable divergence, the ACP gene in between was also most likely vertically inherited by Phycorickettsia from its bacterial ancestors rather than acquired horizontally from an external source. It is worth noting that the eustigmatophyte FabB and FabG proteins are encoded by genes unlinked to the ptACP gene and not specifically related to the Phycorickettsia homologs (data not shown). <p><text><SENT sid="90001" pm="."><plain>Altogether, there is sufficient evidence to propose that the eustigmatophyte ptACP gene has been acquired from a relative of extant Phycorickettsia. The presence of the ptACP gene in all eustigmatophytes examined, including representatives of both principal eustigmatophyte clades (Eustigmatales and Goniochloridales) further implies that the transfer event must have happened before the radiation of extant eustigmatophytes. The apparent absence of this gene from noneustigmatophyte ochrophytes (judging admittedly from an incomplete sampling of the ochrophyte diversity) further suggests that the HGT event occurred only after the eustigmatophyte lineage had diverged from other ochrophytes, that is, that the recipient was a stem eustigmatophyte. This means that the affair between eustigmatophytes and Phycorickettsia must have started earlier than evidenced so far, and that the whole crown eustigmatophyte group is evolutionarily influenced by the interaction with the Phycorickettsia endosymbiont. </sec></sec></SecTag><SecTag type="CONCL"><sec><title><text><SENT sid="90005" pm="."><plain>Conclusions </plain></SENT>
</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="90006" pm="."><plain>The seven new plastid genome sequences reported in this study make eustigmatophytes one of the best sampled algal classes in terms of pt genomics. This is remarkable, given the fact that eustigmatophytes were for long considered an insignificant taxon and the knowledge of their biology still suffers from fundamental gaps. The wealth of the pt genome data enabled us to resolve phylogenetic relationships among main eustigmatophyte lineages, providing a useful framework for interpretation of the evolution of different eustigmatophyte traits. The improved sampling also enabled us to recognize some of the previously enigmatic eustigmatophyte genes as divergent homologs of known genes conserved in other taxa. The detailed reconstruction of the evolution of the eustigmatophyte pt gene complement provided interesting examples illustrating different events accompanying the organellar genome evolution: sequence divergence (nearly) beyond recognition, gene splitting, pseudogenization, complete gene loss, gene gain from external sources, and possibly de novo formation of truly novel genes. We also discovered examples of different configurations associated with loss of particular genes from the eustigmatophyte pt genomes—apparent loss of the respective functionality as well as functional compensation by employing nuclear genes. The latter may have various origins, including EGT, duplication of pre-existing nuclear genes and HGT from external sources. The latter case, concerning the nuclear ACP gene, is particularly interesting, as it points to a very early beginning of coevolution of eustigmatophytes and bacteria of the Phycorickettsia lineage. A systematic survey of eustigmatophyte nuclear genomes and of diverse Phycorickettsia representatives is now in order to understand the actual magnitude and significance of gene traffic between these two organismal groups. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="SUPPL"><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><text><SENT sid="90015" pm="."><plain>Supplementary Material </plain></SENT>
