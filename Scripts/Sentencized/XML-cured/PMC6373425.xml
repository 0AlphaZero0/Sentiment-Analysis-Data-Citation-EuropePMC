<SENT sid="92191" pm="."><plain>Although no isosbestic points in the spectral changes upon addition of the denaturant suggest the formation of the folding intermediates under our denaturation conditions, the contribution of the folding intermediates to the changes of the absorption spectra is rather small and it is more plausible that the transition we detected from the absorption spectra is from the folded state to the unfolded state.

<SENT sid="92192" pm="."><plain>To determine the volume changes induced by the denaturants [37,38], activities, not molarities, were used as the concentration of the denaturant [39–41]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92207" pm="."><plain>Although positive ΔVu has reported in the thermal unfolding of Cyt c at acidic pH [43,44], proteins showing a positive ΔVu value at neutral pH have not yet been reported [6,45–48]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92208" pm="."><plain>As indicated in the previous section, the positive ΔVu for the Cyt c unfolding originates from the larger positive ΔΔVh, compared to the smaller positive Vv. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92209" pm="."><plain>Previous theoretical studies have proposed that a positive ΔΔVh was originated from hydration of hydrophobic groups because of the exclusion effects of hydrophobic groups on water molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92210" pm="."><plain>The excluded volume for a water molecule located near hydrophobic groups is larger than that of a bulk water molecule; this implies that hydration of hydrophobic groups results in a positive ΔΔVh. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92248" pm="."><plain>This difference in the hydrated structure could be attributed to the different ligation structures between urea-and GdnHCl-denatured states in Cyt c. In urea denaturation, Met80, one of the axial ligands for heme, is replaced by His33, whereas in GdnHCl denaturation, His26 is also ligated to the heme iron (Fig. 5) [32,57]; this enabled us to speculate that the denatured structure surrounding the heme axial ligands reflects the different ΔΔVh values between the two denaturants. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92257" pm="."><plain>The lower midpoint activities in the mutant correspond to the lower stability of the ligation of Met80 in the mutant, indicating that the mutation at His26 to Gln promotes the replacement of the heme axial ligand, Met80, by His33 at lower urea activity. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="92260" pm="."><plain>The more hydrated structure surrounding the hydrophilic amino acid residues in the urea-denatured state corresponds to the negative shift of ΔΔVh of the H26Q mutant (Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="92261" pm="."><plain>The mutation caused a much less drastic negative shift in ΔΔVh for the GdnHCl denaturation compared with that for urea denaturation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92262" pm="."><plain>Because GdnHCl is a more effective denaturant than urea, GdnHCl-denatured Cyt c already lost most of the α-helical structures and the mutation at His26 did not induce further drastic denaturation, leading to the small shift of ΔΔVh by the mutation. </plain></SENT>
