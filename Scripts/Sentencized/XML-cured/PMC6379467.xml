</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="92828" pm="."><plain>DCs are major antigen-presenting cells (APC) located in tissues and lymphoid organs, where they integrate environmental signals to initiate either immunity or tolerance. They express receptors for pathogen associated molecular patterns allowing early recognition of microbial intruders. By conveying this information to T lymphocytes, DCs are linking innate and adaptive immunity. <p><text><SENT sid="92831" pm="."><plain>Classical DCs (cDC) develop from committed DC precursors (pre-DC) in the bone marrow (BM), which seed tissues and develop into different DC subsets (1, 2). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92832" pm="."><plain>As suggested recently, DCs can be grouped into cDC1 and cDC2 subsets, according to their developmental origin, functional properties and location (3). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92833" pm="."><plain>According to this nomenclature cDC1 express markers such as CD8 and CD103, while cDC2 express CD4 and CD11b. cDC1 are superior to present antigen via MHCI to CD8+ T cells (4–6), while cDC2 are better equipped to present antigen via MHCII to CD4 T cells (4). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92835" pm="."><plain>In addition, cDC1 are able to efficiently load exogenous antigen onto MHCI for cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells (7). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92836" pm="."><plain>More recently it was shown that cDC1 have the specific and non-redundant role to optimize CD8+ T cell responses during a later step in T cell priming (8). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92837" pm="."><plain>Several mutant mice have been generated to study the functions of cDC1 or cDC2 in vivo (2, 9). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92838" pm="."><plain>However, mice with mutations that discriminate cDC1 in different locations, such as splenic CD8+ cDC1 or intestinal CD103+ cDC1, but not both do not yet exist. <p><text><SENT sid="92839" pm="."><plain>The maintenance of DC populations relies on constant replenishment by blood-borne precursors (10, 11) and in situ cell division with 5% of lymphoid organ resident DCs undergoing cell division at any given time (12). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92840" pm="."><plain>The importance of tightly controlled DC-numbers becomes obvious when the system is disturbed artificially. Inhibition of DC apoptosis by interfering either with caspases (13), pro-apoptotic Bim (14) or cell-death inducing Fas (15) in vivo caused DC-accumulation and autoimmunity. Similarly, artificial prolongation of DC-lifespans by Akt mutants (16) or overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (17) enhanced immunogenicity of DCs. However, mechanisms naturally regulating the DC lifespan are less well-described. DC-activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces apoptosis by CD14-mediated NFAT activation (18) and down-regulation of Bcl-2 (19). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92845" pm="."><plain>Also killing of DCs by primed cytotoxic T cells (CTL) has been described (20), a mechanism which was observed for both, CD103+ and CD11b+ DC (21). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92846" pm="."><plain>Ligands of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily bind to CD40 (22) or TRANCE (23) on DCs to prolong their survival (24). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92847" pm="."><plain>However, to the best of our knowledge other intrinsic DC life-cycle regulatory mechanisms are not known. <p><text><SENT sid="92848" pm="."><plain>Previously, we characterized the promoter regions of CD11c and DC-STAMP, two DC-specific markers, and identified an evolutionary conserved promoter framework, which also controls expression of Ppef2 (25). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92849" pm="."><plain>Ppef2 is a poorly characterized phosphatase with three EF-hands typical for calcium-binding proteins and an IQ motif (26). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92850" pm="."><plain>In mice, Ppef2 is strongly expressed in the retina, but Ppef2 deficiency did not cause retinal degeneration (27), while Ppef2-orthologs prevent retinal degeneration in Drosophila (28). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="92851" pm="."><plain>Besides the Ca2+- binding of Ppef2 (rdgC) in C. elegans (29) or the Calmodulin-binding of Ppef2 in human cells (30), it has been speculated that Ppef2 would be involved in stress-protective responses and could possibly positively regulate cell survival, growth, proliferation and oncogenesis as a “survival-phosphatase” (31, 32). <p><text><SENT sid="92852" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that in the hematopoietic system of mice Ppef2 expression is confined to CD8+ DCs, but not tissue resident CD103+ DCs or other cells. Ppef2 is down-regulated rapidly after DC-activation with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, while DC-activation via CD40 did not alter Ppef2-levels. We generated Ppef2-deficient mice and show that splenic CD8+ cDC1 display increased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. As a consequence, the Ppef2−/− DCs displayed strongly reduced cross-presenting capacities in vivo. Our data identify Ppef2 as a molecular regulator for survival and function of CD8+ cDC1. </sec></SecTag><SecTag type="METHODS"><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title><text><SENT sid="92857" pm="."><plain>Materials and Methods </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="93110" pm="."><plain>Currently very little is known about Ppef2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93111" pm="."><plain>In this study we show that among hematopoietic cells specifically CD8+ cDC1 express the phosphatase Ppef2, which is down-regulated upon DC-activation by TLR-ligands, but not by CD40-engagement. Down-regulation of Ppef2 increases apoptosis and limits antigen-presenting cell functions of CD8+ cDC1. <p><text><SENT sid="93113" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional profiling showed that Ppef2 is expressed with high specificity in CD8+ cDC1 and confirmed the microarray data available from the Immgen consortium (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93114" pm="."><plain>Although CD11b+ cDC2 and monocytes were also reported to express very low levels of Ppef2 mRNA, this did not translate into protein as determined by β-galactosidase, which is included in the gene-trap cassette of Ppef2−/− mice. However, tissue CD103+ cDC1 show some Ppef2-mRNA expression according to the Immgen database (36), but do not express significant amounts of Ppef2 (ß-Gal)-protein. CD11b+ cDC2 of the thymus also express the Ppef2-reporter. According to the Immgen-database, both thymic DC-subsets, CD8+ DCs and CD8− DCs express high levels of Ppef2-mRNA, which is different from the spleen,where CD8+ cDC1, but not CD11b+ cDC2 express Ppef2-mRNA (36). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93118" pm="."><plain>As Ppef2 shares promoter organization with CD11c and the respective promoter motive is sufficient to drive DC-specific gene expression in all CD11c+ DCs (25), the cDC1-specific Ppef2-expression is surprising. This suggests that Ppef2-expression is most likely controlled on additional levels leading to differential expression in distinct DC subpopulations. More specifically, CD8+ and CD103+ cDC1 subsets differentiate from the same Ppef2-negative pre-DC precursor into different environments. While CD8+ cDC1 are mostly resident in lymphoid organs, CD103+ cDC1 develop in barrier organs such as skin and mucosal tissues. Here, CD103+ DCs might routinely encounter TLR-signals from skin, lung and intestinal microbes, which could eventually cause down-regulation of Ppef2 in the steady-state. In contrast, CD8+ cDC1 in lymph nodes and spleen should not readily receive TLR-signals due to their localization and might therefore continue to express Ppef2. <p><text><SENT sid="93124" pm="."><plain>In the case of an infection, exposure of cDC1 to TLR-ligands also down-regulates Ppef2-expression in mature DCs. This is in contrast to CD40-signals; although both signaling pathways utilize TNF-associated factor (TRAF) 6, CD40 and TLR-signaling leading to NF-κB activation vary from each other (47). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93126" pm="."><plain>CD40 mediated TRAF-signaling involves also TRAF2 and 3 (48), while TLR-signaling involves IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93127" pm="."><plain>In addition, CD40 signaling can result in protein kinase B (Akt) activation (49), which may promote survival, while TLR signaling was shown to induce JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), which may cause apoptosis (50). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93128" pm="."><plain>This data fits to the hypothesis that CD40 induces pro-survival signaling, whereas TLR signaling is rather pro-apoptotic and involves mitogen-activated protein kinases, which regulate Ppef2 expression and possibly promote apoptosis. In contrast, pro-survival TRAF6-CD40 signaling might utilize Akt not altering the expressing of Ppef2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93130" pm="."><plain>We observed down-regulation of Ppef2 expression also after spontaneous maturation of DCs in culture and other studies have shown similarities between LPS activated and spontaneously activated cells in vitro, when analyzing microarray data (51). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93131" pm="."><plain>The majority of changes in gene expression during DC-activation are reductions of expression (52). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93132" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether loss of expression of Ppef2 in mature DCs is simply a consequence of co-downregulation of other genes, which may be dispensable for mature DCs, or whether it is a specific regulation in order to limit the lifespan of DCs. <p><text><SENT sid="93133" pm="."><plain>The only functional Ppef2-study published so far investigated the anti-apoptotic role of Ppef2 in oxidative stress by suppression of Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (Ask1) in immortalized cell lines (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93134" pm="."><plain>Ppef2 caused potent dephosphorylation of Ask1 at the threonine residue 838, suppressing Ask1 activity (53). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93135" pm="."><plain>When Ask1 and Ppef2 were co-expressed in vitro, suppression of Ask1 by Ppef2 led to a decrease in caspase-3 activation (32). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93136" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the phosphatase Ppef2 functions to control Ask1 activity to prevent apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions. Ppef2 is also up-regulated in mouse hippocampus after hypoxia-ischemia, along with several other transcripts associated with neuroprotection (54). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93138" pm="."><plain>However, western blot analyses of Ppef2−/− DCs revealed no changes in Ask1 expression or phosphorylation (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93139" pm="."><plain>Instead, mRNA-sequencing revealed Trim2 and Dll4 being expressed at reduced levels in Ppef2−/− CD8+ cDC1. <p><text><SENT sid="93140" pm="."><plain>Trim2, an E3 Ligase, ubiquitinates pro-apoptotic Bim for proteasomal degradation (39). Ppef2−/− DCs showed an increase in Bim, for which a decrease in Trim2 could be responsible, although we were unable to confirm alterations of Trim2 protein levels in Ppef2−/− DCs (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93141" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we showed that loss of Ppef2 led to a decrease of Trim2 mRNA which can influence the abundance of Bim. Being a regulator of DC apoptosis, Bim would therefore be responsible for the increase in apoptotic active caspase-3+ DCs observed in Ppef2−/− mice. <p><text><SENT sid="93143" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we also observed increased caspase-3 levels in CD11b+ cDC2 of Ppef2−/− mice in vivo, although these DCs do not express Ppef2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93144" pm="."><plain>Eventually indirect secondary effects or the uptake of apoptotic cleaved caspase-3+CD8+ cDC1 by CD11b+ cDC2 might account for this finding. Recently, it has been shown that oxysterol-metabolizing enzyme expressing CD8+ (XCR1+) cDC1 do influence homeostasis and positioning of CD11b+ (DCIR2+) cDC2 (55), indicating a possible cross-talk between both DC-subsets. However, the exclusivity of the competitive disadvantage observed for CD8+, but not CD11b+ DCs, during bone marrow chimera reconstitution suggests that Ppef2-deficiency directly affects CD8+ cDC1 only. <p><text><SENT sid="93147" pm="."><plain>Although the rate of apoptosis was increased in CD8+ cDC1 from Ppef2−/− mice, we did not find diminished total numbers or frequencies of CD8+ cDC1. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93148" pm="."><plain>Also short-term or pulse-chase BrdU-labeling experiments could not reveal statistically significant differences for DC proliferation or turnover, which might compensate for increased rates of DC-death (data not shown). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93149" pm="."><plain>As only 5% of all DCs proliferate in steady-state (12), BrdU-incorporation might not be sensitive enough to reveal subtle changes in compensatory proliferative rates. Also serum levels of Flt3L were not elevated, as reported in mice which lack DCs due to expression of diphteria toxin (56). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93151" pm="."><plain>Eventually, alterations in precursor-product relations might account for compensatory effects. However, we did not detect elevated numbers of pre-DCs, nor did they show an increased proliferative rate (data not shown). <p><text><SENT sid="93153" pm="."><plain>Increased apoptosis of DCs should lead to decreased T cell priming capacity. In our experiments we avoided to activate DCs with TLR-ligands, as fully matured DCs naturally down regulate Ppef2 and as such would not be different from Ppef2−/− DCs. T cell proliferation was substantially reduced upon priming by Ppef2−/− DCs. Also cross-presentation of OVA-protein by CD40-matured CD8+ cDC1 was strongly reduced in Ppef2−/− mice, indicating that DCs have limited T cell priming ability when they lack Ppef2. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="93157" pm="."><plain>This might hint for a DC-intrinsic mechanism, which could limit antigen-specific T cell responses for protection from excessive immune activation to avoid collateral tissue damage and autoimmunity, which has been observed with apoptosis-resistant DCs (13–17). <p><text><SENT sid="93158" pm="."><plain>Although its sequence is highly conserved in humans, hPpef2 does not show a similar DC-specific expression pattern (57), but is rather restricted to the retina.
