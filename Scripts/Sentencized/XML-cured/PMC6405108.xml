</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="94151" pm="."><plain>Hippocrates, the founder of medicine as arational science has studied many medicinal properties of foods and summarized food asmedicine. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94152" pm="."><plain>Many traditional systems including Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine systems are practising use of food as medicine throughout history. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94153" pm="."><plain>For being medicinally active or for being functional, a food should contain biologically active componentswhich contribute to enhanced health or reduced risk of disease apart from being nutritious. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94154" pm="."><plain>These are well thought out as foods which are part of a normal diet[1,2,3]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94155" pm="."><plain>Coriandrum sativum L. is an important member of Apiaceaefamily.It is identified as one of the oldest herbal plants valued for its nutritional and medicinal properties[4].Leaves and seeds of this plant are used as spice as well astherapy for various disorders in traditional medicine systems[5].C. sativum is a potential source of multiple bioactive componentssuch as flavonoids(quercetin and isoquercetin, rutin), terpenes (linalool), terpenoids, polyphenols (ferrulic acid, gallic acid, rutin, caffeic acid, anethole, borneol, caroteinoids), fatty acids rich in petroselinic acid, coumarins and hydroxy-coumarins, tannins, sterols vitamin C and tocopherols etc. which may be responsible for its therapeutic action [4,6].C. sativum possesses interesting pharmacological activities such asantidyslipidemic, anti-inflammatory, cardio and neuroprotective etc. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94156" pm="."><plain>[7,8].C. sativummay be consideredas a functional food due to itscommon used in regular diet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94157" pm="."><plain>Moreover, its pharmacological benefits in various disorders promote its use as a functional food [7]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94158" pm="."><plain>Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the leadingcauses of mortality in diabetic patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94159" pm="."><plain>DN is generally characterized by the thickening of basement membrane, expansion of messengial cells, fibrosis and apoptosis of podocytes which leads tostructural as well as functional abnormalities. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94160" pm="."><plain>The functional impairment of renal cells leads to increased excretion of urinary albumin, urea, uric acid and creatinine, BUN, fluid retention, glomerular lesions and reduce glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic patients [9]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94161" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, chronic hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are two major culprits for onset of complications related to diabetes[10,11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94162" pm="."><plain>Hexokinase enzyme phosphorylates glucose for energy production under normal conditions whereas chronic hyperglycemia heads to saturation of hexokinase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94163" pm="."><plain>This saturation results to entrance of excess glucose to pathways such aspolyol pathwayand ultimately leads to increased formation of AGEsand their receptors [10,11].The interaction between AGEs and their receptors causes vascular aging and damage, consequently involved actively in the pathogenesis of DN. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94164" pm="."><plain>Chronic hyperglycemiaalso induces oxidative stress by increasingthe level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which facilitates formation of AGEs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="94165" pm="."><plain>Therefore, alterations in above mentioned biochemical pathways lead to structural and functional aberration of nephrons and eventuallyDN. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="94166" pm="."><plain>Along with the available interventions of diabetes like oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin therapy, many diabetic patients also choose complementary and alternative therapies which have intensified the demand for alternative therapies for management of diabetes [12].Following the direction of using safenatural products along with functional foods, their bioactive constituents and medicinal properties, the present study was designed to investigate petroleum ether extract of C. sativum for attenuation of DN. </plain></SENT>
