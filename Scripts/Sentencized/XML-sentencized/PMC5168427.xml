</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50663" pm="."><plain>Aphasia is an acquired communication disorder that impedes to varying degrees an individual's comprehension and expression of language, be it through their ability to read, understand spoken language, write, speak, and/or gesture (Code, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50664" pm="."><plain>Aphasia is most commonly caused by stroke with ~30–40% of acute stroke cases presenting with aphasia (Pedersen et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Engelter et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and up to 61% of those individuals continuing to experience aphasia at 12 months post-stroke (Pedersen et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50665" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aphasia becomes a chronic communication disorder for a significant proportion of people who experience stroke. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50666" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, research has demonstrated that people with aphasia can continue to improve their language skills many years post-stroke when they have access to efficacious treatment regimens (Brady et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50667" pm="."><plain>While a number of studies have suggested that intensive aphasia rehabilitation is most effective (Bhogal et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kelly et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Cherney et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), other research supports more distributed protocols (Dignam et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50668" pm="."><plain>A likely outcome of this debate about rehabilitation intensity is that rehabilitation interventions should be tailored to the individual's needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50669" pm="."><plain>However, full customization of aphasia rehabilitation protocols that are delivered in-person are improbable in a healthcare landscape of increasingly restricted resource allocation combined with growing demand. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50670" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even when such tailored rehabilitation services are available, access by individuals with aphasia may be restricted due to decreased mobility and/or geographical isolation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50671" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, a number of technology-based solutions, such as computer-based aphasia therapy (CBAT) and telerehabilitation, have been implemented in aphasia rehabilitation to overcome these issues of access, intensity, and limited resources. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50672" pm="."><plain>While CBAT programs have been used in aphasia rehabilitation for many years (van de Sandt-Koenderman, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) only recently has the highest level of evidence supporting the use of CBAT been reported in a systematic review (Zheng et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50673" pm="."><plain>The review concluded that there is evidence of the effectiveness of CBAT for people with chronic aphasia as it found statistically significant improvements in language outcomes after CBAT when compared to no therapy in all but one study and no statistically significant differences in language outcomes when compared to traditional clinician-delivered therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50674" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, the authors of the review recommended that clinicians carefully consider matching the CBAT program to the needs of each client in terms of feedback, cueing hierarchies and the degree of clinician support provided when clients use CBAT. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50675" pm="."><plain>This recommendation may result in clinicians needing access to a wide range of CBAT programs in order to tailor therapies to this complex and heterogeneous disorder given that most CBAT programs are currently fixed in terms of the types of tasks, feedback and cues available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50676" pm="."><plain>Zheng et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) called for further quality and controlled research to be conducted around the use of CBAT in order to determine the key features required in CBAT programs and treatment protocols best suited to various types and severities of aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50677" pm="."><plain>This call for further research was also made by van de Sandt-Koenderman (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) who appealed for current CBAT programs to be made more sophisticated and attractive to users by bringing them up-to-date with new technologies such as mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50678" pm="."><plain>Additionally, van de Sandt-Koenderman (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) called for the development of CBAT programs that encompass functional treatment goals and social participation needs of people with aphasia, as well as, expansion into telerehabilitation models in which a clinician guides and supports a client in their rehabilitation using CBAT programs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50679" pm="."><plain>Telerehabilitation is another technology-based solution that has been explored for both assessment and treatment of aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50680" pm="."><plain>In the context of speech-language pathology telerehabilitation (or its synonym telepractice) has been defined by the peak professional body Speech Pathology Australia, as “the application of telecommunications technology to deliver clinical services at a distance by linking clinician to client, caregiver, or any person(s) responsible for delivering care to the client” (SPA Position Statement, 2014). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50681" pm="."><plain>Telerehabilitation may be delivered synchronously (real-time), or asynchronously (delayed), or using a hybrid combination of the two approaches. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50682" pm="."><plain>Much of the aphasia telerehabilitation research to date has focused on synchronous or hybrid approaches (see Systematic Reviews by Hall et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Coleman et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50683" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there has been less research into asynchronous models of telerehabilitation for aphasia rehabilitation reported in the literature. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50684" pm="."><plain>Seminal research into asynchronous telerehabilitation was conducted by Mortley and colleagues who combined the use of a CBAT program, StepByStep, with an asynchronous telerehabilitation approach to deliver aphasia rehabilitation directly into the individual's home (Wade et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Mortley et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50685" pm="."><plain>The CBAT program, StepByStep had been designed for independent use by people with aphasia and was accessed on a personal computer with a Windows operating system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50686" pm="."><plain>A range of tasks were available such as written and spoken word to picture matching, semantic association tasks, as well as, naming, reading, and spelling tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50687" pm="."><plain>An important feature of the StepByStep program was that it allowed for the input of personal and meaningful stimuli. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50688" pm="."><plain>In this way the program aligned with the neurorehabilitation principle of saliency, which is a significant factor in language recovery (Pulvermüller and Berthier, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Raymer et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50689" pm="."><plain>The telerehabilitation approach allowed clinicians to remotely monitor progress, provide feedback and update therapy tasks, resulting in an improved ratio of therapy to therapist time when compared with other computer-based aphasia therapy programs (Mortley et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50690" pm="."><plain>Clinical results were encouraging in that all seven participants demonstrated consistent and intensive use of the program, resulting in significant improvements in word retrieval (Mortley et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50691" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the participants reported experiencing increased confidence and participation in communication. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50692" pm="."><plain>The participants credited the asynchronous telerehabilitation model with improving their access to therapy, increasing the intensity of therapy and increasing their autonomy (Wade et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50693" pm="."><plain>This research highlighted the importance of providing people with aphasia with salient therapy tasks and demonstrated that people with aphasia appreciated having access to clinician monitored therapy which they could engage in autonomously. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50694" pm="."><plain>However, the uptake of the Windows-hosted StepByStep program has perhaps been impeded by recent advances in technology toward mobile touch devices (iPad®, tablet PC, smartphones). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50695" pm="."><plain>As interest in mobile devices continues to grow current programs may need to be converted or new programs developed. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50696" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, research suggests that tomorrow's elders with disabilities will demand mobile access to services as they continue to participate in a lifestyle which includes travel and other activities outside the home (Morris et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50697" pm="."><plain>In response to this burgeoning use of mobile devices in the community, Brandenburg and colleagues conducted an integrated review of mobile computing and aphasia which examined issues of accessibility for people with aphasia and the potential uses of mobile computing with this population (Brandenburg et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50698" pm="."><plain>The issue of accessibility (also called usability) in CBAT programs is critical to the successful uptake of these programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50699" pm="."><plain>Usability has been defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as “the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use” (ISO 9241-11, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50700" pm="."><plain>Another important concept in the development of software and new service delivery models such as telerehabilitation is acceptability. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50701" pm="."><plain>Acceptability is a judgment by the user of the software or service as to whether their needs are sufficiently met. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50702" pm="."><plain>As discussed by Brandenburg et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) a number of features have been identified as improving the usability of mobile technology for people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50703" pm="."><plain>However, more research is needed in this area and the use of participatory design methodology, or an end-user design approach as it is known in the software development field, may be one way to achieve improved usability of CBAT programs accessed on mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50704" pm="."><plain>Given that mobile devices are becoming the device of choice for many people, including people with aphasia (Brandenburg et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), it is encouraging that recently developed asynchronous telerehabilitation platforms have made use of this new technology (Kiran et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Brandenburg et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Des Roches et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Choi et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50705" pm="."><plain>Brandenburg et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) developed an application for use on a smartphone which measures “talk time” in much the same way that a pedometer measures steps. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50706" pm="."><plain>Features of CommFit™ include being able to set a goal for the amount of talking, and data feedback to both the person with aphasia using the app and their clinician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50707" pm="."><plain>Using key usability design and aphasia friendly text principles for people with aphasia, the prototype application was developed and then trialed with healthy adults to determine the accuracy of the measurement of talking time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50708" pm="."><plain>Usability of this app with the target population is yet to be published. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50709" pm="."><plain>The other two recently reported asynchronous telerehabilitation systems are more complex in that the programs aim to provide language therapy across a number of domains. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50710" pm="."><plain>Kiran et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and Des Roches et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported the use of an iPad®-based software program, Constant Therapy, to deliver a range of impairment-level language and cognitive tasks to participants with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50711" pm="."><plain>The Constant Therapy program also allowed clinicians to monitor therapy progress remotely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50712" pm="."><plain>Kiran et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) demonstrated the feasibility of the iPad®-based software platform to deliver therapy tasks to four participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50713" pm="."><plain>Tasks were assigned from the Constant Therapy library of approximately 30 evidence-based language and cognitive therapy tasks, each with varying levels of difficulty thereby allowing some degree of individualization of therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50714" pm="."><plain>Following the positive findings of this feasibility testing, Des Roches et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) investigated the effectiveness of the program in a comparison study where both groups received ten 1-h sessions to complete therapy tasks on the iPad with the support of a clinician and the experimental group supplemented these sessions with home practice on the iPad® between clinic visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50715" pm="."><plain>Both the experimental and control groups showed improvements on standardized testing, however, the experimental group showed greater improvements than the control group, thus demonstrating the benefits of increased practice time using Constant Therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50716" pm="."><plain>While the effectiveness of this CBAT program is promising, the researchers noted only 68.7% compliance with the prescribed 6 h of home practice. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50717" pm="."><plain>It would be interesting to determine whether usability issues impacted compliance and client satisfaction with this iPad®-based therapy approach. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50718" pm="."><plain>The asynchronous telerehabilitation platform described by Choi et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), iAphasia, was also designed for use on an Apple iPad®. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50719" pm="."><plain>The iAphasia program consisted of therapy tasks across the six language domains of auditory comprehension, reading comprehension, repetition, naming, writing, and verbal fluency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50720" pm="."><plain>Six levels of difficulty were available for each domain and arranged hierarchically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50721" pm="."><plain>Automatic feedback and progress graphs were available to the participant with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50722" pm="."><plain>Clinicians accessed client data from iAphasia stored on a database through a Web portal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50723" pm="."><plain>Results from a feasibility study using iAphasia with eight participants were promising with significant improvement on standardized assessment after the 4 week trial and maintenance of these outcomes at follow-up 4 weeks later. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50724" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a strong and positive correlation was found between usage time and improvement in standardized assessment scores regardless of aphasia severity at baseline. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50725" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, participants with mild aphasia had low usage time which the authors concluded was due to the program not being “attractive” to these participants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50726" pm="."><plain>Regrettably, “attractive” was not defined and so it is unclear whether this was due to issues of usability or acceptability of the program, or its limited capacity to meet the participant's goals and needs due to the restriction of six domains and six difficulty levels. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50727" pm="."><plain>Thus, while the asynchronous telerehabilitation platforms that make use of modern mobile devices hold great promise for improving access to therapy, there are some limitations in their application. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50728" pm="."><plain>In particular the fixed therapy task types and difficulty levels within some of the programs (e.g., Constant Therapy and iAphasia) may restrict their use to people with specific aphasia profiles. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50729" pm="."><plain>The inability to import client images and/or local audio content to increase the saliency of tasks is also perhaps a limitation of these newer programs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50730" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the older program StepByStep had this capacity to import images, but its utilization of Windows operating system restricts somewhat its accessibility on mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50731" pm="."><plain>Indeed to the best of the authors' knowledge, none of the asynchronous telerehabilitation programs for aphasia published to date have the capacity to provide complete customization of therapy tasks such that the programs can be used with a wide variety of aphasia types and severities to meet the goals of the user. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50732" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although the asynchronous telerehabilitation studies reviewed here have implemented aphasia friendly principles into the design of their user interfaces, none have scientifically examined the usability of their programs with people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50733" pm="."><plain>Therefore, there is a need to develop an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform that has the capacity to be used across a range of clients of varying severity and aphasia types, and which is flexible in terms of the types of tasks available for use with clients or easily adaptable. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50734" pm="."><plain>It is important that the platform uses high quality stimuli that are culturally appropriate and ideally would allow for the import of client images and local audio content to increase saliency. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50735" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, usability of the asynchronous telerehabilitation platform should be considered throughout the development period. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50736" pm="."><plain>Usability issues are a major barrier to the uptake of technology for people with disabilities (Simpson et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50737" pm="."><plain>For people with aphasia it is not just the communication disorder that presents challenges to technology usability, but also the sensory, physical, and cognitive impairments that often accompany aphasia (Brandenburg et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50738" pm="."><plain>One way to potentially ensure adequate usability of CBAT programs, either used in isolation or as part of an asynchronous telerehabilitation system, is to include end-users in the design and development of the programs and to assess usability with the target populations. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="50752" pm="."><plain>eSALT is an implementation of a generic software program developed by the second author, Hugh Breslin. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50753" pm="."><plain>The generic program, AppTailor, allows the user to easily and quickly design and/or adapt applications or “apps” for deployment to mobile devices. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50754" pm="."><plain>The AppTailor system has two parts, a desktop application and a device-based component. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50755" pm="."><plain>The desktop application allows practitioners to design tasks to be performed by their clients on a mobile device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50756" pm="."><plain>The user interface provides a preview of how the task will appear on the device. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50757" pm="."><plain>The designer can build a layout for each task and specify which illustrated words or phrases will be used in each step of the task. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50758" pm="."><plain>Additionally standard controls such as dropdown boxes, text editor, and switch controls can be dropped onto the layout as well as media elements such as a video player or a voice recorder. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50759" pm="."><plain>The saved designed task serves as a set of “layout instructions” that can be assigned to device users and uploaded to the cloud. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50760" pm="."><plain>The device application downloads and reads the “layout instructions” to determine how the device app should look and behave. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50761" pm="."><plain>The data input captured is uploaded to the cloud. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50762" pm="."><plain>The desktop application can download these results and present them to the practitioner so that they can view results and modify the tasks accordingly to repeat the process. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50763" pm="."><plain>The authors felt that the entire AppTailor system could be adapted and implemented as an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform for use in speech-language pathology. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50764" pm="."><plain>A period of adaptation of AppTailor into eSALT followed during which the nomenclature was made specific to speech pathology, custom layouts were developed, and the word/picture library and audio cues were created. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50765" pm="."><plain>The result was a working prototype of eSALT (v1.1) which allowed clinicians to develop and customize impairment-based aphasia therapy tasks for transfer to Windows tablet devices from which clients with aphasia could access the tasks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="50766" pm="."><plain>As an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform, eSALT has both a client interface and a clinician interface and so aspects of end-user design and examination of usability needed to extend to the clinician's use of the platform to monitor progress, provide feedback and update tasks remotely. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50767" pm="."><plain>Hence, a qualitative study with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) experienced in aphasia rehabilitation using CBAT was undertaken to determine SLPs' preferences for a comprehensive CBAT program (Swales et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50768" pm="."><plain>Ten Australian SLPs participated in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50769" pm="."><plain>Five themes emerged from the thematic analysis which detailed preferences across therapy activities in the CBAT program, the stimuli used and cues available, as well as, preferences for accessing progress data and considerations around accessibility and usability (Swales et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50770" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these SLPs confirmed that there was a need for a CBAT program that was more flexible than current programs in the types of therapy tasks available and that there should be a high degree of flexibility in the program for “clinicians to set all task parameters to each client's needs and increase saliency of therapy” through specific targets, stimuli, cues and feedback (Swales et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, p. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50771" pm="."><plain>326). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50772" pm="."><plain>The SLPs considered usability of CBAT programs from a number of perspectives other than their own, such as the individual with aphasia, their family and also other health professionals such as allied health assistants who often manage the use of CBAT programs in clinics. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50773" pm="."><plain>Finally, the SLPs desired a program that was accessible across a variety of operating systems and devices and they confirmed the need for platforms that enabled remote monitoring of client progress and remote updating of therapy tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50774" pm="."><plain>Importantly, these findings came from a group of SLPs who had no experience of eSALT (v1.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="50775" pm="."><plain>At this point it was decided to embark upon a usability study with both end-user groups, in order to determine the usability and acceptability of eSALT (v1.1). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51261" pm="."><plain>Within this category of using eSALT, the SLPs' responses were coded into four sub-categories: Interface was easy to use, learning to use, efficiency, and familiarity with program improved usability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51262" pm="."><plain>The SLPs felt that the interface was easy to use and that learning to use eSALT (v1.1) was also easy and did not take too much time. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51263" pm="."><plain>The SLPs considered the in-person training in the use of eSALT as important and that the user manual was also useful. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51264" pm="."><plain>However, all of the SLPs reported that the eSALT (v1.1) program took too long to perform certain actions, such as saving and uploading tasks and that this inefficiency was frustrating. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51265" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, upon reflection one of the SLPs felt that the time taken to use eSALT (v1.1) was probably comparable to traditional therapy preparation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51266" pm="."><plain>The SLPs also reported that as their familiarity with the program increased so did their effective and efficient use of the program (see Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51268" pm="."><plain>One of the unique features of eSALT is the capacity to develop and fully customize therapy tasks, therefore a major category related to the preparation of therapy tasks and included six sub-categories: Development of tasks from scratch, copying and personalizing tasks, variety of tasks, usability with variety of aphasia types currently restricted, stimuli and cues and the time taken to develop tasks (See Supplementary Table 2). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51269" pm="."><plain>All of the SLPs reported initial difficulty developing therapy tasks from scratch, with one SLP stating “I think to develop from scratch there are several steps that you need to step through and get them all right before you can upload to the tablet.” In contrast, all of the SLPs reported that copying a task template and personalizing it was easy and straightforward. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51270" pm="."><plain>On the topic of the task templates, all of the SLPs felt there was a good variety of templates, but that a larger bank of task templates would improve the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51271" pm="."><plain>This idea of a larger bank of therapy task templates was also related to being able to use eSALT with a wider variety of aphasia types, in that there were few high level language task templates available. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51272" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, limitations in the (v1.1) program, such as restrictions on the amount of text able to be displayed and the use of punctuation in tasks, impeded the development of higher level tasks by the SLPs. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51273" pm="."><plain>The SLPs also commented on the time it took to develop tasks, expressing some frustration with the amount of time spent developing tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51274" pm="."><plain>However, all of the SLPs felt that there was great variety and high quality stimuli available in eSALT (v1.1) and that the stimuli were culturally appropriate. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51280" pm="."><plain>It was felt that this process of assigning tasks or stimuli was efficient. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51289" pm="."><plain>Despite the SLPs' expressing frustration at the time inefficiencies within eSALT (v1.1), the SLPs' perceptions of eSALT were generally positive with comments such as “I think it's a great program at the end of the day”. </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51300" pm="."><plain>Despite the SLPs in this study only using eSALT in an asynchronous telerehabilitation service delivery model, they discussed how eSALT could be used in other clinical service delivery models. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51301" pm="."><plain>Two of the SLPs thought that eSALT could be used in traditional in-person therapy sessions, as an adjunct to paper-based therapy, or with support from therapy assistants across the day. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51302" pm="."><plain>In the context of home-based use the SLPs felt that eSALT could be a tool to encourage family involvement in therapy or could be used to provide homework tasks between clinic visits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51303" pm="."><plain>One of the SLPs talked about the capacity to remotely monitor client's progress and then adapt tasks in a more timely manner. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51306" pm="."><plain>For people with aphasia, the SLPs thought that eSALT contained a number of benefits over traditional worksheets, such as dynamic cueing, more salient and personalized therapy tasks, and greater variety of tasks which would maintain the client's interest. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51307" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the SLPs felt that eSALT was modern, culturally appropriate and less isolating for people with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51308" pm="."><plain>With regard to their own use of eSALT, the SLPs reported a number of benefits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51309" pm="."><plain>These benefits included the ability to change tasks quickly and more frequently, as well as easily adjusting the level of task difficulty. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51310" pm="."><plain>Some of the SLPs felt that it was beneficial to provide clients with electronic tasks as the results are calculated for the clinician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51311" pm="."><plain>The range and type of stimuli available in eSALT was seen as giving the clinician the capacity to quickly and easily provide tasks for clients. </plain></SENT>

(<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), the end-user design approach was successful in identifying features of the program that should be modified to enhance the usability and acceptability of the software for the users with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51355" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the collection of usability and acceptability data from both observation in a real world setting and interview provided additional confidence that the most important areas were identified for refinement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51356" pm="."><plain>Simic et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) also employed this combination of data sources in their usability study of a synchronous telepractice system for anomia therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51357" pm="."><plain>As in these previous studies, the use of communication supports during the interviews enabled those participants with more severe expressive difficulties to participate in providing their perspective and so provided a rich data set (Galliers et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Simic et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51358" pm="."><plain>In terms of usability, both sources of data (the independent observations of the participants accessing therapy tasks and qualitative data from the interviews) revealed that the majority of the participants were able to successfully and independently use the tablet and the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51359" pm="."><plain>However, some skills such as using the scroll bar and using different types of input types (e.g., keyboard) were found to be problematic for some users. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51360" pm="."><plain>For some participants these difficulties arose due to the variable responsiveness of the touchscreen on the devices, while other participants were observed to press too hard on the touchscreen. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51361" pm="."><plain>It may be that these access issues were partly due to the participants' inexperience with the mobile device or insufficient training; however it is also important to consider that co-morbidities such as reduced cognitive ability or impaired dexterity may also impact on a user's ability to access a program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51362" pm="."><plain>Tasks which required fewer steps such as “open therapy task from list” and “use synchronize icon on eSALT menu to send results” appeared to be easier, which may be due to the fact that they place fewer demands on working memory, cognitive and language skills. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51363" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, it is essential that appropriate hardware be used and that usability testing extend from the software to also include the hardware. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51364" pm="."><plain>This prototype of eSALT (v1.1) was developed for use on a Window mobile device and the devices used were mid-range products rather than premium products. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51365" pm="."><plain>Thus, the sensitivity or responsiveness of the touchscreen may not have been ideal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51366" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in a Windows operating system the standard method of accessing off-screen items on the main menu is via a scroll bar whereas swiping is the standard method used on an Apple iPad®. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51367" pm="."><plain>During the interviews the participants with aphasia identified a number of factors which they felt influenced their use of eSALT (v1.1) and the tablet. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51368" pm="."><plain>While some participants felt that personal factors such as age or experience with technology may have been influential, all participants agreed that training and support were crucial factors in their use of the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51369" pm="."><plain>Research supports this finding, with Kurland et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) reporting that adequate training and motivation were more important predictors of successful technology use than age, aphasia severity or previous computer experience in their trial of a tablet-based therapy program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51370" pm="."><plain>With regard to training and support, the participants in this study especially valued the initial in-person training and the subsequent home visit in which additional personalized training or troubleshooting took place. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51371" pm="."><plain>Other researchers have also identified training and ongoing support as crucial factors in promoting independence and competency in operating computer-based aphasia therapy programs (Egan et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kiran et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51372" pm="."><plain>Personalized support was also needed by the participants when technical problems arose. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51373" pm="."><plain>It was interesting that some participants did not want to contact the SLP or researchers when faced with technical problems, but rather contacted family members to ask for assistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51374" pm="."><plain>As the use of technology in aphasia rehabilitation grows, a key consideration should be how best to provide tailored technical support to people with aphasia, especially those without personal support networks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51375" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the participants in this study had mixed views as to whether the remote monitoring of their progress by a SLP was a motivating factor. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51376" pm="."><plain>This is in contrast to other studies which have reported the monitoring role of speech pathologists to be a crucial and highly motivating factor in self-managed computer therapy (Wade et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Palmer et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51377" pm="."><plain>Those participants who did want to know how well they were progressing through the therapy tasks suggested that this could be achieved either through direct contact with the SLP (e.g., telephone call) or through the eSALT program itself if results could be displayed to the user. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51378" pm="."><plain>In terms of acceptability of the program and the asynchronous telerehabilitation model of service delivery, all of the participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with the use of eSALT (v1.1) and the asynchronous telerehabilitation model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51379" pm="."><plain>High levels of participant satisfaction are commonly found in telerehabilitation studies and have also been cited in other usability studies involving telerehabilitation (Simic et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51380" pm="."><plain>As in the Wade et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) study participants in this study reported high levels of motivation to practice intensively and reported that this was achievable because they could access the therapy at home and had autonomy over their practice schedule. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51381" pm="."><plain>The participants highly valued the personalization of therapy tasks that was achievable through eSALT (v1.1) and appreciated the wide variety of tasks available to them through the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51382" pm="."><plain>However, some participants felt that the tasks were not well matched to their needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51383" pm="."><plain>This is an interesting finding given that eSALT (v1.1) had the capacity for therapy tasks to be individually tailored to a client's specific needs. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51384" pm="."><plain>This mismatch may have been due to a limitation in the research design, as the clinicians only had one assessment session with participants before designing the tasks, or it may have been due to the clinicians' not receiving enough training in the use of eSALT (v1.1). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51385" pm="."><plain>A trial which more closely imitated a clinical setting in which the clinician and participant met in-person for several sessions may have allowed clinicians to determine whether the tasks designed for participants were appropriate and make more changes in response to participant feedback. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51386" pm="."><plain>This need to appropriately align therapy tasks to the client's skill level was also identified in the usability study by Simic et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51387" pm="."><plain>In summary, the results from the participants with aphasia confirmed the acceptability of the asynchronous telerehabilitation service delivery achieved through eSALT (v1.1), but identified a number of improvements which would enhance usability and acceptability of the program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51388" pm="."><plain>The major improvements identified included changes to the mobile device used, removing the need for a scroll bar, personalization of the task menu and provision of additional immediate feedback to the user on therapy progress. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51390" pm="."><plain>The recruitment of practicing SLPs and the embedding of this usability and acceptability study in a clinical scenario yielded rich data for the refinement of eSALT (v1.1) program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51391" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge this is the first study to involve SLPs in an end-user design approach for an asynchronous telerehabilitation platform and specific to the clinicians' use of the program, although clinicians have been involved in usability studies of synchronous telerehabilitation systems (Simic et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51392" pm="."><plain>In both the current study and the Simic et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) study clinician participants had no prior experience of the telerehabilitation system being evaluated. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51393" pm="."><plain>A potential strength of this sampling method is that the data gathered is ecologically rich and possibly more generalizable to clinical practice. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51394" pm="."><plain>In terms of the usability of eSALT (v1.1) the clinicians identified a number of strengths of the program, including the layout of the interface, the quality, appropriateness and variety of stimuli available, the variety of task templates and the ease with which they could personalize these templates for their participants with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51395" pm="."><plain>However, the clinicians found designing therapy tasks from scratch difficult and time consuming, and even more so for higher level language tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51396" pm="."><plain>They expressed frustration at the time the program took to save, which they felt impeded the acceptability of the program overall. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51397" pm="."><plain>One factor in the poor efficiency of the eSALT (v1.1) program was that the hardware used had low processing power and memory. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51398" pm="."><plain>It is important that the hardware chosen is fit for purpose so that usability data is unambiguous in terms of its relationship to the software or hardware. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51399" pm="."><plain>Future studies should ensure that optimal hardware is utilized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51400" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, refinement of the eSALT (v1.1) program's efficiency was a key finding. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51401" pm="."><plain>Another key finding for the usability and acceptability of eSALT (v1.1) related to reading and using the data from the participants with aphasia. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51402" pm="."><plain>As evident from the satisfaction survey and the interviews, all of the SLPs in this study found reading data in Excel spreadsheets difficult and did not use this data in their decision making. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51403" pm="."><plain>However, they liked the simple visual display of data in the calendar and used this data to make decisions about the appropriateness of tasks and when to update tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51404" pm="."><plain>These decisions were based on the participant's completion of tasks rather than success or accuracy in completing the tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51405" pm="."><plain>Improvements to eSALT in terms of summation of data and graphical display of accuracy data should enable clinicians to more easily use the data capture features that this telerehabilitation platform offers, thus enhancing its usability and applicability clinically. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51406" pm="."><plain>The capacity for clinicians to use data to make clinical decisions about therapy progress is crucial to the successful uptake of asynchronous telerehabilitation. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51407" pm="."><plain>Contact between the SLP and the participant with aphasia was also considered a key factor in the success of an asynchronous telerehabilitation service delivery model. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51408" pm="."><plain>While one clinician used the eSALT (v1.1) program to display contact information to her participants, it was felt that a specific messaging system within the eSALT program would enhance its usability and acceptability. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51409" pm="."><plain>In terms of the acceptability of the asynchronous telerehabilitation service delivery model enabled through eSALT(v1.1), the clinicians believed that the eSALT platform was applicable in a number of clinical settings and could be used in service delivery other than asynchronous models, such as during in-person therapy sessions. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51410" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate high levels of acceptability for eSALT and highlight the flexibility of this asynchronous telerehabilitation platform. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51411" pm="."><plain>Other studies have also highlighted the capacity to use asynchronous telerehabilitation systems in clinical sessions (e.g., Des Roches et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51412" pm="."><plain>All of the clinicians in the current study stated that they would use eSALT again and also recommend it to others once further refinement of the program was complete (See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51413" pm="."><plain>The clinicians anticipated many benefits for people with aphasia using eSALT, including improved access to intensive therapy practice, therapy that is more salient through the personalization possible in eSALT and greater variety in therapy tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51414" pm="."><plain>For themselves, the clinicians felt that eSALT enabled them to provide more salient therapy and to easily and more frequently change the tasks given to a client. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="51438" pm="."><plain>In order to assist with task development and improve the ease with which clinicians could give a range of clients with aphasia appropriate tasks, the list of task templates was substantially expanded to over 50 tasks, including high level language tasks. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51439" pm="."><plain>Restrictions on text length and punctuation were relaxed and the word/picture library was expanded to over 1300 high quality color photographs across a wider range of categories (e.g., verbs, money). </plain></SENT>

</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51441" pm="."><plain>In order to facilitate efficient feedback on client progress to the client and the clinician, the capacity to set the target response within a task was expanded to all response inputs (except free text input). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51442" pm="."><plain>This key development enabled results, such as percentages correct, to be displayed to the client at the end of each task and also assisted with automatic scoring and summation of client progress for the clinician. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51443" pm="."><plain>This automatic scoring functionality may further improve the accessibility and usability of eSALT for both clients and clinicians, as it should significantly reduce the time clinicians need to manually score tasks and provide feedback, as well as, provide the option for immediate feedback to the client. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="51477" pm="."><plain>Although this formative usability study used multiple methods to collect data during a feasibly study, a number of limitations were evident. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51478" pm="."><plain>Firstly, the usability data gathered from both end-user groups could have more comprehensively covered the use of the software by use of an expanded observational checklist that required all potential uses to be observed (e.g., an item specific to the participant's use of the audio recording and playback function) or by the software itself tracking usability in the form of error counts. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51479" pm="."><plain>The study by Simic et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) collected error counts, however, this was achieved through observation rather than software tracking. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51480" pm="."><plain>Usage data detailing exactly how long each participant engaged in therapy using eSALT (v1.1) and how long clinicians spent designing tasks and monitoring progress was not available in this study. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51481" pm="."><plain>The capture of usage data will be vital in future studies to bestow additional credibility to the usability and acceptability of data collected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51482" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, accurate usage data from both end-users would enable analysis of the potential cost-efficiency of asynchronous telerehabilitation in relation to the ratio of practice time by the participant with aphasia to clinician time in designing, monitoring and updating therapy tasks. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51483" pm="."><plain>The hardware chosen on which to run the clinician's desktop application was not ideal, with insufficient processing power and memory for the complex processing requirements of such an open and flexible software program. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51484" pm="."><plain>This led to the program being inefficient in the performance of functions such as saving and loading words/pictures. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51485" pm="."><plain>It will be important that future usability studies ensure that hardware is fit for purpose. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51486" pm="."><plain>The sample size of this usability study may be considered small, however, usability literature suggests that formative usability studies involving early prototypes and set in a real world context may record valid data from as few as five participants (Macefield, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51487" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, given the heterogeneity and complexity of aphasia there may be a need for future usability studies to include a larger sample of people with aphasia as well as a larger sample of clinicians from a variety of rehabilitation settings. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51488" pm="."><plain>Future usability studies should aim to further embed the research in real world settings so as to increase the ecological validity of the data and discover unanticipated issues earlier (Genov et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51489" pm="."><plain>For example, ecological validity of the data may be improved by including participants who are currently receiving other therapy, so as to diminish any potential Hawthorne effects in the data. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="51490" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there may be a need for different types of usability studies, such as comparative studies which might compare the usability of two or more interfaces or punctuated studies which promote an iterative development process (Macefield, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="51491" pm="."><plain>Since the completion of this study in late 2013, improved versions of eSALT have been used in a number of other research projects, including a trial of the effectiveness of the therapy provided through eSALT (UQ ECR Grant eSALT v4.2) and as part of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing a comprehensive intensive aphasia program to usual care (NHMRC Grant APP1057047 eSALT v4.1). </plain></SENT>
