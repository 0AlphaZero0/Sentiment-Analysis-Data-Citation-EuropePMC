</text></title><p id="Par34"><text><SENT sid="58335" pm="."><plain>Foot drop is the inability or difficulty to voluntarily lift the foot due to weak or absent ankle dorsiflexors. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58336" pm="."><plain>It is commonly caused by stroke, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58337" pm="."><plain>To avoid foot dragging during the swing phase of the gait, patients with foot drop adopt abnormal gait patterns characterized by hip hitching, circumduction and toe catch. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58338" pm="."><plain>These distortions of the gait pattern lead to a decrease in the gait velocity and walking endurance, longer stance and double support gait phases, an increased energy cost, instability and a tendency to trip and fall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par35"><text><SENT sid="58339" pm="."><plain>Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is an active approach for treating foot drop. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58340" pm="."><plain>It is a technique that relies on the production of short bursts of electrical pulses to induce contraction by eliciting an action potential in the motor neurons that innervate a muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58341" pm="."><plain>FES principles can be employed for the therapeutic treatment of foot drop and/or in the form of an active assistive orthotic device for daily use and the long-term replacement of the impaired motor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58342" pm="."><plain>FES-based therapeutic and assistive devices for foot drop correction typically stimulate the common peroneal nerve in the swing phase of the gait to ensure foot lifting, i.e., the dorsiflexion (DF) of the ankle (for a review, see references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58343" pm="."><plain>Moreover, producing plantar flexion (PF) with FES during the pre-swing phase of the gait results in better knee flexion, which also facilitates the swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par36"><text><SENT sid="58344" pm="."><plain>The most common challenges in foot drop FES applications are determining motor points, i.e., adequately positioning the electrodes, setting stimulation parameters that produce comfortable foot lift without unnatural foot eversion or inversion, and increased muscle fatigue from electrically induced contraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58345" pm="."><plain>Currently available commercial systems stimulate dorsiflexion only; they do not compensate for eversion (EV) or inversion (IV) and do not support push-off due to the complexity of proper electrode positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par37"><text><SENT sid="58346" pm="."><plain>One of the options for overcoming these issues is the use of multi-pad surface electrodes. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58347" pm="."><plain>Multi-pad electrodes comprise many relatively small stimulation pads. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58348" pm="."><plain>Each pad can be activated separately or as a part of a stimulation pattern, i.e., a set of individual pads that are associated with different parameters, including the pulse width and amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58349" pm="."><plain>Multi-pad systems aim to improve the selectivity of stimulation and provide easier and faster electrode donning and doffing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par38"><text><SENT sid="58350" pm="."><plain>However, many pads increase the number of possible combinations for stimulation electrode shaping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58351" pm="."><plain>Defining the stimulation patterns can be time consuming and laborious and requires medical training and knowledge of neurophysiology and anatomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58352" pm="."><plain>Therefore, novel FES systems may benefit greatly from an automated stimulation electrode shaping process that does not rely on precise or finely reproducible electrode positioning. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58353" pm="."><plain>Such an automated process can reduce the clinicians’ time and effort in therapeutic applications of FES and increase the users’ independence in terms of the everyday use of a FES system in assistive applications. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par39"><text><SENT sid="58354" pm="."><plain>Several groups have investigated the design of multi-pad stimulation systems and control algorithms for the automatic shaping of stimulation patterns/electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58355" pm="."><plain>Elsaify presented a proof of concept for using muscle twitches for the selection of stimulation patterns for DF induction using multiple individual electrodes positioned over the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and an inertial sensor on the foot for recording the twitch responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58356" pm="."><plain>Heller et al. described the principle of searching for an optimal 4 × 4 pad electrode within an 8 × 8 pad cathode placed over the peroneal nerve, with a common anode over the TA muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58357" pm="."><plain>More recently, Valtin et al. described a FES system for foot drop with the control of DF and EV during the swing phase of the gait by two decoupled iterative learning controllers. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58358" pm="."><plain>They employed two automatically tuned multi-pad electrodes, one over the TA muscle and the other over the area of the peroneal nerve. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58359" pm="."><plain>Foot movements were monitored with 2 inertial measurement units at the shank and foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58360" pm="."><plain>In a recent publication, Kenney et al. described a ShefStim device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] array-based FES system for the correction of foot drop that comprises a three-phase search algorithm for finding an appropriate candidate out of 25 stimulation patterns within a multi-pad array. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58361" pm="."><plain>Prenton et al. tested the automatic algorithm for stimulation pattern selection described by Kenney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for unsupervised use by individuals with foot drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par40"><text><SENT sid="58362" pm="."><plain>Although FES-induced ankle DF can correct foot drop, it also decreases knee flexion and ankle plantar flexion at the toe-off in the swing phase of the gait, which decreases the propulsive force generated during the transition from the stance phase to the swing phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], which in turn implies a need for more complex stimulation patterns in systems for FES-assisted gait, including the support of movements other than DF. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58363" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available multi-pad FES systems for foot drop treatment support the induction of both DF and PF movement. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58364" pm="."><plain>An assistive benefit of introducing electrically induced PF during FES-assisted walking is the enhancement of the propulsive force during the push-off phase. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58365" pm="."><plain>In addition to assistive effects, the therapeutic effects of FES that presumably arise through the facilitation of neural plasticity by increasing the strength of afferent inputs are also important to consider when designing a closed-loop FES system. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58366" pm="."><plain>In particular, an FES system in which the timing of the electrical input that creates the afferent feedback is synchronized with the electrophysiological correlate of voluntary movement (i.e., EMG or a position sensor) has been shown to facilitate neural plasticity (for a review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58367" pm="."><plain>Therefore, creating a natural, temporally precise sequence of phases (i.e., a FES-induced DF in the swing phase and a PF in the push-off phase of the gait) during FES-assisted walking therapy may further enhance motor recovery via the synchronization of sensory and motor information. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par41"><text><SENT sid="58368" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to clinically test a novel foot drop device supporting the induction of both DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58369" pm="."><plain>Because the system was based on multi-pad technology, we introduced and described a dedicated decision support system (DSS) to facilitate the process of defining the stimulation patterns for inducing ankle DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58370" pm="."><plain>The novel foot drop device that was the focus of this study comprised a custom-designed multi-pad electrode, an electrical stimulator, and a single inertial sensor (Fesia Walk, Tecnalia R&amp;I, Donostia/San Sebastián, Spain). </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58371" pm="."><plain>The novelty of the applied methodology lies in the multi-pad electrode design and positioning, covering the branches of peroneal and tibial nerves for supporting both DF and PF and a dedicated DSS for easier shaping of the DF and PF stimulation patterns. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p id="Par42"><text><SENT sid="58372" pm="."><plain>An additional goal was the clinical evaluation of the performance of the DSS for the automatic identification of high-quality pads for further electrode shaping. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58373" pm="."><plain>A qualitative assessment of the DSS output was conducted by comparing the pads suggested by the DSS with the pads selected by trained rehabilitation specialists. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58374" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we analyzed the variability of pads included in the DF/PF stimulation patterns during 20 daily sessions in 10 stroke patients. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58375" pm="."><plain>We also tracked the changes in the patients’ active and FES-induced ankle range of motion to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the proposed FES methodology for inducing good-quality movement. </plain></SENT>

</text></title><p id="Par101"><text><SENT sid="58620" pm="."><plain>We have described a new DSS for finding an optimal set of pads to produce both DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58621" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that a single custom-designed multi-pad electrode can selectively induce both DF and PF movements. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58622" pm="."><plain>The control of both DF and PF movements and the stimulation hotspots differed from all previously reported methodologies used for foot drop correction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58623" pm="."><plain>The pronounced session-to-session variability of the stimulation patterns emphasizes the advantages of multi-pad electrodes and the need for automation to facilitate stimulation pattern design. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58624" pm="."><plain>The semi-automatic procedure of statistical analysis of Q-ranked combinations and inclusion data on the final patterns optimized by the clinicians can serve as an initial step in this direction. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="58625" pm="."><plain>Future work will address the effectiveness of the gait therapy using the Fesia Walk system and the design of a fully automated electrode shaping algorithm. </plain></SENT>
