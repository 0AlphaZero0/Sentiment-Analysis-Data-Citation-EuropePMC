<SENT sid="69375" pm="."><plain>Fetuin-B, which is secreted from the liver, is the second member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Fetuin-B shares some similarity in functional analysis with fetuin-A, which has been found to cause insulin resistance by activating Toll-like receptors and inducing inflammatory signaling.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Meex et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> recently reported that fetuin-B was increased in humans with liver steatosis and patients with type 2 diabetes, impaired insulin action in myotubes and hepatocytes, and caused glucose intolerance in mice. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69485" pm="."><plain>MR study is one form of instrumental variable analysis for observational studies which employs the germline genetic variants as instruments for environmental exposure and has been considered as analogous to randomized controlled trial.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> To perform MR analysis, a few stringent assumptions should be met well.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> First, the instrumental variable is associated with the risk of interest. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="69488" pm="."><plain>By using the <italic>FETUB</italic> SNP variants which were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations as instrumental variables to assess the potential causal association of fetuin-B with insulin resistance, we found that the associations of measured fetuin-B and genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR were significantly different. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69489" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot exclude a potential association of genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR, the estimate was significantly different from the positive association of the measured fetuin-B with HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69490" pm="."><plain>There are several possibilities for the discrepancy on the associations of measured fetuin-B and genetically predicted fetuin-B with HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69491" pm="."><plain>First, our subjects are all adults with central obesity and older ages, and we may not have recruited appropriate population if the <italic>FETUB</italic> SNP variants affect insulin resistance earlier before they have been becoming old and obese. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69492" pm="."><plain>The second possibility of the discrepancy is that subjects who carry the risk alleles of <italic>FETUB</italic> SNP with elevated serum fetuin-B may have developed compensatory mechanisms against the risk of insulin resistance, as our obese subjects were all community-living and relatively healthy without apparently diagnosed diseases. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69493" pm="."><plain>The third explanation is that the observed association between serum fetuin-B concentrations and insulin resistance may be confounded by other determinants of fetuin-B and meanwhile <italic>FETUB</italic> SNP variants are not confounded by the same determinants. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69494" pm="."><plain>For example, fetuin-B is correlated with severity of hepatic steatosis which itself is also independently associated with insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69495" pm="."><plain>But the <italic>FETUB</italic> SNP variants have not been found to be associated with severity of hepatic steatosis, which has not been appropriately adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69496" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that the association of serum fetuin-B with insulin resistance is through other different mechanisms, and more pathway analysis for this association is warranted. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69497" pm="."><plain>Although MR analysis that is less susceptible to confounding bias and reverse causality was used in the present study, a few limitations still need to be acknowledged. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69498" pm="."><plain>First, our subjects were all obese, and we may underestimate the association between serum fetuin-B and insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69499" pm="."><plain>Second, insulin resistance was determined by HOMA-IR calculated with fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels rather than the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, which remains the “gold standard” for accurately determining insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69500" pm="."><plain>Third, <italic>FETUB</italic> rs4686434 significantly deviated from HWE. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69501" pm="."><plain>But we believed this would not change our main findings, as the other 3 tagging SNPs (rs3733159, rs1047115, and rs6785067) obeyed the HWE, and there were no genotyping errors detected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69502" pm="."><plain>Fourth, only 4 tagging SNPs were selected and rare SNPs with MAF &lt;0.05 were not considered in the present study; the number of the genotyped SNPs was limited and explained only a small fraction (9.2%) of serum fetuin-B variation. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69503" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some rare SNPs among the <italic>FETUB</italic> locus are associated with insulin resistance and may underestimate the true association between genetically predicted fetuin-B levels and HOMA-IR. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69504" pm="."><plain>So for future studies on the possible causal relationship between fetuin-B and insulin resistance using MR analysis, more genetic variants, including both common and rare SNPs, should be included as the instrumental variables. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69505" pm="."><plain>And the fifth limitation was that we have not replicated our findings, as there was no another independent cohort available for us at present. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69506" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our results should be confirmed in different populations with much larger sample size in future. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="69507" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study provided for the first time that the genetic variants in the <italic>FETUB</italic> locus were significantly associated with serum fetuin-B concentrations but were not associated with insulin resistance. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69508" pm="."><plain>Although we found that the elevated serum fetuin-B concentration was significantly associated with increased risk of insulin resistance, results from MR analysis suggested that this association may not be causal. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="69509" pm="."><plain>Future studies on the nongenetic determinants of serum fetuin-B concentration to assess if such unmeasured factors in the present study may confound the association between fetuin-B and insulin resistance are needed. </plain></SENT>
