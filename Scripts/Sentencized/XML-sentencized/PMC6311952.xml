</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="87658" pm="."><plain>Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer; approximately 80% of RCCs are clear-cell tumors [<xref rid="mdy454-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87659" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, lymph nodes, and metastasis (TNM) staging system are 81%, 74%, 53%, and 8% for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively [<xref rid="mdy454-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87660" pm="."><plain>Some patients with locoregional RCC have a relapse risk of up to 40%, increasing to up to 80% in patients considered to be at high risk for recurrence, and could therefore benefit from adjuvant treatment [<xref rid="mdy454-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="mdy454-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87661" pm="."><plain>The success of targeted therapies in the metastatic RCC setting led to increased interest in testing these agents in the adjuvant setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87662" pm="."><plain>Overall five additional trials assessed the utility of targeted therapy in the adjuvant RCC setting. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87663" pm="."><plain>Of the three completed trials (ASSURE, S-TRAC, and PROTECT) [<xref rid="mdy454-B5" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>], only S-TRAC met its primary end point. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87664" pm="."><plain>S-TRAC included patients with resected ≥T3 and/or N+ clear-cell RCC at high risk for tumor recurrence after nephrectomy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87665" pm="."><plain>Results showed that disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly longer with sunitinib treatment versus placebo: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.59–0.98; <italic>P </italic>=<italic> </italic>0.03; medians, 6.8 and 5.6 years, respectively [<xref rid="mdy454-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87666" pm="."><plain>Based on S-TRAC outcomes, the US Food and Drug Administration extended sunitinib’s indication to include the treatment of patients at high risk for recurrence after nephrectomy. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="87667" pm="."><plain>Axitinib is an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87668" pm="."><plain>In the phase III AXIS trial in the second-line setting of metastatic RCC, significantly longer progression-free survival and higher objective response rate were reported for axitinib versus sorafenib; however, the safety profiles were similar and manageable [<xref rid="mdy454-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87669" pm="."><plain>Consequently, axitinib is approved for the treatment of advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87670" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in various clinical trials, antitumor activity was observed with axitinib, both as a single agent and in combination with immunotherapy, in the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC [<xref rid="mdy454-B9" ref-type="bibr">9–11</xref>]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="87671" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the efficacy and safety of adjuvant axitinib versus placebo in patients with ≥pT2 and/or N+ RCC from the Adjuvant Axitinib Therapy of Renal Cell Cancer in High Risk Patients (ATLAS) trial. </plain></SENT>
