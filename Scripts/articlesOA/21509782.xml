Despite decades of intensive study, the immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> is incompletely characterised, reflecting the extremely complex interaction between pathogen and host. Pathways that may alter the balance between host protection and pathogenesis are therefore of great interest. One pathway shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic infections, including TB, is the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. We show here that the expression of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with PD-1, is increased in whole blood from active TB patients compared with whole blood from healthy controls or <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed individuals, and that expression by neutrophils is largely responsible for this increase.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neutrophils</kwd><kwd>Programmed death ligand 1</kwd><kwd>Tuberculosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type=""><title>Introduction</title><p>Infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), leading to tuberculosis (TB), remains one of the pre-eminent problems in global health, with an estimated third of the world's population infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. The majority of infected people remain in a state of &#x02018;latency&#x02019;, being asymptomatic and non-infectious, as the infection is controlled by the immune response. Nonetheless, a small proportion of infected individuals will suffer active disease or reactivate latent infection resulting in active disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>].</p><p>The immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> is complex and incompletely understood. Several factors are known to be necessary for control of <italic>Mtb</italic> but there is an incomplete understanding of which host factors are sufficient for successful immune control or which drive disease pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Therefore, there is great interest in how immune regulatory systems may modulate the balance between protection and pathogenesis during TB.</p><p>Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (also denoted as CD274 and B7-H1) is an immunomodulatory molecule that acts largely through interaction with the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. PD-1 interacts with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to deliver inhibitory signals that regulate T-cell and other responses, thus helping to maintain the balance between effective immunity, tolerance and immuno-pathology. PD-L1 is reportedly expressed on a variety of different cell types, including T cells and myeloid cells such as DCs and monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>].</p><p>PD-L1/PD-1 interactions can play a role in a diverse array of settings including infectious disease. In an infectious setting, PD-L1/PD-1 interactions are often associated with chronicity, particularly during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. PD-L1 reportedly suppresses T-cell proliferation and effector function, through binding PD-1, most notably on functionally &#x02018;exhausted&#x02019; CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic viral infections such as mouse models of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and also on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in patients infected with HIV or hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].</p><p>PD-L1/PD-1 interactions may also play a role in the chronicity of some bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>]. T cells from TB patients reportedly express PD-1, and PD-L1 could be induced on T cells stimulated with sonicated H37Rv <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 enhanced <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; responses and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell cytotoxicity from peripheral blood and pleural fluid mononuclear cells in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>]. Similar findings have recently been reported for NK cells obtained from pleural fluid and peripheral blood of TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, the expression of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 during TB remains incompletely defined, thus hampering the understanding of how PD-L1/PD-1 may regulate the immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>We have previously conducted whole genome microarray of whole blood from active and latent TB patients and healthy controls and shown a distinct transcriptional signature, comprising both under and over-represented transcripts, for the active TB group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. We wished to further investigate these data sets to determine the levels of expression of molecules of the PD-1 pathway in different cell populations in patients with TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><sec><title>PD-L1 is over-represented in active TB patients' blood and reduced with anti-mycobacterial treatment</title><p>Initially, we investigated the expression of transcripts for the main molecules involved in the PD-1 pathway, namely PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2, in whole blood from active and latent TB patients and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). PD-L1 was significantly over-represented in whole blood from active TB patients as compared with healthy controls and latent TB patients in three independent cohorts of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>); two recruited in London (Training and Test sets, <italic>p</italic>=0.0043 and 0.000521, respectively) and one from a TB endemic area (South Africa; validation set, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). The abundance of PD-L2 was increased in some active TB patients, particularly in the training set; however, PD-L2 levels overall were not significantly different in all three cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Seven active TB patients were tracked longitudinally during anti-mycobacterial treatment and PD-L1 levels assessed at time of diagnosis and at 2 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The over-representation of PD-L1 in blood of active TB patients seen at the time of diagnosis was significantly decreased with treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). One patient did not have increased levels of PD-L1 at time of diagnosis; however, upon further clinical analysis, this patient showed no radiographic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Although some active TB patients still showed elevated levels of PD-L1 transcripts at 2 months post-initiation of treatment, there was no difference in PD-L1 transcript levels in patients compared with healthy controls after completing successful therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>Together, these findings suggest that the presence of PD-L1 in the blood may be related to pathology and failure to control disease during TB.

There was variation between patients, reflected by spread in MFI of PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2A</xref>), likely representing the heterogeneity of TB patients, extent of disease and the natural variability in the human immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Further flow cytometric analysis revealed that PD-L1 was most highly expressed on cells that were consistent with CD16<sup>+</sup> neutrophils, whereas few cells consistent with CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes or CD3<sup>+</sup> or CD19<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes from active TB patients expressed PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>; Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Again, relatively low levels of expression of PD-L1 were found on all analysed cell types from the blood of healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2B</xref>; Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the increased level of neutrophil-specific PD-L1 expression in active TB patients, neutrophils, monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from blood of active TB patients and healthy controls were separated using magnetic beads, and the levels of PD-L1 transcripts determined using Nanostring nCounter technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). This technology allows capture and counting of individual mRNA transcripts in a complex mixture and has similar sensitivity to real-time PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Nanostring analysis of purified cell populations showed that purified neutrophils from active TB patients expressed significantly higher levels of PD-L1 transcripts than purified neutrophils from healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>), and this increased expression on neutrophils appeared to account for the total increase in PD-L1 expression in whole blood. Monocytes from active TB patients also had slightly higher expression of PD-L1 than monocytes from healthy controls, and although levels were significant they were much lower than in whole blood or neutrophils. There was no increased PD-L1 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells above controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2C</xref>). Thus, neutrophils appear to be the predominant cell type over-expressing PD-L1 in the blood of active TB patients.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report of PD-L1 expression by neutrophils during in vivo infection, although a recent report has shown that treatment of neutrophils with IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF upregulated PD-L1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] and an earlier report showed that LPS stimulation could upregulate PD-L1 on neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. We have previously found that neutrophils from active TB patients display an IFN-inducible signature that contained gene transcripts involved in both type I and type II IFN signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>]. Our results are therefore consistent with these earlier findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] but also suggest that type I IFN may play a role in PD-L1 upregulation on neutrophils, particularly as type I IFN reportedly upregulates PD-L1 on other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>].</p><p>How PD-L1 expression on neutrophils modulates the immune response during TB remains to be elucidated; however, it is possible that PD-L1 expression acts as a mechanism for limiting neutrophil-mediated immunopathology. This is in accordance with recent findings that PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> have severe lung pathology and succumb to disease much earlier than WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. This was associated with a dramatic increase in neutrophils in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In this study we show that the immunomodulatory ligand PD-L1 is over-represented in the blood of patients with active TB, that this over-representation is largely driven by neutrophil expression of PD-L1 and is diminished by successful therapy. This is consistent with an association of PD-L1 with failure to control disease and pathology. Whether PD-1/PD-L1 interactions act to suppress protective immunity during TB or as a mechanism for controlling neutrophil-mediated immunopathology will be important to elucidate. The majority of studies of PD1/PD-L1 interaction during chronic viral infection point to this pathway acting to suppress protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. PD-1/PD-L1 interaction may also therefore suppress protective responses during TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway suppresses <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific IFN-&#x003b3; production and cytotoxicity by T cells as well as IFN-&#x003b3; production and cytotoxicity by NK cells from peripheral blood and pleural fluid mononuclear cells from TB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Whether neutrophils expressing PD-L1 are able to suppress these protective responses in active TB patients would be important to investigate.</p><p>However, there is growing evidence that in intracellular bacterial infections, where protection is largely mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be less straightforward. Two models of <italic>Listeria</italic> infection demonstrated that abrogation of PD-L1 signalling during infection led to reduced antigen-specific T-cell responses, inhibition of key effector molecules, increased bacterial loads and increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>]. In addition, recent reports have shown that PD-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> also have significantly higher bacterial loads in the lung, increased lung pathology and earlier mortality than wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. Large increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in neutrophils but a decrease in T cells in the lungs were also observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. Another report has shown that PD-1 expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during murine <italic>Mtb</italic> infection are not analogous to the functionally exhausted PD-1-expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seen during chronic viral infections but rather are a highly proliferating, cytokine-producing population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. The effect of PD-1/PD-L1 interactions on innate and adaptive immunity during bacterial infection is therefore likely to be more complex than at first thought and this may complicate their use as a potential therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patient cohorts and healthy controls, sample collection and processing for microarray</title><p>This study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committees at St Mary's Hospital London, UK (REC 06/Q0403/128) and University of Cape Town, Cape Town, Republic of South Africa (REC012/2007).
