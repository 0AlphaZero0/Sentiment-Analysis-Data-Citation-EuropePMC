To better understand this mechanism, a microarray analysis was conducted on NK cells from healthy donors PBMCs that were co-cultured with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7-infected erythrocytes. A very similar pattern of gene expression was observed among all donors for each treatment in three replicas. Parasites particularly modulated genes involved in IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signaling as well as molecules involved in the activation of interferon regulatory factors, pathways known to play a role in the antimicrobial immune response. This pattern of transcription was entirely different from that shown by NK cells treated with IL-12 and IL-18, in which IFN-&#x003b3;- and TREM-1-related genes were over-expressed. These results suggest that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites and the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18 have diverse imprints on the transcriptome of human primary NK cells. IFN-&#x003b1;-related genes are the prominent molecules induced by parasites on NK cells and arise as candidate biomarkers that merit to be further investigated as potential new tools in malaria control.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infections caused by malaria parasites, especially by the species <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, remain a serious world health concern. The innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are involved in immunity to malaria, however, the engaged macrophages, dendritic cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and NKT cells fail to fully eliminate the infection <xref rid="pone.0024963-Stevenson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Urban1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Characterized by cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion, NK cells play a critical role as the front line of defence against pathogens and tumor cells. Within the setting of malaria, several studies have elucidated the interactions between NK cells, infected erythrocytes (iRBCs) and other immune cells leading to specific NK responses to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024963-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Experiments performed with NK cells derived from malaria-naive or infected individuals showed that these cells have cytolytic activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-iRBCs that is possibly mediated by FAS and Granzyme B <xref rid="pone.0024963-Orago1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Mavoungou1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The DBL-alpha domain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PFEMP1) was identified as the molecule through which NK cells recognize iRBCs <xref rid="pone.0024963-Mavoungou2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. MYD88-associated IL18R in NK cells was shown to be the major indirect sensor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0024963-Baratin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Experimental evidence suggested that, in addition to their up-regulation of CD69 and CD25 after contact with iRBCs, NK are one of the first cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; in response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This event was described to be dependent on cross-talk with accessory cells either via direct or indirect interactions. The possible bidirectional interplay between ICAM and LFA-1 on NK cells and macrophages was shown to be important for NK cell up-regulation of CD69 and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion <xref rid="pone.0024963-Baratin2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indirectly, the production of cytokines by accessory cells, especially IL-12, IL-18, IFN-alpha and IL-2, was shown to boost NK cell activation and IFN-&#x003b3; release in response to iRBCs <xref rid="pone.0024963-Newman1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>However, the magnitude of IFN-&#x003b3; release by NK cells is known to be heterogeneous among individuals, possibly influencing susceptibility to disease <xref rid="pone.0024963-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In this line, qualitative and quantitative differences in NK subsets found in malaria patients were linked to the severity of the disease <xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, correlations between KIR genotype and NK cell responsiveness to iRBCs have been reported <xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Microarray techniques have been widely used for research as well as for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, applications pertinent to host-microorganism interactions may be a good predictor of the biological processes thereby involved. In this study, Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays were used to examine the gene expression profile of primary NK cells from three healthy donors that were co-cultured with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. This pattern of gene expression was compared to the same NK cells following stimulation with IL-12&#x0002b;IL-18.</p><p>The response of NK cells to malaria has been the topic of several studies over the previous few years, but there is still a lack of information regarding the impact of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> on NK cells at a transcriptional level. A greater understanding of the NK cell mechanisms of sensing and responding to iRBCs is needed seeking the advantages of NK cell-targeted vaccines development against malaria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The three healthy individuals who served as NK cell donors are themselves authors of this study.

RMA16 was used for array normalization and signal calculation. Normalized signal values were imported into Genespring 11 (Agilent Technologies). Significance was calculated using a t-test without multiple testing correction, selecting all the transcripts with a minimum change in expression level of 1.5-fold together with a p-value of &#x0003c;0.05. Subsequently, transcripts in common for all donors in each treatment were compiled and gene network analysis and functional categorization was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>). The p-value associated with a biological process or pathway annotation for IPA is a measure of its statistical significance with respect to the Functions/Pathways/Lists Eligible molecules for the dataset and a reference set of molecules (which define the molecules that could possibly have been Functions/Pathways/Lists Eligible). The p-value is calculated with the right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test. The ratio is calculated by taking the number of genes from the dataset that participate in a Canonical Pathway, and dividing it by the total number of genes in that Canonical Pathway. The ratio indicates the percentage of genes in a pathway that were also found in the uploaded gene list (or the Functions/Pathways/Lists Eligible genes if a cut off was specified) and is therefore useful for determining which pathways overlap with most of the genes in the dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>

An <italic>in vitro</italic> approach was used to investigate the specific immune response to malaria. Such an approach is widely used in research especially in diseases where primary material is difficult to access. The gene expression profile and activation characteristics of NK cells incubated with iRBCs at a 1&#x02236;3 ratio (PBMCs&#x02236;iRBCs) were examined at one time point (24 h) after co-culture. These conditions were chosen based on prior observations showing that optimal NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production occurs at either 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> or 1&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> iRBCs per 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs and that the peak of IFN-&#x003b3; release occurs between 15 and 24 hours after stimulation <xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>First, these results demonstrate that all donors' NK cells have a very similar pattern of gene regulation for each different treatment. An interferon signaling gene expression signature is induced by iRBCs on NK cells, in which genes involved in a pro-inflammatory response, mainly mediated by type I interferon were modulated. A recent microarray study has described the up-regulation of <italic>IFIT1</italic>, <italic>IFIT3</italic>, <italic>and CXCL10</italic> (after 1 h of activation) and <italic>IFI44</italic>, <italic>IFIT2</italic>, <italic>and ISG20</italic> (after 18 h of activation) in IFN-&#x003b1;-treated whole PBMCs from healthy donors. Arrays performed with isolated cell subsets (NK cells, monocytes and T cells) showed the up-regulation of <italic>OAS2</italic>, <italic>OASL</italic>, <italic>ISG20</italic> and <italic>IFI44</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0024963-Zimmerer1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Another group has reported the up-regulation of <italic>TNFSF10</italic> (TRAIL), <italic>IFIT</italic> and <italic>OAS</italic> genes in NK cells isolated from IFN-&#x003b1;-2b-stimulated PBMCs from five healthy donors <xref rid="pone.0024963-Stegmann1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The expression profile of IFN-&#x003b1;-treated cells in these studies was very similar to the profile detected in iRBCs-activated NK cells in the current study, which did not utilize IFN-&#x003b1;. Therefore, such similarities provide support of a clear iRBCs-induced type I interferon-related response in NK cells. Moreover, the regulated molecules were linked to top canonical pathways, all belonging to the &#x0201c;cellular immune response&#x0201d; category. Some of the regulated genes were not yet assigned to a clear role in this category, but most genes were linked to well-known biological functions, mainly in infection control and inflammation. As in systemic lupus erythematosus (LE) <xref rid="pone.0024963-Baechler1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Petri1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, such inflammatory components were recently detected as increased IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-inducible genes in the blood of patients with Tuberculosis (TB), especially in their purified neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0024963-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Its correlation with disease severity provided primary data supporting a role for type I IFN in the pathogenesis of human disease. Here, we have observed that mostly the same transcripts found in the mentioned studies were overexpressed in our NK cells due to parasite co-incubation. It is difficult to extrapolate the LE/TB findings to malaria without confirmation with longitudinal studies; however, it is possible that the role of type I interferon signaling in diseases caused by intracellular pathogens will be a marker of disease progression and immune response development.</p><p>In this study, the IFIT family was found to be among the most highly up-regulated NK genes induced by parasites. To date, little is known about their function. Most of the evidence characterizes these proteins as inhibitors of cellular and viral processes such as protein translation <xref rid="pone.0024963-Fensterl1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Recent findings indicate that IFIT proteins are substantially induced during infection possibly reflecting a functional role. A complex formed by IFIT1, 2 and 3 was observed to exert antiviral activity by physically engaging microbial triphosphorylated-RNA suggesting that these proteins possibly have the ability to bind to various types of nucleic acids of other diverse microbes <xref rid="pone.0024963-Pichlmair1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> DNA, therefore, could be one target. In fact, DNA sensing and its relation to type I interferons have recently been revealed to be important in innate immunity to malaria <xref rid="pone.0024963-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genomic DNA, rich in AT motifs, was shown to generate type I interferon through two suggested innate pathways (a TLR9- and a STING- driven) which converge on the IRFs to regulate IFN gene transcription. Interferon type I, in turn, could possibly influence the outcome of the disease.</p><p>Instead of IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-related genes though, we expected to observe a direct up-regulation of the <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> gene in all donors treated with iRBCs (as was detected with the IL-12/IL-18 treated NK cells). To our surprise, NK cells from only one donor (donor K) up-regulated the <italic>IFN-&#x003b3;</italic> gene, and the fold change was much lower than that induced by IL-12 and IL-18. Nevertheless, it is very likely that this 3D7-mediated induction of type I-related genes reflects the first steps of a cascade of events leading to IFN-&#x003b3; release. In the case of a viral infection, there is consensus that the activation of NK cells is critically dependent on type I IFN signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this activation is achieved by its direct action on NK cells <xref rid="pone.0024963-Zhu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Others have shown that type I IFNs are an early and critical regulator of NK cell number, activation and antitumor activity and that, in combination with IL-18, type I IFN plays an important role in inducing IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells <xref rid="pone.0024963-Swann1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Matikainen1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In addition to overlapping with type II interferon at multiple levels of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, type I interferons have unique regulatory mechanisms for both their own signaling as well as IFN-&#x003b3; signaling <xref rid="pone.0024963-Theofilopoulos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. A very recent report showing the responses of human PBMCs to stimulation with type I and II interferons, among other cytokines, is in agreement with this co-induction concept. The authors describe the responses to IFN-&#x003b3; as being restricted to a subset of type I interferon-inducible genes whereas responses to type I interferon were highly stereotyped and resulted in the up-regulation of genes such as <italic>OAS1-3</italic>, <italic>MX1/2</italic>, <italic>CXCL10</italic>, <italic>STAT1/2</italic>, <italic>IRF2/7</italic> and <italic>IFIT1-5</italic>. However, after four hours of IFN-&#x003b1; treatment, transcripts of type II interferon itself were induced, which the authors suggested might play a role in the initiation of an IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent transcriptional programs in type I IFN-treated cells <xref rid="pone.0024963-Waddell1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Along these lines, <italic>L. major</italic>-induced IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; was suggested to mediate key events of the innate response to the parasite. NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion early in infection were shown to be decreased in the event of type I interferon blockage in mice <xref rid="pone.0024963-Diefenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. In a recent study with <italic>L. mexicana</italic> infection, type I interferon was also described to promote the early IFN-&#x003b3; and IL10 expression <xref rid="pone.0024963-Buxbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>
<italic>P. falciparum</italic>-mediated IFN-&#x003b1; responses have been previously reported by few <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies <xref rid="pone.0024963-OjoAmaize1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024963-Luty1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In accordance with our findings, new microarray evidence show that expression profiling of PBMCs derived from patients with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria show elevated expression of interferon-inducible genes (ISGs) <xref rid="pone.0024963-Sharma1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The study further confirms that PBMCs stimulated with iRBCs induce IFN-&#x003b1; at the protein level and IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA, suggesting a possible role for type I interferons in malaria. Although their gene expression profiling was performed with a mixed group of cells and hence cannot be traced to one specific cell population, the NK cells in the present study appear to respond in concert with PBMCs from malaria-infected individuals in that previous study. Furthermore, human plasmatocytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were suggested to produce IFN-&#x003b1; in response to <italic>P. falciparum-</italic>schizonts, which in turn promote &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; production <xref rid="pone.0024963-Pichyangkul1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Microarray analysis of whole-blood cells from <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected mice <xref rid="pone.0024963-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> demonstrated that the predominant responses at about 16 h to 24 h post-infection were dominated by interferon-induced genes and that after 32 hours there was a dramatic change in the regulated transcripts. However, there are contradictory studies regarding the importance of IFN-&#x003b1; in the immune response against malaria. A recent study has described that neither pDCs nor IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; were essential for parasite clearance as mice depleted of pDCs or IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor knock-out mice could control <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0024963-Voisine1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In contrast, experimental evidence suggested that IFN-&#x003b1; treatment of <italic>P. berghei</italic>-infected mice has a protective effect on the evolution of cerebral malaria and inhibits the development of <italic>P. yoelli</italic> blood-stage infections in mice <xref rid="pone.0024963-Vigario1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Vigario2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In addition, polymorphisms in the IFN-&#x003b1; receptor 1 were associated with protection against cerebral malaria in humans <xref rid="pone.0024963-Aucan1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. High titers of antiviral activity have been reported to be due to IFN-&#x003b1;, and a positive correlation between degree of parasitemia, interferon titers and NK cell activity was observed in acutely ill <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected children <xref rid="pone.0024963-OjoAmaize1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b1;, in combination with iRBCs, boosted the up-regulation of CD69 on NK cells but did not up-regulate IFN-&#x003b3; in the present study. Additionally, when testing the cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells from Donor E against <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, no significant interference in parasite growth was observed, even with the addition of IFN-&#x003b1;. Such lack of cytotoxicity was likely due to donor-related characteristics (low IFN-&#x003b3; responder) but it will be important to determine the reason that expanded NK cells treated with IL-12/IL-18 (which lead to IFN-&#x003b3; release) did not inhibit parasite growth. As mentioned before, others have described that the peak of IFN-&#x003b3; induction occurs around 15&#x02013;24 h after co-culture with parasites and that this response is dependent on cross-talk with other cells. Thus, it would be worth observing whether HPR2 is suppressed at earlier time points than 24 h and 48 h after co-culture and whether the addition of accessory cells to the system would interfere with parasite growth. To further investigate the importance of IFN-&#x003b1; on the NK response against parasites, 3D7-iRBCs were co-cultured with NK92 (NK cell line) in which <italic>IRF9</italic>, <italic>STAT1</italic> or <italic>STAT2</italic> were knocked down by siRNA and RT-PCR was used to verify the suppression of EBA-175 and BAEBL/EBA-140, which are vital parasite genes involved in invasion (our unpublished observations). However, no differences were observed in cytotoxicity of the siRNA -transfected cells against 3D7. One potential explanation for this is the fact that, due to the difficulties in obtaining large amounts of fresh NK cells, these experiments were performed with an NK cell line, which might not reflect physiological conditions. Another reason could be the choice to evaluate cytotoxicity by the NK population, although there is still considerable debate regarding the importance of NK and T cells in immunity to malaria. A very recent study with <italic>P. chaubadi</italic>-infected mice shows that the suppression of infection is dependent on &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells and independent of NK cells <xref rid="pone.0024963-Weidanz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Conversely, a study with a large cohort of malaria-naive donors shows that the majority of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells are &#x003b1;&#x003b2; and not &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells. Moreover, the authors of that study observed that NK cells dominate the early IFN-&#x003b3; response (around 18 h), that NK and T cells contribute equally to the response at 24 h, and that T cells dominate from there-after <xref rid="pone.0024963-Horowitz1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>The combination of IL-12 and IL-18 augments NK cell activity and stimulates NK production of IFN-&#x003b3;, a cytokine suggested to control <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0024963-ArtavanisTsakonas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0024963-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. PBMCs stimulation with high doses of IL-12 and IL-18 (as performed in this study) was previously shown to up-regulate NK cell expression of CD69 and CD25, and to stimulate the release of IFN-&#x003b3; <xref rid="pone.0024963-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. We were interested in determining whether there were similarities between the transcripts induced by IL-12/IL-18 and iRBCs. However, this was not the case. IL-12/IL-18 treatment induced genes strongly correlated to the signaling pathway triggered by <italic>TREM 1</italic>, an immune regulatory molecule that plays a role in innate and adaptive immune response <xref rid="pone.0024963-Bleharski1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. The molecule is expressed on monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, and neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0024963-Bouchon1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0024963-Cantoni1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> and its activation triggers molecules involved in cell-to-cell signaling/interactions and inflammatory responses (including CD83, IL-6 and TNF among others). NK cells induced by iRBCs in our study also modulated some genes related to this pathway although not as strongly as the IL-12/IL-18 treatment. The second strongest gene association was found with the protein ubiquitination pathway, which consists of a concerted action of enzymes indispensable for the rapid removal of proteins, the regulation of gene transcription, translational quality control and immune surveillance, to mention some of the functions. A prominent molecule in immune surveillance is IFN-&#x003b3;, which was found to be the top molecule (FC&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;92,460) up-regulated by IL-12/IL-18 treatment in this study. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules and this process is enhanced by IFN-&#x003b3;. This cytokine induces immune cells to express immunoproteasomes that impose changes on the normal cascade of actions of the pathway, consequently leading to the stimulation of host defence <xref rid="pone.0024963-Lecker1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.</p><p>Overall, this study provides evidence that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites induce IFN-&#x003b1;-associated transcripts in human NK cells within the first 24 hours of interaction. This study also demonstrated that the NK transcriptional changes induced by IL-12 and IL-18 are diverse from those induced by 3D7. Whether both patterns of expression converge at one stage and whether IFN-&#x003b1;-related transcripts result in IFN-&#x003b3; signaling, should be further investigated by microarrays and functional studies at different time points. The role of IFN-&#x003b1; in malaria is still controversial and understudied. This study suggests inherent regulatory molecules of the NK response to parasites that might be potential targets to be considered in malaria vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0024963.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
