We developed a strategy to study the coordinate regulation of such genes, and to compare different cell populations or tissues. A set of 150 genes, comprising different classes of epigenetic modifiers was compiled. This new tool was used initially to characterize changes during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) to central nervous system neuroectoderm progenitors (NEP). qPCR analysis showed that more than 60&#x00025; of the examined transcripts were regulated, and &#x0003e;10&#x00025; of them had a &#x0003e;5-fold increased expression. For comparison, we differentiated hESC to neural crest progenitors (NCP), a distinct peripheral nervous system progenitor population. Some epigenetic modifiers were regulated into the same direction in NEP and NCP, but also distinct differences were observed. For instance, the remodeling ATPase SMARCA2 was up-regulated &#x0003e;30-fold in NCP, while it remained unchanged in NEP; up-regulation of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CHD7 was increased in NEP, while it was down-regulated in NCP. To compare the neural precursor profiles with those of mature neurons, we analyzed the epigenetic modifiers in human cortical tissue. This resulted in the identification of 30 regulations shared between all cell types, such as the histone methyltransferase SETD7. We also identified new markers for post-mitotic neurons, like the arginine methyl transferase PRMT8 and the methyl transferase EZH1. Our findings suggest a hitherto unexpected extent of regulation, and a cell type-dependent specificity of epigenetic modifiers in neurodifferentiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromatin structure is a major determinant of gene expression. The transcriptionally active &#x0201c;open&#x0201d; euchromatin and the silenced &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; heterochromatin are two major structural variants. Increasing evidence points to intermediate forms which undergo dynamic changes especially during development <xref rid="pone.0036708-Khorasanizadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The mechanisms determining access of transcription factors to their regulatory sequences include DNA methylation <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bogdanovic1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, post-translational modifications (PTM) of histones <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kouzarides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and chromatin remodeling <xref rid="pone.0036708-Clapier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Histones, the most abundant chromatin proteins, are the building blocks of the nucleosomes. The latter consist of DNA wrapped around an octameric histone core <xref rid="pone.0036708-Luger1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Modifications of histones, and binding of further chromatin-associated proteins act in concert with DNA methylation to regulate access to the genetic information <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bannister1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Daujat1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kappes1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These control mechanisms that are independent of the primary DNA sequence are jointly termed &#x0201c;epigenetics&#x0201d;.</p><p>The enzymes catalyzing PTM of histones are classified as &#x0201c;writers&#x0201d;. They promote acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination of specific lysine residues or the phosphorylation of serines and threonines. Enzymes removing these histone marks, such as KDM6B, act as &#x0201c;erasers&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kouzarides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Different binding proteins, such as the heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) are recruited by specific histone modifications <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bannister1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These &#x0201c;readers&#x0201d; translate the code of the histone marks into structural changes of the chromatin. For many marks, e.g. the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me), multiple writers, readers and erasers are known <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kouzarides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Additional important players in chromatin dynamics are the multi-subunit chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the BAF complex, which can alter chromatin structure in an ATP-dependent manner <xref rid="pone.0036708-Clapier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Although the first genome-wide maps of histone modifications have been assembled for different human cell types <xref rid="pone.0036708-Azuara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, only scarce information is available on the expression, function and role of the different epigenetic regulators and modifiers during human neurodevelopmental processes. Most information on neuronal chromatin modifiers has been derived from neuroblastoma cell lines <xref rid="pone.0036708-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, and data on non-transformed cells are mainly of rodent origin. Epigenetic mechanisms have been studied during mouse development, both <italic>in vivo</italic>

These studies revealed interesting information on the lineage-specific expression of some chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex. Its neural progenitor stage-specific subunits (BAF45A, BAF53A) are exchanged for the neuron-specific (BAF45C, BAF53B) counterparts <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Differentiating hESC represent an interesting new model system to study early neural development, and allow the generation of pure populations of early neuroectoderm CNS progenitors (NEP) <xref rid="pone.0036708-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and neural crest cells, progenitors of the PNS (NCP) <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lee2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

Then, we assembled a representative list of 150 candidates to be studied. Their expression was quantified in human brain as well as in two tightly-controlled differentiation models, resulting in NEP and NCP cells, in order to investigate potential lineage- and stage-specific gene expression patterns of epigenetic regulators, and to validate the usefulness of the gene set for the characterization of tissue-specific profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cultivation of the hESC line H9</title><p>H9 cells were cultivated in HES medium (DMEM/F12, 20&#x00025; knock-out serum replacement (KSR), 1x GlutaMax, 100 &#x000b5;M MEM NEAA, 90 &#x000b5;M beta-mercaptoethanol and 10 ng/ml FGF-2) on feeder cells (mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)) at 37&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>.

The samples were taken for transcriptional profiling when the RNA quality indicator (RQI) number was &#x0003e;8.

The statistically most over-represented gene ontologies (GO), amongst the genes that were up-regulated in NEP more than 10 fold were all related to nervous system development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The six most significant GOs yielded for instance the categories &#x0201c;forebrain regionalization and development&#x0201d; and &#x0201d;nervous system development&#x0201d;. This is in good agreement with previous data describing this NEP population as rostral committed CNS progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0036708-Chambers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Transcriptional changes during the differentiation process are expected to be associated with epigenetic changes as it is known that epigenetic processes play a crucial role during cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0036708-Minard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In order to characterize such changes in our particular model system, we used various methods to characterize histone modifications on different levels of cell organization. First, we used Western blot analysis to quantify the global amount of different histone modifications across the entire chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The overall levels of the various histone lysine modifications evaluated for this purpose remained constant during the differentiation independent of their property to activate (H3K36me2, H3K4me3) or silence (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H4K20me3) gene expression. Secondly, the distribution of the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3 within the nucleus was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The results showed, that a dramatic redistribution within the nucleus occurred. In hESC, H3K9me3 was localized in sharply-demarcated speckles, while the staining was diffuse in NEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This relocalization process was confirmed by staining for another heterochromatin marker, H4K20me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, H3K27me3 and euchromatin marks (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K9Ac) did not change their localization pattern upon differentiation (data not shown). In contrast to the western blot results the H3K9me3 immunostaining looks as if H3K9me3 would increase upon differentiation. This apparent discrepancy could either be due to the very dense chromatin structure in the H3K9me3 spots in hESC or due to high concentrations of H3K9me3 present in these heterochromatin spots that are not adequately reflected by the immunostaining method. Western blot analysis is in this case the more reliable method to quantify protein amounts, and therefore we conclude that there is no significant change in the overall extent of H3K9 methylation during differentiation. Thus, the altered spatial organization of the histone marks was not due to overall changes in the amount of heterochromatin and euchromatin. In a third approach, we looked for histone alterations on the level of individual genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed for histone marks typically associated with silenced (H3K27me3) or open gene promoters (H3K4me3). We have chosen these two histone marks, as developmental regulator genes are described to be in a poised state (ready for activation or silencing) through the simultaneous presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bernstein1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Golebiewska1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The data indicated that the pluripotency genes <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> lost their H3K4 tri-methylation upon differentiation. Moreover, H3K27me3 was enriched in the <italic>OCT4</italic> promoter, whereas <italic>NANOG</italic> gained a bivalent status in NEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Both types of changes are consistent with the silencing of their respective genes during the differentiation. In contrast, <italic>PAX6</italic> was bivalently modified in hESC, but lost the silencing H3K27me3 mark upon differentiation. This is in agreement with up-regulation of this gene in NEP. No such changes were found for the <italic>SOX2</italic> gene, which is active both in hESC and NEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate, that chromatin may change locally (nuclear regional distribution) and gene-specifically, even though overall levels of certain chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) or of the DNA CpG methylation remain relatively constant <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lister1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We assumed that these specific epigenetic changes would require the fine-tuning of the activity of genes coding for enzymes that are specific for certain differentiation states or groups of genes. As little is known about such regulations, the major part of this study dealt with a characterization of epigenetic modifier transcripts, using neural differentiation as a test case.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Compilation of a set of genes involved in chromatin modification</title><p>Initially, we used oligonucleotide high-density microarray-based whole transcriptome analysis in hESC and NEP for data mining concerning the regulation of epigenetic modifier genes. By manual screening for few candidates, we found for instance <italic>DNMT3B</italic> to be strongly down-regulated in NEP compared to hESC. This correlated well with the function of this gene as pluripotent stem cell marker <xref rid="pone.0036708-Adewumi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The large and undefined amount of 400&#x02013;600 (depending on definition or gene ontology included) known epigenetic regulator genes makes it difficult to search for them manually on a gene array data set. Also, systematic bioinformatic analysis did not reveal an overrepresentation of a GO related to chromatin modification. During this search process, we realized that a GO comprising all epigenetic modifiers has not yet been defined.</p><p>Therefore, we compiled and annotated here a set of such genes that is a representative cross-section of epigenetic modifiers. For an initial candidate list, we selected few positive controls such as neuronal specific BAF subunits (BAF53B, BAF60C) or PRMT8. These are either known to be expressed specifically in the brain or to have a proven function during neural development, at least in mouse model systems <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kousaka1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Then, we scanned the GOs dealing with chromatin structure, histone modification, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. In combination with an extensive literature search we chose a representative set of these genes. Few additional factors were added due to their high sequence and domain homology to known epigenetic factors of the same family.</p><p>A total of 150 genes were selected according to the principles described above. These also comprised potential positive control markers for non-neuronal tissue, such as CDYL2 for the spleen <xref rid="pone.0036708-Dorus1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, CHD9 for osteogenesis <xref rid="pone.0036708-Shur1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> or HDAC11 for oligodentrocyte differentiation <xref rid="pone.0036708-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The genes were classified according to their functional role in epigenetic processes, and a graphical overview of their mechanistic role was provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). To make the background information for the selected genes broadly available, we compiled an extensive table that lists their supposed function as well as the supporting evidence for this function, together with relevant literature citations, and, if available, the genes' potential role in neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036708.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0036708-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0036708.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Compilation of 150 representative genes involved in epigenetic regulation.</title><p>The genes were identified, selected, and classified according to their function based on published literature and database searches.

This low amount of regulated genes was very surprising, in addition these genes were also regulated to a low level compared to neurodevelopmental genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036708.s003">Fig. S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036708.s005">S5</xref>). One reason for this could be due to the far lower sensitivity of microarray hybridization compared to qPCR. Therefore, we decided to use qPCR analysis as alternative approach. The relative expression changes of NEP vs. hESC were calculated from averaged data of three independent differentiations, and then visualized as a heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The full set of data including statistics is added as supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036708.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). About two thirds of the genes were up-regulated, and 16 of them reached relative transcript levels of 5-fold to 30-fold compared to hESC. For 68 of the genes, the relative expression levels identified by microarray and qPCR correlated well as 14 genes were up-regulated and 54 genes were not regulated with both methods. However, the regulation of an equally large group of genes (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72) was identified only by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0036708.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). We conclude that qPCR is a more sensitive and specific approach for the quantification of expression levels of this hand-picked selection of epigenetic modifier genes. This was also supported by the observation that the absolute expression levels detected by qPCR were mainly below ten-fold which might not have been detected by microarray hybridization. The remaining 10 genes that showed contradictory expression levels in qPCR analysis compared to microarray hybridization might be outliers that were not removed by statistical analysis of the microarray data. Alternatively, this could also be due to wrong affymetrix annotations of these genes or due to the analysis of different transcripts (splicing) of the same gene. As one example for a class of enzymes regulated on the transcriptional level, we chose histone deacetylases.

Therefore we assembled all investigated genes involved in these three epigenetic processes. First, the expression levels of components of BAF remodeling complexes were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Interestingly, the subunits considered to be specific for neural stem cells (BAF45A, BAF53A) were found to be highly expressed in cortex samples. However, the neuron-specific subunits (BAF60C and BAF53B) were expressed in Ctx at more than an order of magnitude higher levels (several hundred-fold compared to hESC) than BAF45A/BAF53A. A low, but significant expression of BAF60C was here also observed in NEP and NCP. This is in agreement with the literature as expression of this subunit has also been described for murine neural progenitor cells <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Next, we compared the expression levels of histone acetyl transferases (HAT) and found pronounced up-regulations of KAT2B (PCAF), MYST3 (MOZ), MYST4 (MORF) and NCOA1 (compared to hESC) in the other three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). This may indicate a role in general neuro-development. Such a role has indeed been shown for MYST4 and NCOA1 in murine model systems. MYST4 was shown to be essential for neuronal development of mouse cortex <xref rid="pone.0036708-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and NCOA1 is elevated in murine neural stem cells <xref rid="pone.0036708-Nishihara1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0036708-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0036708.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Synopsis of the regulation of different epigenetic modifier groups at different stages of neuronal differentiation.</title><p>Four groups of epigenetic modifiers were selected for a comparison of relative expression levels of NEP, NCP and CTX.

These proteins assemble two main complexes: PRC2 that methylates H3K27 via the catalytic subunit EZH2 or EZH1, and PRC1 that binds to H3K27me via the CBX4 (Pc2) subunit, ubiquitinates H2AK119 and establishes the dense heterochromatin structure that is needed for gene silencing <xref rid="pone.0036708-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Among the components of PRC1, we found a particular regulation pattern that is potentially specific for the developmental stage and/or tissue: CBX7, a homologue to CBX4 (Pc2) was up-regulated only in Ctx, but not in NEP or NCP. In addition, CBX8, a further particular isoform of CBX4, was up-regulated in all three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). This may indicate a neuron-specific role for CBX7 and a more general neuronal role for CBX8.</p><p>Most interestingly, we found a pronounced differential regulation pattern for the two isoforms of the PRC2-associated H3K27 methyl transferase. In Ctx, EZH2 was down-regulated, while EZH1 was strongly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). For murine <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> systems it was reported that EZH2 is exchanged with EZH1 in fully differentiated non-proliferative tissue <xref rid="pone.0036708-Margueron1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Moreover, the methylation of H3K27 catalyzed by EZH1-containing PRC2 complex results in a very dense chromatin structure, while chromatin methylated at H3K27 by EZH2-PRC2 does not change its higher order structure significantly <xref rid="pone.0036708-Margueron1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used two homogeneous and well-controlled neural differentiation systems to examine hitherto unknown regulations of the large set of genes coding for epigenetic regulators. The early precursor cells were further compared to cortical tissue. Thus, the cell types used to explore changes of chromatin modulators on the transcriptional level spanned developmental stages from embryonic stem cells to post-mitotic neurons. Our findings of pronounced cell type-specific regulations of the transcripts coding for chromatin-modifying proteins complement other types of approaches to study epigenetic regulations. While most previous studies have focused on the chromatin itself, by investigating histone modifications, DNA methylation patterns or the spatial chromatin structure, we investigated the expression levels of the genes catalyzing the above mentioned chromatin alterations.</p><p>For the initial characterization of the experimental systems used, we chose several traditional endpoints. For instance, some histone modifications were studied directly by Western blot and immunostaining. Although the global amount of methylated histones did not change during neural differentiation, the sub-nuclear distribution of such histone marks, as well as their abundance on individual promoters underwent striking changes. In parallel with the down-regulation of the stem cell markers <italic>OCT4</italic> and <italic>NANOG</italic> upon differentiation of hESC to NEP, the enrichment of H3K4me3 in their promoter region was reduced. In the same vein, the up-regulation of the neuroectoderm marker <italic>PAX6</italic> was paralleled by a loss of the repressing H3K27me3 mark in its promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). However, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the enzymes responsible for such chromatin changes. Because the group of genes involved in epigenetic modification has been poorly defined, only few broad tissue specific expression studies have been performed <xref rid="pone.0036708-Azuara1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Cheung1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Pan1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and these are mostly limited to mouse models or lower vertebrates. The set of epigenetic modifiers selected and characterized here should help to facilitate more studies on human tissue expression.</p><p>Many different proteins have been described to be directly or indirectly involved in opening or closing the chromatin structure, and therefore providing or inhibiting access for the transcriptional machinery. Complexity is added by synergistic and antagonistic actions of many factors, by the formation of multi-protein complexes with exchangeable subunits, and by the involvement of one given factor in multiple complexes and reactions <xref rid="pone.0036708-Clapier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Particularly important for our study is the feature that often one specific chromatin modification can be set by several different enzymes. For example, more than 15 different histone methyltransferases are known to catalyze the methylation of lysine 4 of H3 <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kouzarides1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Therefore it was interesting, that among the 8 H3K4 HMT, only the H3K4 histone methyltransferase <italic>SETD7</italic> was strongly up-regulated in both the neural precursor populations and in cortical tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This indicates that this specific enzyme may play a particular role in regulating neural genes.</p><p>Also the BAF chromatin remodeler multi-protein complexes contain different alternative ATPase subunits, such as SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 <xref rid="pone.0036708-Clapier1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is still unclear, under which circumstances these subunits are assembled into the BAF complex. Here we found cell-type specific regulation of these subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0036708-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The differential use and transcriptional regulation of chromatin remodelers may help in the future to characterize different cell types and developmental stages. Combined with more detailed future knowledge of preferred targets, e.g. of SETD7 or SMARCA2-containing complexes, cell-specific maps of their transcriptional regulation may complement other approaches to yield information on differential epigenetic regulations. The foremost outcome of the suggested PCR-based analysis will be a fast and efficient strategy for screening different tissues or cell types for differences of regulation on the transcriptional level. This may yield interesting fingerprints as such. In addition, this approach could be used as a first screen to identify candidates for more in depth examination of epigenetic modifiers. The subsequent studies would then address the functional relevance of the gene products. This would require more information on protein levels, on post-translational modifications of the respective proteins and also of their association with different multi-protein complexes.</p><p>During the course of this study, we tested different approaches to define a useful set of epigenetic modifiers. Initially, we looked up the genes that are included in the most obvious epigenetic GOs (&#x0201c;histone modification&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chromatin organization&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;chromatin remodeling&#x0201d;). We realized that many of the genes included in these GOs did not fulfill our criteria for an epigenetic modifier, i.e. the literature did not support their direct role in epigenetic modifications or regulations. For example, the genes coding for nitric oxide synthase or IL-1 were included in this list. Study of the primary literature for many more genes showed that the supporting evidence for a predominant role in epigenetics was often not solid. Part of the information included in the GO database is assembled in initial stages by data mining algorithms that screen scientific publications according to key words. This approach works very well for clearly defined biological areas such as &#x0201c;carbohydrate metabolism&#x0201d;. It works less well for epigenetic regulator genes, as many different processes impact on epigenetics and <italic>vice versa</italic>. This can easily lead to an erroneous classification of an epigenetically regulated gene as epigenetic regulator. Moreover, many enzymes like the above-mentioned nitric oxide synthase may indeed affect chromatin modifiers indirectly <xref rid="pone.0036708-Sen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, although this may not be their major physiological role.</p><p>Due to these problems, we hand-picked here a set of 150 epigenetic regulators genes after careful study of the literature. The list consists of players involved in all major groups of epigenetic mechanisms. We are aware of the fact that a more exhaustive list would rather contain about 1000 genes. Such a list would certainly be more complete, but it would also contain several disputable candidates, and it would be much harder to handle. We took here the practical approach to validate the applicability of our set of genes to confirm some known candidates. Our list included some epigenetic regulator genes that have known roles in vertebrate and non-vertebrate neuronal development or are expressed specifically in the brain in mouse model systems. The relative expression levels of these genes in our study provided first evidence for the usefulness of our set of genes. For instance, our data showed that <italic>PRMT8</italic>, <italic>BAF53B</italic> and <italic>CHD5</italic> were exclusively or very highly expressed in human cortex tissue (out of the cell types examined). This agrees with information for mouse tissue <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lessard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Kousaka1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Thompson1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, and we show here for the first time that these genes are also highly expressed in human brain.</p><p>At present, very little is known about epigenetic regulator genes that may be specific for non-neuronal tissues. Most knowledge is derived from knockout mice that show developmental defects upon knock down of a specific regulator gene. On this basis, some candidates in our list of genes may be up-regulated in other differentiation systems, during the generating of other cell types/tissues. For instance, CHD9 was reported to be involved in osteogenic cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0036708-Shur1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, and CDYL2 is expressed highly in testis, prostate, spleen and leukocytes <xref rid="pone.0036708-Dorus1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. For the examination of new tissues, these may be used as positive controls. However, this will have to be paralleled by the choice of a set of tissue-specific differentiation markers (similar to <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>Nestin</italic> and <italic>NeuroD1</italic> for NEP), which can then be used as overall positive controls for the correct differentiation and correct analysis procedure.</p><p>We also tested the ability of the gene modifier set to identify new differential patterns in related cell populations, such as different neural precursors or neural precursors vs. post-mitotic neurons. As we identified, in general, astonishing cell type differences, and differential expression patterns, for the genes that are yet little characterized, we conclude that the chosen set of modifiers represents a useful tool and starting point for future studies.</p><p>The major groups of genes that we found to be highly-expressed throughout neuronal development, were involved in histone acetylation, chromatin remodelling and PRC complex components. Surprisingly, only one H3K4 histone methyl transferase, <italic>SETD7</italic>, was strongly regulated. Further interesting changes involved ATPase subunits of chromatin remodelling complexes: <italic>CHD7</italic> and <italic>SMARCA2</italic> showed cell-specific expression profiles. In NEP, <italic>CHD7</italic> was up- and in NCP it was down-regulated. It is known that this chromodomain protein is required for the differentiation of hESC to early NCP and for frog neural crest formation <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bajpai1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. However, it is unclear, whether the gene still plays a role in developed neural crest cells or their progeny. Our findings of a relative down-regulation (also confirmed by microarray analysis; not shown) may indicate that CHD7 is less important, once NCP have developed, expanded and undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (as the cells used here). In contrast to <italic>CHD7</italic>, <italic>SMARCA2</italic> was up-regulated in NCP but not in NEP. This data may indicate a role of the ATPase in NCP cells, but we are aware of the fact that knowledge on protein levels and functional data would be required for a more definite statement.</p><p>Another example for cell type-specific expression differences was found for members of the PRC1 complex. The canonical <italic>CBX4</italic> (Pc2) subunit of PRC1, that binds the H3K27me mark <xref rid="pone.0036708-Simon1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Bernstein2" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, was neither regulated during early differentiations towards NEP and NCP nor was it highly expressed in the cortex. Instead, we found <italic>CBX8</italic> to be up-regulated in all investigated cell types, and <italic>CBX7</italic> to be highly expressed in cortex, while the levels in other cells resembled those in hESC. Therefore, the CBX4 homologue CBX7, may have a specific role in adult brain. We also obtained evidence suggesting a cell-type-specific subunit switch in the PRC2 complex. <italic>EZH2</italic>, the methyl transferase catalyzing the H3K27me3 modification, is expressed in the two progenitor cell types (NEP and NCP), but its expression was low in cortex, compared to hESC. Instead, its isoform <italic>EZH1</italic> was highly expressed in the adult tissue. Interestingly, it has been shown for mouse cells that chromatin methylated by EZH1 had a much denser structure than chromatin methylated by EZH2 <xref rid="pone.0036708-Margueron1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. However, the exact function of EZH1 is not fully clarified yet. Recently, EZH1 was reported to co-localize with active histone modification H3K4me3 indicating a different function of PRC2-EZH1 complex <xref rid="pone.0036708-Mousavi1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we compiled a representative set of 150 genes involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This list is only a small reflection of the hundreds or even up to thousand genes that have been described to be involved in epigenetics. The set presented here can still be handled easily, and it has been shown to be useful to indicate changes due to differentiation. This provides a basis for more detailed investigations of certain candidates or more comprehensive investigation of certain groups of genes. With this study, we have added a new approach to characterize the epigenetic status of a cell or tissue. It may be comparable to the characterization of transcription factor networks <xref rid="pone.0036708-Fulton1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Negre1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> or transcriptional profiling in other areas of cell biology <xref rid="pone.0036708-Zimmer1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Balaskas1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Falsig1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0036708-Lund1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In all such cases the information on the actual state of cellular constituents (in our case: chromatin) is very limited, and the absolute expression levels of what is measured are hard to interpret, but the relative changes and their dynamics can yield useful descriptions of a biological system, and define a level of information not easily obtained by other methods. This may be particularly interesting for toxicology, for the characterization of diseased tissue, and for the comparison of different cell populations generated <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0036708.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
