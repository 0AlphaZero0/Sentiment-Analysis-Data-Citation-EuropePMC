We explored the metabolome of &#x0003e;400 small molecules in serum of uninfected individuals, latently infected healthy individuals and patients with active TB. We identified changes in amino acid, lipid and nucleotide metabolism pathways, providing evidence for anti-inflammatory metabolomic changes in TB. Metabolic profiles indicate increased activity of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), decreased phospholipase activity, increased abundance of adenosine metabolism products, as well as indicators of fibrotic lesions in active disease as compared to latent infection. Consistent with our predictions, we experimentally demonstrate TB-induced IDO1 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate a link between metabolic profiles and cytokine signaling. Finally, we show that 20 metabolites are sufficient for robust discrimination of TB patients from healthy individuals. Our results provide specific insights into the biology of TB and pave the way for the rational development of metabolic biomarkers for TB.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a floating grant from the Max Planck Society to SHEK.

<xref rid="pone.0040221-Lawn1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0040221-Philips1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is characterized by chronic latency without clinical symptoms in the vast majority of infected individuals. Of the more than 2 billion people infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> globally, less than one-tenth is likely to develop active TB during their lifetime and in the majority of cases infection remains in an asymptomatic stage of latency. Even though TB can be cured, drug treatment is long-lasting and complex, and requires at least three drugs given over a minimum of 6 months. In many regions, notably in developing countries with high TB incidences, diagnosis is neither sensitive nor specific, and an estimated 40% of TB patients fail to be correctly diagnosed <xref rid="pone.0040221-Lonnroth1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The tuberculin skin test (TST) diagnoses immunologic sensitization to mycobacteria, indicating exposure, and hence cannot be used to distinguish infected healthy individuals from patients with active TB. More recently, gene expression profiling has shown promise in differentiating between infection states in TB <xref rid="pone.0040221-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0040221-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>We investigated the feasibility of identifying small molecule biochemical profiles in serum for gaining novel biological insights into the mechanisms underlying TB. The aim of this study is to use metabolites as biomarkers of TB infection and disease status, and to elucidate their role in protection and pathogenesis in TB. We acquired information on 428 distinct small molecules, including amino acids, short peptides, carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleotides and cofactors, and compared the characteristic metabolomic profiles of three groups: (i) healthy <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-uninfected controls (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup>), (ii) latently <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected healthy individuals (TST<sup>+</sup>), and (iii) patients with active TB (TB<sup>active</sup>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0040221.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p><p>We defined several remarkable differences between the metabolic profiles of healthy subjects and TB patients, including lower relative abundances of amino acids, medium-chain fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), higher relative abundances of fibrinopeptides and adenosine degradation products inosine, hypoxanthine and ribose, as well other compounds, such as bile acids and uremic toxins. The observed differences and correlations between compound abundances allowed us to construct functional clusters and infer their biological significance in TB disease progression. In addition, we could identify a serum metabolomic biomarker set that distinguishes active TB from the two groups of healthy subjects, which is a necessary first step towards the use of metabolic biomarkers in TB diagnosis. We also found that distinct cytokine abundances in several instances correlated with the relative abundances of metabolites, indicating a functional link between these systems. Finally, we studied the role of tryptophan degradation by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a well-known immunosuppressive mechanism. We revealed that IDO1 expression was upregulated in pulmonary lesions from mice suffering from experimental TB. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mirrored findings observed in serum.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Test Groups Differ in the Relative Abundance of Several Metabolites</title><p>Differences in the abundance of small molecules in serum between the three study groups were determined by applying a t-test for each of the three possible comparisons (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup> vs. TST<sup>+</sup>, TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup> vs. TB<sup>active</sup> and TST<sup>+</sup> vs. TB<sup>active</sup>), corrected for multiple testing at a significance threshold of 0.05.

Nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that three clusters of compounds included a specific profile. Both the inosine cluster and fibrinopeptide cluster revealed significant differences between the two healthy groups (TST<sup>&#x02013;</sup> and TST<sup>+</sup>), indicating that these effects are specific.

In addition, our study provides a first step towards the development of metabolomic-based diagnosis of TB. Moreover, understanding host metabolic processes during TB could ultimately inform individualized adjunctive therapy in combination with chemotherapy, notably, during prolonged treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB. Clearly, further development of a tailored biosignature suitable for TB diagnosis will require verification in independent cohorts and comparison with other pulmonary infectious diseases. Yet, our current analyses of several hundred metabolites has led to the definition of a signature comprising fewer than 20 metabolites for reliable discrimination between active TB and latently infected or uninfected healthy individuals, emphasizing the power of metabolomic profiling in TB. It is tempting to speculate that one day, metabolic signatures may be harnessed for the development of a simple and robust dipstick test for point-of-care diagnosis of TB.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Human serum samples: the study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Stellenbosch (Stellenbosch, South Africa) and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.

All solvents were similarly purchased in bulk from a single manufacturer&#x02019;s lot in sufficient quantity to complete all related experiments.
