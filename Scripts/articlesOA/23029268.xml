Each year around 9 million individuals newly develop active TB disease, and over 2 billion individuals are latently infected with <italic>M.tb</italic> worldwide, thus being at risk of developing TB reactivation disease later in life. The underlying mechanisms and pathways of protection against TB in humans, as well as the dynamics of the host response to <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, are incompletely understood. We carried out whole-genome expression profiling on a cohort of TB patients longitudinally sampled along 3 time-points: during active infection, during treatment, and after completion of curative treatment. We identified molecular signatures involving the upregulation of type-1 interferon (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) mediated signaling and chronic inflammation during active TB disease in an Indonesian population, in line with results from two recent studies in ethnically and epidemiologically different populations in Europe and South Africa. Expression profiles were captured in neutrophil-depleted blood samples, indicating a major contribution of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. Expression of type-1 interferon (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) genes mediated was also upregulated in the lungs of <italic>M.tb</italic> infected mice and in infected human macrophages. In patients, the regulated gene expression-signature normalized during treatment, including the type-1 interferon mediated signaling and a concurrent opposite regulation of interferon-gamma. Further analysis revealed <italic>IL15RA</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic> and <italic>GBP4</italic> as molecules involved in the type-I interferon response in all three experimental models. Our data is highly suggestive that the innate immune type-I interferon signaling cascade could be used as a quantitative tool for monitoring active TB disease, and provide evidence that components of the patient&#x02019;s blood gene expression signature bear similarities to the pulmonary and macrophage response to mycobacterial infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the following organizations: the Netherlands&#x02019; Organization of Scientific Research (NWO); the Royal Netherlands&#x02019; Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); WOTRO/NACCAP; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges in Global Health (grant GC6#74); the Netherlands Leprosy Relief Foundation; the Q.M.

A bacteriologically confirmed diagnosis of TB is challenging, as direct microscopy has low sensitivity, bacterial culture takes 2 to 4 weeks, and sputum samples can be microbiologically false negative. Effective treatment of active TB is crucial in containing spread of the disease, and better diagnostics would greatly impact on TB control by facilitating early treatment. Little is known about the precise mechanisms and pathways that control protective versus pathogenic immunity during TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The IL-12/IFN-&#x003b3; and the TNF/TNFR axis are both crucial in protection during <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, as genetic (<italic>e.g.</italic> defects in the IL-12/IL-23/IFN-&#x003b3;/STAT1 axis) or acquired (HIV; immune-suppressants; anti-cytokine auto-antibodies) defects strongly increase host-susceptibility to mycobacterial disease <xref rid="pone.0045839-vandeVosse1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Levin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b3; is produced mostly by CD4+ T cells and assists macrophages in controlling intracellular <italic>M.tb</italic> infection through various anti-microbial immunity pathways, which include phagosomal maturation; anti-microbial peptides; oxidative stress; apoptosis and autophagy <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although IFN-&#x003b3; is essential to protection against <italic>M.tb</italic>, it is not in itself a correlate of protection, however.</p><p>Several studies have profiled gene expression patterns in peripheral blood from TB patients <xref rid="pone.0045839-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In a most comprehensive recent study, Berry <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> reported a previously unappreciated role of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling in TB pathogenesis. Blood transcriptional profiles of active TB patients were dominated by a neutrophil driven IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; inducible gene expression profile <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A more recent study compared gene expression patterns in the blood of tuberculosis and sarcoidosis patients (of European descent), a chronic inflammatory lung disease with granulomatous inflammatory pathology similar to TB, and observed a very similar pattern in gene-expression, miRNA expression and serum cytokine levels between the two diseases <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These data strongly suggest the presence of a major core pro-inflammatory pathway in TB and sarcoidosis, although also disease specific patterns could be distinguished marking TB and sarcoidosis. Thus there has been substantial success in identifying biomarkers associated with active TB.</p><p>Notwithstanding the value of these two genome wide gene expression studies reported recently, a major outstanding question is whether these signatures, captured mostly in EU and South African populations, also translate to populations and regions with a very different host genetic and TB epidemiological background. Our study addresses this issue directly by assessing unbiased whole genome expression profiles in Indonesia, an Asian country with the third highest TB prevalence worldwide. Specifically, we have examined gene expression patterns in PBMC from a longitudinal patient cohort during active TB, TB treatment and TB convalescence. Moreover, we replicated the findings in two independent model systems, a mouse <italic>M.tb</italic>-infection model and a mycobacterium-infected human macrophage cell line model. Although mouse models typically do not develop caseous necrotic lesions, the hallmark of human pulmonary TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, both mice and humans develop TB granulomas in the lung with activation of similar pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0045839-Schafer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and develop highly parallel innate and adaptive immune responses during <italic>M.tb</italic> infection <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Dharmadhikari1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Ottenhoff4" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Our results validate and significantly extend the results available in the current literature, extend these to different ethnic and TB epidemiological settings, and further refine the pro-inflammatory biomarker signature associated with active TB.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene Expression Profiles of Active TB Patients Versus Healthy Controls in a Longitudinal Patient Cohort from Indonesia</title><p>To identify molecular signatures involved in active TB, we applied microarray analysis to compare global gene expression in 23 patients with active TB (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 weeks), whilst they were undergoing treatment (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8 weeks), and after they had completed the entire course of treatment (t&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28 weeks).

This result significantly extends those of Berry et al <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and Maertzdorf et al <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. who found highly similar signatures in the blood of TB patients in Europe and South Africa; our results now confirm and extend this to a TB endemic setting on a third continent in a different host genetic as well as TB epidemiological setting, namely Indonesia. In addition, our results confirm and validate part of the findings in two independent models of TB infection, thus connecting the TB patient blood expression profiles to pulmonary and macrophage expression signatures.</p><p>Our un-biased whole genome microarray analysis revealed that the most prominent host responses in all three models of infection were immune related. The most significant pathways were interferon mediated immunity, macrophage mediated immunity and cytokine and chemokine mediated signaling pathways. Further analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the TB patient study revealed that the type-1 interferon signaling activity was the predominant pathway up-regulated during active disease, and that there was concurrent down-regulation of interferon-gamma. This is consistent with findings that key protective immune mechanisms are repressed by type-1 interferon signaling during active TB infection <xref rid="pone.0045839-Korbel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-vandeWetering1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> as a possible immune evasion response.</p><p>The network analysis of genes found to be commonly regulated in all 3 independent TB disease models showed that the most significant network was mainly involved in IL-12, IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; signaling. This is indeed noteworthy as evidence implicating the involvement of type 1 interferon (IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2;) in TB have only begun to emerge very recently <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the present study, we have shown an up regulation in type 1 interferon (&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;) and the genes involved. Kuchtey <italic>et al</italic>., showed that during early infection (2&#x02013;3 weeks post infection) there was an enhanced growth of <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG in the lungs of mice deficient in IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; receptors, and during late infection the burden of BCG was similar in lungs of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild type mice <xref rid="pone.0045839-Kuchtey1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Desvignes <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported a similar non redundant protective role for type-1 interferons during early <italic>M.tb</italic> infection in a mouse model <xref rid="pone.0045839-Desvignes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In a large human study using whole blood from active TB patients <italic>vs.</italic> uninfected controls, Berry <italic>et al</italic>., found an increase in type 1 IFN which was attributed predominantly to neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Here, however, we present highly similar findings in TB patients&#x02019; blood leucocytes, which were depleted of neutrophils through Ficoll density centrifugation, but still include monocyte/macrophages. The fact that the latter are the most likely source of this signature was supported by the finding of a similar signature in an independent, human macrophage cell line model of mycobacterial infection. Also in another study using whole blood to compare gene expression profiles in TB patients with active disease <italic>vs.</italic> individuals with latent <italic>M.tb</italic> infection several interferon inducible genes were found to be profoundly upregulated, including IFN-&#x003b1; protein 6 and 27 and ISG15 <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, exogenously added IFN-&#x003b1; was found to inhibit the priming effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on key cytokine release by monocytes <xref rid="pone.0045839-vandeWetering1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. IFN-&#x003b2; was found to have a similar effect <xref rid="pone.0045839-dePaus1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. This is compatible with a model in which enhanced type I interferon signaling inhibits type II interferon mediated protective immunity in TB.</p><p>It is unsurprising that of all immune cells and corresponding signaling systems (T-cells, B-cells, monocytes/dendritic cells/macrophages, natural killer cells), the macrophage-mediated immunity process was consistently found to play a dominant role (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0045839-t001">

Alveolar macrophages phagocytose inhaled <italic>M.tb</italic> by a wide range of receptors such as complement receptors CR1, 3 and 4; mannose receptors; Toll-like receptors; C-type-2 lectin receptors and scavenger receptors <xref rid="pone.0045839-Sinai1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The further influx of macrophages following the formation of a primary lesion further highlights the key role of these professional phagocytes in pulmonary host defence in TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. <italic>M.tb</italic> however inhibits macrophage activity by inhibiting autophagy, an important cellular mechanism to control intracellular <italic>M.tb</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0045839-Gutierrez1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Petruccioli1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In addition, <italic>M.tb</italic> blocks the maturation of phagosomes such that they fail to traffic further along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and fail to fuse with lysosomes. One newly identified receptor which may be important in this process is human TLR8. A polymorphism resulting in a missense mutation in TLR8 (Met1Val) was recently shown to be strongly associated with human susceptibility to TB <xref rid="pone.0045839-Davila1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Increased credence to the possible involvement of TLR8 in upstream <italic>M.tb</italic> recognition is lent by findings from the expression array in the longitudinal patient cohort, which highlighted the significance of the immunity and defense pathway in active disease, including TLRs. It may be of interest to note that TLR8 is absent from mice, which could account for part of the differences in TB infection biology between humans and mice.</p><p>Further validation of our findings using qRT-PCR revealed that <italic>IL15RA</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic> and <italic>GBP4</italic> were involved in this molecular signature in all three models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g006">
<bold>Figure 6</bold>
</xref>). <italic>IL15RA</italic> encodes for interleukin-15 (IL-15) receptor alpha (IL-15R&#x003b1;), a common cytokine receptor expressed by macrophages that plays an important role in the development, survival, and proliferation of various immune cells (e.g. natural killer and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). IL-15, which is co expressed with IL-15R&#x003b1; by antigen presenting cells allowing trans-production of cytokines to immune effector cells <xref rid="pone.0045839-Wong1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> is generally considered to be a regulator of T cell homeostasis as it cooperates with other cytokines like IL-2 and IL-7 to maintain pools of naive and memory T cell populations. Mortier <italic>et al</italic>., has described that IL-15R&#x003b1; expression on macrophages supports the early transition of antigen specific effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to memory cells <xref rid="pone.0045839-Mortier1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As these processes are critical in the early immune response against microbial infections, and as data on the potential protective effects of IL-15 on murine experimental tuberculosis is starting to emerge, further studies are necessary in order to document the precise mechanism of action of IL-15-mediated type-I interferon signaling on <italic>M.tb</italic> survival and proliferation.</p><p>The second gene with consistent validation across the three TB models studied here, <italic>UBE2L6</italic>, is a member of the ubiquitin family of proteins. The modification of proteins with ubiquitin is an important cellular mechanism for targeting abnormal or short-lived proteins for degradation, and recent work linking the ubiquitin family of proteins to type-I interferon mediated host immune responses is now beginning to emerge <xref rid="pone.0045839-Oshiumi1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0045839-Jeon1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>The third gene, <italic>GBP4,</italic> encodes Guanylate binding protein 4. With IFN-&#x003b1; being a main hypothesis in our study, it is reassuring that <italic>GBP4</italic> was commonly found in all 3 models, and indeed GBP4 displays a direct interaction with IFN-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g007">
<bold>Figure 7</bold>
</xref>). Type 1 and 2 IFNs have been shown to differentially regulate the <italic>GBP</italic> family of genes, and GBP4 is exclusively regulated by IFN-&#x003b1; production through macrophages <xref rid="pone.0045839-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>In our study a substantial number of overlapping genes were identified when comparing BCG infected human macrophage cells and circulating leucocytes from TB patients with active disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g003">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). The majority of these genes was present in the immune-mediated and host defense pathways. It needs to be highlighted that these genes were also common when the mouse TB infection model was compared to the data from the human models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g004">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). The genes overlapping in all three systems were further validated with qRT-PCR. The 15 genes that were successfully validated in the THP-1 cell line model by qRT-PCR completely overlapped with the 17 genes validated by qRT-PCR in the longitudinal patient cohort. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045839-g006">
<bold>Figure</bold>
<bold>6</bold>
</xref>). This is not surprising since both models share a common human host background. The fact that only 3 genes were common to all three models may reflect important differences between the human and mouse models of TB. The PCR validation of these genes may represent an underestimate of the of the true array findings as the detection probes did not directly overlap with the array probes and so may not be able to confirm the specific RNA transcript identified by the array, particularly in the mouse to human comparisons. Although the use of BCG rather than <italic>M.tb</italic> in the THP-1 infection model may also have contributed to this relatively low number, it should be emphasized that the analysis focused only on those genes found in <underline>all</underline> three models, and that the variation between the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected human patients and the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected mice was significantly larger that that between the <italic>M.tb</italic> infected human patients and the BCG infected THP-1 cells. Our approach thus excludes the identification of genes based on only one individual model, and identifies genes only when they have been validated in three models, which is a significant advance compared to previous studies. In our study the mice were infected with <italic>M.tb</italic> intravenously, and it will be of interest to see whether infection via the aerosolic route, which is reflective of natural TB transmission, would have yielded similar response patterns. A cardinal feature of human TB is of central caseous necrosis in pulmonary granulomatous lesions, while such necrotic lesions are not seen in the mouse TB infected lung. Caseous necrosis is considered an essential step towards developing cavernous TB, in which phase <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli are released into the open airways prior to transmission. Thus, there are clear differences in the pathological manifestations of TB in human and mouse systems and this difference in disease pathology has been central to the argument that the mouse is an imperfect model for TB. However, notwithstanding these differences, we were able to observe consistent molecular signatures of active TB across the distinct models, thus supporting the general conclusion that mouse models are appropriate for studying certain aspects of the immune molecular host response to infection.</p><p>The use of TB patients cohorts, <italic>in vitro</italic> human macrophage cell lines and inbred mouse models of TB have provided new information which is in line with, but also significantly extends recent work from other groups <xref rid="pone.0045839-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0045839-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the major role of dysregulated inflammation in general, and of strongly enhanced type 1 IFN-&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling in active TB disease. Importantly whereas this latter finding was originally attributed to the activity of neutrophils, we here find these same gene expression patterns also in cells devoid of neutrophils, such as PBMCs and macrophages. Finally, our study discovered genes commonly expressed in all three TB models we have studied, for example <italic>IL15RA</italic>, <italic>UBE2L6</italic> and <italic>GBP4</italic> which are all common to the IFN-&#x003b1; network. Future studies should extend this also to protein expression profiles to determine whether these differences are also present at the protein level. This will allow further insights into their possible function during TB disease and <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, and help to better delineate new TB biomarker signatures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia, Jakarta, and by the Eijkman Institute Research Ethics Committee, Jakarta, and written consent was voluntarily signed by all patients and control subjects <xref rid="pone.0045839-Sahiratmadja1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Patient Recruitment</title><p>After informed consent, 23 new pulmonary tuberculosis patients above 15 years of age were recruited from an outpatient tuberculosis clinic in central Jakarta (Indonesia) <xref rid="pone.0045839-Sahiratmadja1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

The canonical pathways are described in the library of the Ingenuity Pathways knowledge base and are based on well-known established textbook literature where molecular links are known. The networks are built from a compilation of literature searches. Connecting lines between nodes represent one or more publications which imply a direct or indirect connection between the genes. The Ingenuity program is updated monthly to reflect new publications.</p><p>For canonical pathways, the significance of the association was measured in two ways: (i) by the ratio of the number of genes from the data set that map to the pathway divided by the total number of genes in that pathway and (ii) by using the Benjamin-Hochberg multiple corrected p-value to obtain a p-value determining the probability that the association between the genes in the data set and the canonical pathway is explained by chance alone, correcting for multiple testing of the same genes against different canonical pathways.</p><p>Network-wise, IPA computes a score for each network related to the fit of the input set of differentially expressed genes. The score is obtained from the likelihood that the focus genes in a network are together due to chance alone, with a score of 2 being equivalent to a p-value of 0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) by Fluidigm System</title><p>Using the extracted RNA from the three systems above, 100 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Kit for 1000 reactions (ABI, USA), and processed for the 48.48 Fluidigm Microfluidic Chips, according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, together with data analysis using the Biomark qRT-PCR analysis and Biomark Melting Curve analysis software (Fluidigm, USA).
