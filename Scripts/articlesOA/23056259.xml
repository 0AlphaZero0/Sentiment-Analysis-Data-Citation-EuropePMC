While most remain asymptomatic, with latent TB, approximately 10% develop active TB during their lifetime <xref rid="pone.0046191-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Over nine million new cases of active TB and 1.4 million deaths annually have been reported <xref rid="pone.0046191-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Improved diagnostics, treatments of shorter duration and improvements in treatment monitoring are badly needed.</p><p>Active pulmonary TB diagnosis requires culture of <italic>Mtb</italic>, which may take up to 6 weeks <xref rid="pone.0046191-Pfyffer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although the World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed GeneXpert MTB/RIF automated molecular test for <italic>Mtb</italic> results in rapid diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0046191-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, this test still requires sputum which may be difficult to obtain. Difficulties in obtaining sputum lead to approximately 30% of patients in the USA and 50% of South African patients to be treated empirically <xref rid="pone.0046191-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046191-CCDC1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. After diagnosis there are no available early biomarkers correlating with treatment success, resulting in significant delay in assessing treatment response. Currently conversion to negative culture after 2 months of treatment is the only accepted biomarker <xref rid="pone.0046191-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However a systematic review and meta-analysis of sputum conversion revealed low sensitivity and modest specificity for the prediction of treatment failure <xref rid="pone.0046191-Horne1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Chest X-rays are commonly used to assess response but are not universally available and assessment is difficult to standardise <xref rid="pone.0046191-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This lack of effective treatment monitoring can lead to the development and spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) TB, which are mainly caused by non-adherence or inappropriate drug regimens, with a detrimental impact on global TB control.</p><p>To date transcriptional profiling has been used successfully in cancer classification, to identify prognostic biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0046191-ReisFilho1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and to distinguish between inflammatory and infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0046191-Pascual1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Moreover we recently demonstrated a whole blood transcriptional signature which could distinguish active TB from latent TB and other diseases, and which correlated with radiographic extent of disease <xref rid="pone.0046191-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This active TB blood signature diminished in seven patients after 2 months of successful treatment and reverted to that of healthy individuals after completing treatment <xref rid="pone.0046191-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Earlier blood biomarkers correlating with treatment response would improve monitoring of individual patient treatment responses without the need for sputum production, which may permit stratification of patients requiring differing treatment regimens. Additionally early biomarkers may aid in anti-TB drug development.</p><p>Our study was therefore designed to establish if early changes in blood transcriptional responses can be observed during standard anti-TB treatment. In addition this adds to our previous study by examining the transcriptional treatment response directly in a larger cohort from a high-burden TB country, South Africa <xref rid="pone.0046191-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Our study demonstrated that a change in the whole blood host transcriptional signatures was significantly detectable as early as 2 weeks after initiation of treatment, providing potential for the development of early biomarkers for treatment monitoring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population and Inclusion Criteria</title><p>All participants in South Africa were recruited from the Ubuntu TB/HIV clinic in Khayelitsha, a large peri-urban African township in Cape Town which has over 1000 TB notifications annually.

The 29 South African patients were sampled at: pre-treatment (29/29 patients), 2 weeks (25/29 patients), 2 months (24/29 patients), 6 months (25/29 patients) and 12 months (29/29 patients) after initiation of treatment. Thirty-eight South African latent individuals were sampled as asymptomatic controls. Only five latent individuals were aware of prolonged contact with another individual with active TB.

By plotting the expression profiles of the 15,837 transcripts along a time scaled x-axis, a marked change was readily observed after 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Next an active TB 664-transcript signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046191.s005">Table S2</xref>) was derived from differentially expressed genes in the pre-treatment active TB patients compared to the latent TB patients in the South Africa 2011 cohort. First, all transcripts were normalised to the median of the latent TB patients, then only transcripts with &#x02265; twofold change from the median were selected, before applying a statistical filter. When this signature was applied to the South Africa 2011 Cohort, during and after treatment, a marked and rapid change in the transcriptional response was observed as early as 2 weeks, which then continued through 2 and 6 months, after treatment initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In agreement with our previous study, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the active TB 664-transcript signature demonstrated a highly significant over-representation of Interferon (IFN)-signaling

To assess this we employed the previously described weighted molecular distance to health (MDTH) algorithm as this generates a quantitative score for the degree of transcriptional perturbation in a disease cohort relative to the controls <xref rid="pone.0046191-Pankla1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Moreover we have already demonstrated that MDTH positively correlates with the severity of active pulmonary TB, as defined by the radiological extent of disease <xref rid="pone.0046191-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We found that the median MDTH of the South African untreated active TB 664-transcript signature decreased significantly at 2 weeks onwards, compared to the median pre-treatment MDTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We then developed a novel metric that provides a quantitative measure of an individual&#x02019;s temporal change in gene expression. This &#x02018;temporal molecular response&#x02019; offers a potential advantage in the clinical setting, allowing assessment of each patient&#x02019;s expression change without reference to a control group. For a given signature the temporal molecular response was determined by measuring the transcriptional perturbation between two time points, and expressing this value as a percentage of the total number of transcripts constituting the signature. The mean temporal molecular response calculated for the active TB 664-transcript signature revealed a statistically significant change in the transcriptional response at 2 weeks after treatment initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). This continued to change between 2 weeks and 2 months, and between 2 weeks and 6 months, after treatment initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The magnitude of the patient&#x02019;s temporal molecular response during treatment (at 2 weeks and 2 months) did not correlate with the magnitude of their untreated transcriptional signature, as measured by MDTH (p&#x0003c;0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046191.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This suggests a patient&#x02019;s untreated transcriptional signature is not predictive of the patient&#x02019;s treatment response.</p><p>In summary we show that this active TB 664-transcript signature (derived from untreated active and latent TB patients) significantly and rapidly changed after 2 weeks of initiating treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figure 2B, E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>A Specific TB Treatment Response Signature Also Significantly Diminishes At 2 Weeks Post Treatment</title><p>We next sought to define a transcriptional signature that specifically reflected the patients&#x02019; response to clinically successful anti-TB treatment (comparing time points 0 and 6 months). To determine this treatment specific signature we first used a computer algorithm to randomise the South Africa 2011 cohort into two groups of patients <xref rid="pone.0046191-Haahr1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This allowed us to derive the signature from one group of patients (active TB Training Set) and then validate our findings in another independent group of patients (active TB Test Set). 320 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046191.s006">Table S3</xref>) were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the pre-treatment active TB Training Set samples and their paired 6-month treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The treatment specific 320-transcript signature was shown to rapidly and significantly change at 2 weeks onwards after treatment initiation, in the active TB Training set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This was validated in the active TB Test Set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

This could suggest that the transcriptional response reaches a plateau at 2 months and therefore the 2 month gene expression profiles would not be significantly different from the latent TB expression profiles. To establish whether any significant changes occurred between 2 months and the latent TB patients, we compared each of the time points: 2, 6 and 12 months to the latent TB profiles.

We demonstrate that this active-TB transcriptional signature significantly diminishes in active TB patients after just 2 weeks of initiation of clinically successful anti-TB treatment. In addition we demonstrate that a treatment-specific transcriptional signature, consisting of 320 transcripts, derived from comparing a cohort of South African untreated active TB samples to their paired 6-month end of treatment samples, also significantly diminishes after just 2 weeks of anti-TB treatment. Furthermore the significant change in the treatment-specific signature was validated in two more clinically successfully treated cohorts, from the high TB-burden setting of South Africa and from the intermediate TB-burden setting of London, UK. Both the active-TB and treatment-specific transcriptional signatures were dominated by IFN signaling and innate immune response genes. The transcriptional response to anti-TB treatment could also be individually quantified for each patient. Together, these findings suggest that blood transcriptional signatures could be used as early surrogate biomarkers of a successful treatment response, in both the clinical setting and in drug development.</p><p>TB treatment monitoring is a major challenge for attempts to eradicate <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. In April 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health brought together experts in the field and research scientists with the sole purpose of addressing this problem <xref rid="pone.0046191-Nahid1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Poor treatment monitoring, and hence inadequate treatment, leads to worsening of a patient&#x02019;s disease, increasing the potential for disease spread and the risk of developing drug resistant mycobacteria. Currently the 2-month sputum culture conversion is the only biomarker of successful TB treatment <xref rid="pone.0046191-Mitchison1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However it is time consuming, taking several weeks to grow the bacilli and results can be compromised by contamination. Moreover patients who have clinically improved may be unable to expectorate sputum at 2 months and potentially incorrectly labelled as having a negative culture <xref rid="pone.0046191-Perrin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, although sputum conversion is commonly used as a surrogate end point for treatment response in clinical trials evaluating new drugs, a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its accuracy in predicting an individual&#x02019;s treatment failure revealed low sensitivity and only modest specificity <xref rid="pone.0046191-Horne1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046191-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. While other biomarkers have also been trialled, including C-reactive protein, IFN-&#x003b3;and neopterin, all have similarly shown poor sensitivity and specificity <xref rid="pone.0046191-Walzl2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Chest X-rays are commonly used in the clinical setting as a marker of treatment response but they generally improve slower than the clinical response and lack specificity as interpretation can be confounded by previous lung damage <xref rid="pone.0046191-Perrin1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Moreover interpretation of radiographic changes in response to treatment has not yet been standardised, and the facilities are not always available in developing countries <xref rid="pone.0046191-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore there is clearly a need for early and easily detectable biomarkers for treatment monitoring, capable of potentially identifying poor responses due to drug resistance or lack of treatment adherence, and available for patients unable to produce sputum.</p><p>In our earlier study we demonstrated in a small number of patients that blood transcriptional signatures in UK active TB patients diminished after 2 months of anti-TB treatment <xref rid="pone.0046191-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In our current study we have shown a significant blood transcriptional response to anti-TB treatment occurs rapidly, as early as 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g002">Figures 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g005">5</xref>, E2&#x02013;3). This early transcriptional response could be as a consequence of the observed rapid and high killing capacity of antimycobacterial antibiotics leading to a substantial reduction in mycobacterial load <xref rid="pone.0046191-Gumbo1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046191-Jindani1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046191-deSteenwinkel1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although the signatures we have derived may not be completely specific for active TB, since clinically similar diseases such as sarcoidosis show common transcripts <xref rid="pone.0046191-Koth1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, demonstration of a response to antimycobacterial therapy as we show here, could help resolve this overlap and so improve diagnostic specificity.</p><p>We have shown here that the whole blood active-TB transcriptional signature is dominated by IFN signaling and innate immune response genes. These findings are in agreement with our previous work <xref rid="pone.0046191-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and with other gene expression studies in TB <xref rid="pone.0046191-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046191-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This robust correlation occurring between different host populations, likely different <italic>Mtb</italic> strains, diverse environments and microarray analysis strategies indicates that blood transcriptomics have great potential to be developed into robust novel diagnostic tools. Furthermore we demonstrate here that the derived treatment specific 320-transcript signature also had many genes in common with the active TB 664-transcript signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). This overlap of genes is highly suggestive that this study will help guide future development of a subset of genes that most accurately correlates with a patient&#x02019;s response to anti-TB treatment, acting as a surrogate marker of treatment failure or success.</p><p>Due to the ethical design of this study we do not present active TB patients who did not respond to TB treatment. Our study has demonstrated a very important proof-of-principle that active TB patients who are successfully treated have a dramatic measurable change in their blood gene expression profiles as early as 2 weeks. The use of a commercially available whole genome microarray platform together with broadly available bioinformatics analyses programmes will easily allow rapid validation in subsequent TB treatment studies, including a comparison with patients with MDR-TB and HIV/TB co-infected cohorts. This study focussed on TB patients who are not co-infected with HIV, as they represent the majority of patients infected with <italic>Mtb</italic>. WHO 2010 reports that of the 1.4 million deaths, three-quarters were not known to be co-infected with HIV <xref rid="pone.0046191-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge no other studies have specifically derived transcriptional signatures of response to TB treatment. However two other studies have described relevant treatment related transcriptional differences. Mistry <italic>et al</italic> found that patients who had completed a course of anti-TB treatment displayed similar expression profiles to a latent TB group, but they did not examine any patients during their anti-TB treatment course, and used custom arrays <xref rid="pone.0046191-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, therefore more difficult for others to validate. Joosten <italic>et al</italic> showed in a small number of samples that their active TB gene set diminished after 2 months of anti-TB treatment, however they did not examine any patients at earlier timepoints <xref rid="pone.0046191-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Our early TB treatment blood transcriptional signature has great potential for development as blood biomarkers for clinical use and could be measured in the field using a polymerase chain reaction assay, similar to the WHO endorsed GeneXpert MTB/RIF test already in use for TB diagnostics in both developing and developed countries. However a blood host biomarker, based on our transcriptional signature, would have advantages over the GeneXpert test since it would not require sputum.</p><p>A further problem in the management of TB is the extended length of treatment, requiring a minimum duration of 6 months. However the treatment duration required for maximum efficacy and preventing resistance, has not been fully established. The ability therefore to stratify patients into groups requiring shorter or longer treatment durations, particularly in resource limited settings, could be of value in improving patient compliance and reducing treatment related side effects. We demonstrate here that some patient&#x02019;s transcriptional response appeared to plateau before 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0046191-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0046191.s002">Figure S2</xref>
<bold>)</bold> suggesting blood transcriptional signatures may help develop personalized treatment regimes.</p><p>In summary we have shown that transcriptional signatures, measured in easily accessible whole blood, showed a significant response to anti-TB treatment, as early as 2 weeks after initiation of treatment, far quicker than currently available tests. In addition, we have demonstrated this early response to anti-TB treatment occurs in both high- and intermediate-burden settings. The transcriptional response could be measured for each individual TB patient, thus providing a potential clinical tool for single patient treatment monitoring. Furthermore this could aid in patient stratification for treatment with differing regimen lengths. These findings provide a strong foundation for the development of an early biomarker of successful anti-TB treatment response. Development will require validation of these findings in larger cohorts, including a group of patients who fail to respond to anti-TB treatment. This potential biomarker of early treatment response could allow rapid detection of inadequate treatment regimens and poor treatment compliance, therefore ultimately reducing disease spread and drug resistant <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0046191.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
