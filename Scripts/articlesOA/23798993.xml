Also, we selected candidate genes associated or implicated with leprosy in genetic studies and biological experiments. Forty-seven genes were selected for validation in two independent types of samples by multiplex qPCR. First, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model using THP-1 cells was infected with live <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG). In a second situation, mRNA obtained from nerve biopsies from patients with leprosy or other peripheral neuropathies was tested. We detected DEGs that discriminate <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG from <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. Specific signatures of susceptible responses after <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection when compared to BCG lead to repression of genes, including <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>IL8</italic> and <italic>SOD2</italic>. The same 47-gene set was screened in nerve biopsies, which corroborated the down-regulation of <italic>CCL2</italic> and <italic>CCL3</italic> in leprosy, but also evidenced the down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, and the up-regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and ubiquitination. Finally, a gene expression signature from DEG was identified in patients confirmed of having leprosy. A classification tree was able to ascertain 80% of the cases as leprosy or non-leprous peripheral neuropathy based on the expression of only <italic>LDLR</italic> and <italic>CCL4</italic>. A general immune and mitochondrial hypo-responsive state occurs in response to <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. Also, the most important genes and pathways have been highlighted providing new tools for early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been funded by PAPES (Programa Estrat&#x000e9;gico de Apoio &#x000e0; Pesquisa em Sa&#x000fa;de, FIOCRUZ); FAPERJ (Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro), CAPES (Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior) and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico).

Samples were then labeled during second strand cDNA synthesis using Bioprime DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) in a 50 &#x000b5;L reaction containing 120 &#x000b5;M of dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 60 &#x000b5;M non-labeled dCTP and 40 &#x000b5;M Alexa 555 or Alexa 647 tagged dCTP, and incubated for 3 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. Labeled cDNA was purified by four subsequent centrifugations at 13,000&#x000d7; g with 400 &#x000b5;L of nuclease-free water in Microcon 30 columns. Degree of labeling (DoL) was measured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and expressed as the percent of fluorescent nucleotides in each 100 bases. A DoL between 1 and 3% was accepted and used as quality control of fluorescent labeling. Sample pairs were joined and hybridized to HEEBO slides under coverslips in 5&#x000d7; SSC and 0.1% SDS by overnight incubation at 60&#x000b0;C in slide chambers placed in a water bath under agitation. Following hybridization, coverslips were removed and slides submitted to four washing solutions: 2&#x000d7; SSC and 0.2% SDS for 10 minutes, 0.5&#x000d7; SSC and 0.02% SDS for 10 minutes and 2&#x000d7; 0.1&#x000d7; SSC for 5 minutes each. Arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and the hybridization signal values for the multiple probes for each mRNA were obtained with the use of GenePix Pro v.6.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

Other genes were included in this study after a careful review of the literature using key words such as, leprosy OR tuberculosis AND cytokines OR immune responses, SNPs, polymorphisms, genetics, although we did not use a systematic review. After revision of the literature, we selected genes associated with leprosy trying to focus on genes that 1) have been described in genetic assays, but the biological effect of the genetic association has never been assessed; 2) genes that have been tested in biological experiments (File S1). In order to test different genes we used a 96.96 chips from Fluidigm (Biomark platform) that allow us to test 96 genes in 96 different targets. Nevertheless, we used only 47 genes in duplicates for 96 samples. One slot was kept as negative control of the PCR reaction. Complementary DNA from each of the 96 samples was simultaneously pre-amplified with a mix of 47 primer pairs in a conventional thermocycler (File S1). To this end, we used Taqman preamp mastermix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA) with 200 nM of each primer (forward and reverse) and 1.25 &#x000b5;l of each cDNA in a final reaction volume of 5 &#x000b5;l for 14 cycles.

This patients have a rare leprosy condition called pure neural leprosy (PNL) and although Ridley and Jopling postulated that PNL might occur across the spectrum from LL to TT forms, in our hands the vast majority of the PNL cases are paucibacillary. Second, a clear hyporesponsive immunopathogenetic profile was observed following live <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection. Indeed, active induction of an immune hyporesponsive state is detected <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is also associated with down-modulation of <italic>ex vivo</italic> immune responses (anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic) and decreased mitochondrial metabolism. In this context, although some genes were only different in one of the situations tested (<italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>ex vivo</italic>), results from both models reinforce the participation of specific genes and/or pathways in the pathogenesis of leprosy. <italic>CCL2</italic> and <italic>CCL3</italic>, for example, were repressed in both situations. However, other genes, such as <italic>IL8</italic> (in the THP-1 model) and <italic>CCL4</italic> (in the nerves biopsies) were down-regulated respectively, thus providing complementary information which points to the inhibition of chemokines by <italic>M. leprae</italic>, a possible survival strategy for the pathogen. One of the highlights of this work is that we used live <italic>M. leprae</italic>, which has been consistently shown to induce different pathways when compared to dead <italic>M. leprae</italic> in order to establish a niche for replication <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. These data also corroborate results from the multifamily genetic scan carried out in 2004, which identified the 17q21 region, enriched in chemokine genes such as <italic>CCL2</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL4</italic>, among others, as linked with leprosy. A decrease in chemokine expression could prevent activation of the host chemotactic response and, therefore, <italic>M. leprae</italic> could escape destruction by the immune system, contributing to the establishment of intracellular infection and consequently the spread of disease. It is important to note that these genes were selected for this study based on the genetic association study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Jamieson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> that had not been validated using approaches such as those employed here.</p><p>Likewise, it is remarkable that complementarity was observed between <italic>SOD2</italic> mRNA repression in THP-1 and several genes associated with mitochondrial metabolism that were down-regulated in the nerves. This result also indicates that this second pathway is crucial for <italic>M. leprae</italic> survival, although most of the genes were only significantly reduced in nerve biopsies. Once again, it is interesting to note that <italic>SOD2</italic> was also suggested to participate in leprosy susceptibility through a genomic scan <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mira1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Previously, it has been reported that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces down regulation of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0064748-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Sinsimer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines could be involved in the control of infection by <italic>M. leprae</italic> suggesting that mycobacteria may be attempting to avoid the host reaction in order to facilitate its survival. Curiously, our data also showed a borderline decrease (p&#x0003c;0.1) in expression of IL-6 mRNA in <italic>M. leprae</italic>-stimulated THP-1 cells. To this regard, another gene in the TNF superfamily, <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, was tested since an increased expression of this gene was observed in leprosy patient lesions <xref rid="pone.0064748-Sun1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref> and genetic variants in this gene were associated to leprosy susceptibility through a genome-wide association study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

Indeed, lipid metabolism is crucial for <italic>M. leprae</italic> intracellular survival, and recently the accumulation of lipid derivatives in nerve lesions of LL patients was shown <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.

Indeed, the cholesterol content of the host's cell membrane seems to be essential for entry of mycobacteria. Therefore, the up-regulation of LDLR mRNA or protein in mycobacterial infections may increase levels of cellular cholesterol in order to facilitate entry into host cells. A classical hallmark of leprosy lesions is the presence of <italic>M. leprae</italic>-infected macrophages/Schwann cells showing a foamy phenotype as a result of their high lipid content <xref rid="pone.0064748-Virchow1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Job1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. In the present study we showed an increase in LDL receptor mRNA expression, the main receptor of native LDL, in nerve biopsies of leprosy patients as a potential mechanism of host lipid accumulation induced by <italic>M. leprae</italic>.

Moreover, we were able to show by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, both in the context of Schwann cells and macrophages, that <italic>M. leprae</italic> infection is able to increase host cell uptake of native LDL (unpublished data). Cholesterol metabolism has shown to play an important role in mycobacterial pathogenesis both by facilitating bacterial internalization <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mattos2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> as well as by acting as a carbon and energy source <xref rid="pone.0064748-Pandey1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, the up-regulation of LDLR mRNA in <italic>M. leprae</italic> infected nerves may increase levels of cellular cholesterol in order to facilitate entry and bacterial survival into host cells. In fact, it also raises an interesting possibility whereas detection of lipid metabolites could help diagnosis. A recent study performed on serum samples from patients before and after MDT conclusion (Amaral et al., unpublished data) confirmed previous observations by Al Mubarak and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0064748-AlMubarak1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> showing that polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism is deeply affected during leprosy.</p><p>Another gene that was down regulated in leprosy patient samples was <italic>Bad</italic>, which is a pro-apoptotic gene. <italic>Bad</italic> was also suppressed after infection of THP-1 by <italic>M. leprae</italic> in a previous study <xref rid="pone.0064748-Hasan1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref> where authors observed that irradiated <italic>M. leprae</italic> inhibits apoptosis by diminishing pro-apoptotic Bad and Bak mRNA expression, while inducing the anti-apoptotic gene Mcl-1. These results could be combined with the induction of E3-ubiquitin ligases that also elicit an anti-apoptotic response. Indeed, <italic>PARK2</italic>, which is another E3-ubiquitin ligase, was previously shown to be associated with leprosy <xref rid="pone.0064748-Mira1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Also, it is quite interesting that two different E3-ubiquitin ligases were associated with leprosy using different approaches (genomic scan and microarray) suggesting that indeed ubiquitination is a crucial process, which possibly regulates apoptosis and is involved in leprosy susceptibility. Once more, we observe a coherent pattern of gene expression where <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces an anti-apoptotic response in the host cell, which would be an appropriate strategy for this intracellular pathogen that only multiplies every 14 days. It has been shown that Parkin is involved in the ubiquitination of Bcl-2, which prevents cytochrome c release from the mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0064748-Berger1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref> preventing apoptosis. In fact, the regulation of mitochondrial functions, as observed in the results of this work, may also channel the cell in the same direction. We showed a decrease in mitochondrial gene expression in Schwann cells after infection with <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The very same genes were also down-regulated in nerve biopsies from leprosy patients suggesting a suppression of mitochondrial energy metabolism. Furthermore, SOD2, a mitochondrial gene involved in defense against superoxide (O2-) and other toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also down-regulated in THP-1 cells infected with <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The mitochondrial alterations observed are consistent with inhibition of apoptosis, which are often triggered in the mitochondria. These organelles play a central role as a stress sensor within the cell and the repression of mitochondrial genes could be a confirmation of the hypothesis of an anti-apoptotic effect caused by <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The mitochondrial alterations have already been associated with other disease models such as Chagas' disease, in which down-regulation of several transcripts encoding components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway was observed in a murine model infected by <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0064748-Garg1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>, suggesting a decrease in global energy production and subsequent cardiac performance.</p><p>In this context, when we selected differentially expressed genes to cluster between leprosy and non-leprous patients, a distinctive pattern was found to distinguish between both groups. Significantly regulated genes clustered in three unique sets of genes, one of which was almost entirely composed of mitochondrial genes involved in the electron transport chain and found to be down-regulated in leprosy patients. Nonetheless, a classification tree was developed, based on the mRNA expression of only two genes, <italic>LDLR</italic> and <italic>CCL4</italic>, each of which belonged to a cluster with an opposite pattern of regulation in leprosy patients, either up or down, respectively. CCL4 was also observed recently as a potential biomarker to distinguish leprosy patients and controls of areas endemic, as Brazil <xref rid="pone.0064748-Geluk1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. The discriminative power of these two genes was able to ascertain almost 80% of the cases as leprosy or non-leprous and this is extremely important in patients with difficult diagnosis, as the case of pure neural leprosy, which the pathology is restricted to the nerve and the patient did not presents skin lesions <xref rid="pone.0064748-Jardim1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, this study is the first to show an induction of genes induced by type-I IFN by <italic>M. leprae</italic> in cells of the peripheral nervous system: IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM4. The type-I IFN-inducible genes had recently been observed to be more induced in skin lesions of leprosy patients with disseminated lepromatous form compared to patients with tuberculoid form <xref rid="pone.0064748-Teles1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. This result is consistent with other recent reports of global gene expression which identified this class of genes as induced in blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to patients with latent tuberculosis <xref rid="pone.0064748-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0064748-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> and identified a highly prominent type-I interferon molecular signature in three models of TB (newly-diagnosed TB patients followed-up through treatment, a BCG infected human macrophage cell line and an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse lung TB infection model) <xref rid="pone.0064748-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. An interferon-related signature in THP-1 cells infected by different <italic>M.tb</italic> strains was also identified <xref rid="pone.0064748-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. In addition, another study in our laboratory found other members of this family, to be up-regulated in primary SCs infected by live <italic>M. leprae</italic> (unpublished data), consistent with the microarray analysis present here. The role of type I IFN in mycobacterial diseases still needs to be further evaluated.</p><p>In summary, our findings suggest that decrease of various genes related to immune response and mitochondrial metabolisms against infection by <italic>M. leprae</italic> indicating that <italic>M. leprae</italic> appears to have a suppressive effect in human cells may be associated with negative regulation of the immune response and therefore for success of the infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0064748.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
