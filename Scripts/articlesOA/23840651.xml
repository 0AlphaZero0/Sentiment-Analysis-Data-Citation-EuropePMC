The Beijing (Bj) lineage of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is suggested to be more virulent than other Mtb lineages and prone to elicit non-protective immune responses. However, highly heterogeneous immune responses were reported upon infection of innate immune cells with Bj strains or stimulation with their glycolipids. Using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models of infection, we here report that the molecular mechanism for this heterogeneity may be related to distinct TLR activations. Among this Mtb lineage, we found strains that preferentially activate TLR2, and others that also activate TLR4. Recognition of Mtb strains by TLR4 resulted in a distinct cytokine profile <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, with specific production of type I IFN. We also uncover a novel protective role for TLR4 activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, our findings contribute to the knowledge of the molecular basis underlying how host innate immune cells handle different Mtb strains, in particular the intricate host-pathogen interaction with strains of the Mtb Bj lineage.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work has been funded by Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o para a Ci&#x000ea;ncia e Tecnologia, Portugal.

<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB) and is responsible for about 2 million deaths annually <xref rid="pone.0067277-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. One of the most intriguing aspects of Mtb infection is the spectrum of disease outcomes, ranging from several degrees of pathogenesis, latency or clearance <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kirschner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Various host factors, including malnutrition and co-infection with HIV, influence on the outcome of TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kirschner1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Recently, the contribution of Mtb genetic variation to the heterogeneity of TB outcomes is gaining importance <xref rid="pone.0067277-Coscolla1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although TB was thought to be caused by essentially identical bacteria, recent evidence showed that it consists of 6 major lineages, each associated with geographical human populations <xref rid="pone.0067277-Gagneux1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and with highly variable types of inflammatory responses <xref rid="pone.0067277-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Portevin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Much interest has been recently devoted to the study of the heterogeneity of responses associated with the East Asian (Bejing/W) (Bj) lineage of Mtb <xref rid="pone.0067277-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Several studies associate Mtb Bj strains with more severe forms of TB, TB outbreaks, drug resistance and less efficacious BCG vaccination <xref rid="pone.0067277-Parwati1" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0067277-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0067277-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Experimental infections with Mtb Bj strains show the induction of non-uniform immune responses <xref rid="pone.0067277-Aguilar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dormans1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but the molecular bases underlying this variability remain largely unclear.</p><p>The initiation of the immune response to Mtb relies on bacterial sensing by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), as TLRs, expressed by multiple cell types including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recognition of Mtb by TLRs triggers various intracellular signaling cascades, ultimately inducing the production of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial molecules <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Evidence demonstrating a role for TLR activation in the control of Mtb comes from studies showing a lethal infection in mice lacking the master TLR signaling adaptor MyD88 <xref rid="pone.0067277-Fremond1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Scanga1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Shi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, the contribution of individual TLRs awaits further clarification. TLR2 is central for <italic>in vitro</italic> activation of the innate immune response <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bhatt1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and was shown to impact the maintenance of Th17 cells in the lung of Mtb-infected animals <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and granuloma formation <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, but not bacterial burden <xref rid="pone.0067277-TeixeiraCoelho1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Sugawara1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The role of other TLRs, such as TLR4 and TLR9, has been less addressed <xref rid="pone.0067277-Bafica1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kamath1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Reiling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In humans, the association of TLR polymorphisms with susceptibility to TB remains to be confirmed/needs further studies <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kleinnijenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Different polymorphisms in the human <italic>TLR2</italic> gene were reported to associate with increased susceptibility to TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ogus1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Thuong1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Velez1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Yim1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, whereas such association was not observed in other studies <xref rid="pone.0067277-Biswas1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Selvaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, a MAL/TIRAP functional variant, affecting signaling through TLR2, was shown to be protective in TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Khor1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Regarding TLR4, while genetic polymorphisms in an Asian Indian population were linked to an increased susceptibility and severity of pulmonary TB <xref rid="pone.0067277-Najmi1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, in Gambian, Indian or Chinese TB patients no association was found <xref rid="pone.0067277-Selvaraj1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Xue1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Newport1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This discrepancy might be explained on the basis of a dynamic host-pathogen genetic and pathogen phenotypic interplay, as postulated from studies involving <italic>TLR2</italic> polymorphisms <xref rid="pone.0067277-Caws1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Herein we show that some Mtb strains preferentially activate TLR2, whereas others activate TLR4. This differential recognition of Mtb strains impacts on both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> immune responses, specifically inducing the production of different arrays of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our findings present evidence that differential TLR recognition evoked by different Mtb strains may be decisive for shaping of innate immune responses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and possibly contributing for the outcome of Mtb infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations of the European Union Directive 86/609/EEC.

<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Beijing Strains are Differentially Recognized by TLR2 or TLR4</title><p>The Bj lineage of Mtb is known to induce heterogeneous immune responses <xref rid="pone.0067277-Krishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Portevin1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Aguilar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dormans1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the search for the host molecular basis underlying this heterogeneity, we started by comparing the induction of cytokine production by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) upon stimulation with a collection of phylogenetically diverse Mtb isolates of the Bj lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Our analysis of cytokine production by infected cells was performed at 6 h post-infection, in order to focus on the events triggered by the innate immune recognition of Mtb strains, thus minimizing autocrine effects likely to occur at later times. Among this collection of Mtb isolates, we found strains, including HN878, that were lower inducers of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production than H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which is in line with previous reports <xref rid="pone.0067277-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. However, we also found strains that induced higher cytokine production in macrophages than H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall the highest cytokine amounts were detected in macrophages infected with Mtb strain 02-171.

The increased bacterial burden observed in the first three weeks of infection for the Mtb strain 02-171 was accompanied by enhanced lung pathology, measured by the extent of lung infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). However, and as observed for the progression of bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), the lung pathology was similar to both strains at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In line with our <italic>in vitro</italic> data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), the expression of cytokines at the site of infection was higher in the case of Mtb strain 02-171 as compared to H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0067277-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

Altogether our data suggest that Mtb strain 02-171 may be more virulent for mice during the innate immune phase of the infection, although the adaptive immune response is efficient in inducing bacteriostasis. To further investigate whether Mtb strain 02-171 is indeed more virulent for mice than H37Rv during innate immunity, we infected Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with either strain and followed the progression of infection.

Finally, the heterogeneity of the immune response and the differential TLR recognition reported were also not related to the profile of drug susceptibility of each strain <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ghebremichael1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><p>TLR4 activation results in intracellular signals mediated by both MyD88 and TRIF, whereas TLR2 signals depend on MyD88 alone <xref rid="pone.0067277-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. As a result of TRIF-pathway activation, a signaling complex involving IKK and TBK-1 is formed, which catalyze the phosphorylation of IRF3 and induce its nuclear translocation, leading to the transcription of <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067277-Kawai1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Consistent with this, secretion of IFN-&#x003b2; by Mtb-infected macrophages was only observed for TLR4-activating strains (02-171 and Harlingen). Taking into consideration a recent report showing that Mtb activates the DNA-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway in macrophages, inducing signalling through Sting/TBK-1/IRF3 with consequent <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> transcription <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, our data now suggest that certain strains of Mtb are also able to enhance this <italic>ifn&#x003b2;</italic> transcription via TLR4 activation. This finding may be relevant as type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes constitute a molecular signature associated with active pulmonary Mtb infection in humans <xref rid="pone.0067277-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Although the role of type I IFN during Mtb infection remains unclear <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Ordway1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, mice lacking type I IFN receptor present decreased bacterial burden and late mortality upon Mtb infection <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Desvignes1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Moreover, the virulence of certain Mtb strains was suggested to be correlated with their ability to induce type I IFN production <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Our findings showing that Mtb strain 02-171 (a TLR4-activating and type I IFN inducer) was more virulent during the innate phase of the immune response than H37Rv in mice are in line with these observations. Nevertheless, in the absence of TLR4 we found a further increase on the lung bacterial burden of mice infected with Mtb strain 02-171, despite the lower induction of IFN-&#x003b2; expression. Also, Mtb strain Harlingen, another TLR4 activating strain, showed a degree of virulence comparable to H37Rv (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0067277.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>), pointing to the fact that the mechanisms underlying differences in virulence during the innate phase of the immune response are most likely multifactorial. On one hand, differences in virulence may result from the balance of cytokine responses induced by different strains. Indeed, Mtb strain 02-171 induced higher levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the lung of infected animals, a balance that may favor susceptibility during the innate phase of the immune response. This balance was altered in the absence of TLR4, where we observed a decrease in the overall cytokine expression and in the expression and production of iNOS, accompanying an increase in bacterial burden. On the other hand, it is also possible that Mtb strain 02-171 shows a higher resistance to host innate killing mechanisms, thus escaping them and growing faster during the early phases of infection.</p><p>Our data suggest a possible dual role for TLR4 during infection with certain strains of Mtb, since its activation not only induced type I IFN, that may result in increased susceptibility <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manzanillo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Manca2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Desvignes1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, but simultaneously induced the expression of protective cytokines (e.g. TNF) and of iNOS, a molecule known to be important for the control infection <xref rid="pone.0067277-North1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. The participation of TLR4 appeared to predominate in the innate phases of the immune response. In contrast, the adaptive immunity was equally effective either in the presence or absence of TLR4, causing a significant reduction in CFU numbers observed after day 18 of infection. This finding is interesting, as previous reports on the role of TLR2 or TLR9 in Mtb infections evidenced a more pronounced effect in later stages of infection, in terms of granuloma formation <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Reiling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Branger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, Th17 cell maintenance <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Reiling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Branger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> or Th1 cell differentiation <xref rid="pone.0067277-Drennan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Abel1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Reiling1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0067277-Branger1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Of note, in the absence of TLR4 we still observed cytokine expression in the lungs of mice infected with Mtb strain 02-171, suggesting that other PRRs, and/or that innate cells other than macrophages, harboring a different set of PRRs, must operate <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Despite the faster growth observed for Mtb strain 02-171 during the initial phase of the <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, at around day 30 we observed a sharp decrease on the lung bacterial load. This is an atypical observation for Mtb infections and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are currently under investigation. It is possible that this strain of Mtb induces a T cell response with specific characteristics and dynamics that transiently lead to a better control of bacterial burden in the lung, thus allowing killing of the mycobacteria. In line with this hypothesis, our findings show that in a system where the acquired immune response fails, such as the Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, Mtb strain 02-171 is more virulent and lethal than the reference strain H37Rv.</p><p>Our study brings forth a compelling amount of evidence showing that Mtb strains are recognized differently via TLR2 or TLR4 with possible implications on the <italic>in vivo</italic> innate immune responses to Mtb. It would be of the utmost interest to now pursue our findings in an effort to uncover the molecule(s) present in Mtb strain 02-171 that is/are able to activate TLR4. It will be also of interest to increase the number of strains tested in order to investigate how they cluster according to their ability to preferentially activate TLR2 vs TLR4. Our results may, at least in part, explain the discrepant data obtained by different groups addressing the association of TLR polymorphisms to TB susceptibility, highlighting the relevance of also investigating the relation between the infecting strain and the studied TLR polymorphism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0067277.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
