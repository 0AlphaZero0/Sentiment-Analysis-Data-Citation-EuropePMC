Co-infection with HIV/AIDS and the emergence of drug resistant strains have made improved TB control an urgent necessity. Most immunocompetent people mount an effective immune response against the aetiological agent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, such that infection is controlled in a latent asymptomatic form in 90% of individuals <xref rid="pone.0070063-Dorhoi1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>TB treatment is long, leading to lack of adherence, acquired drug resistance and a 5% risk of relapse <xref rid="pone.0070063-Frieden1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-vanRie1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. There is no way of knowing if lung sterilization is achieved at an earlier time point; therefore biomarkers capable of predicting treatment efficacy/outcome are needed to aid clinical management <xref rid="pone.0070063-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Walzl2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Biomarkers that can accelerate the drug developmental pipeline are also urgently needed, as current clinical trials use TB-relapse in a two year follow-up period to measure drug efficacy <xref rid="pone.0070063-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, although new recommendations suggest a shorter period would be sufficient <xref rid="pone.0070063-Nunn1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a pivotal role in TB immunity, particularly at later stages of infection and when bacillary burden is high <xref rid="pone.0070063-Woodworth1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070063-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. There is a functional overlap between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells: both produce cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3; to activate <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infected dendritic cells and macrophages, however CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit strong cyolytic activity enabling them to kill infected phagocytic cells: this activity has been observed in both mouse <xref rid="pone.0070063-Kamath1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070063-Kamath2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and human <xref rid="pone.0070063-Canaday1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0070063-Sud1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> tuberculosis.</p><p>The NKG2D receptor is a member of the type II C-type lectin-like family of transmembrane proteins, and plays an essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity <xref rid="pone.0070063-Obeidy1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. NKG2D is expressed as a homodimer on NK cells, &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cells, some CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. NKG2D lacks signaling domains on its short intracellular tail and uses an adaptor molecule, DNAX-Activation Protein 10 (DAP10), to relay signals inside cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. NKG2D binds a wide range of ligands that differ considerably in sequence, domain structure and affinity for the receptor <xref rid="pone.0070063-Champsaur1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0070063-Raulet1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In humans, these ligands can be broadly divided into two families: major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) and UL-16 binding proteins (ULBPS). The former family comprises highly polymorphic MICA and MICB, the expression of which are significantly upregulated on stressed, malignant and infected cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Upshaw1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, including infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0070063-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>In NK cells, NKG2D is a &#x0201c;master-switch&#x0201d; of activation that cannot be overcome by inhibitory signals. However, in T cells, NKG2D acts as a co-stimulatory receptor until a high activation status is reached, influenced by cytokine action, that enables it to act as an activation receptor and bypassing the conventional TCR-CD28 stimulation pathway <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Silencing of NKG2D and its adaptor molecules DAP10 and 12 by RNA interference leads to reduced cytotoxic activity of human NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Karimi1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. CD28 and NKG2D have overlapping but not identical functions. In mice, CD28 enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function and survival whereas NKG2D only does the former <xref rid="pone.0070063-Markiewicz1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In a tissue specific context, NKG2D expression is more important on antigen-specific lung resident effector T cells compared to memory ones <xref rid="pone.0070063-Rajasekaran1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The majority of studies have shown that NKG2D can act as a co-stimulatory molecule in its own right <xref rid="pone.0070063-Groh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Diefenbach1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, however Ehrlich <italic>et al</italic> found the opposite result i.e. NKG2D requires other co-factors such as CD28 to trigger CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytotoxicity in both murine and human cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Ehrlich1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>NKG2D expression regulation is multi-layered; availability of DAP10, differential regulation by cytokines and chronic exposure to soluble or membrane bound NKG2D ligands control this pathway. This regulation may be awry in TB, due to its chronicity and the aetiological agent, <italic>M.tuberculosis,</italic> which has devised numerous immune evasion strategies. Some studies have shown that NKG2D may play a role in TB. Blocking NKG2D leads to inhibition of <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>

We hypothesised that as NKG2D is involved in killing <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected cells, it would be more highly expressed in TB patients at diagnosis compared with household contacts, with a subsequent reduction in expression during successful TB treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the LSHTM (study number 5459) and Gulab Devi Hospital Ethics committees.

Intracellular staining was performed with a pre-titrated amount of anti-Granzyme B (Alexa-Fluor 647, clone GB-11: BD). Paraformaldehyde/PBS (10%) (Sigma) was added to the samples prior to running on a FACS Calibur 4CA E5180 (BD) under Category 3 conditions. Data were analysed using FlowJo (v7.6).

Prior to patient recruitment, a sample size calculation based on pilot data indicated that a cohort of 23 patients and 23 contacts would have 90% power to detect a difference between TB patients and contacts of 2.9-fold (assuming standard deviation 3 in each group) with a type I error of 5%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Expression of NKG2D, but not DAP10, mRNA is up-regulated by CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells Following Mycobacterial Stimulation</title><p>In a DNA-array study <xref rid="pone.0070063-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> we found that NKG2D mRNA expression was enhanced on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Contrary to our expectation, the <italic>ex vivo</italic> NKG2D mRNA expression and lymphocyte protein expression in blood was not significantly different in active TB disease compared to latently-infected or non-infected household contacts at diagnosis. There was, however, a dramatic reduction in NKG2D expression within the 2 month intensive treatment phase, and this was followed by a return to high levels by the end of treatment in successfully cured patients.

The modulation of NKG2D expression in TB patients with successful treatment occurred in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and to a lesser extent on NK cells, as determined by flow cytometry. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are crucially involved in protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>: patients with active TB disease have fewer circulating terminally-differentiated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than latently-infected healthy subjects, with a reduction in the proportion of polyfunctional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and lower perforin and IFN&#x003b3; production <xref rid="pone.0070063-Caccamo1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>The biphasic nature of the changes in NKG2D expression with treatment might reflect a combination of altered sequestering of lymphocytes in the lungs, varying with changes in bacterial burden and antigen level, together with altered differentiation stages of circulating lymphocytes and altered general ability to respond to antigenic stimulation. Overnight stimulation of diluted blood <italic>in vitro</italic>, either with live mycobacteria (<italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG) or anti-CD3 mAb, enhanced NKG2D expression in untreated TB patients, compared to that in uninfected controls or after two months of treatment. This could imply that there were more differentiated effector cells in the blood capable of responding rapidly to antigenic stimulation. Alternatively, the reduced NKG2D expression at month 2 of treatment might reflect a loss of a cytotoxic lymphocyte population, possibly due to cellular exhaustion, which is later replenished, coinciding with cure and immune restoration. Although it is possible that the antibiotics themselves had a direct effect on NKG2D expression, we consider this unlikely as in previous transcriptomic studies, we and other investigators have seen no evidence of a direct effect on immune cell gene expression profiles <xref rid="pone.0070063-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Cliff2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, if the change in gene expression was due to a non-specific toxic effect, one would also expect it occur in the two patients who died, but this was not the case.

IL-15-deficient mice are highly susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and this defect is mediated in part by reduced NKG2D expression <xref rid="pone.0070063-Rausch1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. NKG2D expression is also modulated by IL-2, which increases both NKG2D and DAP-10 expression on murine cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Burgess1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;, which is elevated in active human TB disease but declines with chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0070063-Hirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Olobo1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, down-regulates NKG2D expression on human CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells <xref rid="pone.0070063-Eisele1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0070063-Friese1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>.

Further studies in larger and diverse ethnic populations should be performed to validate these findings if NKG2D is to be useful as a biomarker for TB drug discovery. Changes in NKG2D in response to TB-treatment in HIV-positive people should also be determined.
