Recent transcriptomic studies support a role for relative proportions of myeloid and lymphoid transcripts in tuberculosis outcomes. The ML ratio in peripheral blood is known to be governed by hematopoietic stem cells with distinct biases.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold>&#x02003;The predictive value of the baseline ML ratio was modeled in 2 prospective cohorts of HIV-infected adults starting cART in South Africa (primary cohort, 1862 participants; replication cohort, 345 participants). Incident tuberculosis was diagnosed with clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic methods per contemporary guidelines. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards modeling were conducted.</p><p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold>&#x02003;The incidence rate of tuberculosis differed significantly by baseline ML ratio: 32.61 (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.38&#x02013;61.54), 16.36 (95% CI, 12.39&#x02013;21.23), and 51.80 (95% CI, 23.10&#x02013;101.71) per 1000 patient-years for ML ratios of less than the 5th percentile, between the 5th and 95th percentiles, and greater than the 95th percentile, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .007). Neither monocyte counts nor lymphocyte counts alone were associated with tuberculosis. After adjustment for sex, World Health Organization human immunodeficiency virus disease stage, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts, and previous history of tuberculosis, hazards of disease were significantly higher for patients with ML ratios of less than the 5th percentile or greater than the 95th percentile (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.39&#x02013;4.40; <italic>P</italic> = .002).</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions.</italic></bold>&#x02003;The ML ratio may be a useful, readily available tool to stratify the risk of tuberculosis and suggests involvement of hematopoietic stem cell bias in tuberculosis pathogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>combination antiretroviral therapy</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>ML ratio</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="24"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in patients commencing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="JIT494C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIT494C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], yet practical methods to stratify risk in this population are lacking [<xref rid="JIT494C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. If individuals at risk for tuberculosis could be accurately identified, they could be targeted for preventive strategies such as chemoprophylaxis. Risk factors for tuberculosis include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and the presence of latent <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref rid="JIT494C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, identifying individuals who have latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection or a high risk for developing tuberculosis is a major challenge; tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) and the recently developed interferon &#x003b3;&#x02013;release assays are poor at predicting which individuals with latent infection will subsequently go on to develop tuberculosis, particularly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#x02013;positive populations [<xref rid="JIT494C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The need to identify groups at risk of tuberculosis is highlighted by the fact that isoniazid preventive therapy is most effective among TST-positive patients [<xref rid="JIT494C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="JIT494C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as opposed TST-negative individuals [<xref rid="JIT494C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Gene expression studies have identified biomarkers of active tuberculosis that provide insight into immune mechanisms of disease and may be useful for improving the diagnosis of tuberculosis [<xref rid="JIT494C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIT494C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fletcher et al recently used whole-transcriptome microarrays to identify correlates of risk of tuberculosis up to 2 years before disease developed in infants who had been vaccinated with BCG at birth (Fletcher et al, unpublished data). Relative abundance of myeloid-specific gene transcripts and lymphoid-specific transcripts at 10 weeks of age were associated with subsequent tuberculosis after stratifying for BCG responses. The observation that the relative proportion of monocytes and lymphocytes may be related to tuberculosis susceptibility is reminiscent of older studies. Between 1921 and 1931, Florence Sabin and colleagues found that numbers of monocytes were increased following experimental infection of rabbits with <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> [<xref rid="JIT494C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They and others reported that the ratio of lymphocytes to monocytes in peripheral blood correlated with extent of disease in both rabbits [<xref rid="JIT494C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="JIT494C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], although the numbers studied were small and the strength of the conclusions that could be reached in humans conceded to be modest. Finally, by experimentally reducing monocyte numbers in rabbits with a monocyte antiserum or conversely increasing the number of monocytes with A-3 phosphatide and then challenging animals with <italic>M. bovis</italic>, they demonstrated that reduced or elevated ratios of monocytes to lymphocytes (hereafter, the &#x0201c;ML ratio&#x0201d;) were associated with enhanced lethality of mycobacterial infection [<xref rid="JIT494C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lymphoid cells are thought to be the major effector cells in tuberculosis immunity and myeloid cells the major host cell for infection. Therefore, the relative abundance may reflect a balance between effector and target cells. Among infants with altered ratios of myeloid transcripts to lymphoid transcripts in the study by Fletcher et al, however, hematopoietic stem cell&#x02013; and inflammation-associated transcripts were also altered. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the relative abundance of these cell types could be a marker of hematopoietic parameters associated with tuberculosis. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that a high or a low ML ratio may be a correlate of risk for tuberculosis. We evaluated this hypothesis in a cohort of HIV-infected South African adults commencing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Setting</title><p>Data in this study were derived from several cohort studies or clinical trials [<xref rid="JIT494C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIT494C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] conducted at the at the Centre for the AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) AIDS Treatment (CAT) clinic in Vulindlela, rural KwaZulu Natal, or the CAPRISA eThekwini clinic in Durban, KwaZulu Natal.

Briefly, patients who were clinically evaluated to have WHO stage IV disease or had a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell count &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x000b5;L were eligible for commencement of a cART regimen comprising 2 nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and 1 nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor. During this period, the South African guidelines did not support the routine use of isoniazid preventive therapy for patients receiving cART. For this analysis, 1862 individuals who initiated cART and had at least 1 full blood count measurement available before cART were included. At enrollment, all individuals underwent clinical examination, including clinical screening for tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections. Individuals with active tuberculosis at enrollment were excluded. Participants were clinically evaluated at least twice before enrollment, and monthly after cART commencement. During follow-up after cART initiation, individuals with symptoms and/or signs of tuberculosis were assessed and received a diagnosis per South African guidelines, which include clinical examination, sputum microscopy, and/or culture and chest radiography as indicated [<xref rid="JIT494C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The replication cohort was a cohort of cART-naive adults who self-referred for care at the Prince Cyril Zulu Communicable Diseases Centre, a chest clinic that provides care for the eThekwini (Durban) municipality.</p><p>HIV-uninfected women enrolled in the CAPRISA004 trial were included for analyses of the stability of the ML ratio [<xref rid="JIT494C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

For the primary analysis of tuberculosis incidence, a survival analysis was performed. Study duration was calculated as the time from cART initiation to the first diagnosed episode of tuberculosis or death, withdrawal from the study, transfer to another facility, or last visit date (for patients remaining in follow-up), whichever occurred first. The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves stratified by ML ratio. To test the association between the ML ratio and tuberculosis incidence, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed. Covariates included in the model are given in the body text or tables. For the analysis of continuous variables, the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; .05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson approximations were used to calculate confidence intervals (CIs) for estimations of the incidence rate. Bootstrapped estimates of the adjusted HR across the ML ratio continuum were generated with the boot package. Statistical analyses were performed in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), using the following packages: epiR, survival, date, and mfp.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We assessed whether the ML ratio, when evaluated before commencement of cART, was predictive of the development of tuberculosis during cART in a prospective cohort of 1862 HIV-infected adults in South Africa.

Here, we demonstrate that extremes in the ratio of peripheral blood monocytes to lymphocytes, but neither monocyte or lymphocyte counts alone, were associated with an increased risk of incident tuberculosis over several years. Our observation that the ML ratio is associated with tuberculosis risk supports findings of recent microarray studies in HIV-negative infants (Fletcher et al, unpublished data) and extends findings made &#x0003e;80 years ago in rabbit models of mycobacterial infection [<xref rid="JIT494C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In more recent studies in cattle, the ratio of monocyte-derived macrophages to lymphocytes has been shown to correlate with inhibition of mycobacterial growth in vitro [<xref rid="JIT494C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="JIT494C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The observation that risk is higher among individuals with either low or high ML ratios adds evidence to support recent findings that extremes of immunity are associated with tuberculosis [<xref rid="JIT494C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="JIT494C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as differences in the ratio of myeloid transcripts to lymphoid transcripts in infants were associated with differences in inflammatory gene expression (Fletcher et al, unpublished data). Collectively, the historical small-animal studies, recent microarray data, and these human studies demonstrate that the ML ratio may be an easily measured predictive biomarker of tuberculosis. This ratio could herald a previously unknown pathophysiologic driver of tuberculosis.</p><p>Whether the ML ratio is causatively involved in tuberculosis or simply reflects underlying traits that affect tuberculosis risk will require further study. It is likely that the ML ratio captures underlying differences in the immune microenvironment, as has been implied by its prognostic value in influenza [<xref rid="JIT494C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and malaria. Recent studies in mice [<xref rid="JIT494C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="JIT494C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have shown that subsets of hematopoietic stem cells have distinct biases in the ratio of myeloid and lymphoid cells they give rise to [<xref rid="JIT494C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="JIT494C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We speculate that differences in the proportions of myeloid-biased, balanced, or lymphoid-biased hematopoietic stem cells may underlie the peripheral differences in the ML ratio and that the ontogeny of monocytes and lymphocytes, reflected in their ratio, may affect their ability to respond to mycobacterial infection. Recent studies have demonstrated that mycobacterial infection may alter hematopoiesis [<xref rid="JIT494C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or directly infect bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells [<xref rid="JIT494C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that latent or prior <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection may alter hematopoietic stem cells such that the peripheral ML ratio is altered. In support of this is the observation that in the microarray studies, alongside the ratio of myeloid transcripts to lymphoid transcripts being a signature of risk, transcripts suggesting activation/quiescence of hematopoietic stem cells were more prevalent among infants who developed tuberculosis. Alternatively, the ML ratio and underlying hematopoietic stem cell activity may be epiphenomena, and the ML ratio may be a marker of where along the spectrum [<xref rid="JIT494C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] of tuberculosis between latent and active disease an individual is, consistent with hypothesis first proposed in 1935 by Kato [<xref rid="JIT494C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Further work to explore the pathophysiological involvement of the ML ratio in tuberculosis may yield new pathways to modify or prevent disease.</p><p>The clinical usefulness of the observation that the ML ratio is related to prospective risk of tuberculosis is promising but will benefit from extension and validation in non&#x02013;tuberculosis-endemic regions, among children, and in HIV-negative adults. In particular, the diagnostic performance of the ratio and the development of standards or diagnostic thresholds require attention. Evaluation of whether the ML ratio is associated with other disorders, as is suggested by recent studies in influenza [<xref rid="JIT494C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and malaria [<xref rid="JIT494C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], is also necessary. Moreover, the question of whether ML ratios during cART continue to offer predictive value will need specific evaluation. Since neither the ML ratio, TST, nor interferon &#x003b3;&#x02013;release assays reliably detect all individuals at risk for tuberculosis, their combined use may need to be explored for its potential in risk stratification.</p><p>Although we observed that higher ML ratios were associated with tuberculosis, it is possible that tuberculosis was present but not diagnosed at the time of enrollment (reverse causation). But the observation that the association appears to hold out for several years, and is present even excluding early tuberculosis diagnoses, suggests that undiagnosed tuberculosis at enrolment does not account for the association.</p><p>An important potential limitation of this study is that this was a secondary data analysis study, so it is plausible that there may have been misclassification of the tuberculosis diagnosis if tuberculosis was not specifically and prospectively assessed. But the data used here were obtained during the conduct of prospective studies in which assessment for any clinical disorder, particularly tuberculosis, was performed. The diagnostic algorithm for tuberculosis used in these studies followed the national South African guidelines, and so the diagnostic procedures in this study approximate those in clinical settings, which are known to suffer impaired sensitivity for incident tuberculosis. A further limitation of this study is that participants did not have TSTs or interferon &#x003b3;&#x02013;release assays performed. Finally, at the time of clinical assessment, although clinicians were not blinded to the full blood count, they were not aware of this hypothesis, thus diminishing diagnostic bias.</p><p>Among patients starting cART, the ability to predict the risk of tuberculosis may facilitate targeted interventions such as vaccination, treatment for latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection to prevent tuberculosis ,or closer clinical monitoring to diagnose tuberculosis earlier. The ML ratio may be a useful, readily available tool to stratify risk of tuberculosis and provide a new insight into tuberculosis pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jit494/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).
