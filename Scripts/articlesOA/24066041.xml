The analysis of gene expression changes based on a limited number of genes or single study designs, however, may not be sufficient for the identification of universal diagnostic biomarker profiles. Here we propose that biological pathway and process based analyses from multiple data sets may be more relevant for identification of key pathways in TB pathogenesis, and may reveal novel candidate diagnostic TB biomarkers. A number of independent genome-wide gene expression studies have recently been performed to study expression of biomarkers for TB disease. We have integrated the results from these independent studies and performed pathway- as well as biological process-based analysis on the total data set. Interestingly, IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signalling is not the single dominant pathway in the analysis of the total dataset, but combined, functional, analysis of biomarkers suggests a strong dominant role for myeloid cell involvement in inflammation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge European Commission Framework Programme 6 TBVAC contract no.

Biomarkers could be of great significance in the battle against tuberculosis (TB), especially in the development of better diagnostics and new vaccines <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A number of new TB vaccine candidates have been developed over the past decade and many of them are currently in early stage clinical development. The next major step will be to test the protective efficacy of these new candidates, which will present a major challenge because of the nature of TB infection and its progression to disease: in most individuals, infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) results in latent infection that can persist for decades, with active disease development in about 3&#x02013;10% of infected individuals, mostly within the first 2 years post infection <xref rid="pone.0073230-World1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-OGarra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The low incidence rates of TB disease require large and lengthy clinical vaccine efficacy trials in TB endemic areas to achieve the statistical power needed to demonstrate vaccine induced protection against disease development.</p><p>As an alternative to using clinical endpoints, scientists are urgently searching for biomarkers that predict whether individuals are (long-term) protected or at (increased) risk for disease development. Such biomarkers would allow assessment of vaccine efficacy at earlier stages and with smaller groups of individuals, and allow comparison of multiple TB vaccine candidates in efficacy studies. Thus, the demonstration of TB vaccine efficacy and biomarker efficacy are both of eminent importance. Such biomarkers would also facilitate licensure of new efficacious TB vaccines in different age groups (infants, children, adults) as well as ethnically and geographically different populations (particularly Africa and Asia) without having to perform further large scale efficacy testing.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Biomarker Challenges</title><p>Identification of biomarkers of protection against TB disease is challenging because there is no gold standard of infection or protection. Our understanding of what is strictly required for host protection from TB disease is incomplete, which hampers vaccine development <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff2" ref-type="bibr">[2,5]</xref>. Moreover, validation of biomarkers against clinical endpoints is difficult because in TB clinical endpoints cannot always be clearly defined. For the curative response to treatment time to sputum conversion is frequently used, but for protection against disease development no gold standard clinical definition is available. In infant BCG vaccination studies, protection has been defined as known exposure to TB within the household without the development of disease within 2 years following exposure <xref rid="pone.0073230-Kagina1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This definition is probably suitable for infants that experience most exposure within the household, however, for most (adult) people it is difficult to trace exposure to TB and thus disease-free time post exposure <xref rid="pone.0073230-Lienhardt1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>; moreover, adults may more often be re-exposed during the 2 year follow up period, confounding estimations of disease incidence. Clinical endpoints should be comparable among studies to allow ranking and prioritization of biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. An additional complexity is that new candidate TB vaccines are quite different by nature, <italic>e.g.</italic> live vaccines compared to subunit vaccines or priming compared to boosting vaccines, which each may induce protection in a different manner and may thus require different sets of biomarkers to evaluate vaccine induced protection <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Next to biomarkers of protection against TB disease development, also biomarkers predicting disease risk are extremely important in vaccine trials: these may identify individuals at risk at an early stage and thus help to significantly shorten follow-up times and numbers. Biomarkers of early TB disease development may be easier to identify since in contrast to protection, TB disease can be demonstrated using microbiological diagnosis (bacterial staining or culture, GeneXpert MTB/RIF), X-ray or made highly likely based on clinical manifestations. To identify biomarkers of disease-risk, patients can be compared to various other groups, including those with latent TB, treated TB patients or patients with other inflammatory or infectious diseases. Early identification of individuals at risk of developing TB disease will help reducing the occurrence of contagious pulmonary TB and thus limit disease transmission.</p><p>Biomarkers will thus be critical tools in the battle against TB. However, a number of issues need to be taken into consideration when comparing biomarker studies. First, geographic or ethnic variations may significantly impact on immune responses towards TB due to a variety of factors which include: host genetic factors; the presence of environmental microbes like helminths or HIV <xref rid="pone.0073230-Dockrell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Lalor1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t001">Table 1</xref>); exposure to/infection with immunomodulatory (environmental) non-tuberculous mycobacteria; previous BCG vaccination; <italic>Mtb</italic> exposure intensity and frequency; reinfection rates; <italic>Mtb</italic> strain heterogeneity etc. Concomitant HIV infection may predominantly affect biomarkers derived from the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment. In addition, metabolic conditions may influence immunity and biomarker signatures following vaccination or infection. For example, obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) both result in continuous low-grade systemic inflammation, including cytokine and chemokine production, switching of macrophage subsets from anti-inflammatory Mf2 to pro-inflammatory Mf1 <xref rid="pone.0073230-Sell1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Harford1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The significance of T2D for TB has emerged from epidemiological data and prompted WHO to initiate combined care for TB and T2D <xref rid="pone.0073230-World2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073230-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Patients with T2D have a 3-fold increased risk to develop TB disease, and achievement of negative sputum cultures as a measure of treatment success takes longer as compared to non-T2D TB patients <xref rid="pone.0073230-World2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073230-Sullivan1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Also low body mass indexes and malnutrition are significant risk factors for the development of TB disease, indicating that nutritional status is an important factor for TB disease, which may significantly affect measurable biomarker profiles <xref rid="pone.0073230-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Dai1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0073230-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073230.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Factors that may affect TB Biomarkers.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0073230-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0073230.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">patient</td><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1">age</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">geographic origin/ethnicity</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">environmental exposure (eg environmental mycobacteria)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">previous vaccinations (eg BCG during childhood)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">co-infections (eg HIV, Helminths)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">metabolic state (malnutrition, obesity, T2D)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">use of immunomodulating drugs (eg immune suppression)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">pathogen</td><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1">strain (eg MDR, Beijing)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">route of entrance (eg vaccine vs natural infection)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">site of disease (pulmonary vs extrapulmonary)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="3" align="left" rowspan="1">time since infection/stage of disease progression</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sample</td><td colspan="5" align="left" rowspan="1">type of sample (eg whole blood, PBMCs, fluid from disease site)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="2" align="left" rowspan="1">time between collection and fixation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td colspan="4" align="left" rowspan="1">sample handling (eg isolation procedures, temperature)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>Secondly, the type of material used for biomarker determination may greatly determine the type of biomarkers that can be detected. Whole blood contains large numbers of neutrophils, which are present at a very low frequency in isolated PBMCs, and which seem to be cells that express promising TB biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0073230-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073230-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. On the other hand, the strong signal from these large numbers of neutrophils in whole blood may obscure highly relevant and specific gene expression profiles from smaller populations, e.g. T-cells, B-cells, monocytes or other relatively rare populations. Furthermore, it is recognized that the isolation of cells from whole blood may alter their gene expression profiles, which is further enhanced if blood processing is delayed for several hours <xref rid="pone.0073230-Hanekom1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073230-McKenna1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Therefore, biomarkers should preferably be analysed on the same type of material over different studies and processing time should be standardized to reduce variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0073230-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0073230-Hanekom2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These differences in cell populations may be reflected in differential expression of particular biomarkers, and thus not only reflect the response to TB but also indicate changes in comorbidities. Finally, biomarkers for different forms of disease may be different, e.g. pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary TB, partly because samples obtained from peripheral blood, sputum or pleural fluid have different cellular compositions.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>TB biomarkers and other diseases</title><p>The use of biomarkers to predict TB disease progression (or ultimately vaccine efficacy or protection) is complicated by the nature of these markers. Most TB biomarkers or biomarker-signatures identified so far are indicators of general (intracellular) infection and subsequent immune activation, rather than highly specific for TB disease. There is a large overlap with biomarkers reported in other inflammatory diseases including SLE, sarcoidosis, melioidosis and Still's disease <xref rid="pone.0073230-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Koh1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as well as following Yellow Fever vaccination <xref rid="pone.0073230-Querec1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. With the exception of sarcoidosis and melioidosis, most of these diseases can be discriminated rather easily from TB based on clinical symptoms or examination in combination with existing diagnostics.</p><p>It is unsurprising that TB biomarker profiles overlap significantly with other infections and inflammatory conditions, since most pathways represent genes associated with immune activation and inflammation. At the cellular level, infection with any pathogen may trigger activation of innate cells through pattern recognition receptors (TLRs, NLRs etc.), resulting in upregulation of markers and cytokines/chemokines irrespective of the exact nature of the pathogen. Following specific recognition by the adaptive immune system, this will similarly result in activation of innate cells, initiating a modular response to eliminate the invading pathogen. Thus, it is to be anticipated that a large number of biomarkers should be shared between disease processes that rely on similar host-module responses.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Global TB Biomarker Signatures</title><p>Multiple studies have analysed production of single cytokines or chemokines, or the expression of cell surface markers at the protein or mRNA level as biomarkers for TB disease. More recently, single candidate biomarkers were combined into multicomponent signatures to increase power and specificity. Advanced statistical methods were applied to select genes from (global) transcriptomic datasets and to compile signatures including the smallest possible number of genes to retain good predictive values. Such signatures appear to be more powerful biomarkers than individual genes or proteins <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Recently, multiple groups have reported global gene expression analysis in different cohorts of TB patients with active disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t002">Table 2</xref>). In these studies, signaling through the type I interferon (Interferon alpha/beta (IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;)) pathway was frequently reported as important in TB disease, although the molecules identified as differentially expressed or produced were not identical between all different cohorts or studies. Because the pathways involved are clearly related and overlapping, we decided to analyse the TB biomarker signatures emerging from these genome wide transcriptomic studies as a group, using a &#x0201c;helicopter&#x0201d; perspective by jointly analyzing data from all published genome wide expression studies on TB disease to date. A helicopter view over all data may allow comparative analysis of all available data rather than a comparison of individual pathways identified by each study. Since all data are assessed to be equally important the distant view from the helicopter should allow identification of major players in the TB disease development. This should help to better characterize the key processes and pathways involved rather than identifying markers which might be relatively unique to certain study settings, determined e.g. by the specific population sampled, time and type of sampling, and other possible confounders discussed above. We reasoned that the processes or pathways identified by such an analysis should be more reliable and generic, and thus may provide a platform for further TB biomarker exploration and evaluation in a global context.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0073230-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073230.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Information on studies included.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0073230-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0073230.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">study</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">reference</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">population</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">sample collection</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"># TB patients</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">type of sample</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">initial, independent</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mistry R, JID, 2007: 195, 357</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active TB disease vs healthy infected controls</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">South Africa</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">whole blood</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Jacobsen M, J Mol Med, 2007: 85, 613</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active TB disease vs healthy infected controls</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Germany</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PBMC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Berry MP, Nature, 2010: 466, 973</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">active TB disease vs healthy infected &#x00026;

Patients originated from different geographical regions, including Europe, Asia, Saharan and Sub-Saharan Africa. Gene expression data were analysed within each study, mostly involving pathway analysis to determine the most dominant signaling pathways within that cohort in comparison to their specific control population. Gene signatures were determined that could serve as biomarkers to discriminate patients with active TB disease from the respective control population included. A number of studies also included pathway ontology analysis to decipher the potential cell subsets or cellular processes that were most different between TB disease and control populations.</p><p>Here, we combined all genes identified by each of the eight independent global gene expression studies to discriminate between patients with active TB disease and controls, into a single data set, allowing more comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes during TB disease. All genes identified by each of the individual studies as differentially expressed between TB disease and their respective control populations were included in this analysis. Gating criteria for gene selection were determined by the individual authors and their selection of genes differentially expressed in TB disease versus their respective control population was added into our study, irrespective whether the genes were up or downregulated.

A number of independent studies have used the modular classification described by Damian Chaussabel <xref rid="pone.0073230-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, which is based on the assumption that the probability for multiple transcripts to follow a complex pattern of expression across dozens of conditions only by chance is low and such sets of genes should therefore constitute coherent and biologically meaningful transcriptional units. He used microarray based gene expression profiles from a number of diseases and grouped genes according to their concordance in expression profiles <xref rid="pone.0073230-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Pubmed searches were done to identify module functional associations, resulting in rather broad, cell type based allocations in particular as a consequence of using PBMCs as source material. Conceptually the modular framework is very elegant and expected to give insights in processes that are strongly enriched within a gene expression data set. However, the number of genes that can be grouped into the modules initially was limited. Recently, a novel version of these modules was published, which is now based on Illumina microarray platforms and contains a larger number of genes (publically available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biir.net/public_wikis/module_annotation/G2_Trial_8_Modules">http://www.biir.net/public_wikis/module_annotation/G2_Trial_8_Modules</ext-link>). Also the number of modules was greatly expanded in this new version compared to the previous version <xref rid="pone.0073230-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. All 409 genes in our current data set were annotated according to the latest version of the modules (web publication date August 2012) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>). 371/409 (90.7%) genes in the combined dataset were retrieved and assigned to modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>). However, the majority of genes (195/371 or 52.6%) were allocated to modules without functional assignment (undetermined/not determined), resulting in only 176/409 (43.0%) of genes with a functional classification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Two modules are highly represented in the dataset: 68/176 (36.6%) of the allocated genes belong to the inflammatory signature and 36/176 (20.5%) genes belong to the interferon related signature. Genes identified in more than 1 independent studies also predominantly represented patterns of inflammation (9/39; 23%) and interferon related pathways (7/39; 17.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0073230-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073230.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Functional classification of individual genes identified by gene expression analysis on TB patients.</title><p>Categories have been based on combined output from Ingenuity and GSEA software modules and may include multiple canonical pathways or cell processes.

The disadvantage of the modular data analysis is the limited relation of gene sets within a module to specific functional capacities, the relative lack of sensitivity for small changes in gene expression profiles, mostly because the data sets used to annotate the modules were all derived from PBMCs, with their particular cellular composition, and did not include specialized cell types, or specifically activated pathways. For example, monocytes and macrophages only represent a low proportion of PBMCs (5&#x02013;10%) and thus specific monocyte activation pathways may not be recognized by the modular annotation.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Molecular Interactions</title><p>Ingenuity based pathway analysis revealed highly significant overlap with 92 canonical pathways with p&#x0003c;0.001 and a total of 196 canonical pathways p&#x0003c;0.05.

First, pathways were excluded if they were smaller than 50 genes; secondly, pathways were excluded if fewer than 10 out of the total of 409 gene dataset mapped in that pathway; and thirdly, we only considered pathways in which our genes represented at least 10% of the total gene-set in that pathway.

Genes that comprise the TREM1 canonical pathway are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t005">Table 5</xref>, in addition genes identified in our dataset are indicated. The dataset overlaps with TREM1 signaling directly, but also has significant overlap with TLR and downstream TLR signalling as well as with effector cytokines secreted following TREM1 activation. This is a novel finding, not detected in any of the individual published studies. TREM1 or &#x02018;Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1&#x02019; is a member of the Ig superfamily and is predominantly expressed on myeloid cells. Cell surface expression of TREM1 is increased upon cellular activation, e.g. by LPS and other microbial products <xref rid="pone.0073230-GomezPina1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Expression of TREM1 results in amplification of neutrophil- and monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses, by increased cytokine production and upregulation of cell activation markers, as seen in bacterial and fungal infections. TREM1 signaling pathways interact with signaling pathways downstream from the IFNaR1/2 and from TLRs <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Arts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Cross-talk between TREM1 and TLR2 and TLR4 signaling cascades have been demonstrated, and potentially also other TLR (TLR 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9) and possibly NLR signaling pathways are influenced by TREM1 signaling <xref rid="pone.0073230-Arts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. TREM1 and TLR2 signaling pathways can synergize at the level of cytokine production <xref rid="pone.0073230-Arts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. TREM1 plays a crucial role in fine-tuning of the inflammatory response by amplifying or dampening TLR induced signals, and is known to tune the septic response in order to facilitate efficient clearance of the pathogen without damaging the host <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ford1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The ligand of TREM1 is currently unknown, although it has been speculated that it may be expressed on pathogens, thereby directly activating TREM1 signaling <xref rid="pone.0073230-Arts1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Peptidoglycans on gram positive bacteria and endotoxins on gram-negative bacteria are candidate ligands, and mycobacterial peptidoglycans might also serve as TREM1 ligands. This remains to be determined but would be an interesting explanation for the increased TREM1 signaling observed in patients with active TB disease.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0073230-t005"

Similarly, in BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) cells from patients with pulmonary TB no significant increase in cell-surface TREM1 expression was observed compared to BAL cells from non-infectious controls, whereas BAL cells from patients with other pulmonary infections did express increased TREM1 levels on macrophages and neutrophils <xref rid="pone.0073230-Richeldi1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Thus, TREM1 related signaling seems important during active TB disease; although cellular TREM1 expression levels may not be changed, levels of soluble sTREM1 are increased at the site of disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3b2"><title>Myeloid lineage cells</title><p>In addition to TREM1 signaling, a number of other pathways associated with myeloid cell function or activation were prominently identified in the Ingenuity analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t003">Table 3</xref>).

Grouping of genes according to the canonical pathway based groups resulted in categorization of 107 out of the total 409 genes in the dataset. The myeloid signature thus identified is strong and also more clearly represented than in any of the individual studies: 56/107 (52.3%) genes that were grouped into canonical pathways were in the myeloid category, although the majority overlaps with other categories as well, including TREM1 signaling.</p><p>As with the Ingenuity based pathway analysis, most of the GSEA gene sets we identified represented a myeloid biased gene signature and an inflammatory immune response. The gene sets SEKI_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE_LPS_UP, ICHIBA_GRAFT_VERSUS_HOST_DISEASE_35D_UPICHIBA_GRAFT_VERSUS_HOST_DISEASE_D7_UP, JISON_SICKLE_CELL_DISEASE_UP and REACTOME_IMMUNE_SYSTEM overlap with each other and comprise many genes associated with myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t004">Table 4</xref>).

These comprised signaling pathways around Akt, MYD88 and the NF&#x003ba;B complex as central players in the network, indicating an important role for inflammation, phagocytes and professional antigen presenting cells including macrophages. Indeed the early microarray studies performed in TB patients indicated that genes with roles in inflammation and immunity were most abundantly expressed <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Mistry1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and most inflammation related genes differentially expressed were derived from monocytes <xref rid="pone.0073230-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ottenhoff3" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, Cliff et al. speculated that some of the genes specifically upregulated during TB disease can be expressed by macrophages and DCs but not by monocytes, and thus may reflect activated APCs, possibly cells trafficking between lungs and lymphoid tissue via the blood <xref rid="pone.0073230-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This could also explain the relatively high myeloid gene expression observed in TB patients and in particular the involvement of TLR and Fc receptor induced signaling, since these processes would normally be expected to occur at the site of disease rather than in the circulation. The pathways associated with these myeloid cells point towards a strong role for direct pathogen related processes, even in the circulation (not the disease site in TB).</p></sec><sec id="s3b3"><title>T-cells and B-cells</title><p>Although the emerged profiles are dominated by inflammatory and myeloid gene signatures there was one gene set associated with CD4 T Cell/follicular helper T cell activation (PICCALUGA_ANGIOIMMUNOBLASTIC_LYMPHOMA_UP) <xref rid="pone.0073230-Piccaluga1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t004">Table 4</xref>). CD4 T cells are important for the control of Mtb infection and TB disease, proliferate and are activated in response to antigens from M. tuberculosis. It is possible that these follicular helper T cells are contributing to the formation of B cell follicles during active TB disease. Studies of human TB granulomas have identified B cell follicle structures which may contribute to the immune response in TB, and activated B cells have been found in granulomas of nonhuman primates infected with Mtb <xref rid="pone.0073230-Ulrichs1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Phuah1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>As expected also canonical pathways associated with B cell function (as previously reported by <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>), T cell function (previously reported by <xref rid="pone.0073230-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>) and more general inflammation processes were identified by Ingenuity analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t003">Table 3</xref>). The potential functional implications of B cells in TB disease have been debated for decades, in particular because intracellular pathogens are considered to be sequestered from circulating antibodies. However, functional significance of B cells in TB disease has been demonstrated in mouse models: B cell deficient mice appear more susceptible to TB <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maglione1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, and Fc-receptors play a role in protection. Furthermore, in addition to the presence of B cells in human TB lesions as described above, the expression of human Fc&#x003b3;R1 is a consistent and strong component in TB biomarker signatures <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Joosten1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. These observations suggest that B cells may play a hitherto unappreciated role in immunity in TB. This is further supported by recent results that suggest that also intracellular binding of antibody to pathogens can take place via a cytosolic Fc-receptor called TRIM21 <xref rid="pone.0073230-McEwan1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Geijtenbeek1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Pathogen bound antibody triggering of TRIM21 subsequently stimulated transcription factor pathways including NF-kB, IRF7 and others, resulting in immune activation and inflammatory signals. This may open up an interesting new angle for the potential role of B cells and in particular antibodies in the combat against TB, which should be explored in more detail. Interestingly, our network based analysis of genes expressed in peripheral blood from TB patients does include TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Gene expression of TRIM21 was detected in cohorts of TB patients compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0073230-Maertzdorf2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>) and was grouped close to Fc Receptors and its defined signaling molecule IRF7 in the Ingenuity network analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3b4"><title>Hematopoiesis</title><p>A process which was not expected but clearly represented in the canonical pathway analysis was hematopoiesis, represented by &#x02018;Erythropoietin signaling&#x02019;; &#x02018;IL-3 signaling&#x02019;; &#x02018;FLT3 signaling in hematopoietic progenitor cells&#x02019;; &#x02018;prolactin signaling&#x02019; and &#x02018;HGF signaling&#x02019;. This indicates that in the blood of patients with TB disease active remodeling apparently is ongoing, either with renewal of hematopoietic cells at a possibly increased rate compared to non-TB controls or with cells emerging from the bone marrow and on their way to the site of inflammation (mostly the lung in TB patients). Recently it has been demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic> may hijack mesenchymal stem cells and may survive in the CD271+ stem cells for a long period after successful treatment of pulmonary TB, hiding from the immune system <xref rid="pone.0073230-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. This suggests that stem cells in the bone marrow may be active players in TB disease, revealing a new cell type involved in TB pathogenesis. Another interesting link between mycobacterial infections and stem cells is the recent observation that <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> is capable of reprogramming host gene expression in adult Schwann cells and induces a dedifferentiation program towards stem cell like cells (SLC) <xref rid="pone.0073230-Masaki1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.

It remains unknown whether <italic>Mtb</italic> also possesses the capacity to reprogram host cells by activating pathways characteristic for hematopoiesis, but this may be an interesting possibility that fits with the observed changes in gene expression profiles. Interestingly, the vast majority of genes categorized as &#x02018;hematopoiesis&#x02019; is also associated with several myeloid functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b5"><title>Type I Interferon Signaling</title><p>Berry et al <xref rid="pone.0073230-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> were the first to describe that Type I interferon signaling was increased in TB patients. The pathway MOSERLE_IFNA_RESPONSE was amongst the 15 most significant pathways identified by GSEA in active TB disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t004">Table 4</xref>). Surprisingly, interferon &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; related signaling pathways were not amongst the top pathways represented by our dataset in Ingenuity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t003">Table 3</xref>), despite it being detected with high significance in several individual studies. Interferon signaling reached statistical significance (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000026), but was lost during application of gating criteria, due to the small number of genes in the pathway (&#x0003c;50) and the small number of genes overlapping with our dataset (&#x0003c;10). However, because of the interest in IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; signaling in TB disease, we added a category IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0073230-t003">table 3</xref> based on all 3 canonical pathway datasets related to type I interferon signaling in Ingenuity &#x02018;interferon signaling&#x02019;; &#x02018;role of JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 in interferon signaling&#x02019; and &#x02018;role of PKR in interferon induction and antiviral response&#x02019;. IFN signaling represented 13/107 (12.1%) genes in our dataset and was thereby not the most dominant pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g001">figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>). Signaling through IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; seems an important pathway associated with TB disease in most independent studies, although many molecules involved in downstream IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathways are not uniquely involved in transmitting signals derived from IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptors but may also be critical components in other pathways.</p><p>Type I interferons are classically known as early response molecules in the context of viral infections and are well known immune modulators.

Both TB and leprosy are long term, chronic infections; in both diseases an increased expression of IFN&#x003b2; induced genes has been observed, suggesting its potential involvement in tissue damage and inflammation, and in regulating adaptive IFN&#x003b3; responses. It may be speculated that patients with latent Mtb infection have strong IFN&#x003b3; induced responses which are downregulated by IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; during reactivation from latent to active TB disease <xref rid="pone.0073230-OGarra1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0073230-Teles1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>Macrophages or monocytes infected with Mtb produce and secrete type I interferons <xref rid="pone.0073230-Decker1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.

Commonly genes are grouped according to similar changes in expression profiles, e.g. using non-hierarchical clustering. More recently, groups of genes have been clustered into modules based on their shared expression (and likely involvement) in biological processes <xref rid="pone.0073230-Chaussabel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These modular representations have become more popular in annotating function to gene expression data. However, joint expression of genes during certain processes/diseases does not necessarily demonstrate functional relatedness. Related gene expression events may be dynamic and occur in sequence rather than simultaneously such that genes with strong functional relations may not necessarily be detected at the same time point in the (disease) process and therefore may not group into the same cluster or module. The assessment of pathways and processes that seem key in the disease process seems to be more valuable than merely assessing the combination of genes with the highest changes in expression levels.</p><p>Here we explored functional interactions based on known molecular interactions (Ingenuity) and enrichment of genes in biological pathways (GSEA) to analyze gene expression data described in TB disease at a higher aggregation level, from an helicopter perspective. Dominant pathways may not only serve as biomarkers at the transcription level as such, but products from these pathways or cellular responses induced by that particular pathway may also be significant indicators of disease, potentially allowing easier assessment of pathway activity in simpler tests. Future assessments of biomarkers for vaccine-induced protection may benefit from similar, pathway/process based analyses to allow more powerful biomarker selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0073230-g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0073230.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of events during active TB Disease.</title><p>Pathway and process based analysis suggests that these processes are key players in TB disease pathogenesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0073230.g004"/></fig><p>Interestingly, multiple genes affected in TB disease were involved in more than a single pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0073230.s001">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g001">Figure 1</xref>), emphasizing the impact of individual signaling components in multiple pathways. Therefore, assessment of total pathway function or at least multiple components from the same pathways may be a more reliable measurement of such pathways than individual markers that are functionally involved in many different signal transduction chains.</p><p>The combined analysis of TB biomarkers of disease identified by 8 independent studies revealed a less dominant role for the IFN&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; related genes, but revealed a very strong involvement of myeloid cells. In particular signaling through Pattern Recognition Receptors, Fc receptors, fibrosis and TREM1 seemed key players during active TB disease. These findings may be somewhat unexpected, mostly because all profiling was performed in whole blood or purified PBMCs and not at the site of disease. In particular in Mtb infection, the local activation of myeloid cells and receptors involved in pathogen recognition are expected to be key players in the disease process, yet also systemic activation of these pathways is emphasized by our analysis. These cells may either traffic from the site of disease into the circulation or may have been indirectly activated by pathogen derived products that have entered the circulation, thus mirroring activated phagocytes at the site of disease. It is somewhat surprising to detect a prominent activated myeloid cell signature in the circulation, because generally activation would occur in tissues and cells would subsequently follow the lymphoid system to migrate towards lymphoid organs. Apparently, during active TB disease inflammation may be of such magnitude that the inflammatory site spills over into the circulation such that activated myeloid cells can be detected in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0073230-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In this context, the identification of TREM1 signalling is interesting, providing a new angle for activation of monocytic cells by <italic>Mtb</italic>. Potentially, <italic>Mtb</italic> derived molecules target this pathway, in synergy with TLRs, to activate innate and adaptive immune responses. Additional new leads may include pathways associated with hematopoiesis and B cell activation. Several pathways associated with hematopoiesis were identified by Ingenuity pathway analysis, which may support new recent leads of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells during TB disease. However, the individual genes that fit into these pathways are also involved in myeloid cell activation and inflammation. Therefore genes exclusively associated with hematopoiesis in particular need to be investigated to determine the relevance of hematopoiesis in TB disease. B cell activation in the circulation of patients with TB disease may also require more detailed investigation, in particular since also TB granulomas harbour B cells suggesting active involvement with disease.</p><p>All of these pathways deserve more in-depth (functional) analysis in TB disease and hopefully will guide exploration of new therapeutic targets for TB disease.</p><p>Thus, our &#x02018;helicopter&#x02019; like pathway-based analysis of multiple independent studies reveals novel insights in the pathogenesis and potential biomarkers of TB disease, implying a strong role for myeloid cells in TB pathogenesis which deserves more in-depth investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0073230.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
