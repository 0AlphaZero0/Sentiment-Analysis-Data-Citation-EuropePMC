<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) (tuberculosis, TB) is the leading infectious disease cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide <xref rid="pone.0089925-1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. An estimated 30% of the world population is infected with TB <xref rid="pone.0089925-Dye1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The concurring epidemic of HIV infection in areas endemic for TB infection has resulted in a high burden of HIV/TB co-infection, and TB is currently estimated to be the leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients in these areas <xref rid="pone.0089925-Tufariello1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Toossi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The weakening of the host&#x02019;s immune system by HIV increases risk of de-novo co-infection with TB, or reactivation of latent TB <xref rid="pone.0089925-McShane1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Manosuthi1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR) TB strains has further taxed the healthcare systems in high-TB burden countries. The presence of an HIV infection has been associated with, and may contribute to, the increase in MDR-TB cases <xref rid="pone.0089925-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Suchindran1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, highlighting the importance of research into novel treatments and new diagnostic tools for early detection of TB infections.</p><p>Current diagnostic methods are associated with several limitations including sample collection issues associated with the automated sputum based diagnostic test that can identify MTB and resistance to rifampicin (Xpert MTB/RIF) <xref rid="pone.0089925-Mehta1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) or limited sensitivity and specificity associated with testing for urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) <xref rid="pone.0089925-Fan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Metcalfe1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Rangaka1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Pai1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>). In addition, while LAM detection methods have greater sensitivity in advanced disease <xref rid="pone.0089925-Shah1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, even a combination of Xpert MTB/RIF and LAM tests can only detect approximately 80% of symptomatic patients <xref rid="pone.0089925-Shah2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The presence of an HIV infection further limits the sensitivity for the diagnosis of TB as it increases the number of false negatives detected <xref rid="pone.0089925-Perkins1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Weyer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Failure to detect TB early in HIV co-infected patients is lethal, and better assays for diagnosing TB are needed to reduce the high level of mortality caused by TB in these patients <xref rid="pone.0089925-Perkins1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The interaction of TB with the host immune system induces changes in host gene expression. Ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based methods such as messenger RNA microarrays that interrogate the whole transcriptome have prompted efforts to detect specific host gene expression signatures correlated with different aspects of disease <xref rid="pone.0089925-Mikhailovich1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Several recently published gene expression studies have explored the biological mechanisms of TB infections and identified biomarkers that may be useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes <xref rid="pone.0089925-Lesho1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Jacobsen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Stern1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, no group has yet described a gene signature able to identify patients co-infected with HIV and TB. We address this problem in the present study by analyzing global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from a South African cohort of 43 patients infected with HIV alone or co-infected with HIV and TB. Our analysis identifies a 251-gene signature that distinguishes mono-infected HIV patients from HIV patients co-infected with TB. The accuracy of this signature is 81.4% (sensitivity&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;76.2%, specificity&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;86.4%). This signature was validated on two large publicly available, independent gene expression datasets of patients infected with TB but not HIV, reported by Berry et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and Bloom et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Our HIV/TB signature also accurately distinguished patients mono-infected with TB from healthy individuals and patients with latent TB. It also distinguished untreated infected patients from patients undergoing progressive to successful anti-TB treatment, suggesting the potential to monitor response to therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Study subjects were recruited between September 6, 2007 and October 16, 2008 at the Themba Lethu Clinic, Johannesburg, South Africa and included 22 HIV mono-infected patients and 21 HIV/TB co-infected patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089925-t001">Table 1</xref>). Patients were referred to the Themba Lethu Clinic by the initial practitioners (HIV cohort) or primary TB clinic (HIV/TB cohort) in the Johannesburg catchment area for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) according to local guidelines. All patients were receiving ART at the time of enrollment and all patients co-infected with TB were receiving treatment for TB. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants; consent forms and procedures, as well as study protocol, were approved by the University of the Witwatersrand&#x02019;s Ethics Committee and the Wistar Institute Institutional Review Board. Patients were initially recruited to study natural killer cell activity in HIV and HIV/TB infected patients and the results have been published by Conradie et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Conradie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. PBMC were purified on location from peripheral blood using Ficoll gradient centrifugation, and cryopreserved, then shipped in a single batch to the Wistar Institute using a certified cold chain carrier in liquid nitrogen shippers.

Following RNA isolation, 100 ng of RNA was amplified using Epicentre TargetAmp Nano-g Biotin-aRNA Labeling Kit (cat # TAN07924) to generate amplified cRNA.

The SVM classifier was iteratively trained with the current set of features and the least important features were then removed. The SVM-RFE parameters were set to 10 fold cross-validation with 10 iterations and 10% of the least informative features were eliminated at every step as previously described <xref rid="pone.0089925-Kossenkov1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Showe1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. SVM-RFE produced a ranked list of genes. A gene&#x02019;s rank in the list correlates with its contribution to the overall TB signal, such that genes ranked at the top of the list contribute more to the predictive value of the classifier. Using the most predictive genes, the SVM classifier assigned a score to each of the samples in the training set, where a positive score indicates a prediction of TB and a negative score indicates a control (no active TB). The smallest number of genes that results in the highest classification accuracy (in this case 251 genes) makes up the TB signature or classifier. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the classifier are evaluated at every recursive elimination step.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Independent Validation Samples</title><p>The published external TB associated datasets GSE19435, GSE19439, GSE19442 and GSE19444 <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, available in the GEO database, were used to validate and expand our present study. In this published study <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, RNA from whole blood was hybridized to the Illumina HumanHT-12 v3 BeadChip Arrays. Since our study uses the more recent v4 arrays only the 13,880 probes that had passed the filtering criteria and were common to both Illumina&#x02019;s v3 and v4 platforms were considered in any analyses. We normalized the data obtained from <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> by first calculating the average expression per probe across samples in each dataset separately and then across all samples from the 4 datasets. The difference between the average of a dataset and the overall average was determined and the expression level for each probe within a sample was adjusted by the difference. Data later obtained from GSE40553 <xref rid="pone.0089925-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> also using RNA from whole blood was first normalized using median quantile normalization. The data was then normalized with respect to the other 4 datasets by again adjusting each sample to the difference between the average expression for the dataset and the average across all 4 datasets.

TS2 contained the microarray data only from mono-infected TB patients before any treatment and after 12 months of treatment, when they were presumably cured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089925-t002">Table 2</xref>). TS2 allowed us to determine whether a TB signature could be detected in patients prior to any treatment with similar accuracy as in TS1. Comparable results to TS1 were observed with the TS2 data (no treatment vs. complete treatment) with an accuracy of 92.9% achieved and only one TB patient being misclassified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089925-t004">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089925-g002">Figure 2<italic>B</italic>
</xref>). It should be noted that the TB samples misclassified in TS1 and TS2 were from the same patient. The ability of the signature to correctly classify the pre-treatment TB samples as having TB signifies that the signature is associated with the presence of an active TB infection and not primarily due to the effect of the treatment. This is further supported by the observation that the overall expression of the TB signature in the samples obtained after 12 months of successful treatment resembles the gene profiles of the uninfected controls. A heatmap of the 251 genes in these four groups shows gene expression between the TB patients before and after 2 months of treatment to be quite similar, while expression of these genes in patients 12 months after treatment are more similar to the gene expression levels in the uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>The strong correlation of the signature with the presence of a TB infection can be further seen in the principal components analysis plot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The expression of these 251 genes clusters the data across the first principal component in a sequential manner with samples more to less infected clustering from right to left. Samples from TB infected patients prior to treatment cluster furthest to the right, while samples from the early treatment cluster in the middle/right area of the plot closer to the pre-treatment samples. Samples from TB patients taken after 12 months of treatment cluster in the middle/left area of the plot and finally, controls, with and without HIV, cluster to the far left. This progressive relation is also evident in the tracking of the time-series samples for each of the individual patients, represented by the colored lines in the figure. For each of the seven patients the pattern of pre-treatment, 2 months treatment and 12 months treatment samples always move from right to left indicating a change in state from infected to uninfected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The 251-gene HIV/TB Signature Distinguishes between Active and Latent TB</title><p>We also tested the 251-gene signature&#x02019;s performance on four additional datasets: TS3 (GSE19439), TS4 (GSE19444), TS5 (GSE19442) and TS6 (GSE40553) to determine whether our signature could also distinguish between untreated active and latent TB infections.

Because of slight differences between Illumina&#x02019;s HumanHT-12v3 microarrays used for the Berry study and the v4 arrays used for ours, we used the 387 probes from their signature that were common to both arrays to assess whether this gene signature would effectively classify our HIV/TB patients as TB infected. We first applied the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method similar to that described in <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> using data from the TS3 dataset as a training set. Testing on our data resulted in the correct classification of only 7 out of 21 of our HIV/TB patients (33% sensitivity), indicating that this signature does not perform well on HIV co-infected samples. We also applied the SVM analysis used for our studies as a second approach for testing the performance of the 387 signature. Data from the 387 probes in the TS3 dataset were used to train the model that was then applied to our data. The 387-probe signature was not able to distinguish our two patient classes and classified both mono-infected and co-infected patients as having active TB (0% specificity). Similarly, the 86-gene signature that distinguishes between TB and other inflammatory and infectious diseases <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> could not classify the two groups in our dataset (0% sensitivity) and only had four probes in common with our signature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is currently no &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for TB diagnosis in mono-infected patients or patients co-infected with HIV.

Remarkably, only one TB patient was misclassified in this study, despite the fact that our data was collected on purified PBMC samples and the mono-infection study was performed on whole blood (Tempus Blood RNA Tubes, Applied Biosystems). These results highlight the robustness of our signature to detect TB both in the presence and absence of an HIV infection and in whole blood samples as well as purified PBMC. We also validated the signature&#x02019;s ability to distinguish untreated TB samples from samples taken 12 months after treatment when the infection is presumed to be eliminated. While patients only treated for 2 months remain classified as TB-positive, those treated for 12 months are classified as controls. The time course study suggests that our gene signature can assess the efficacy of treatment over time as we find that untreated, 2 months treated and 12 months treated samples from individual patients exhibited a diminished TB signature (score) as a consequence of the treatment. This suggests that the 251-gene signature may be useful in differentiating between patients who respond successfully to treatment (TB eradication) and subjects with poor response who need more aggressive treatment, or with treatment-resistant infections. Larger time-series studies will be needed to evaluate the usefulness of this assessment but Molecular Distance to Health and Temporal Molecular Response scores based on recent data from Bloom et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Bloom1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> support this possibility, as scores for our 251-gene signature are demonstrated to change significantly after two weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s008">Methods and Results S1</xref>).</p><p>While our training set did not include patients with a latent TB infection, our classifier also accurately distinguished between an active TB infection and a latent infection in the four external datasets tested (TS3-6). Our 251-gene signature correctly identified all 17 patients with latent TB in TS3 (100% sensitivity). In addition, it also classified 20 out of 21 (95.2%), 28 out of 31 (90.3%) and 35 out of 38 (92.1%) patients with a latent TB infection as controls in TS4, TS5 and TS6, respectively.</p><p>The recently published 393-gene signature of Berry et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> did not perform well on our HIV-infected samples while our PBMC signature performed accurately on their data. This is likely due to two factors. Berry et al. <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> analyzed gene expression patterns in whole blood specimens collected using Tempus tubes whereas our study used cryopreserved PBMC. Tempus collection tubes capture the neutrophil RNA not captured in the PBMC samples as most of the granulocytes are removed by the PBMC purification.. The other key difference in the two datasets is that the sample population used for the selection of our 251 gene signature was composed entirely of HIV-positive individuals, whereas HIV infection was specifically excluded in Berry&#x02019;s study. HIV co-infection may obscure the expression of certain genes that would otherwise be related to a TB infection that were detected in the Berry study. Although both signatures clearly demonstrate specificity for the presence of TB, only 16 probes, corresponding to 15 genes, were common to both signatures (TMEM51, APOL6, STAT2, STAT1, LOC653610, GK, DHRS9, TRAFD1, UBE2L6, GBP2, LPCAT2, AK026751, ASPHD2, BRSK1, and FLVCR2). The 393-gene signature <xref rid="pone.0089925-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, has demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity in the detection of TB in the absence of HIV while our 251-gene signature could be used for diagnosing the presence of active TB, both in patients with and patients without HIV.</p><p>Although 251 genes is a relatively small number for such an analysis, we used Ingenuity (Ingenuity Systems, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) to identify pathways and gene functions that might be represented in our 251 gene list. While the list did include genes involved in Immunological Disease (9 genes), Infectious Disease (33 genes) and Inflammatory Disease (7 genes), we did not find any pathways or functions to be significantly enriched after applying the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg procedure for multiple-test correction of p-values (0.05) in the 251 gene list, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s008">Methods and Results S1</xref>). In addition to gene expression, we also examined changes in DNA methylation, however, the changes we found were very small and uninformative in our study, likely because they are associated with only a specific cell type in the PBMC mixture of cells. The DNA methylation data are also available in GEO under the accession number GSE50835 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s006">Figure S6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0089925.s008">Methods and Results S1</xref>).</p><p>The size of the cohort used to obtain our 251-gene signature was relatively small, as the collection of the samples analyzed was part of a study that was focused on defining cytokine expression differences between patients infected only with HIV and those co-infected with TB <xref rid="pone.0089925-Conradie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Thus, we did not enroll TB mono-infected patients or healthy donors. However, the datasets used to validate our TB signature do represent those populations, and the excellent performance of our signature on these large independent datasets strongly supports the validity and robustness of our 251 gene signature. It is possible that this signature could be further reduced with a larger training set, if necessary.</p><p>We realize this is only a first step in addressing a difficult area of TB diagnostics and that the major need for such diagnostics are in resource limited settings. We have shown that we could develop a 251 gene signature that improved on the previously described 393 gene signature with the possibility of further improving this signature. While array based assays used to develop this signature remain costly, we and others <xref rid="pone.0089925-Nebozhyn1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089925-Paik1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> have successfully moved array developed diagnostics to PCR based platforms which are less costly and less technically demanding. The successful application of our signature to the samples collected in Tempus RNA stabilization tubes as well as to purified PBMC supports the feasibility of collecting samples in field settings and shipping them to a central processing center for analysis. Although much more work is needed these results provide reason for optimism that such diagnostic platforms can be developed.</p><p>In conclusion, we report a 251-gene signature that accurately identifies HIV patients that are co-infected with TB. In addition, we show that this signature has broad applicability as it also identifies TB in the absence of an HIV infection. TB infection presents a number of diagnostic challenges, and this is particularly problematic when its association with HIV infection masks its more typical clinical and laboratory presentations. We believe that our signature represents a significant advance, and warrants further testing aimed at determining its impact as a diagnostic tool and/or a means to monitor response to antibacterial treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0089925.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
