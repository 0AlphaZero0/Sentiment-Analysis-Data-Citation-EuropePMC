Although the causal mutation of SCD is known, the sources of clinical variability of SCD remain poorly understood, with only a few highly heritable traits associated with SCD having been identified. Phenotypic heterogeneity in the clinical expression of SCD is problematic for follow-up (FU), management, and treatment of patients. Here we used the joint analysis of gene expression and whole genome genotyping data to identify the genetic regulatory effects contributing to gene expression variation among groups of patients exhibiting clinical variability, as well as unaffected siblings, in Benin, West Africa. We characterized and replicated patterns of whole blood gene expression variation within and between SCD patients at entry to clinic, as well as in follow-up programs. We present a global map of genes involved in the disease through analysis of whole blood sampled from the cohort. Genome-wide association mapping of gene expression revealed 390 peak genome-wide significant expression SNPs (eSNPs) and 6 significant eSNP-by-clinical status interaction effects. The strong modulation of the transcriptome implicates pathways affecting core circulating cell functions and shows how genotypic regulatory variation likely contributes to the clinical variation observed in SCD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>sickle cell disease</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>eSNP mapping</kwd><kwd>gene-by-environment interactions</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="2"/><ref-count count="42"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9288"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder particularly common among individuals of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, affecting 1 in 100 West African individuals and 1 in 500 African-Americans (World Health Organization, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Genetic mutations that cause SCD result in structural changes to wild-type hemoglobin (HbAA), the oxygen carrying protein inside red blood cells (RBCs). The most common form of SCD in West Africa is caused by a single point mutation in codon 6 of the &#x003b2;-globin gene which leads to an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid to valine (HbSS). The second most common abnormal Hb mutation in West Africa, HbC, results in an amino acid change at the same position in the beta globin gene, but with lysine replacing glutamic acid. These hemoglobin mutations compromise the delivery of oxygen and result in tissue and organ damage. Despite the monogenic origin of the disease, SCD patients exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical variation (Driss et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) ranging from patients with mild forms of the disease that rarely require medical interventions to patients with severe complications warranting frequent hospitalization and aggressive clinical follow-up. Homozygous HbSS and compound heterozygous HbSC individuals suffer from SCD with overlapping yet distinctive clinical and biochemical features (Hannemann et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Inter-individual clinical variation is also pervasive within each of these SCD groups, but its basis is poorly understood and likely reflects a combination of the effects of several factors including haplotypic variation in the &#x003b2;-globin locus region, the action of genetic modifiers elsewhere in the genome, and a wide range of environmental factors (Weatherall, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Sankaran et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Mapping genetic variants associated with SCD clinical phenotypes have largely been limited to candidate gene approaches and genome-wide association studies (Adams et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Menzel et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Lettre et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Sebastiani et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Solovieff et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Thein, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Steinberg and Sebastiani, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). One of the most characterized modulators of clinical expression of SCD is fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Higher HbF levels have been associated with reduced rates of acute pain episodes, leg ulcers, less frequent acute chest syndromes, and reduced disease severity (Akinsheye et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Heritability for HbF is high (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> approximately 0.60&#x02013;0.89) and genetic factors that control its expression have been mapped (Sankaran et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). However, HbF levels have no clear association with other SCD clinical manifestations such as stroke and silent cerebral infarction, priapism, urine albumin excretion, and systemic blood pressure (Akinsheye et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Several other genetic modifiers contributing to the variation in clinical expression of SCD have also been identified (Thein, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Steinberg and Sebastiani, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), nonetheless most of the variation remains unexplained. Since disease in general involves differential expression (Emilsson et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Cookson et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Berry et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Idaghdour et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), a systems genetics approach to map genetic variation associated with gene expression traits correlated with clinical phenotypes (Idaghdour and Awadalla, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) is likely to reveal regulatory variation modulating SCD.</p><p>We recruited HbSS and HbSC patients from a West African SCD cohort, using a two-phase sampling design, and generated a global map of gene expression variation and its genetic regulatory variation. Patients in the cohort were part of an established comprehensive clinical care program which includes an intensive socio-medical intervention program to impact the disease course (Rahimy et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The vast majority of the children in the cohort show a severe clinical phenotype at some stage of the follow-up program. We set out to establish the extent of the effects of SCD relating to the Hb genotype and clinical follow-up on whole blood gene expression profiles, and also to identify genetic regulatory variation associated with gene expression traits. Furthermore, we test the hypothesis that gene expression variation associated with the disease or in response to clinical follow-up can be dependent on patient's regulatory genotypes, which in turn may explain inter-individual differences in disease severity. In so doing, we captured new genes associated with SCD clinical variation and identified genetic regulatory effects that explain a substantial percentage of transcriptional variation in SCD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Ethics approval for the study was granted by the Sainte-Justine Research Center Ethics Committee and by the Facult&#x000e9; des Sciences de la Sant&#x000e9; of the University of Abomey-Calavi in Benin, West Africa. Informed consent was obtained for all participants in the study. Patients were part of a large cohort of SCD children longitudinally followed-up at the Centre de Prise en charge M&#x000e9;dicale Int&#x000e9;gr&#x000e9;e du Nourrisson et de la Femme Enceinte atteints de Dr&#x000e9;panocytose (CPMI-NFED), the National Institute of SCD Infants and Pregnant Women in Cotonou, The Republic of Benin. In total, 250 SCD patients aged between 6 months and 9 years old (mean age 4 years) and 61 healthy control siblings (not HbSS or HbSC and have at least one normal hemoglobin allele) were sampled under informed consent. A two-phase sampling design was used from February-December 2010 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). The initial discovery phase included patients recruited mostly before the end of April, 2010, and the replication phase included patients that were recruited mostly between April 2010 and December 2010 (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). The distribution of SCD patients newly enrolled (E) and followed (FU), Hb genotypes, and sex were proportionate in both phases. The 61 healthy siblings were of roughly equal age (mean age 3 years) and sex proportions as the SCD patients, and were also recruited at the CPMI-NFED (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SCD clinical status and severity score</title><p>The CPMI-NFED has an established comprehensive clinical care program that includes an intensive socio-medical intervention program to impact the disease course (Rahimy et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The vast majority of children in the cohort show a severe clinical phenotype. SCD patients experiencing an acute event are labeled acute (A). For the purpose of the present study, two (2) sampling clinical categories were assigned to patients: patients sampled at enrolment into the program and in steady-state are labeled as entry (E), and patients already being followed at the SCD Center were labeled as FU. At the Center, most patients that are followed obtain a steady-state condition with general clinical improvement that involves increased velocity of linear physical growth and marked reduction in the frequency and severity of SCD-related acute events; however, some followed patients experience no such improvement.</p><p>Age-matched healthy siblings were recruited as controls (Ctls). Three quarters of our Ctls are heterozygous HbAS and 1/4 are homozygous HbAA. Only 14 probes were differentially expressed between HbAA and HbAS individuals at FDR 1%. Furthermore, none of the variance in the Ctls was explained by this effect as evidenced by variance component analysis and by the lack of clustering based on Hb genotype in PCA analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>). For these reasons, we grouped HbAA and HbAS individuals and used them as a control sample.</p><p>A quantitative SCD severity score (SV) was calculated using an online SCD severity calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bu.edu/sicklecell/projects/">http://www.bu.edu/sicklecell/projects/</ext-link>) (Sebastiani et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) where each patient was assigned a score based on their sex, Hb genotype, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and white blood cell (WBC) counts. Ctls were assigned a score of 0.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The same collection procedure was followed for all samples in order to reduce technical heterogeneity. A total of 10 ml of peripheral whole blood was collected for each patient between 9:00 am and 2:00 pm and stored at &#x02212;30&#x000b0;C. Shipment to Montreal was done at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Approximately 3 ml of this blood was collected for RNA work in TEMPUS blood RNA Tubes (Life Technologies); and approximately 5 ml of this blood was collected in EDTA tubes for DNA work; the remainder of the blood was used for complete blood counts using an automated KX-21 blood analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Japan), identification of the hemoglobin phenotype by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Capillary Electrophoresis, and thick smear analysis for parasetemia quantification. Total RNA was isolated using the TEMPUS RNA extraction kit (Life Technolgies) following the manufacturer's recommendations. A globin mRNA reduction step was performed using GLOBINclear-Human kit (Life Technologies). Total RNA extractions were quantified and quality was checked using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit and 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only samples of high RNA quality (Agilent's RNA Integrity Number &#x0003e;7.5) were retained for expression profiling. DNA samples were extracted using QIAamp DNA Kit (Qiagen). Quantity and quality was checked using Agilent's DNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit and the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping the &#x003b2;-globin locus</title><p>Identification of the rs334 genotype and characterization of haplotype structure in the Hb locus was performed using Sequenom MassARRAY technology for 237 patients using 600 ng of genomic DNA and following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. Individuals with less than 75% call rate were excluded (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data sets</title><p>Four datasets were used for gene expression analyses: the discovery phase (126 SCD patients and 31 Ctls), the replication phase (124 SCD patients and 30 Ctls), combined dataset I (250 SCD patients and 61 Ctls), and combined data set II (160 SCD patients and 56 Ctls). Combined data set II includes only HbSS SCD patients excluding those sampled during acute crises. For the joint genotypic and gene expression data analyses, the combined dataset II (<italic>n</italic> = 173) included 120 SCD patients and 53 Ctls (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>, Supplementary File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression profiling</title><p>Illumina's HumanHT-12 v4 BeadArrays were used to generate expression profiles of more than 48,000 probes using 500 ng of labeled cRNA for each sample following the manufacturer's recommended protocols. All expression data are available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the series number GSE35007. The individual expression arrays are listed as GSM860207 through GSM860517. To minimize chip and batch effects, a randomized design was used. Hybridization was performed on two different dates and 4 samples from the first hybridization batch were re-hybridized with the second batch. These technical replicates clustered adjacent to one another in hierarchical analysis, indicating a negligible batch effect on the data. This was confirmed by testing for batch effect in the probe-by-probe analysis of variance. The expression intensities were averaged for each probe in the statistical analysis. The raw intensities were extracted using the Gene Expression Module in Illumina's BeadStudio software. Expression intensities were log2 transformed and quantile normalized using JMP Genomics v5.0 (SAS) after an outlier filtering procedure was applied. In total, 28,595 probes with expression at or above background levels averaged across all the arrays were retained for further analyses. These represent probes remaining after removal of 18,404 probe measurements that were considered to lay below background detection levels indicated by the inflection point in a plot of rank-ordered normalized intensities. Also, 427 probes overlaying SNPs included in the Illumina's OmniExpress BeadChip were removed from the analysis. Pathway and gene ontology analysis was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genome wide genotyping</title><p>Genome-wide genotyping data was generated for over 733,200 SNPs using Illumina's HumanOmni Express BeadChip arrays following manufacturer's protocols and extracted using the Genotyping Module in Illumina's BeadStudio software. Marker properties were calculated using PLINK (Purcell et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Only SNPs with minor allelic frequency &#x0003e;5%, a call rate &#x0003e;99% and SNPs that are in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) were included (<italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003e; 0.001). This resulted in a final set of 568,921 SNPs for further analysis. Global genotypic variation and ancestry was inferred using Eigenstrat (Price et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>); we detected limited population structure in our sample (Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S3</xref>). Insignificant population structure and limited genetic differentiation were also observed when 541 genotypes from a subset of genes known to influence hemoglobin levels (alpha-globin, G6PD, BCL11A, MYB, and HBS1L) were used in PCA and gene-wise Fst analysis to estimate the magnitude of genetic differentiation among the clinical statuses investigated and between them and the Ctls.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression data analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses of the gene expression data were performed using JMP Genomics v5.0 (SAS), and SAS 9.3 (SAS). Principal Component analysis (PCA) and Variance Component analysis (VCA) of the gene expression data were performed such that the first three expression PCs (ePCs) were modeled either simultaneously or individually as a function of various effects in the data: Hemoglobin genotype, clinical status (E vs. FU vs. Ctls), sex, and pair-wise combination of fixed effects. SAS GLM was used to evaluate the magnitude and significance of differentially expressed probes. Probe-level differential expression analysis was performed using analysis of covariance. Variance was partitioned among the Hemoglobin genotype (Hb), clinical status effect, sex, and total blood cell counts (RBCs and WBCs) as covariates. The effects of date of sampling, phase (discovery vs. replication), age (in years), and gPCs were tested and found to be marginal. Pairwise contrasts (Hb genotype &#x000d7; Sex, Hb genotype &#x000d7; ClinStatus, and ClinStatus &#x000d7; Sex) also were evaluated and found to be insignificant.

A statistical significance threshold of 1% FDR was applied separately to each term in the analysis of covariance.</p></sec><sec><title>eSNP mapping</title><p>Multiple linear regression analyses were performed using PLINK to test for significant associations between gene expression levels for each probe and SNP genotype. Only well-annotated, autosomal probes with validated chromosomal location and gene function based on the most recent annotation in NCBI and UCSC as of October 2011 were included for the association tests. In the process we aligned all probes to the reference genome (hg19), excluded ambiguous and all non-RefSeq probes, and removed 427 probes overlaying known SNPs from the analysis. This resulted in a total of 19,431 expressed probes that were tested for association with 560,675 SNPs. SNPs with a minor allelic frequency &#x0003c;5%, an exact HWE <italic>P</italic>-value &#x0003c; 0.001, or &#x0003e;1% missing data were excluded. We distinguished between local and distal associations based on the chromosomal location of the probe-SNP pair; a local association implicates a probe and a SNP located on the same chromosome while a distal association implicates a probe and a SNP located on different chromosomes.

In the discovery phase (<italic>n</italic> = 157), unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the genome-wide gene expression correlation matrix revealed that individual gene expression profiles cluster largely according to Hb genotype, SCD SV, and clinical status (E vs. FU vs. Ctls; Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B</xref>). PCA revealed the presence of strong correlation structure in the data such that the first three expression principal components (ePC1-3) explain over a third of the total variance (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>). VCA of the first three ePCs further confirms the substantial effect of Hb genotype (explaining 45.6% of the variance) followed by clinical status (explaining 7% of the variance) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Variance of ePC1 was explained primarily by Hb genotype (&#x0003e;70%) while ePC2 and 3 were dominated by the effect of clinical status, explaining 20% of the variance of each PC; sex and interaction effects had negligible effects on the variance (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S4</xref>). Repeating this analysis with only SCD patients (<italic>n</italic> = 126) revealed that a third of the variance (31%) was captured by the first three ePCs, with Hb genotype and the FU effect explaining 19.5 and 8.6% of the variance, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sickle cell disease impacts gene expression genome-wide.

Given that a fraction of the variation in ePCs is likely due to differences in the proportion of cell types between SCD patients, we performed a probe-by-probe analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the discovery sample that accounts for total blood cell counts (RBC and WBC counts), in addition to sex, and genetic ethnicity using individuals' scores at significant genotypic PC axes (see Materials and Methods for details). This analysis revealed significant differences between SCD patients (E and FU) and Ctls with a quarter of the transcriptome being differentially expressed for the 3-way clinical status effect at 1% False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S5</xref>).

HbSC individuals were excluded from this analysis given their small sample size relative to the HbSS group. SCD patients undergoing an acute event were also excluded to focus on the steady state of the disease. An ANCOVA of this dataset accounting for sex and total cell counts revealed that over seven thousand probes were significantly differentially expressed (1% FDR) for the clinical status effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and 739 probes for the FU effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The effect of clinical status is visually shown in a heat map generated using a 2-way hierarchical clustering of per-group mean expression levels of differentially expressed probes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The supervised and unsupervised gene expression analysis of both the discovery and replication samples documented the relative contribution of Hb genotype and clinical status to the transcriptional variation observed in a West African SCD cohort and characterized the effects taking place after clinical follow-up.

We focused on gene sets with Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) greater than 0.25 in either E or FU relative to the Ctls as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. This analysis showed that the strong modulation of the transcriptome implicates pathways affecting core circulating cell functions. A strong activation of pathways associated with B-lymphocytes development, stress (glucocorticoid, interferon and oxidative phosphorylation associated pathways) and cell proliferation in E compared to the FU group was observed. We also note a significant up-regulation of genes specific to platelet function and erythrocyte membrane in SCD individuals relative to the control and to a lesser extent in FU relative to the E group.</p></sec><sec><title>The genetic architecture of transcript abundance in SCD</title><p>The genetic architecture of transcript abundance in SCD was investigated through genome-wide association analysis of gene expression traits in SCD patients and Ctls.

The expression data for the combined dataset was re-normalized in order to minimize potential batch effects, resulting in a final set of 19,431 probes tested against 560,675 SNP genotypes using multiple regression analyses and applying Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. For local associations, the genome-wide significance threshold corresponds to testing on average 200 SNPs against each probe. For distal associations, each probe was tested against each of the 560,675 SNPs. We ran a model that accounted for participant clinical status (E, FU, and Ctls), total blood cell counts (RBS, WBC), and sex (Model 1, see Materials and Methods). Three hundred and ninety genome-wide significant peak SNP-probe associations were identified corresponding to 371 local and 19 distal effects (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

We first identified the extent of gene expression variation in SCD patients that is explained by clinical phenotypes and measured the magnitude and significance of gene expression differences for SCD clinical status in an initial discovery phase. The unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiles shows that SCD has substantial influence on the human transcriptome, explaining over a third of the total variance, followed by Hb genotype and SCD clinical status. Significant differences in gene expression profiles between SCD clinical status and Ctls were also observed, with over a quarter of the transcriptome being differentially expressed. We replicated these findings in a replication cohort.</p><p>Using GSEA, we identified and replicated biological pathways involved in the clinical course of SCD. This analysis shows that the strong modulation of the transcriptome implicates pathways affecting core circulating cell functions. Enrichment analysis also showed that several biological pathways previously reported to be associated with SCD (Jison et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) are subject to differential expression between the three clinical groups. Furthermore, we observed strong activation of pathways associated with B-lymphocyte development, stress and cell proliferation in the E compared to the FU group. Enrichment of genes that were uniquely differentiated between the E and FU patients identified a significant up-regulation in B-lymphocytes expressing phosphorylated CD5, B-cell Receptor Signaling and upstream regulation of B-cells by PAX5. PAX5 expression has been shown to increase the quantity and the commitment of B cells (Horcher et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). These observations reflect perturbed cellular profiles in the E groups and more stable profiles after clinical FU. Furthermore, markers of mitosis, cell cycle and DNA synthesis were identified in the analysis on combined data set II and likely suggest a more stable state of blood cells in the FU group in general. The strong interferon related signature also suggests a more perturbed and potentially more pathogenic state of blood cells prior to clinical follow-up. The overexpression of activated B lymphocyte markers in the E group tends to point in that same direction. Previous studies have shown that changes in B cell function occurs during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in patients with SCD (Venkataraman and Westerman, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Thus, follow-up of SCD patients may act on these pathways. We also note a significant up-regulation of genes specific to platelet function and erythrocyte membrane in SCD individuals relative to the control group and to a lesser extent in FU relative to the E group. Activation of platelets in SCD patients was previously associated with clinical complications such as vasculopathy (Raghavachari et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension (Villagra et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). We observed a strong inflammatory response signature in Acute patients consistent with the processes induced during SCD crises events such as VOC (Musa et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>We characterized the genetic architecture of transcript abundance in SCD patients and Ctls and identified 390 genome-wide significant peak SNP-probe associations. Four genes that are associated with an eSNP were previously associated with SCD phenotypes in reported association studies (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Almost half of the eSNP genes (150 eSNP genes) that we identified overlapped with previously reported significant eQTL associations (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S1</xref>). Out of these, 58 were exact SNP-gene eSNP pairs. The overlap between our distal eSNP associations and those published in a recent paper that examined the effects of trans eQTLs as putative drivers of disease (Westra et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) identified three distal eSNPs (rs11171739, rs10493008, and rs6489721) in our SCD cohort that were also associated with genes in complex traits. Although the SNP-gene associations in our study were not exact matches with those reported in the (Westra et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) paper, it is possible that these 3 trans eSNPs are drivers for SCD related phenotypes.</p><p>Differential expression analysis revealed thousands of genes differentially expressed between clinical categories. We identified 11 eSNP interaction effects that are dependent on clinical status for this class of genes, six of which remained genome-wide significant after accounting for relatedness in the entire sample using a Q-K mixed model: <italic>ZSCAN12L1</italic>, <italic>C9ORF173</italic>, <italic>CAPZA1</italic>, <italic>SVIL</italic>, <italic>MEF2A</italic>, and <italic>C1ORF88</italic>. These genes represent novel SCD associations, form an interacting network generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com">www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>) (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S8</xref>) and have some overlapping clinical manifestations, particularly with respect to cardiovascular disease.</p><p>For example, <italic>CAPZA1</italic>, capping protein (actin filament) muscle Z-line alpha 1, is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the alpha subunit of the barbed-end actin binding protein (Kuhlman and Fowler, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). <italic>CAPZA1</italic> has recently been associated with blood pressure variation in a meta-analysis of GWAS (Kato et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In our study, we see an interaction between cis-acting eSNP rs768000 and clinical status such that SCD patients with the minor allele have higher expression of <italic>CAPZA1</italic> when they are followed-up. The <italic>SVIL</italic> gene encodes isoforms of supervillin, a protein that has been associated with KIRD2DL that regulates the inhibitory signal of natural killer cells that recognize MHC class I molecules (Liu et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Recently, a study suggested an inhibitory role for SVIL in platelet adhesion and arterial thrombosis using human GWAS and mice knockout approaches (Edelstein et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Edelstein et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) identified that platelets express <italic>SVIL</italic>; platelet thrombus formation is associated with human <italic>SVIL</italic> variants and low <italic>SVIL</italic> expression. We show a local association between <italic>SVIL</italic> gene expression and a SNP on chromosome 10, rs11013210. In our study, Ctls have a significant increase in <italic>SVIL</italic> gene expression when they have the minor allele for the SNP rs11013210. Finally, the <italic>MEF2A</italic> gene encodes a protein that is a DNA-binding transcription factor that activates many muscle-specific, growth factor-induced, and stress-induced genes (Zhao et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Defects in this gene have been associated with autosomal dominant coronary artery disease 1 with myocardial infarction (Liu et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). <italic>MEF2A</italic> affects the proliferation, migration and phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (Zhao et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Papait et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In our samples, we see a local association between <italic>MEF2A</italic> gene expression and SNP rs10400870 genotype on chromosome 15 that is dependent on clinical status. Ctls have a significant increase in <italic>MEF2A</italic> gene expression when they have the minor allele for rs10400870.</p><p>In an attempt to estimate the contribution of the genetically controlled fraction of transcript abundance on the association between expression traits and clinical FU categories, we compared the effect of clinical status on global gene expression before and after conditioning for the eSNP effect on transcript abundance. To run this test we used the combined dataset II (focusing on the SNP effect and ClinStatus within the HbSS group) and applied it to all expressed genes. We used a full ANCOVA model with and without the SNP effect and applied the same stringent filtering criteria as described for the analyses above. We extracted <italic>p</italic>-values for the ClinStatus effect for all the genes and contrasted the two models. This comparison revealed overall a relatively high degree of correlation (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S9</xref>) suggesting that quantitatively most of the transcriptional signal differentiating the clinical categories is robust. However and as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">S9</xref>, we observe a global shift in the significance values toward lower values once genotypic effects are accounted for. To further show this trend, we limited our comparison to genes differentially expressed at Bonferroni level for the ClinStatus effect in at least one of the two tested models (<italic>n</italic> = 2188 genes). After fitting the genotype effect on each of these genes, 41% (<italic>n</italic> = 905) remain significant for the ClinStatus effect and 58% (<italic>n</italic> = 1275) are no longer significant. It is also worth noting that directionality of the effect between the two models was consistent for all tested genes. Moreover and as expected, our top interacting genes (based on <italic>p</italic>-values for the SNP &#x000d7; ClinStatus interaction effect) were among the list of genes that were subject to the highest drop in statistical significance for association with ClinStatus after fitting the eSNP effect. Taken together, these results suggest that transcript abundance of over half of expressed genes associated with clinical follow-up is under significant regulatory genetic effect.</p><p>Using eQTL approaches, transcriptional genotype-by-environment interactions have previously been reported in humans (Smirnov et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Romanoski et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Barreiro et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Idaghdour et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) but mostly using <italic>in vitro</italic> systems (with the exception of Idaghdour et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Here we demonstrate the existence of these effects <italic>in vivo</italic> in SCD. The genes implicated in these interactions show differential eSNP effects depending on SCD follow-up status. These interactions show how the genetic control of gene expression through allelic variation is likely to impact processes implicated in the response to SCD as well as to clinical follow-up programs.</p><p>In summary, using a two-stage sampling design, we identified and replicated a strong transcriptional signature of the effect of follow-up in SCD patients that implicates core biological pathways involved in the pathobiology of the disease. We have provided a genome-wide picture of regulatory variation <italic>in vivo</italic> in SCD patients and highlighted genotype-by-clinical status interaction effects that likely contribute to the clinical heterogeneity observed in SCD patients including those enrolled in SCD clinical follow-up programs. These results further our understanding of the transcriptional events occurring in SCD patients and their genetic regulatory control. The genetic and transcriptional markers reported here can potentially guide follow-up programs. These markers detected in whole blood, a readily and ethically accessible source of biological material in children, will be particularly useful in populations where the disease is most prevalent.</p></sec><sec><title>Accession numbers</title><p>All expression data are available at NCBI GEO under the series number GSE35007.
