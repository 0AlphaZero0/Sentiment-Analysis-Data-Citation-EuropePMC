Current BCG vaccine provides good protection against severe childhood TB, but is less useful in the prevention of adult TB because of its protection provided against TB in adults is very variable <xref rid="pone.0092340-Tuberculosis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Colditz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition to effective vaccines, a rapid and accurate diagnosis test for active TB will prompt early treatment and reduce transmission thereby facilitating TB control. Unfortunately, the available diagnostic tests have significant shortcomings, such as lack of sensitivity and specificity <xref rid="pone.0092340-Dorman1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This is particularly problematic in the settings of extra-pulmonary, sputum-smear negative and pediatric TB. To overcome these shortcomings, an Interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) release assays (IGRAs) has been developed to identify individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) <xref rid="pone.0092340-Lalvani1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Losi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Metcalfe1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, meta-analysis showed that IGRAs had limited power in distinguishing active TB from LTBI, although it was useful for identifying subjects with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection from those without infection <xref rid="pone.0092340-Denkinger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Mazurek1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As a consequence, identification of biomarkers that can accurately distinguish individuals with active TB from LTBI has been designated an important research priority in TB research <xref rid="pone.0092340-Wallis1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Complement functions as an important host defense system that senses danger signals triggered by pathogen- and host tissue damage-associated pattern molecules <xref rid="pone.0092340-Benoit1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Nayak1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Bohlson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

However, little is known about the role of other complement components in TB.</p><p>C1q is a 460-kDa protein composed of 18 polypeptide chains (6A, 6B and 6C). C1q is synthesized by monocyte/macrophage lineage <xref rid="pone.0092340-CortesHernandez1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Petry1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, DCs <xref rid="pone.0092340-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, microglia <xref rid="pone.0092340-Korotzer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and other cell types <xref rid="pone.0092340-Maeda1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Macrophages are abundant in tissues and are probably the major source of blood C1q <xref rid="pone.0092340-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is reported that the microbial factors and inflammatory cytokines can regulate C1q production. LPS, peptidoglycan (PGN), zymosan, IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 increase but IL-1 inhibits C1q production by macrophages <xref rid="pone.0092340-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A classical function of C1q is to initiate complement activation <xref rid="pone.0092340-Reid1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Besides complement activation, C1q has been recently recognized to have versatile non-complement activation functions <xref rid="pone.0092340-Nayak1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is reported that C1q can modulate dendritic cell maturation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and T- and B-cell responses <xref rid="pone.0092340-Nayak1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Castellano1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Heeger1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Son1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. In a recent report comparing whole blood microarray data from LTBI and TB patients C1q mRNA was differentially expressed <xref rid="pone.0092340-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To investigate the role of C1q in human TB, we have defined the mRNA and protein expression pattern of C1q in the peripheral blood and the site of infection. We report that elevated C1q expression is strongly associated with active TB disease and disease severity. C1q is highly enriched at the site of disease compared to the peripheral blood. More importantly, C1qC is a useful biomarker for diagnosis of active TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This work received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen Third People's Hospital.

Each cohort consists of active tuberculosis patients and controls recruited for the comparison; the detailed demographic characteristics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0092340-t001">Table 1</xref>. Diagnosis of active TB was based on clinical symptoms, chest radiography, microscopy for acid fast bacilli (AFB), sputum Mtb culture and response to anti-TB chemotherapy. All sputum specimens were digested and decontaminated of other bacteria by the standard N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH-sodium citrate method. An aliquot of the specimen was used for microscopical examination of Ziehl-Neelsen stained smears and the remainder was used for parallel testing with BACTEC TB 960 culture system as per the manufacturer's instructions. Sputum samples were classified according to the highest number of AFB per specimen. Previously established Mtb specific IGRAs were used to differentiate individuals with LTBI from healthy controls without infection <xref rid="pone.0092340-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The diagnosis of TB pleurisy was based on pleural fluid and/or biopsy cultures or on observation of granulomatous inflammation in pleural biopsy tissue. The non-TB pleurisy group included 11 malignant effusions (lung cancer), 14 transudates caused by liver cirrhosis, and 2 empyema. All TB patients were recruited prior to anti-TB chemotherapy treatment and some of them were follow-up after anti-TB chemotherapy treatment for C1q dynamic assays. Heparinized whole blood was collected by venipuncture from the populations mentioned above, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from some active TB patients, and pleural fluid samples were collected from patients with pleural effusion.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0092340-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0092340.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The demographic characteristics of the study populations.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0092340-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0092340.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study cohort</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Median age in years (range)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">AFB-positive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELISPOT Positive</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microarray set</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TB</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt101">a</xref>

However, the biological and clinical significance of these findings has up to now not been investigated. In our studies we confirmed using microarray data that active TB was associated with an elevated C1q expression. In addition and expanding upon previous work we validated this difference in expression using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. We then looked the association further and showed that C1q expression in the blood decreased following anti-TB chemotherapy. We also show here that TB pleurisy was associated with a higher level of C1qC in pleural effusion than was seen in non-TB pleurisy. Together, these findings strongly support the concept that C1q measurement could assist in identifying patients with active TB and also in disease prognosis following treatment.</p><p>Recently, several host molecules have been suggested as tools to discriminate active TB from LTBI <xref rid="pone.0092340-Walzl1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. A whole-blood 86-transcriptional signature which is dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon-inducible gene profile has been reported to distinguish active TB from other diseases with a specificity of 83% <xref rid="pone.0092340-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

While our study also found an increase in the expression of some interferon inducible genes as well as FCGR1B and CD64 (data not shown), the ROC analysis revealed that C1qC mRNA expression alone in PBMC can distinguish active TB from HC with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 89%, and active TB from LTBI with a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 82%, respectively. These findings suggest that in addition to interferon-inducible genes, an elevated C1q is strongly associated with active TB disease and could be used to discriminate active TB from LTBI. Novel molecular diagnostic approaches with the combination of these gene signatures may significantly improve our ability to identify active TB cases.</p><p>Maertzdorf <italic>et al</italic>. reported an increase in C1qA and C1qB, but not C1qC, in patients with active TB <xref rid="pone.0092340-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, the difference in mRNA expression between active TB and LTBI groups determined by microarray was moderate (2&#x02013;3 fold) and importantly, its potential in discriminating active TB from LTBI was not evaluated <xref rid="pone.0092340-Maertzdorf1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. We found in this current study that C1qC is the most differentially expressed gene among the three C1q components. The reasons underlying the difference are currently unknown. In addition to donor ethnic background, we suspect that the difference in cell populations used (whole blood vs. PBMC) might have contributed to the discrepancy. Compared to whole blood used in the previous study, PBMC preparation used here are known to contain significantly more monocytes and less neutrophil <xref rid="pone.0092340-Castano1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Experiments are now underway in our laboratory to examine the expression of C1q in various leukocyte populations.</p><p>Importantly, our longitudinal study indicated that the level of C1q in PBMC could be used to monitor the efficacy of anti-TB chemotherapy. A previous paper showed that C1q mRNA expression diminished as early as 1 week after treatment <xref rid="pone.0092340-Cliff1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Our kinetic study has extended the finding and demonstrated that C1q mRNA expression progressively declined through the course of treatment and was completely extinguished by 6 months. In contrast, plasma C1q protein took longer and returned to background level by 12 months after treatment. These observations suggested that C1q mRNA analysis may be more sensitive than protein measurement in monitoring the outcome anti-TB treatment.</p><p>In a substantial development we found that the C1q level in pleural effusion and BALF of TB patients is significantly higher than that of non-TB patients, suggesting that C1q is highly enriched at sites of active TB disease. It remains unclear however whether C1q is produced locally at the inflammatory sites or systemically in organs like the liver. Nevertheless, the observation raises the possibility that C1q may actively contribute to the regulation of the inflammation in active TB. Indeed, locally synthesized C1q has been reported to act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to control microglial activation and recruitment through regulating the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0092340-Farber1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Inhibition of inflammation at early stage gives Mtb a breathing space to initiate a productive infection and therefore cause disease <xref rid="pone.0092340-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. To do this, Mtb has developed strategies to inhibit macrophage activation <xref rid="pone.0092340-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Cambier1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. For example, it has been recently reported that pathogenic mycobacteria use cell-surface-associated phthiocerol dimycoceroserate lipids to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns and therefore preventing Toll-like receptor pathway mediated activation of macrophage <xref rid="pone.0092340-Cambier1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. In addition, it has been reported that intranasal Poly-IC treatment exacerbates tuberculosis in mice through the pulmonary recruitment of a pathogen-permissive monocyte/macrophage population, which were not fully activated and displayed impaired control of Mtb <xref rid="pone.0092340-Antonelli1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. On the other hand, macrophage also plays important role in protective immunity against Mtb as the cell is responsible for both killing the bacteria directly and priming immune response by antigen presentation <xref rid="pone.0092340-Abebe1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>.

This is important because similar to IL-6 and CRP, increased C1q level has been reported during other inflammatory conditions <xref rid="pone.0092340-Mutoloki1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0092340-Merchant1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that the C1qC level in pleural effusion of TB patients is significantly higher than in non-TB patients (non-inflammatory diseases).

Nevertheless, to formally establish a role for C1q in differential diagnosis of active TB, we will in future recruit individuals with active TB and non-TB lung disease and compare their C1q levels.</p><p>Although in this study we have clearly demonstrated the important value of C1q in diagnosing active human TB, it remains unclear if the molecule plays a role in controlling host resistance and inflammatory response to Mtb. The precise functions of C1q in TB immunopathology and disease progression warrant further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Xingshu Zhang, Wanshui Shan, Puxuan Lu, and Kai Luo for their assistance in performing experiments and patient recruitment.
