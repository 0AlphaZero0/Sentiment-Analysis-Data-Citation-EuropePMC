Since natural infections induce a longer-lasting immunity than vaccinations, detailed knowledge of the immune responses following natural infection can provide important clues for such improvement. The purpose was to elucidate the kinetics of the protective immune response evolving after experimental <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> (<italic>B. pertussis</italic>) infection in mice. Data were collected from (i) individual analyses, i.e. microarray, flow cytometry, multiplex immunoassays, and bacterial clearance; (ii) twelve time points during the infection; and (iii) different tissues involved in the immune responses, i.e. lungs, spleen and blood. Combined data revealed detailed insight in molecular and cellular sequence of events connecting different phases (innate, bridging and adaptive) of the immune response following the infection. We detected a prolonged acute phase response, broad pathogen recognition, and early gene signatures of subsequent T-cell recruitment in the lungs. Activation of particular transcription factors and specific cell markers provided insight into the time course of the transition from innate towards adaptive immune responses, which resulted in a broad spectrum of systemic antibody subclasses and splenic Th1/Th17 memory cells against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>. In addition, signatures preceding the local generation of Th1 and Th17 cells as well as IgA in the lungs, considered key elements in protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, were established. In conclusion, molecular and cellular immunological processes in response to live <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection were unraveled, which may provide guidance in selecting new vaccine candidates that should evoke local and prolonged protective immune responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="24"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

Whole cell and acellular vaccines have drastically decreased the number of cases <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mattoo1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, recently resurgence of pertussis in the vaccinated population has been observed in the USA <xref rid="pone.0104548-Cherry1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Baxter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and in European countries <xref rid="pone.0104548-Celentano1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kretzschmar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Currently pertussis is still endemic, ranking in the top-ten of vaccine preventable diseases worldwide, according to the WHO. Next to improved diagnostics and public awareness, also strain adaptation and waning immunity are thought to be responsible for this increase in disease cases <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mooi1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Thus, a call for vaccines with improved efficacy is evident.</p><p>As a main feature of the innate immune response upon <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in mice the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4 has been acknowledged <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mann1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This activation of TLR4 by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> leads to up-regulation of cytokine gene expression and recruitment of neutrophils into the lungs <xref rid="pone.0104548-Banus2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Moreno1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It was found in animal models that <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection results in formation of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Since immunity induced by natural infections provides faster clearance upon reinfection and is longer lasting compared to both acellular and whole cell pertussis vaccination <xref rid="pone.0104548-Wendelboe1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, immune mechanisms induced upon infection or vaccination have been compared. In human and murine studies, immunization with whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines results predominantly in a Th1 or a Th2 response, respectively <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ausiello1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, in both the intramuscular (human) or subcutaneous (mice) administered acellular and whole cell pertussis vaccines, the humoral response is characterized by systemic IgG <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mills2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Canthaboo1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, while mucosal immune responses seem absent. Despite the absence of direct evidence for correlates of protection against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, both Th1 and Th17 type CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells as well as IgA-producing B-cells seem to play an important role in a protective immune response against <italic>B. pertussis</italic>

Since these responses are not induced by the currently available vaccines <xref rid="pone.0104548-Hendrikx1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but more resemble responses induced by infection, a better understanding of the immune response induced in the host following <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection is needed. Despite knowledge on particular elements of the immune response generated by a <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection, little is known about the kinetics and sequential relation of these elements. For this, systems biology can be an important tool, as was shown for tuberculosis and influenza infection <xref rid="pone.0104548-Brandes1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Berry1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Here, systems biology was applied to elucidate molecular and cellular events in the different phases of the immune response after primary <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in a murine model. To this end, innate and adaptive immune responses were investigated over a period of 66 days post infection. Gene expression profiles in spleen and lungs, cytokine profiles in sera, and cellular composition of the spleen were determined at twelve time points. Furthermore, cellular and antibody mediated immune responses against <italic>B. pertussis</italic> were investigated. Herewith, we revealed a chronological cascade of immunological processes consisting of recognition, processing, presentation and clearance of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>.

Therefore, mice were intranasally infected with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> using a dose of 10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (cfu). Approximately 13% of the intranasal dose was traceable in the lungs of mice 2 hours p.i. The number of bacteria remained fairly constant for one day, and increased from the second day to a maximum 7 days p.i. (10<sup>7</sup> cfu). Subsequently, a decrease in the number of bacteria was observed and complete clearance in 2 out of 3 mice was achieved 28 days p.i. To determine whether single intranasal infection with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> leads to protection, mice were reinfected 56 days after primary infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Especially DAP12, which is abundantly expressed in lungs, interacts with other membrane receptors and influences cytokine expression <xref rid="pone.0104548-Aoki1" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>.

Together with TREM2, DAP12 down-regulates TLR and FcR expression <xref rid="pone.0104548-Hamerman1" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Overall, these former receptors function as an important bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses, determining the strength and direction of the adaptive immune response by the successive activation of lymphocytes, such as CTLs, Th-cells, and B-cells <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kikutani1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Takagi1" ref-type="bibr">[88]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104548-Nimmerjahn1" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>.

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g008">8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g010">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g012">12</xref>). Data from this study suggests generation of local specific Th1/Th17 cells in the lungs. Th1 cells, which produce IFN&#x003b3; are important for clearance of <italic>B. pertussis</italic>. Postponed clearance was shown in IFN&#x000e3;-depleted mice <xref rid="pone.0104548-Barbic1" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>. Th17 cells have been indicated as key cells to control bacterial infections at mucosal sites <xref rid="pone.0104548-Khader1" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>. Recent studies revealed that Th17 cells increase the clearance of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> after an intranasal infection in animals <xref rid="pone.0104548-Ross1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Fedele1" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>.</p><p>Infection with <italic>B. pertussis</italic> induces also B-cell and antibody mediated immunity. Microarray analysis showed increased gene expression of the BCR in the lungs. In addition, gene expression of IgM, IgG and IgA was observed in lungs and spleen. Whereas, most genes for antibody isotypes were found up-regulated in both tissues, IgM was down-regulated in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g010">10</xref>). This was confirmed by the detection of IgA and IgG (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) after 14 days p.i. However, IgM antibodies were not found systemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g011">Figure 11</xref>). In mice, IgG1 is associated with a Th2-like response, while IgG2a (in Balb/c mice) and IgG2b suggest induction of a Th1 response <xref rid="pone.0104548-Benjamini1" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. IgG2b is also linked to Th17 lymphocytes <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mitsdoerffer1" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>. All antibody responses in the present study were directed against whole cell <italic>B. pertussis</italic> and outer membrane vesicles, but not against the <italic>B. pertussis</italic> antigens that are typically present in acellular vaccines: Ptx, Prn, FHA and Fim2/3. However, memory Th1/Th17 cells were detected upon re-stimulation with Prn and FHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) was highly expressed during the whole course of <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in the lungs. pIgR is essential for the transport of IgA into the mucus and is seen as a bridge between innate and adaptive mucosal responses <xref rid="pone.0104548-Norderhaug1" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Kaetzel1" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref>. The expression of pIgR was drastically enhanced 14 days p.i., leading to secretion of mucosal IgA in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g011">11</xref>). Interestingly, the increased pIgR expression coincided with IL-17A production in the lungs and sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104548-g007">7</xref>), which is in agreement with the finding that Th17-mediated responses influence the local humoral response by inducing pIgR expression and elevating secretory IgA levels <xref rid="pone.0104548-Jaffar1" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. Therefore, the transport of IgA to the mucosa, which is orchestrated by IL-17A via the induction of pIgR, supports an important role for local immunity. In summary, <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection induces a broad humoral response, which was observed by gene and protein expression.</p><p>Our study also contains several conceptual points for discussion. First, altered gene expression in the spleen caused by <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection was modest, except for 21 days p.i. Two possible reasons can be given: (i) the infection initiated a local immune response in the lungs and (ii) gene expression is required to be rather strong to exceed the significance threshold. After the lungs and the draining lymph nodes, the spleen is the third organ in line involved in the generation of the immune response. Therefore, gene expression effects could be less abundant. Furthermore, the spleen consists of many cell types with different gene expression profiles, so changes in expression levels in a single cell type might not have been detected. Cell sorting of individual cell types and subsequent gene expression profiling could overcome this problem. Second, specific antibody and T-cell responses were only measured for a limited set of available purified antigens. The inclusion of other antigens, such as outer membrane proteins, would perhaps have allowed a more detailed analysis. Third, in this study we propose murine infection-induced immune signatures as a benchmark to be used in the development of improved human pertussis vaccines. Since <italic>B. pertussis</italic> is not a natural pathogen for mice, translation of the results obtained in this study to the human situation remains to be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, using a (naive) murine model has several advantages. It is regarded an important small animal model for pertussis vaccine development <xref rid="pone.0104548-vanderArk1" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref> and enables to dissect the local and systemic immune response in great detail, as shown in this study, rather than using blood or nasal washes from humans undergoing a <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection. Furthermore, the role of individual gene signatures and products could be assessed in future research in mice by using knockin or knockout strains, or by functional interventions. Encouraging is that many observations made in this study, such as the rapid clearance upon reinfection and involvement of Th17 and Th1 responses, are in line with recent studies on <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection in baboons, which resemble the human situation more closely <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104548-Warfel2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Translation of biomarkers from mouse to man however should be performed with care.</p><p>Overall, our study describes the molecular and cellular sequence of events that eventually lead to the induction of protective immunity to pertussis, including local immunity in the lungs, which is not induced by current vaccines. Especially the inductions of Th1 and Th17 cells and IgA in the lungs are regarded key elements in superior immunity. Our data can be used to select vaccine concepts that resemble infection, with respect to e.g. administration route and prolonged antigen exposure, and immune signatures elicited. Local delivery of vaccines may be an important advancement for improved protection as was previously demonstrated with a live attenuated pertussis vaccine <xref rid="pone.0104548-Mielcarek1" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. Also adjuvants could be selected and optimized that can steer host immunity of inactivated vaccines towards an infection-like immune response with minimal adverse effects. The molecular and cellular fingerprint of the local immune response discovered in <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infected mice thus can provide a strong guidance for developing improved pertussis vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The independent ethical committee for animal experimentations &#x02018;Dierexperiment Commissie (DEC)&#x02019; of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) reviewed the animal experiments in this study according to the guidelines provided by the Dutch Animal Protection Act.

To determine the number and identity of cells, three different panels of labeled antibodies were used to prevent overlapping fluorescence spectra. Panels consisted of 1) total T-cell population (CD3), CD4 T-cell (CD4), CD8 T-cell (CD8), early activated T-cell (CD69), and neutrophil (Gr-1); 2) T-cell (CD3), B-cell (CD19), monocyte (CD14), and natural killer cell (DX5); 3) T-cell (CD3), macrophage (CD11b), DC (33D1, CD11c), MHC class II (IA/IE), and activation marker (CD40). Data acquisition was performed with a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences, USA) and data analysis was done by using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., USA). Debris and dead cells were excluded by using forward/side scatter characteristics and live/dead staining, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4o"><title>Stimulation of splenocytes</title><p>Splenocytes were resuspended in the culture medium IMDM (Gibco) +8% FCS+p/s/g +20 &#x000b5;M &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and cultured (24-wells plate; 6&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) for 7 days at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
