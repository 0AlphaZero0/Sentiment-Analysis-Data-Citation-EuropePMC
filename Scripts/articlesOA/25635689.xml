Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are emerging as key effectors of tissue destruction in TB but have not been comprehensively studied in plasma, nor have gender differences been investigated. We measured the plasma concentrations of MMPs in a carefully characterised, prospectively recruited clinical cohort of 380 individuals. The collagenases, MMP-1 and MMP-8, were elevated in plasma of patients with pulmonary TB relative to healthy controls, and MMP-7 (matrilysin) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B) were also increased. MMP-8 was TB-specific (p&#x0003c;0.001), not being elevated in symptomatic controls (symptoms suspicious of TB but active disease excluded). Plasma MMP-8 concentrations inversely correlated with body mass index. Plasma MMP-8 concentration was 1.51-fold higher in males than females with TB (p&#x0003c;0.05) and this difference was not due to greater disease severity in men. Gender-specific analysis of MMPs demonstrated consistent increase in MMP-1 and -8 in TB, but MMP-8 was a better discriminator for TB in men. Plasma collagenases are elevated in pulmonary TB and differ between men and women. Gender must be considered in investigation of TB immunopathology and development of novel diagnostic markers.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>TS was funded by an MRC and GS by a Wellcome Clinical Research training fellowship.

Multidrug resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB cases are rising [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and &#x0201c;totally drug-resistant TB&#x0201d; has been reported in Iran, India and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To develop new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, it is critical to understand underlying mechanisms of disease. Pulmonary tissue damage is characteristic of tuberculosis and is a consequence of immunopathology driven by the host response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic>. Pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown and subsequent cavitation results in morbidity, mortality [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and facilitates transmission [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. TB is more common in males than females, with a 1.9-fold excess in case notification globally, which may result from both sociological and biological factors [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, although some evidence of biological differences in TB between men and women exists, this has historically been overlooked by the field [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteases able to degrade all components of the pulmonary extracellular matrix [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and therefore are implicated in the pathology of cavitary pulmonary TB [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Accumulating evidence implicates the MMPs in tissue destruction in TB, in particular MMP-1 driving collagenolysis [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and MMP-9 regulating cellular recruitment to the granuloma [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. MMP-8 and MMP-9 are principally derived from neutrophils and are contained within granules [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase) can degrade collagen and has been implicated in other destructive lung pathologies [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Neutrophils are relatively unique in that they store pre-synthesised MMP-8, and neutrophils are emerging as key pathological mediators at the time of TB diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Circulating MMPs have not previously been systematically investigated in TB, in particular including the important control group of respiratory symptomatics (patients with symptoms suspicious of TB but sputum culture negative). MMPs are most appropriately analysed in plasma samples [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and concentrations have been reported to differ between men and women [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of circulating inflammatory mediators in TB, such as cytokines and chemokines, in plasma and serum to define underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis has generally shown surprisingly small differences between patients with TB and control groups [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, these investigations generally do not consider gender differences [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We hypothesised that MMPs, as final effectors of immunopathology in TB, may identify greater divergence between groups. We analysed plasma concentrations of MMPs in a prospectively collected cohort of 380 patients with active tuberculosis, healthy controls, and the key comparator group of respiratory symptomatics. We demonstrate that circulating collagenases are elevated in TB, further implicating collagenase activity in driving immune-mediated tissue damage, and identify MMP-8 as a novel marker of TB compared to other respiratory infections. MMP-8 concentrations are higher in men than women with TB, highlighting a previously overlooked potential confounder in the investigation of TB pathology and assessment of novel diagnostic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All participants gave written informed consent and the research was approved by internationally accredited ethics committees at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (Lima, Peru) and Imperial College London (London, United Kingdom).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design</title><p>SELDI-TOF proteomic analyses of a subset of these plasma samples along with baseline clinical characteristics of those patients have previously been reported [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Participants were recruited over a 2 year period from 16 community TB clinics serving the shantytown of Ventanilla in Lima, Peru. The clinical management of patients was not altered from the standardised regime, and all patients provided four consecutive sputum samples for microscopy and culture. Patients with active TB were recruited on the basis of positive sputum microscopy with subsequent confirmation by culture. Symptomatic controls were those who had symptoms suspicious of TB (persistent cough and 2 or more features from fever, weight loss, decreased appetite or haemoptysis) but in whom active TB was subsequently excluded by sputum microscopy and negative sputum culture. This group was deemed to have an alternative respiratory infection and described as &#x0201c;respiratory symptomatics&#x0201d;. Healthy controls were recruited from randomly selected households in the community where patients with active TB were not resident. Informed consent was given by or on behalf of all participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Sample collection</title><p>A 4 ml blood sample was obtained from each participant either before initiation of treatment or within 48 hours of starting treatment. Blood was collected in EDTA and transferred to the laboratory on ice. The plasma was separated (3500 rpm, 10 minutes), aliquotted in 1.5ml cryovials and frozen at -70&#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Luminex assay</title><p>The samples were defrosted at 4&#x000b0;C and 50&#x003bc;l aliquots were placed in 96 well plates before refreezing at -70&#x000b0;C. This minimized freeze thaw cycles of the samples prior to analysis. Analysis used MMP beads (R&#x00026;D systems, Abingdon, UK) on the Luminex 200 platform (Biorad Bioplex 200, Hemel Hempstead), as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions for MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12 and-13. The lower level of detection of the assay was 1.1, 12.6, 7.3, 6.6, 16.6, 13.7, 3.2, 0.7 and 63.5pcg/ml respectively. In preliminary studies, MMP-12 and MMP-13 were not detected in plasma of either control or TB patients and so were not studied further. MMP-2 was detected but was excluded from statistical analysis as it was present in the plasma at high baseline concentrations and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were predominantly above the assay range.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The luminex output was exported into Microsoft Excel and a master data file compiled integrating the clinical characteristics with laboratory values.

We report the first comprehensive analysis of circulating MMPs including the key comparator group of respiratory symptomatics. Two collagenases, MMP-1 and MMP-8, were elevated in active TB, but MMP-8 is specifically upregulated in TB compared to both symptomatics and healthy controls. Critically, MMP-8 was higher in males than females, potentially introducing an important confounder. Analysis of the sexes separately confirmed that MMP-8 is increased in active TB compared to symptomatics and controls. These data demonstrate that gender needs to be considered in investigation of TB immunopathology and novel diagnostic markers.</p><p>Previous studies have primarily assessed MMPs at the primary site of TB disease rather than in the circulation. MMPs-1, -2, -3 and-8 were increased in the induced sputum of patients with pulmonary TB and MMP-1 correlated with extent of radiological infiltration [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, in our study of circulating MMPs, the collagenase MMP-8 was most elevated in patients with TB compared to respiratory symptomatics, demonstrating that different immunological mediators predominate in each compartment. This suggests that measuring biomarkers at the site of disease and within the circulation may not identify the same pathological mediators, and that plasma analysis may not reflect the processes within the lung interstitium. MMP-8 is principally neutrophil-derived and its principal substrate is thought to be fibrillar collagen [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Collagen is the primary structural fibril of the pulmonary ECM and our findings support the hypothesis that excessive collagenolytic activity is critical to the tissue destruction that occurs in pulmonary TB [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Doxycycline, a widely available antibiotic, also inhibits MMP activity at sub-antimicrobial concentrations, and so our data further support the potential use of doxycycline as a host-directed therapy to limit immunopathology in TB [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The elevation of MMP-8, and the close association with MMP-9 on principal component analysis, suggests that neutrophils are the primary source of MMP-8, which are emerging as key mediators of pathology at time of TB diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Plasma MMPs in tuberculosis have previously been investigated in smaller cohorts of patients.

Also consistent with our findings, a recent study using aptamers for proteomic profiling of paired serum of TB patients at enrolment and after 8 weeks of TB chemotherapy showed that MMP-1, -8 and-9 fell during treatment [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The elevation of MMP-8 in TB compared to respiratory symptomatics contrasts with CRP, which has been reported to be more elevated in other respiratory conditions [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Investigation of plasma MMPs in other respiratory infections have shown that plasma MMP-9 is elevated in community acquired pneumonia compared to healthy controls and in two studies, MMP-9 was found to return to normal after antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In a study of hospital acquired pneumonia, MMP-8 and MMP-9 were elevated in both the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma of patients compared to healthy controls [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These findings are consistent with our data and suggest that MMPs may be peripheral markers of immune-mediated tissue damage.</p><p>We analyzed a cross-sectional study of patients with smear positive pulmonary disease and demonstrated differences in plasma MMPs compared to healthy controls. In addition, plasma MMP-7 was elevated in patients with latent TB relative to IGRA negative controls. MMP-7 has previously been implicated in TB-IRIS [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Large-scale population studies would be required to determine whether increased MMP-7 associates with an increased risk of developing active TB and is a marker of low-level disease activity. Important follow-up studies will be to compare pulmonary disease, where bacillary loads are high, with paucibacillary TB disease to determine whether MMPs diverge between these clinical presentations. In addition, a key subsequent study will be to determine the changes in plasma MMPs during TB treatment. We have previously shown that MMP concentrations in induced sputum correlate with treatment outcome [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], but are not aware of longitudinal studies of plasma MMPs during treatment.</p><p>Differences in plasma MMPs between men and women have been previously identified [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and we confirmed in our study that MMP-8 was significantly higher in men with TB and this was not due to the potential confounder of delayed presentation. Men mount a greater and often more damaging inflammatory response to infection compared to women of reproductive age [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A proposed mechanism is that female sex hormones are protective [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and female neutrophils have been found to express decreased MMP-9 during the period of the menstrual cycle when oestrogen levels are higher [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Clinical features of TB infection differ between men and women, although the biology is very poorly understood [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, men have a higher reported incidence of TB [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and present more commonly with smear positive pulmonary disease [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Men have greater infiltrates on chest radiograph and more frequent haemoptysis [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, women more frequently develop lower zone pulmonary infiltrates [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These epidemiological observations demonstrate divergent immunopathology between sexes in human TB and are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in MMP expression causes greater tissue destruction in men [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The gender differences in plasma MMP-8 concentrations that we identify demonstrate a previously overlooked potential confounder in the assessment of novel TB diagnostic tests, which currently do not discriminate between men and women [<xref rid="pone.0117605.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In summary, plasma MMP-1 and MMP-8 are elevated in active pulmonary TB, implicating excessive collagenase activity in TB immunopathology. MMP-8 is TB-specific and is higher in TB than in respiratory symptomatics. Plasma MMP-8 concentrations differ between men and women, demonstrating that gender must be considered in the investigation of TB pathology and development of novel TB diagnostics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117605.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Table A.
