Most published systems vaccinology studies have utilized whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to monitor the immune response after vaccination. Because human blood is comprised of multiple hematopoietic cell types, the potential for masking responses of under-represented cell populations is increased when analyzing whole blood or PBMC. To investigate the contribution of individual cell types to the immune response after vaccination, we established a rapid and efficient method to purify human T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh venous blood. Purified cells were fractionated and processed in a single day. RNA-Seq and quantitative shotgun proteomics were performed to determine expression profiles for each cell type prior to and after inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination. Our results show that transcriptomic and proteomic profiles generated from purified immune cells differ significantly from PBMC. Differential expression analysis for each immune cell type also shows unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks at early time points after vaccination. This cell type-specific information provides a more comprehensive approach to monitor vaccine responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was funded in part with Federal funds from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, under Contract No. 272200800007C, the Vanderbilt Clinical and Translational Science Award grant NIH RR024975, the Childhood Infections Research Program grant T32-AI095202-01, the Immunobiology of Blood and Vascular Systems training grant 5 T32 HL69765-12, and NIH grant GM064779.

Using high-dimensional molecular approaches, systems biology identifies changes caused by perturbations such as infection or vaccination, combined with extensive computational analysis to model and predict responses[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the context of vaccinology, systems biology offers an approach to dissect the human immune response after immunization by correlating changes in the transcriptome and proteome with antibody or cell-mediated immune responses, in order to make predictions about vaccine efficacy and potentially adverse events[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The first systems biological studies to dissect human vaccine-induced responses utilized the yellow fever vaccine, YF-17D[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In these pioneering studies, both CD8+ T cell and B cell signatures identified in microarray profiles were correlated with protective cell-mediated and antibody responses, thus providing predictive signatures. Since these studies, several other vaccines have been studied, including live and inactivated influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Systems biology studies with influenza vaccines identified modules of genes that positively correlated with protective immune responses. For example, interferon-responsive genes that were up-regulated at early time points after TIV vaccination positively correlated with robust hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titers[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nakaya <italic>et al</italic>. found that an elevated antibody response to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), but not to live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), correlated with upregulation of B cell-specific transcripts, including immunoglobulins (IgA, IgD, IgE, and multiple IgGs) and the TNFRSF17 surface receptor[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Using the Nakaya dataset, Tan <italic>et al</italic>. identified immunoglobulin and complement genes as well as proliferation-associated genes to be predictors of protective antibody production in response to TIV vaccination. They concluded that enrichment of these particular gene sets at 7 days post-TIV vaccination was likely due to increased representation of proliferating plasmablasts in subjects with elevated antibody responses[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Predictive correlates that can be identified prior to vaccination are emerging in systems vaccinology studies. Tsang <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that baseline proportions of 126 individual immune cell sub-populations in the blood, identified by comprehensive flow cytometric analysis, could predict influenza vaccine-induced antibody responses[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several studies have found an inverse correlation between baseline influenza-specific microneutralization or HAI titers and the subsequent generation of both plasmablasts and protective antibodies after seasonal influenza vaccination. These studies reported that subjects with lower baseline titers of influenza antibodies generated more robust post-vaccine antibody responses compared to subjects with high baseline titers [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furman <italic>et al</italic>. identified several additional baseline predictors of protective immunity, including the frequency of CD8 T cells and NK cells, as well as multiple differentially expressed gene modules. These included genes associated with: 1) apoptotic pathways; 2) cell survival and proliferation (including generation and maintenance of germinal centers); 3) cell-to-cell signaling; 4) RNA post-transcriptional modification; and 5) carbohydrate metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Despite insights into the global human immune responses obtained from these and other studies, the majority of systems biology studies are limited in scope to total RNA from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since human blood is comprised of a multitude of hematopoietic cell types that are present in varying proportions, responses elicited from under-represented cell types in the blood are likely masked by those of predominant cells[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, Nakaya <italic>et al</italic>. found upregulation of the transcription factor XBP-1, which is necessary for the terminal differentiation of antibody-forming plasma cells, in RNA from sorted B cells, but not from PBMC, after TIV vaccination[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, when utilizing PBMC to monitor the immune response, the contributions of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells&#x02014;prime contributors to innate immunity&#x02014;are overlooked.</p><p>Most current vaccines target adaptive immune T and B lymphocytes by conferring lasting, life-long immunity (memory) that can be recalled rapidly upon subsequent encounter with the immunizing antigen[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The qualitative and quantitative aspects of these adaptive immune responses are slow to develop and are tightly regulated by the rapidly-induced innate immune response. Thus, an immune response represents a highly coordinated effort from multiple hematopoietic cell types&#x02014;each with their own inherent programming. We therefore believe that it is vitally important to analyze and model individual cell types in response to vaccination.</p><p>To develop a comprehensive systems biology model for studying immune responses following vaccination, we developed an efficient protocol to purify from human blood six immune cell types that contribute to both innate and adaptive immune responses: T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), monocytes, and neutrophils. These cells were isolated and processed immediately for down-stream systems analysis to avoid potential problems associated with the use of frozen cells[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Unlike previous systems vaccinology studies, which utilized microarray analysis to map dynamic changes in the transcriptome after vaccination[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], this study utilized RNA-Seq data generated prior to and after TIV vaccination together with the human reference genome sequence to identify changes in both protein-coding and non-coding RNA transcripts after vaccination. Additionally, and unique to this study, our protocol included quantitative proteomics to monitor changes in protein expression after vaccination.</p><p>Our results reveal that RNA and protein expression profiles from each sorted cell type differ significantly from the profile obtained from PBMC. Comparison of differentially expressed transcripts and proteins after vaccination with 2011&#x02013;2012 seasonal TIV further shows considerable differences between PBMC and sorted cells. Together, our data suggest that important cell type-specific information is gained when purified cells rather than PBMC or whole blood are utilized in systems studies. The cell type-specific information obtained from unbiased RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics analysis utilizing the complete human reference genome sequence provides a more comprehensive systems biology approach to monitor and eventually to model vaccine responses. This approach is applicable for other systems biology studies involving complex interactions between different cell types following vaccinations, infectious diseases, diseases and pharmacological interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Seasonal TIV Vaccination of human volunteers and blood collection</title><p>Volunteer recruitment and vaccination protocols for this study were approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB#111030 &#x0201c;CLR-03 2011-Immune Cells and Soluble Factors from Healthy Donor&#x0201d;). After obtaining written informed consent, thirty one subjects were enrolled in this study. Twenty-nine subjects provided 90mL blood samples to develop our phenotyping and cell sorting protocols and to establish baseline blood profiling information; for these purposes, twenty three subjects provided a single blood sample, and six subjects provided four samples over subsequent days on the same schedule as proposed for vaccinated subjects. Once the cell sorting pipeline was in place, two subjects were vaccinated with a single dose of 2011&#x02013;2012 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (strains included: A/California/7/09 (H1N1,), A/Perth /16/2009 (H3N2), and B/Brisbane/60/2008).

Residual RBCs were removed from the PMN fraction by ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis (KD Medical). Single cell suspensions of PBMC or PMN were subjected to magnetic bead separation. T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils were enriched by positive selection using directly conjugated anti-CD3, anti-CD14, and anti-CD15 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively. B cells were enriched by positive selection using anti-PE beads after staining with anti-CD19-PE antibody (Miltenyi Biotech) since directly conjugated CD19-microbeads interfered with subsequent anti-CD19 phenotypic staining. NK/mDC were enriched by negative selection using Streptavadin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after staining with biotinylated anti-CD19 (clone HIB19), anti-CD15 (clone HI98), anti-CD14 (clone 61D3), and anti-CD3 (clone UCHT1) antibodies (eBioscience).

RNA was quantified by either a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies) or the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay (Life Technologies). To assess RNA integrity, total RNA was evaluated on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). One hundred ng of total RNA with RIN values &#x0003e;7 was required for proceeding to downstream RNA-seq applications. Polyadenylated RNAs were isolated using NEBNext magnetic oligo d(T)<sub>25</sub> beads. NEBNext mRNA Library Prep Reagent Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs Inc.) was used to prepare individually bar-coded next generation sequencing expression libraries. Library quality was assessed by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen), and library concentration was estimated by utilizing a DNA 1000 chip on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Applied Biosystems). Accurate quantification of the prepared libraries for sequencing applications was determined using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.). Each library was diluted to a final concentration of 12.5nM and pooled equimolar prior to clustering. Paired-End (PE) sequencing (25 million, 50-bp, paired-end reads) was performed using a 200 cycle TruSeq SBS HS v3 kit on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencer (Illumina, Inc.). Image analysis and base calling was performed using the standard Illumina Pipeline consisting of Real time Analysis (RTA) version v1.13. Raw reads were de-multiplexed using a bcl2fastq conversion software v1.8.3 (Illumina, Inc.) with default settings. Post-processing of the sequencing reads from RNA-seq experiments from each sample was performed as per HudsonAlpha&#x02019;s unique in-house pipeline.

Ten ug of reduced, alkylated, and trypsinized protein extracts were labeled with iTRAQ tags (AB Sciex), pooled, and analyzed by MudPIT using an Eksigent 2-D nanoLC pump coupled to a nanoESI-LTQ-OrbitrapXL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

In contrast to the RNA levels, neutrophils contained the highest amount of protein, while lymphocytes contained the least. Lysates from each sample were trypsinized, desalted, and labeled with 8plex iTRAQ reagents. A control sample&#x02014;the Immune Cell Common Standard (ICCS)&#x02014;was labeled with two iTRAQ channels to assess technical variation and used to normalize data across experiments. Two labeling strategies were tested to determine the optimal pooling strategy for detecting proteomic changes after vaccination (<xref rid="pone.0118528.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig.</xref> Two iTRAQ strategies for quantitative proteomic analysis of immune cells after vaccination). In strategy 1, all six cell types at a single time point were multiplexed in one experiment. The advantage of this approach is that technical experimental variation between cell types at each time point would be minimized. However, since liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) selected proteins for identification and quantification based upon their abundance in the sample, proteins present in higher amounts across the samples would be preferentially quantified. Thus, differentially changing proteins with low expression from a single cell-type might not be quantified. Also, by increasing the complexity of the sample pool through multiplexing lysates from six different cell types, co-fragmentation of co-eluting peptides might cause an increase in iTRAQ signal interference. In strategy 2, all four time-points from one cell type were multiplexed in a single experiment. The advantage of this approach is that by pooling similar proteomes, sample complexity is reduced, thus reducing iTRAQ signal interference caused by co-fragmentation of co-eluting peptides. Since LC-MS/MS quantifies only a fraction of the proteome, this strategy would also ensure quantification of a larger fraction of cell type-specific proteins. However, cell type-specific changes that are artifacts might be detected due to technical experimental variation. We tested both strategies and analyzed the results using both unsupervised hierarchical clustering and PCA (<xref rid="pone.0118528.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig.</xref>). Strategy 2 produced cell-type specific clustering and protein expression patterns by both hierarchical clustering and PCA, while strategy 1 did not. Since the samples in the iTRAQ experiments using strategy 1 did not cluster together by either hierarchical clustering or PCA, we discounted the possibility of batch effect. Therefore, strategy 2 was considered the optimal approach and employed for proteomic analysis.</p><p>Peptide spectra generated by LC-MS/MS were searched against the human Ensembl database of protein sequences using <italic>Sequest</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the resulting peptides were scored and assembled into proteins and quantified based upon the iTRAQ reporter ion intensities in <italic>ProteoIQ</italic>.

By utilizing this efficient cell-sorting protocol, we obtained sufficient numbers of six immune cell types purified from freshly collected whole blood to perform both RNA-sequencing and quantitative proteomics experiments. Importantly, cells were processed and stored for downstream applications in a single day, thus avoiding the pitfalls of freeze-thaw cycles on downstream analysis. In this study, sorting was stopped once the target number of cells was reached (1.5&#x02013;3 x10<sup>6</sup> cells) even if MACS-enriched material remained. Collection of larger numbers of cells is therefore possible for some cell types. In this regard, we have utilized this protocol in a subsequent vaccinology study and collected up to 4x10<sup>6</sup> neutrophils, up to 3x10<sup>6</sup> B cells, T cells, NK and monocytes, and up to 1x10<sup>6</sup> mDC from similar amounts of starting material.</p><p>Further fractionation of these six cell types into sub-populations was considered. However, we decided against this approach for several reasons. First, we were interested in broadly sampling the immune system in response to vaccination. Previous vaccinology studies that investigated responses of individual immune cells only focused on selected cell types [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our approach profiled both transcriptomic and quantitative proteomic responses of six essential innate and adaptive immune cell types, including neutrophils and NK cells, after vaccination. Signals from small, potentially important sub-populations from any of these immune cell types may still be masked in our systems analysis. However, by sorting for these six immune cell types, we simultaneously investigated both innate and adaptive immune cell responses to vaccination at a cell-specific level. Second, pursuing sub-populations of immune cells would require either obtaining larger blood samples or reducing the number of distinct cell types that we could purify in order to recover sufficient cells for both RNA-Seq and proteomics analyses. If only transcriptomic studies had been performed, sorting for sub-populations from selected immune cell types would have been possible. Finally, the added cost for analysis of both transcriptomic and proteomic data from additional sub-populations was considered prohibitive for this study&#x02019;s broad survey of innate and adaptive immune responses after vaccination. Future studies that focus on a specific immune cell type(s) and/or sub-populations can easily be performed by adapting our protocol, especially if only transcriptomic analysis is proposed.</p><p>Emerging technologies that allow for greater identification of sub-populations of cells and the potential for single cell analysis are now possible [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For example, CyTOF offers an opportunity to investigate both cell surface and intracellular protein expression at the single cell level [<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This technology allows for staining of a potentially unlimited number of cellular markers by eliminating the spectral overlap that plagues traditional flow cytometry applications due to use of fluorescently-labeled antibodies. Therefore, analysis of a substantially increased number of cell subtypes from a single sample can be performed. However, the destructive nature of this technology (single cell ICP mass cytometry) eliminates the potential to collect live cells for further downstream applications. Additionally, by nature, antibody-targeted validation studies require that previously identified molecules be selected for screening. The approach described in this study generated both unbiased and quantitative global transcriptomic and proteomic data from six purified immune cell populations after vaccination. CyTOF offers a powerful, single-cell, high throughput approach to validate and characterize results derived by these types of systems studies.</p><p>This study optimized our strategy to generate and analyze RNA-seq and quantitative proteomics data from individual immune cell types sorted from fresh human blood. Differential analysis for each immune cell type revealed unique transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles as well as changing biological networks during the early response after vaccination. Lending support to our strategy, previous transcriptional findings from systems analysis after TIV vaccination were identified in our approach. For example, we found that B cell-specific transcripts identified by Nakaya <italic>et al</italic>. as correlative predictors of protective immunity following TIV vaccination, including immunoglobulin genes and TNFSFR17 as well as the transcription factor XBP-1, were up-regulated in sorted B cell samples from both of our subjects 7 days after vaccination (<xref rid="pone.0118528.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>)[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, we found that CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL10/IP-10, was significantly up-regulated in both PBMC and sorted B cell samples after TIV vaccination (<xref rid="pone.0118528.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>); CXCL10/IP-10 was the only cytokine Nakaya <italic>et al</italic>. identified as being significantly increased in the serum of TIV-vaccinated subjects in their systems study[<xref rid="pone.0118528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These data suggest that our subject cohort likely attained at least some measure of protection after TIV vaccination. Future studies using these protocols will correlate vaccine-induced differential expression of both RNA and proteins, as well as serum cytokine levels, with day 28 antibody titers to make predictions about generation of protective immunity in response to vaccination.</p><p>The methods and strategies developed in this project provided a unique and important opportunity to investigate the quantitative and qualitative differences between PBMC and individual immune cell types at both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. By utilizing RNA-seq rather than microarray analysis, we were able to identify and quantify an expanded fraction of the transcriptome, which included 29 different classes of RNA transcripts. Additionally, both transcriptomic and proteomic data were visualized across the human reference genome sequence. Only a small fraction of differentially expressed transcripts and proteins identified in the purified immune cell types were also identified in the PBMC fraction. Thus, by analyzing each cell type individually, cell-specific transcriptomic and proteomic contributions to the immune response following vaccination were identified. This cell type-specific information, coupled with unbiased systems biology approaches, provides a more comprehensive approach to monitor and eventually model vaccine responses. The approaches developed in this pilot project will help to guide future systems biology studies aimed at modeling and predicting complex responses to vaccines and vaccine adjuvants involving interactions between multiple cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s001"><label>S1 Dataset</label><caption><title>RNA-seq quality control.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s002"><label>S2 Dataset</label><caption><title>Normalized transcript expression in human immune cells prior to and post-TIV vaccination.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s003"><label>S3 Dataset</label><caption><title>Normalized transcript expression in human immune cells filtered for an RPKM of 1.0 in at least one sample from one subject.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s004"><label>S4 Dataset</label><caption><title>Normalized protein expression in human immune cells prior to and post-TIV vaccination.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s005"><label>S5 Dataset</label><caption><title>Normalized protein expression in human immune cells filtered to remove zero values and contaminating keratins from one subject.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s006"><label>S6 Dataset</label><caption><title>Shared up-regulated DE RNA transcripts.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s006.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s007"><label>S7 Dataset</label><caption><title>Shared down-regulated DE RNA transcripts.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s007.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s008"><label>S8 Dataset</label><caption><title>Shared up-regulated DE proteins.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s008.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s009"><label>S9 Dataset</label><caption><title>Shared down-regulated DE proteins.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s009.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s010"><label>S10 Dataset</label><caption><title>Top networks and pathways identified in TIV-vaccinated subjects.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0118528.s010.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118528.s011"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>RNA quality control.</title><p>Scatter plots showing the correlation of total RNA transcripts between time points and subjects. <bold>(a)</bold> Time point comparison within the same subject (HD30 PBMC day 3 vs HD30 PBMC day 0). <bold>(b)</bold> Subject-to-subject comparison of one time point (HD30 PBMC day 3 vs HD31 PBMC day 3).
