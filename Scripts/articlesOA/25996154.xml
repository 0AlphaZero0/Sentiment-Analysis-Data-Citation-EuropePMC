The mechanism of matrix destruction resulting in cavitation is not well defined. Neutrophils are emerging as key mediators of TB immunopathology and their influx are associated with poor outcomes. We investigated neutrophil-dependent mechanisms involved in TB-associated matrix destruction using a cellular model, a cohort of 108 patients, and in separate patient lung biopsies. Neutrophil-derived NF-kB-dependent matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) secretion was up-regulated in TB and caused matrix destruction both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in respiratory samples of TB patients. Collagen destruction induced by TB infection was abolished by doxycycline, a licensed MMP inhibitor. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contain MMP-8 and are increased in samples from TB patients. Neutrophils lined the circumference of human pulmonary TB cavities and sputum MMP-8 concentrations reflected TB radiological and clinical disease severity. AMPK, a central regulator of catabolism, drove neutrophil MMP-8 secretion and neutrophils from AMPK-deficient patients secrete lower MMP-8 concentrations. AMPK-expressing neutrophils are present in human TB lung biopsies with phospho-AMPK detected in nuclei.

The cavity has high bacillary burden and is associated with spread of infection. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes or neutrophils are abundant in areas of TB lung cavities [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Excessive neutrophil recruitment associates with pathology in animal models [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in man [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but the mechanism of how neutrophils drive pathology in human TB is not defined.</p><p>Zinc-containing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have key roles in the inflammatory immunopathology in a wide range of diseases including cancer and arthritis [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the basis of diverse evidence, it has been shown that a matrix-degrading phenotype develops in TB in which MMP activity is relatively unopposed by the specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. MMPs are crucial in granuloma formation in the zebrafish model of TB [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and may drive different stages of lung pathology. Collagenases, a subgroup of the MMPs, are key in TB pathology since collagen is the main structural protein of the lung, the primary site of infection. Patients with pulmonary TB have increased collagenases which correlate significantly with radiological markers of tissue destruction [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Neutrophils secrete MMP-8, a potent collagenase, and increased neutrophil-derived MMPs associate with disease severity in CNS-TB [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], implicating neutrophils in the immunopathology of human TB.</p><p>The concept of metabolism regulating host immunity is only recently emerging [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a serine/threonine kinase is a central regulator of metabolic responses acting as an activator of cellular catabolism [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, AMPK is known to have a role in immune responses determining the effector versus memory fate of CD8 T-cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Inhibition of glucose uptake and AMPK inhibition impedes T cell chemotaxis [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Dissecting the mechanism of how metabolism regulates immunity may be key to understanding immunity in chronic infections such as TB.</p><p>We hypothesize that neutrophils drive tissue destruction in human pulmonary TB. Animal models of infection such as murine strains which develop pulmonary necrosis and cavities are useful in dissecting areas of the immune response in TB [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Murine models also demonstrated the critical importance of IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; in the host defence against TB [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, there are inherent differences between murine and human neutrophils with divergences in cytokine secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], peptides such as defensins [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and intracellular signalling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the role of the neutrophil in MMP-dependent tissue destruction in human pulmonary TB, a disease that affects man as the primary host, and examine the signaling pathways regulating this process.</p><p>First, we investigate the effect of neutrophil-derived collagenase MMP-8 in a human cellular model and examine MMP-8 expression and collagenolytic activity in patients. Neutrophils secrete MMP-8 on direct <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection and in <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>-infected monocyte-dependent networks. Neutrophil MMP-8 is expressed in TB patients&#x02019; biopsy specimens, with the secretion of MMP-8 dependent on NF-kB. We found in a cohort of 108 TB patients and controls that increased MMP-8 is closely associated with neutrophil markers and correlates with radiological and clinical disease severity. Sputum MMP-8 from TB patients is functionally active, causing matrix destruction, and patients with pulmonary cavities on chest radiographs have higher MMP-8 concentrations in their respiratory secretions. Gelatin degradation in the respiratory samples is raised, but is not dependent on neutrophil gelatinase MMP-9. We demonstrate that AMPK regulates MMP-8 dependent tissue destruction, both at the level of protein secretion and gene expression, using data from a cellular model of infection and by investigating biopsy samples from TB patients and immune responses in AMPK deficient patients. Taken together, our data demonstrate that neutrophils cause tissue destruction in TB by an MMP-8-dependent process, regulated by the pro-catabolic AMPK pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Neutrophil MMP-8 is increased in TB and is expressed in neutrophils in patients with pulmonary TB</title><p>First, we investigated MMP-8 secretion from primary human neutrophils stimulated by live, virulent <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>.

We found sputum from TB patients had increased MMP-8 concentrations, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) compared to controls. MMP-8 was strongly associated with markers of neutrophil activation, MPO and NGAL, indicating that sputum MMP-8 is likely to be neutrophil-derived. Neutrophils expressing MMP-8 were found in the inner walls of tuberculous cavities and may further erode the lung matrix, extending previous findings that neutrophils are the predominant phagocytic cells in the respiratory secretions of TB patients [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We also found higher MMP-8 in TB patients with cavities on their chest radiographs than those without cavitation. These findings are consistent with and extend our previous data in smaller groups of patients that demonstrated a trend to increased MMP-8 compared to patients with respiratory symptoms [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, MMP-8 is significantly elevated in plasma samples of patients with TB compared to respiratory symptomatics [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These observations underscore the importance of collagenases, such as MMP-8 and MMP-1, which are the only enzymes capable of degrading the collagen triple helix at neutral pH. The consistent elevation of MMP-8 across the different patient cohorts implicates neutrophils as key players in tissue destruction in TB.</p><p>In animal models of TB, neutrophil influx is associated with poorer outcomes with higher bacterial burden, earlier mortality and tissue inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the mechanisms linking neutrophil excess and poor outcomes are unclear. In our human study, <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> drove neutrophil MMP-8 secretion, causing destruction of collagen, the main structural protein in human lung, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in TB patients. We showed neutrophil MMP-8 closely correlated with sputum collagenase activity as well as clinical CXR score and TB severity score, implicating neutrophils in driving pathology in man by their collagenolytic activity. MMP-8 was also associated with NETs in <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic> infection and NET components such as citrulline H3, which were not present in dead neutrophils, were increased in the respiratory secretions of TB patients. This may further contribute to immunopathology since NETs are recognized to induce cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It is likely that different MMPs predominate in different stages of disease in TB immunopathology. There is good evidence that neutrophils are present not only during the acute phases of TB infection with macrophages, but are also a dominant cell type at the site of established infection of the cavity together with lymphocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Such neutrophils contain high concentration of pre-synthesized MMP-8 [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and so can drive the later stages of TB which leads to lung cavitation, morbidity and death</p><p>MMP-8 inhibition may be a target to abrogate excessive host tissue destruction. MMP-8 is a critical mediator of lung parenchymal damage other lung diseases, such as COPD [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and ventilator-induced lung injury, and MMP-8 inhibition improves outcomes in a murine model of lung injury [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We showed higher MMP-8 in the respiratory secretions of patients with cavities than those without and MMP-8 neutralization decreased the matrix destruction in the sputum of TB patients. Although neutrophil gelatinase MMP-9 is secreted in TB and expressed in TB patients, neutralizing MMP-9 did not reduce gelatinase activity in TB patients. Neutrophil MMP-8 secretion in TB was inhibited by NF-kB inhibitors helenalin, CAPE and SN50 without altering neutrophil viability. Furthermore, doxycycline reduced neutrophil collagenase activity to baseline and MMP-8 neutralizing antibody decreased collagen destruction <italic>ex vivo</italic> in TB patients. Such immunomodulatory agents have potential to reduce tissue destruction in TB.</p><p>For the first time in TB, we have shown that there is interaction between the metabolic AMPK signaling pathway in the regulation of neutrophil MMP-8 secretion and innate-immune mediated tissue destruction. AMPK activates catabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis to generate ATP, while switching off energy-consuming processes including protein and fatty-acid biosynthesis and cell-cycle progression. Two studies have shown that the development of lung injury in murine models is dependent on the pro-catabolic AMPK pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] with AMPK activation decreasing lung injury. This contrasted with our findings where AMPK inhibition decreased neutrophil MMP-8 secretion, and maybe due to AMPK having divergent effects on different cells.</p><p>The AMPK pathway was up-regulated in our cellular model and drives neutrophil MMP-8 secretion and gene expression, which was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. This finding was repeated in a small cohort of extremely rare patients with functional AMPK deficiency from a &#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>-subunit mutation, where <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tb</italic>-driven neutrophil MMP-8 was decreased compared to healthy volunteers. While this does not definitively prove that AMPK regulates MMP-8 secretion as metabolic differences in neutrophils may cause divergent secretion, it implicates AMPK in driving neutrophil-mediated pathology by MMPs in TB. This finding is in keeping with a recent study where AMPK&#x003b1;2 deficient mice had decreased MMP-2 and were found to be resistant to developing abdominal aneurysms, a process which was demonstrated to be MMP-dependent [<xref rid="ppat.1004917.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

This study highlights a previously unappreciated connection between metabolic paths that directly interact with innate immune responses causing immunopathology in human TB.
