One pathway that inhibits host defense responses involves the induction of type I interferons and subsequently IL-10, yet the mechanism by which type I IFN induces IL-10 remains unclear. Our studies of gene expression profiles derived from leprosy skin lesions suggested a link between IL-27 and the IFN-&#x003b2; induced IL-10 pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the IL-27p28 subunit is upregulated following treatment of monocytes with IFN-&#x003b2; and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, the intracellular bacterium that causes leprosy. The ability of IFN-&#x003b2; and <italic>M. leprae</italic> to induce IL-10 was diminished by IL-27 knockdown. Additionally, treatment of monocytes with recombinant IL-27 was sufficient to induce the production of IL-10. Functionally, IL-27 inhibited the ability of IFN-&#x003b3; to trigger antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic> in infected monocytes. At the site of disease, IL-27 was more strongly expressed in skin lesions of patients with progressive lepromatous leprosy, correlating and colocalizing with IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in macrophages. Together, these data provide evidence that in the human cutaneous immune responses to microbial infection, IL-27 contributes to the suppression of host antimicrobial responses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The ability of microbial pathogens to trigger immune responses which counteract host defense is critical for the pathogenesis of infectious disease. Among such pathways, the induction of IL-10 represents a key mechanism by which microbes suppress host antimicrobial responses. In some circumstances, the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) by the pathogen represents one trigger for IL-10 production, resulting in a profound inhibitory effect on innate and adaptive immunity. As such, the induction of the type I IFN to IL-10 pathway contributes to chronic progressive disease in bacterial (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and viral (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Teijaro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Wilson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) infections. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which IL-10 is induced in human immune responses is central for understanding how microbial pathogens suppress antimicrobial defense strategies.</p><p id="P3">Leprosy, a human infectious disease of skin caused by the intracellular bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic>, presents as a spectrum in which the clinical manifestations correlate with the immune response to the pathogen. As such, leprosy is a valuable model for investigating human immune responses to infection. In the skin lesions of leprosy patients, an inverse correlation exists between the expression of IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3;, as well as their respective downstream gene programs (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The skin lesions from patients with the progressive, L-lep form of leprosy display an IFN-&#x003b2; gene signature, whereas lesions from patients with the localized, T-lep form of leprosy are characterized by a low IFN-&#x003b2; and high IFN-&#x003b3; gene signature. Similarly, IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 expression in lesions were significantly correlated, which led to the observation that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induction of IL-10 was type I IFN dependent. Both IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 inhibit the antimicrobial effect of IFN-&#x003b3; on intracellular <italic>M. leprae</italic>, identifying the IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 axis as a key immunosuppressive pathway in human mycobacterial infection.</p><p id="P4">The ability of IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 is relevant to the pathogenesis of other microbial infections. For example, overlap of the IFN-&#x003b2; gene signature in leprosy lesions with the IFN-&#x003b2; signatures from peripheral blood cells in tuberculosis patients (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), identified a common signature of 16 IFN-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced genes (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). One of these IFN-&#x003b2; downstream genes, IL-27, has been shown to induce IL-10, leading to the suppression of lymphocyte responses (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Murugaiyan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). IL-27 functions as a heterodimer composed of two subunits: p28 and EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3), of which the transcriptional regulation of IL-27p28 has been studied in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The IL-27 heterodimer activates via an IL-27R complex consisting of the unique subunit IL-27R (also referred to a TCCR and WSX-1) and the gp130 chain of IL-6R. Here, we investigated the role of IL-27 in suppressing human host defense responses against a cutaneous pathogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 in human monocytes</title><p id="P5">To begin evaluating the role of IL-27 in the IFN-&#x003b2; downstream network, we first examined whether IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 expression in adherent monocytes using an ELISA that measures the levels of the IL-27 heterodimer. Indeed, IFN-&#x003b2; significantly induced IL-27 in human monocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Both IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-27 induced IL-10, with the induction of IL-10 by IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-27 highly correlated in monocytes from the same donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were transfected with a pool of siRNAs specific for the p28 subunit of IL-27 (siIL27) or a pool of non-specific siRNAs (siCtrl), for 24 hrs, then stimulated with IFN-&#x003b2; for 3 hrs or 24 hrs. Transfection of siIL27 inhibited IL-27p28 mRNA expression at 3 hrs by &#x0003e;70% as compared to siCtrl, in both the media and IFN-&#x003b2; stimulated cultures (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).

Here, we investigated a dose titration for the induction of IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-27 and IL-10 by <italic>M. leprae</italic> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Increasing the <italic>M. leprae</italic> MOI resulted in enhanced IL-27 production in monocytes which plateaued at an MOI of 10. Similarly, IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 release plateaued at an MOI of 10, such that this was the dose used for further experiments. We further demonstrate that <italic>M. leprae</italic>-induced IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 production in the same donors correlated significantly (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In addition, <italic>M. leprae</italic> induced IL-27 heterodimer and IL-10 produced in the same donors significantly correlated (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>).

In addition to the T-lep and L-lep forms of leprosy, we examined reversal reactions (RR), representing a shift from the L-lep to T-lep part of the disease spectrum, accompanied by a reduction in bacilli in lesions and enhanced Th1 cytokine responses (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Yamamura <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>). IL-27p28 but not IL-27 EBI3 mRNAs, was found to be differentially expressed in L-lep compared to T-lep lesions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a and b</xref>). RR lesions expressed IL-27p28 mRNA at levels similar to T-lep lesions, and greater than in L-lep lesions. However, IL-27 EBI3 mRNA expression was greater in RR lesions compared to both L-lep and T-lep lesions, though this increase was not significant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The expression levels of IL-27p28, but not IL-27 EBI3, directly correlated with IL-10 in the microarray data (r=0.71 and r=0.00959 respectively, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c and d</xref>). The elevated expression of IL-27p28 transcripts in L-lep vs. T-lep and RR lesions and correlation with IL-10 mRNA expression was corroborated by PCR of an independent set of skin biopsy specimens (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e and f</xref>).</p><p id="P9">The distribution and localization of IL-27 protein in leprosy lesions was examined by immunohistochemistry and confocal laser microscopy using a mAb that recognized the IL-27 heterodimer. Similar to IL-27p28 mRNA, IL-27 protein was also more highly expressed in L-lep lesions compared to T-lep and RR lesions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, IL-27 protein colocalized with CD209<sup>+</sup> and CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages, of relevance since these markers identify the predominant macrophage phenotype in L-lep lesions and is reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> by the differentiation of monocytes by IL-10 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Montoya <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, some IL-27 was detected in CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Triple immunofluorescence revealed that IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-27 and IL-10 are co-expressed at the cellular level in L-lep lesions, with some cells also expressing individual cytokines, indicating autocrine and paracrine production of the three cytokines (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Taken together, the immunohistology data indicate that IL-27, along with IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10, are most strongly expressed in L-lep lesions, therefore associated with the progressive form of leprosy.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>IL-27 prevents IFN-&#x003b3; dependent antimicrobial activity against M. leprae in human monocytes</title><p id="P10">Next, the effect of IL-27 on IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic> was evaluated. Human adherent monocytes were pre-treated with IFN-&#x003b3;, and then infected with <italic>M. leprae</italic> at an MOI of 10:1 overnight resulting in infection of approximately 80% of the monocytes infected with about two bacteria per cell. After the overnight infection, monocytes were treated with IFN&#x003b3;, IFN&#x003b2; + IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-27 + IFN-&#x003b3; or IL-10 + IFN-&#x003b3; and <italic>M. leprae</italic> viability measured after five days. IFN-&#x003b3; induced an antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic> in infected monocytes, reducing the number of viable bacilli by approximately 60% (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Similar to IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10, the addition of IL-27 abrogated the IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial response (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Because the experiments are performed over a five day period, we could not assess whether IFN-&#x003b2; inhibition of IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity was IL-27 dependent, as knockdown of IL-27 using siRNA is transient. In summary, these studies suggest that IL-27 inhibits host defense against <italic>M. leprae</italic> in infected monocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P11">The ability of intracellular pathogens to inhibit host defense responses contributes to the pathogenesis of human infectious disease. Here, we explored the role of IL-27 in the immune response to a microbial pathogen by studying leprosy as a model. We provide evidence that IL-27 inhibits host defense in human leprosy as: i) the induction of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 by both IFN-&#x003b2; and <italic>M. leprae</italic> was partially dependent on IL-27, ii) IL-27 colocalized with IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in the skin lesions from the progressive L-lep form vs. the self-limited T-lep of leprosy; and iii) IL-27 suppressed IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic>. Together, these data reveal that the induction of IL-27 provides a mechanism for suppression of host defense responses in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous human infectious disease, leprosy.</p><p id="P12">Through the analysis of gene expression profiles in leprosy, we identified IL-27, specifically the p28 subunit, as an IFN-&#x003b2; downstream gene associated with the progressive form of the disease (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Teles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Waddell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). IL-27 was part of a common set of 16 IFN-&#x003b2; downstream genes in the overlap between the gene expression profiles derived from the skin lesions of L-lep patients and the peripheral blood from two cohorts of patients with active tuberculosis (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Berry <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Maertzdorf <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Given that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces IFN-&#x003b2; and that IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27, <italic>M. leprae</italic> induced IFN-&#x003b2; is a one key event for the induction of IL-27. Emerging data indicates that mycobacteria induce Type I IFN via cytoplasmic sensors that detect dsDNA and di-cyclic nucleotides that signal through STING, DDX41 and/or cGAS (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Dey <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Parvatiyar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Watson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It is also possible that <italic>M. leprae</italic> directly induces IL-27 via a Type I IFN independent pathway.</p><p id="P13">Here, we provide evidence that IL-27 plays a role in host defense against <italic>M. leprae</italic> by inhibiting IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity. In tuberculosis, IL-27 has also been identified at the site of disease (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>) and inhibits the host defense responses against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Nau, 2008</xref>). IL-27, has been shown to block IFN-&#x003b3; induced autophagy (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Sharma <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), a key part of the IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial pathway against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Fabri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Although the present data demonstrate that IL-27 suppresses IFN-&#x003b3; induced antimicrobial activity against <italic>M. leprae</italic>, we were unable to experimentally determine whether IFN-&#x003b2; suppression of this antimicrobial activity was dependent on IL-27.</p><p id="P14">Although IL-27 functions as a heterodimer containing p28 and EBI3, EBI3 has been found to be constitutively expressed, it is suggested that the induction of the p28 subunit is the rate limiting step in the production of bioactive IL-27 (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Remoli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). This is in agreement with our findings that we see robust induction in the expression of the p28 subunit and very little variability in the expression of EBI3.</p><p id="P15">The present results suggest that one mechanism of IL-10 production in mycobacterial infection involves an <italic>M. leprae</italic>&#x02192;IFN-&#x003b2;&#x02192;IL-27&#x02192;IL-10 pathway. We provide evidence that <italic>M. leprae</italic> induces each of these cytokines, as well as demonstrate that these cytokines in turn induce the downstream pathway, i.e. IFN-&#x003b2; induces IL-27 and IL-10, and IL-27 induces IL-10 directly. Our finding that IL-27 induces IL-10 in human monocytes is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that IL-27 induces IL-10 in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Iyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>) and human T cells (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Batten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="P16">The ability of <italic>M. leprae</italic> and IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 was partially dependent on the expression of IL-27. This pathway is consistent with the ability of LPS to induce type I IFN, leading to the IL-27 dependent production of IL-10 (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Iyer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). IL-10 production in response to <italic>Leishmania spp</italic>. infection was also found to be IL-27 dependent (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In addition, IL-27 enhanced leishmania growth in an IL-10 dependent manner (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Barreto-de-Souza <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Together, these data support the concept that IL-27 directly induces IL-10 expression.</p><p id="P17">In some experimental settings, IL-27 suppressed IL-10 production, in particular in the presence of other cytokines or stimuli. For example, the addition of IL-27 with M-CSF or monocyte-derived macrophages inhibited TLR-induced IL-10 production (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kalliolias and Ivashkiv, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Zeitvogel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It is noteworthy that our data demonstrates that in the skin lesions of leprosy, IL-27 and IL-10 expression correlates, and the two cytokines co-localize in the progressive form the disease.</p><p id="P18">Clearly, microbial pathogens can also induce IL-10 in an IL-27 independent manner. In our study, the ability of <italic>M. leprae</italic> and IFN-&#x003b2; to induce IL-10 was partially blocked by IL-27 knockdown. The induction of IL-10 by the co-addition of live <italic>M. tuberculosi</italic>s and IFN-&#x003b2; to mouse bone marrow derived macrophages was not inhibited by IL-27R deficiency. Live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is known to induce IL-10 via TLR2 signaling (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), a TLR pathway that does not involve induction of type I IFN. Further studies demonstrate that engagement of TLRs can directly induce IL-10 in macrophages (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Nair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>), as can engagement of DC-SIGN through Raf-1 kinase (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Gringhuis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="P19">The role of IL-27 in triggering IL-10 production in mycobacterial infection suggests that it might be considered as a therapeutic target. In human cells, type I IFN blocks IL-1 production in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and this blockade was not reversible by addition of type II IFN (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Novikov <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Therefore, neutralization of IL-27 may favor IFN-&#x003b3; responses which contribute to host defense against mycobacterial infection. As IFN-&#x003b2; may also activate immune responses such as IL-12 induction (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bohnenkamp <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), blockade of IL-27 may inhibit the immunosuppressive pathway induced by IFN-&#x003b2; while preserving its immunostimulatory function. In particular, targeting IL-27 might serve as a useful adjuvant to traditional antibiotic therapy, perhaps in the context of multi-drug resistant bacteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S9"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S10" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients and clinical specimens</title><p id="P20">Patients with leprosy were classified according to the criteria of Ridley and Jopling (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Ridley and Jopling, 1966</xref>).
