However, approximately 5% of patients experience recurrent tuberculosis within 2 years of treatment completion [<xref rid="JIV447C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Tuberculosis recurrence can be due to either reinfection with a new organism or relapse with the same <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolate; it is unknown why mycobacteria persist in some individuals after 6 months of treatment. In Cape Town, South Africa, a setting with a high tuberculosis burden, tuberculosis relapse predominates in the first year after tuberculosis treatment completion, whereas reinfection is more common later [<xref rid="JIV447C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>New tuberculosis drugs or regimens are needed, but there are no easy ways to determine the efficacy of compounds under development. The 2-year relapse rate is used to measure drug efficacy in trials of tuberculosis drugs or regimens, but demonstration of reduced relapse/enhanced efficacy will require many thousands of patients and is very time-consuming and costly. Biomarkers that predict the response to tuberculosis treatment and the risk of tuberculosis relapse early in clinical trials would greatly help to evaluate candidate drugs and select those for further development [<xref rid="JIV447C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Tuberculosis recurrence is associated with the bacterial burden at the time of diagnosis and with delayed sputum conversion [<xref rid="JIV447C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Early Bactericidal Assays performed during the first two weeks of treatment, and sputum conversion rates after 2 months of treatment, can indicate early drug efficacy but cannot measure the killing of persistent bacterial subpopulations later in treatment. Because bacteria with the capability of persisting and causing tuberculosis relapse cannot be detected by current techniques, identification of patients at risk of tuberculosis relapse following treatment would revolutionize clinical trials of new treatments and facilitate clinical management.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of ex vivo whole-blood specimens has revealed transcriptomic changes in patients with tuberculosis, compared with healthy people [<xref rid="JIV447C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV447C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and large-scale changes in gene expression during successful tuberculosis drug treatment [<xref rid="JIV447C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JIV447C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A cross-sectional study of patients who previously experienced tuberculosis recurrence identified genes that discriminated this group from patients who remained cured after 1 tuberculosis episode [<xref rid="JIV447C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Array technology has been used to investigate human phagocyte responses to pathogens, including <italic>M. tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, and <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, [<xref rid="JIV447C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="JIV447C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vitro [<xref rid="JIV447C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, only whole-blood cultures contain all circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, which play an important role in tuberculosis immunity and immunopathology [<xref rid="JIV447C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIV447C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Variations in mycobacterial antigen&#x02013;induced cytokine production [<xref rid="JIV447C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="JIV447C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or mycobacterial growth inhibition [<xref rid="JIV447C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] among study populations are readily detectable in cultures of diluted whole-blood specimens, which traditionally include culture periods of approximately 6 days.</p><p>We hypothesized that cultures of diluted whole-blood specimens and microarray technology would enable identification of differences early during tuberculosis treatment in patients who subsequently experienced relapse, compared with patients who remained disease free for 2 years. Such differences could be developed into biomarkers to predict tuberculosis drug efficacy and could reveal why some people are more susceptible to tuberculosis relapse.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Sample Collection</title><p>Fourteen healthy BCG-vaccinated donors were recruited at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Preliminary flow cytometry experiments showed both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guerin stimulated various lymphocyte populations in diluted whole-blood cultures after 6 days (data not shown). Diluted whole-blood specimens from 3 BCG-vaccinated donors were, for 6 days, stimulated with <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guerin or <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or left unstimulated, and mRNA was analyzed by microarray. Both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guerin had strong effects on gene expression, with &#x0003e;8000 genes differentially expressed by &#x02265;2-fold between at least 2 conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV447F1">1</xref><italic>A</italic>). For approximately 2300 genes, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guerin exerted a similar effect: GO analysis showed that genes involved in a broad range of biological processes, including signaling and multicellular processes, were represented among these regulated genes. Immune system genes also included a broad range of processes, including development, activation, effector process, migration, and immune response terms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV447F1">1</xref><italic>B</italic>). In contrast, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacillus Calmette-Guerin exerted different or opposing effects on approximately 5700 genes: these included a narrower range of gene ontologies, with overrepresentation of cell component biogenesis genes with antigen processing and presentation dominating the immune system category (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV447F1">1</xref><italic>C</italic>). These may represent important immune evasion strategies.

The ability to predict which patients with tuberculosis are at risk of relapse after treatment completion would facilitate clinical management and enhance efficacy testing of new tuberculosis drugs, especially in early phase clinical trials. The majority of patients in this study (8 of 10) were correctly allocated to the tuberculosis-relapse or cured groups, based on expression of a 668-gene signature. Intriguingly, there was clear-cut discrimination of the majority of patients by principal component analysis: the distinction was present at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis, implying that these patients had inherently different immune responses to live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, rather than a differential response to treatment. The misclassified patients exhibited more-complex mixed signatures. The likelihood of a relapsed, cured, or mixed phenotype in this study was not related to disease extent at diagnosis or sputum conversion at 2 months, highlighting that patients can experience relapse for different reasons. In an earlier study [<xref rid="JIV447C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], subjects who had previously experienced recurrent tuberculosis had different blood transcriptomic profiles, compared with those who remained cured after 1 tuberculosis episode, even though blood specimens were collected from subjects while they were healthy and disease free, substantiating a role of inherent difference.</p><p>The relapse-risk gene signature included an exacerbated cytotoxicity response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in vitro<italic>,</italic> accompanied by higher expression of cell cycle genes indicative of excessive lymphocyte proliferation. Patients with tuberculosis develop peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to a variety of antigens, such as Ag85A and ESAT-6 [<xref rid="JIV447C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="JIV447C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but the magnitude is reduced in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, compared with latently infected healthy people [<xref rid="JIV447C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="JIV447C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], possibly because of enhanced cell sequestration in the lungs of patients with tuberculosis or because of reduced cytolytic capacity of antigen-specific CTLs via regulatory mechanisms. Cell-mediated killing of host cells does not necessarily lead to mycobacterial killing and may drive recruitment of neutrophils. In mice, deletion of the regulatory protein PD1 leads to reduced mycobacterial control and more-rapid death [<xref rid="JIV447C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], owing to excessive lung inflammation [<xref rid="JIV447C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, conceivably, the inherently excessive cytotoxic inflammatory response in the patients with relapse led to exacerbated lung immunopathology, and the inflammatory response to remaining bacilli resumed once drug treatment ceased, causing further disease. It is possible that nonsterile cure can be achieved in most patients with tuberculosis, via development of an appropriately regulated effective T-cell response.</p><p>The 668-gene signature contained genes both up and down regulated in the relapse group compared to the cured group, with 356 genes more highly expressed in the cured group. Eight of the genes within the 18-gene highly significantly differentially expressed gene signature were more highly expressed in the cured group. These included Pragmin, which is involved in facilitating immune cell signaling by sequestering the negative regulator C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="JIV447C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; downregulation in the tuberculosis-relapse group might dampen immune cell activation. The transcription factor RUNX2 was also downregulated in patients with relapse, potentially inhibiting PI3K/AKT cell signaling [<xref rid="JIV447C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>The inherently different immune response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in patients with relapse in this study was present at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis and during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Measuring responses later in treatment might identify patients with tuberculosis relapse for further reasons. Although the 2-month sputum conversion rate is often used as an indicator of tuberculosis drug efficacy, data regarding the association between smear/culture conversion and successful tuberculosis treatment outcome are inconsistent [<xref rid="JIV447C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In 2 recent noninferiority clinical trials of gatifloxacin [<xref rid="JIV447C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or moxifloxacin [<xref rid="JIV447C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] efficacy, aimed at shortening the duration of tuberculosis treatment, substantially higher recurrence and relapse rates occurred in experimental study arms despite more-rapid sputum conversion rates, compared with arms that received standard treatment. These trials demonstrate that some patients remain at risk of relapse after early effective bacterial killing, presumably owing to mycobacterial persistence in the absence of establishment of an effective immune response.</p><p>A clinically useful algorithm for predicting tuberculosis relapse or durable cure will likely include a combination of host gene expression, serum markers and microbiological readout. In a parallel study (Ronacher K, Chegou NN, Djoba Siawaya JF, et al, unpublished data), serum tumor necrosis factor &#x003b2; and soluble interleukin 6 receptor levels at the time of diagnosis correlated with the risk of tuberculosis relapse; these cytokines are markers of an inflammatory response. The next stage in the development of biomarkers to predict tuberculosis relapse will be testing transcriptomic signatures in much larger study cohorts. The study presented here was conducted using one of the largest cohorts currently available of patients with tuberculosis relapse, but validation in a large, independent, geographically distinct cohort would prove the ability of this transcriptomic signature for predicting tuberculosis relapse. Future relapse-prediction biomarker studies could be combined with existing tuberculosis drug and vaccine trials, to facilitate sample collection in the context of high-quality clinical and microbiological data collection from large study cohorts, including HIV-positive individuals. Although ex vivo blood samples are readily collected in field trials, it is noteworthy that the 668-gene signature that discriminated patient groups in the current study was not observed in matching ex vivo samples, and in vitro antigen-specific stimulation may add further discriminatory power to a combination biosignature. It is possible that the different patient groups responded with different kinetics following in vitro stimulation, and this could also be addressed in future studies. It may be possible to facilitate wider scale roll-out by adapting methodology using other mycobacterial preparations or antigens, such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold tube cell pellets, which might allow collection of samples after overnight culture. Measurement of protein concentrations in future studies would also provide functional rationale for inclusion in predictive biosignatures.</p><p>A composite biosignature trial end point, which accurately discriminates durable cure from risk of tuberculosis relapse, would allow more compounds and regimens to be tested more rapidly and cost-effectively. Recently, bedaquiline was conditionally approved by the Food and Drug Administration for multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis treatment; approval was based on 2-month sputum conversion data [<xref rid="JIV447C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with no randomized, controlled efficacy studies, as the need for new MDR tuberculosis drug need is so acute. However, there is currently no evidence of improved treatment outcome, and the use of inappropriate surrogate markers of cure could be very damaging in tuberculosis drug and regimen development [<xref rid="JIV447C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The cytotoxic cell gene signature described here could be developed into one arm of a composite treatment outcome biosignature, which could be used for patient stratification in drugs trials. The discrimination of patients with relapse from those who achieved cure also indicates avenues of research for the development of host-directed therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiv447/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <uri xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.
