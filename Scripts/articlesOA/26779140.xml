In the present study, we studied the effect of different treatment schedules with heat-killed non-tuberculous-mycobacteria (NTM) species when given orally, based on the hypothesis of generating oral tolerance. This study included <italic>M. manresensis</italic>, a new species belonging to the <italic>fortuitum</italic> group, present in drinking water. Oral treatment with <italic>M. manresensis</italic> for 2 weeks was able to induce a PPD-specific Tregs population, which has been related to a decrease in the neutrophilic infiltration found in TB lesions. Further mechanistic analysis using PPD-stimulated splenocytes links this 2-week treatment with heat-killed <italic>M. manresensis</italic> to IL-10 production and memory PPD-specific Tregs, and also to a weak PPD-specific global immune response stimulation, increasing IL-6, TNF, and IFN-&#x003b3; production. In lungs, this treatment decreased the bacillary load, granulomatous infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, and IL-17). Oral administration of <italic>M. manresensis</italic> during standard treatment for TB also significantly reduced the relapse of active TB after ending the treatment. Overall the data suggest that the use of heat-killed <italic>M. manresensis</italic> could be a new and promising tool for avoiding active TB induction and as adjunctive to TB treatment. This supports the usefulness of generating a new kind of protection based on a complex balanced immune response focused on both destroying the bacilli and including control of an excessive inflammatory response.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium manresensis</italic></kwd><kwd>tolerance</kwd><kwd>Tregs</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>C3HeB/FeJ</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">ISCIII<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100004587</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">PI11/01702</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">PI14/01038</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">MS 13/00174</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">CP13/00174</award-id><award-id rid="cn001">IFI14/00015</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">FEDER<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100002924</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="8543"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, with 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million deaths reported in 2013 (WHO, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It is estimated that one third of the world's population is infected with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Fortunately, only a small proportion of infected subjects go on to develop the disease. Although, some host factors, mainly immunosuppression conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, drug abuse, renal failure or diabetes mellitus, are known to be related to generation of the disease, it still remains unclear why almost half of healthy adult cases develop TB.</p><p>As reviewed recently (Vilaplana and Cardona, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), research efforts to develop new treatment or preventive strategies have focused on destruction of the bacilli by identifying metabolic pathway targets (development of antimicrobial agents) or studying how the host's immune system identifies it (new vaccine development), whereas little effort has been invested in trying to modulate the host's response against the bacilli, which is paramount for understanding the development of infectious diseases (Casadevall and Pirofski, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), with TB not being an exception (Cardona, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the infection's progression to active TB is essential for finding new strategies to fight TB. In this regard, induction of liquefaction in TB lesions has been identified as a key factor that allows extracellular growth of the bacilli and the development of cavities, thereby favoring spread of the infection (Grosset, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Cardona, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). For this reason, we developed a murine model of active TB using a C3HeB/FeJ mice strain in which lesions liquefact, thus mimicking human-like progression (Marzo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Characterization of this model showed us that extracellular bacillary growth starts before the liquefaction process and is fuelled by the constant attraction of neutrophils and the induction of Neutrophilic Extracellular Traps (NETs), thereby starting a local and uncontrollable bacillary spread. This, in turn, allows fast growth of the granulomas, the induction of new lesions and the coalescence of neighboring lesions, which are responsible for the logarithmic growth of the granulomas. Once a certain size is exceeded, the center of the granulomas first develops caseous necrosis and then the caseum softens, thus leading to liquefaction (Marzo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Vilaplana and Cardona, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In this regard, a recent review of the pathology of human lesions based on necropsies from the pre-antibiotic era also highlights the key role of neutrophils as inducers of exudative lesions, which are clearly responsible for the progression toward active TB (Cardona, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In summary, we can conclude that the onset of active TB is a consequence of an excessive inflammatory response and the coalescence of different lesions (Vilaplana and Cardona, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for the key role of inflammation in progression to TB disease has also been reported by others. Thus, a detrimental role of excessive accumulation of neutrophils has been described in mice (Eruslanov et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Keller et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and, in humans, genetic studies performed with TB and leprosy patients indicated that insufficient but also excessive inflammation are key to TB pathogenesis (Tobin et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Similarly, Berry et al. found a signature of active TB that measures interferon IFN type I-inducible genes in whole blood (Berry et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Unexpectedly, the genes induced in susceptible population were expressed in neutrophils and not in T-cells, thus suggesting that over-activation of neutrophils by IFNs may contribute to TB pathogenesis.</p><p>Host-Directed Therapies (HDT) are currently becoming increasingly popular, as reviewed by Hawn et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), Zumla et al. (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and Zumla and Maeurer (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this regard, we previously tested ibuprofen (Vilaplana et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (Marzo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) in the C3HeB/FeJ model, with very promising results. We are now exploring their potential therapeutic use in humans, but as NSAIDs can produce adverse effects related to dose and length of treatment, these should be taken into account when considering long-term therapy (Michels et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Bjarnason, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>After the success obtained with the aforementioned anti-inflammatory treatment, and for safety reasons, we decided to look for a strategy that avoids the potential toxicity of these drugs and the perspective of constant administration to obtain an effective prophylactic effect. The prophylactic/therapeutic use of low dose tolerance to avoid an excessive inflammatory response has been widely used by different authors in the field of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (Ochi et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), diabetes mellitus and other autoimmune diseases (Weiner et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), as well as infectious diseases (Levy and Ilan, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and atherosclerosis (Harats et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in TB has been controversial as they were initially thought to fuel progression toward active TB. However, recent reports seem not to support this idea (Green et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Leepiyasakulchai et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), thus leading to a more neutral role in their interference against the Th1 response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>We first conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the role of Tregs in protection against the development of active TB by comparing the susceptible strain (C3HeB/FeJ) with the resistant one (C3H/HeN). We then tested the usefulness of low-dose heat-killed <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) cells and their protective role. Finally, we tested different environmental NTM species in order to ensure any possible transfer of this strategy to the market and further characterized the effect of the species that provided the best results.</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Female C3HeB/FeJ and C3H/HeN specific-pathogen-free mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and Harlan Labs (Castellar del Vall&#x000e8;s, Catalonia, Spain).

First, 6 mice from each strain were infected and sacrificed at 3 weeks post-infection to evaluate Treg population in spleen. This experiment was repeated with a final time point of week 2 post-infection, the splenocytes collected being cultured for 7 days. In the third experiment, a total of 12 C3H/HeN mice were infected, and one group was Treg-depleted <italic>in vivo</italic> by administration of anti-mouse CD25 antibody (Clone PC61.5, eBioscience Inc. San Diego, CA) the day before the infection. Blood was collected at different time points to evaluate Treg depletion by flow cytometry. Animals were sacrificed at day 46 post-infection to evaluate lung histopathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment preparation</title><p>Different mycobacteria from the Experimental Tuberculosis Unit strain collection, namely <italic>M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. avium</italic>, and <italic>M. manresensis</italic> (new species, Rech et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref> CECT 8638) were used to prepare the treatments. <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG Danish (Pfizer Inc., NY, USA) was also used.

The bacillary load (BL) of each culture was determined by serial dilution and culture on 7H11 plates, and a Blood Agar plate was also seeded to rule out contamination. Cultures were then inactivated by heating at 80&#x000b0;C for 60 min. Sterilization was confirmed by negative culture in 7H11 (10 plates), Blood Agar, McConkey Agar, and Saboureaud Agar. The inactivated cultures were diluted 1:1 in sterile sucrose (10% sucrose in water) and aliquoted in 1 ml vials for storage at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of treatments</title><p>The effect of treatment on the survival of infected mice was studied. This assessment was done for each treatment when given prophylactically and therapeutically at different doses (10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>6</sup> heat-killed bacilli/animal) and administration schedules (every day, every other day, three times-a-week). The results presented here were repeated 3 times, using 10 C3HeB/FeJ mice per group (a total of 120 animals).</p><p>In order to further characterize the effect of treatment, we evaluated several parameters at week 3 post-infection. For this purpose a total of 20 C3HeB/FeJ mice were used (5 per group of treatment).

At the final time point, pathology and BL in lungs, and effect on T cell populations were studied (see Sections 2.6 to 2.8). A control group was included and treated with the corresponding dilution of the excipient (mannitol).</p><p>The oral administration of heat-killed mycobacteria as a coadjuvant therapy to the human standard treatment against active TB (a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (RHEZ)) was also studied. A total of 21 C3HeB/FeJ mice were used. They started to be treated at week 4 post-infection, when their weight started to decrease. All animals received a commercial combination of the four drugs (RIMSTAR&#x000ae;, Sandoz Farmaceutica, Barcelona) adjusted to their weight, for a total of 4 weeks. Half of the animals also received heat-killed <italic>M. manresensis</italic> (10<sup>5</sup> heat-killed bacilli/animal) orally, 5 days a week for a total of 6 weeks (in addition to the 4-week-treatment with RHEZ, plus 2 more weeks).

One animal from the Treg-depleted group was sacrificed at day 32 for ethical reasons as it exhibited a marked TB infection in the lungs.

This treatment regimen seems to interfere with the excessive inflammatory response, a fact that appears to be key to the development of human-like lesions (Cardona, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and thus is also able to reduce the bacillary concentration in lungs (Marzo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In our opinion, this could be related to the induction of Tregs.</p><p>It is well established that dose and route of administration determine the immune response to an administered antigen (Faria and Weiner, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), therefore we have good reason to think that our regimen induces tolerance to the mycobacteria bacilli. Continuous oral administration modifies the response triggered by the infection through Tregs, as has also been seen in other infectious or autoimmune diseases (Harats et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Ochi et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Levy and Ilan, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Weiner et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that treatment with heat-killed bacilli is effective for reducing both the infiltration area and the bacillary load in lungs, in addition to increasing survival. As such, we then decided to further characterize the effect of treatment on the immune system to prove that tolerance is induced.</p><p>In this regard we first investigated the role of Tregs in our model as it was feasible that oral tolerance could be articulated through this type of cell. The role of Tregs in Mtb infection is controversial, with some authors considering the induction of Tregs to be detrimental (Ribeiro-Rodrigues et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Chiacchio et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) but others pointing to a protective role for Tregs (Leepiyasakulchai et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). To investigate the role of Tregs in our experimental system we compared the Treg population in C3HeB/FeJ mice with their positive controls (C3H/HeN mice), which share the MHC haplotype but have a different susceptibility to Mtb (Marzo et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). We found that the better outcome was associated with a stronger regulatory immune response in the C3H/HeN strain, as the Treg percentage was higher (also PPD-specific response), and when we depleted C3H/HeN mice of Treg by administration of anti-CD25 the susceptibility to Mtb increased. Two out of five mice developed necrotic lesions, whereas in several experiments conducted by our group with this mouse strain, no animals have either died or developed such necrotic lesions. Although, T CD4+CD25+ cells include Tregs as well as potential T CD4+CD25+CD39&#x02212; Th subsets (Dwyer et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), the latter account for about 1% of all T CD4+, therefore Treg depletion is far more relevant. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that Tregs are protective in TB, therefore we continued our research by studying the effect of treatment with heat-killed mycobacteria on Tregs.</p><p>As we were interested in the induction of memory Tregs, we designed the concept of 7 days incubation, together with a study of the CD39 marker. We believe this marker to be very relevant as it has been related to both the memory phenotype and induction of tolerance (Borsellino et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Dwyer et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Roberts et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Furthermore, unlike Foxp3, it is a surface marker, which translates into less aggressive cell processing and easier and faster protocols. Other relevant T cell subtypes, such as T memory effector cells CD25-CD39+, which have shown to play a detrimental role in organ transplantation in humans, or T effector cells, both of which are capable of secreting IL-17, and thus having a pro-inflammatory profile (Dwyer et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), were also studied with the marker combination used. Apart from being used in the study of autoimmune diseases, this CD25 CD39 marker combination has been validated as a Treg marker in the study of TB, exhibiting a negative correlation with IL-17 T cells in peripheral blood (Chiacchio et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; de Cassan et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Use of these markers showed an increase in Treg cells in splenocyte cultures from treated mice, together with a slight global stimulation. The levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF, and IL-6 were increased in cultured spleen samples from mice treated with <italic>M. manresensis</italic>. This suggest a global stimulation that also includes an increase in the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, which can be related to the increase in Treg, as seen by other authors who used 10<sup>6</sup> heat-killed <italic>M. chelonae</italic> intraperitoneally once a week for 3 weeks (Ho et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In that study, the authors also demonstrated a parallel increase in IFN-&#x003b3;, although they did not check for IL-6 or TNF. The most important aspect, however, is that the increase in IL-6 was not linked to the presence of IL-17 (Gao et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), which was undetectable, and this is logical as an exaggerated inflammatory response with neutrophilic attraction is not seen in the spleen in the C3HeB/FeJ model, where there is also effective control of bacillary load (data not shown). This could be due to the fact of the presence of Treg counterbalancing IFN type I production (Srivastava et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Aida et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), thus favoring the increased IFN&#x003b3; response (Manca et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>); or because of the lack of PMN infiltration in the spleen prevents the production of type I IFN (Berry et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), thus favoring the presence of both Tregs and IFN-gamma in this organ in the context of Mtb infection. However, further experiments would be needed to investigate this issue.</p><p>A lower inflammatory milieu was found in the lungs of mice treated with <italic>M. manresensis</italic> when compared to control animals, with lower levels of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-17, and IL-6. In our opinion, the population of PPD-specific memory Tregs is attracted to the lungs and must be crucial for reducing the inflammatory response in situ, specially by counterbalancing the Th17 response (Zhou et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Zheng et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Lung histopathology of mice treated with RHEZ shows how the addition of heat-killed <italic>M. manresensis</italic> is able to stop the progression of the lesions, favoring the fibrosis of the tissue which might contribute to create an anti-inflammatory milieu able to abrogate the growth of the bacilli by curtailing the infiltration of the lesion with monocytes or PMN. This phenomenon is amplified in big-mammals thanks to the stimulation of the fibroblasts of the intralobar septae, that encapsulate the lesions at very early stages, promoting this anti-inflammatory milieu and stopping the bacillary growth (Gil et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Cardona, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The modulatory effect of NTM was demonstrated years ago after intravenous inoculation was shown to induce a non-specific cellular immune response (Collins, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>) and protect against subsequent aerosol Mtb infection to a similar degree as in BCG vaccinated mice (Orme and Collins, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>). On the other hand, subcutaneous sensitization with <italic>M. avium</italic> interfered with BCG vaccination by stopping its growth, although this was not seen after sensitization with <italic>M. chelonae</italic> or <italic>M. fortuitum</italic> (Brandt et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). The recent study by Poyntz et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) is interesting as it shows how important the route of administration for NTM is (in this case, <italic>M. avium</italic>). An increase in Th1 response can be detected when inoculating heat-killed IP several times, thereby increasing the efficacy of BCG, whereas oral administration of living bacilli tended to increase Th2 response in the lung during Mtb infection and reduced the protection against Mtb infection. Treatment with heat-killed <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic>, which has been used for the treatment of active TB (von Reyn et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and has recently been reviewed by Gr&#x000f6;schel et al. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), deserves particular attention due to its ability to reduce Th2 responses and increase Th1 ones.</p><p>Finally, it is relevant to recall that studies in BCG-vaccinated infants in the United Kingdom or in Malawi showed no evidence that the initial response to NTM affected the vaccine-induced change in IFN-&#x003b3; response (Weir et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting to note that, to date, no surrogates of protection have been found in TB. Th1 responses, including poly-functional cells, have received attention for a number of years, although an evaluation of their protective value in a large BCG trial in South Africa showed that protected and unprotected newborns exhibited an equivalent immunological profile (Kagina et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In this sense, our paper may also help to shed some light on other biomarkers that are more closely related to the induction of a balanced immune response and are able to avoid an excessive inflammatory response than can lead to active TB, instead of focussing on an immune response that exclusively targets destruction of the bacilli.</p><p>In conclusion, induction of a balanced immune response triggered by PPD-specific memory Tregs through the administration of heat-killed <italic>M. manresensis</italic> has demonstrated an ability to protect against the progression of Mtb infection to active disease and relapse after TB treatment. This has been demonstrated in the experimental model induced in C3HeB/FeJ mice, which reproduce &#x0201c;human-like&#x0201d; lesions. This finding might help to focus on a new kind of &#x0201c;host-directed&#x0201d; prophylactic and therapeutic approach as well as the development of new predictive biomarkers.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author contributions</title><p>EM and PJC had substantially contributed to the conception and design of the work.
