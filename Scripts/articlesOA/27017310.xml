Briefly, 6,363 healthy adolescents, aged 12&#x02013;18 years, were enrolled between July 2005 and April 2007; follow-up was completed by February 2009 (exclusion criteria and more detail in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Appendices</xref>). Approximately half the participants were evaluated at enrollment and every 6 months during 2 years follow-up; the other half was evaluated at baseline and at 2 years.

According to South African policy, QFT and/or TST positive adolescents were not given therapy to prevent tuberculosis disease.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Adolescents who developed active tuberculosis disease during follow-up were included as &#x0201c;progressors&#x0201d; (cases). Tuberculosis was defined as intrathoracic disease, with either two sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli or one positive sputum culture confirmed as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> complex (mycobacterial growth indicator tube, BD BioSciences). For each progressor, two matched controls that remained healthy during follow-up were selected and matched by age at enrolment, gender, ethnicity, school of attendance, and presence or absence of prior episodes of tuberculosis disease. Participants were excluded if they developed tuberculosis disease within 6 months of enrollment to exclude early asymptomatic disease that could have been present at the time of evaluation, or if they were HIV infected. Prior to analysis, the ACS progressors (cases) and controls were randomly divided into training and test sets, at a ratio of 3:1 using the randomization function in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Microsoft Excel</xref>.</p><p id="P61">The other cohorts consisted of South African and Gambian participants from the Grand Challenges 6-74 Study (GC6-74; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.case.edu/affil/tbru/collaborations_gates.html">http://www.case.edu/affil/tbru/collaborations_gates.html</ext-link>), who were enrolled between February 2005 and December 2010 to independently validate the tuberculosis risk signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>).

At baseline, at 6 months (The Gambia only) and at 18 months (both sites), participants were evaluated clinically and blood was collected and stored in PAXgene tubes as above. Follow-up continued for 2 years, and concluded in November 2012. Among GC6-74 participants, progressors (cases) had intrathoracic tuberculosis, defined on the basis of sputum culture, smear microscopy and clinical signs. For each progressor, four controls were matched according to recruitment region, age category (&#x02264;18, 19&#x02013;25, 26&#x02013;35, &#x02265; 36 years), gender and year of enrolment.</p><p id="P62">The study protocols were approved by relevant human research ethics committees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Appendix 3</xref>).

We have identified a gene expression signature for predicting risk of tuberculosis disease progression. This signature was discovered in a longitudinal analysis of South African adolescents with latent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection who either developed tuberculosis disease or remained healthy. The signature was then validated on blinded samples from untouched adolescents of the same parent cohort. The signatures were again validated, in independent cohorts of longitudinally followed household contacts of tuberculosis disease patients from South Africa and The Gambia, who either developed tuberculosis disease or remained healthy. These results demonstrate that it is possible to predict progression from latent to active disease, using whole blood gene expression measurements at any single time point up to 18 months before tuberculosis disease manifests.</p><p id="P82">The tuberculosis risk signature was discovered using RNA-Seq, a transcriptome analysis technology that is quantitative, sensitive, and unbiased.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The signature was formulated using a framework termed SVM, an extension of the k-TSP approach<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which robustly generates a tuberculosis risk score from gene expression data, using simple arithmetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 11</xref>). The signature was adapted from RNA-Seq to qRT-PCR, a more targeted and affordable technology. The power of the approach was demonstrated by blinded validation of the qRT-PCR-based signature in the independent cohorts.</p><p id="P83">The tuberculosis risk signature predicted tuberculosis disease progression despite marked diversity between the ACS and GC6-74 cohorts. This result is encouraging given the different age ranges (adolescents versus adults), different infection or exposure status, distinct ethnicity and genetic backgrounds,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> differing local epidemiology,<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and differing circulating strains of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic><sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> between South Africa and The Gambia. It is conceivable that distinct mechanisms of progression will be revealed when specific sub-groups of progressors are analysed (e.g., early vs. late progressors in GC6-74). Targeted analyses to identify distinct mechanisms of progression are underway.</p><p id="P84">To explore potential application of the signature for targeted preventive therapy, we estimated the relative risk for tuberculosis disease between signature positive and negative persons from a representative adult population from South Africa, where tuberculosis is endemic. The relative risk of tuberculosis disease is approximately 2 when IGRA or TST is used<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, whereas the relative risk using our risk signature was between 6 and 14. Moreover, this risk signature would aid in detection of asymptomatic and or undiagnosed tuberculosis disease. For example, when applied to combined data from 4 studies of HIV uninfected South African adults<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, involving 130 prevalent tuberculosis cases and 230 controls, the signature discriminated between active tuberculosis patients and uninfected or tuberculosis infected healthy controls with 87% sensitivity and 97% specificity.</p><p id="P85">Although our focus was on prospective prediction of tuberculosis disease, we also showed that the risk signature was excellent for differentiating tuberculosis disease from latent infection and from other disease states. This ability to diagnose tuberculosis disease was not markedly impacted by HIV status. The risk signature could also diagnose culture positive childhood tuberculosis, but not culture negative childhood disease.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> These results suggest that the risk signature might reflect bacterial load in the lung, as culture positive childhood tuberculosis is likely associated with higher bacterial loads, compared with culture negative disease. An association between the risk signature and bacterial load was further supported by meta-analysis of a published treatment study<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, in which the signature relaxed during 6 months of antimicrobial therapy. It is presently not known whether the risk signature will be useful for predicting treatment failure or recurrence.</p><p id="P86">While enrichment analysis of published blood signatures for active tuberculosis implicates a variety of biological processes in the disease, the gene module &#x0201c;interferon response&#x0201d; was the sole module that was over-represented in the risk signature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Tables 19&#x02013;21</xref>). Overlap between 15 of the 16 genes in our prospective TB risk signature and the 393 gene signature of active tuberculosis disease from Berry, <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> suggests that chronic peripheral activation of the interferon response precedes the onset of active disease and the inflammatory manifestations of tuberculosis disease revealed by previously published gene expression studies<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Although additional research is required to understand the functional role of interferon responses during tuberculosis progression, pathogen induction of type I interferons and their detrimental effects on immunity to tuberculosis have been shown in several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments of human cells.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Nevertheless, not all interferon response genes may be associated with a poor outcome, as we showed that genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and TAP1 may play a protective role during tuberculosis infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 18</xref>).</p><p id="P87">Our predictive signature was obtained from transcriptomic analysis of peripheral whole blood. This compartment, although conveniently sampled, may not accurately reflect pathogenic events in the lung, primarily affected by tuberculosis disease. Regardless, circulating white blood cells can serve as sentinels of lung pathophysiology, as transcriptional changes occur when the cells migrate through this organ. To explore a possible cell-type specific origin of the risk signature, we used data from published global gene expression in whole blood and sorted PBMC, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells from healthy controls and tuberculosis patients<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Differential expression of the risk signature genes between healthy controls and tuberculosis patients was comparable in whole blood and PBMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Supplementary Table 22</xref>), suggesting that contribution of granulocytes to the risk signature is redundant. Consistent with this result, comparable differential expression of risk signature genes was observed in monocytes and neutrophils. When compared to the diagnostic signature of Berry, <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, reported to be derived from neutrophils, these results suggest that progression to active tuberculosis involves more diverse cell types.</p><p id="P88">To date, Sloot, <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> published the only report of prospective associations between blood gene expression and tuberculosis disease risk. Using a pre-defined 141 gene panel, PBMC RNA expression in 15 HIV infected drug users who ultimately developed active tuberculosis disease was compared with 16 who did not develop tuberculosis. Four genes assayed exhibited nominal expression differences (unadjusted p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05) and, when combined, two genes, IL-13 and AIRE, fit the data (ROC AUC fit = 0&#x000b7;8). The association between these genes and tuberculosis progression was not validated in a test set or independent cohort; none of the four genes exhibited differences between progressors and controls in our whole blood RNA-Seq datasets.</p><p id="P89">Our results, demonstrating that blood-based signatures in healthy individuals can predict progression to active tuberculosis disease, pave the way for the establishment of diagnostic tools that are scalable and inexpensive. An important first step would be to test whether the signature can predict tuberculosis disease in the general population, rather than the select populations included in this project; for example, the risk of TB disease in our populations was much higher than the lifetime risk of 10% encountered in the general population. The newly described signature holds potential for highly targeted preventive therapy, and therefore for interrupting the global epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS773529-supplement-1.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1178" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>01</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS773529-supplement-01.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e1182" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN6"><p id="P90" content-type="publisher-disclaimer">This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

QFT: Quantiferon Gold In-Tube. TST: tuberculin skin test.

The tuberculosis risk signature was obtained by data mining of a whole blood RNA-Seq dataset generated from the ACS training set. The predictive potential of the risk signature was evaluated by rigorous cross-validation. The tuberculosis risk signature was adapted to qRT-PCR, and then the RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR versions of the signature were employed to predict tuberculosis progression using untouched blinded samples from the ACS test set. The qRT-PCR-based tuberculosis risk signature was then employed to predict tuberculosis progression using untouched blinded samples from the South African and Gambian cohorts of GC6-74. (B) Synchronization of the ACS training set in terms of the clinical outcome. To ensure optimal extraction of a tuberculosis risk signature from the ACS training set, the time scale of the RNA-Seq dataset was re-aligned according to tuberculosis diagnosis instead of study enrolment, allowing gene expression differences to be measured before disease diagnosis. Each progressor within the ACS training set is represented by a horizontal bar. The length of the bar represents the number of days between study enrolment and diagnosis with active tuberculosis. During follow-up, each progressor transitioned from an asymptomatic healthy state (green) to pulmonary disease (red). Left side: alignment of PAXgene sample collection (black points) with respect to study enrolment. Right side: alignment of PAXgene sample collection with respect to diagnosis with active tuberculosis, for use in analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms773529f2"/></fig><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>The tuberculosis risk signature and validation by prediction of tuberculosis disease progression in the untouched ACS test set and the independent GC6-74 cohorts</title><p id="P101">(A) Heatmap depicting relative expression level of genes comprising the tuberculosis risk signature in progressors, compared with controls. Higher expression in progressors relative to controls is indicated by intensity of red colour; the average and standard devations (+ and &#x02212;) are shown. Individual heatmap rows represent distinct splice junctions of individual genes that comprise the signature. Relative expression in each of four 180-day time windows prior to tuberculosis diagnosis is shown. (B) The tuberculosis risk signature was generated by assessing multiple gene-pair interactions; two representative gene-pair signatures are shown. In each scatterplot, the normalized expression of one gene within the pair is plotted against that of the other gene, for all ACS training set data points. The black dots represent control samples, whereas the red dots represent progressor samples. The dotted black line indicates the optimal linear decision boundary for discriminating progressors from controls. (C) Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) depicting the predictive potential of the tuberculosis risk signature for discriminating progressors from controls. Each ROC curve corresponds to a 180-day interval prior to tuberculosis diagnosis. Prediction performance was assessed by 100 four-to-one training-to-test splits of the ACS training set. (D) ROC curves for blind prediction of tuberculosis disease progression on untouched ACS test set samples using the RNA-Seq-based (dotted line) or qRT-PCR-based (solid line) signature. (E) Blind prediction on the combined GC6-74 cohort (blue), South African cohort (purple) or Gambian cohort (green); (F) Stratification of prediction on the overall GC6-74 cohort by time before tuberculosis diagnosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms773529f3"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p id="P102">Cross-validation
