The mRNA profiles of bacilli through the first 2 weeks of therapy reflected drug activity at 3 days with transcriptional signatures at days 7 and 14 consistent with reduced <italic>M.tb</italic> metabolic activity similar to the profile of pre-chemotherapy bacilli. These results suggest that a pre-existing drug-tolerant <italic>M.tb</italic> population dominates sputum before and after early drug treatment, and that the mRNA signature at day 3 marks the killing of a drug-sensitive sub-population of bacilli. Modelling patient indices of disease severity with bacterial gene expression patterns demonstrated that both microbiological and clinical parameters were reflected in the divergent <italic>M.tb</italic> responses and provided evidence that factors such as bacterial load and disease pathology influence the host-pathogen interplay and the phenotypic state of bacilli.

New drug regimens are needed to maintain and improve therapy for tuberculosis, shortening treatment duration and targeting drug-resistant bacilli which complicate 3.5 % of new and 20.5 % of previously-treated TB cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The standard chemotherapy regimen for drug-sensitive TB uses combinations of 4 drugs over 6 months. The recommended treatment for multidrug-resistant TB lasts 18&#x02013;24 months or more, with increasingly toxic combinations of second-line drugs. Extended periods of chemotherapy are required to remove sub-populations of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M.tb</italic>) bacilli that persist through the early phase of antimicrobial drug treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent treatment shortening trial failed to show non-inferiority despite evidence that the experimental regimens were more bactericidal in the first 4 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Evidence for the existence of persister populations recalcitrant to treatment is accumulating; quantitation of mycobacteria in serial sputum samples during treatment with regimens containing isoniazid display a characteristic biphasic pattern of killing, indicative of the presence of multiple populations of <italic>M.tb</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The exposure of sputum-derived bacilli to resuscitation-promoting factors unmasks a previously-unculturable drug-tolerant population of <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and sub-populations of bacilli that only grow in liquid culture and not on solid media may represent 90 % of bacilli in sputum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar <italic>M.tb</italic> populations have also been identified in chronic murine tuberculosis models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and generated in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Microfluidic systems have revealed heterogeneous mycobacterial responses to antibiotic exposure in genetically-homogenous populations, providing a basis for the generation of such sub-populations in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is unlikely that the duration of tuberculosis chemotherapy will be reduced until drug regimens are identified that can kill these persister sub-populations.</p><p>Success in tuberculosis chemotherapy is measured by the proportion of patients who fail therapy or who relapse after treatment is completed; therapy is monitored by counting <italic>M.tb</italic> in sputum and assaying markers of drug toxicity. Clinical or microbiological parameters, such as number of lung cavities or extent of lung cavitation, <italic>M.tb</italic> culture positivity at 2 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] or bacterial load in sputum before the start of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], are associated with early treatment success but are poor predictors of treatment outcome. For example, use of a combination of biomarkers, culture negativity at 2 months and low extent of cavitation by X-ray, failed to be predictive of individuals where treatment could be shortened from 6 to 4 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, molecular profiling assays, such as those used to identify tuberculosis disease from patient blood transcriptional signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], have not been applied to bacteria during patient drug therapy to assess the predictive power of dynamic bacterial responses to antimicrobial drug exposure.</p><p>The transcriptional signature of <italic>M.tb</italic> reflects the bacterial physiological state and offers insight into the mechanisms required to survive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An increased understanding of which <italic>M.tb</italic> bacterial phenotypes survive chemotherapy during natural infection will aid the design of novel intervention strategies. To this end, <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli have been profiled from in vitro models that mimic hypothesized features of <italic>M.tb</italic> persister populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Investigation of the mRNA signature of <italic>M.tb</italic> derived from human sputa revealed a slow/non-growing gene expression pattern alongside an accumulation of lipid bodies, a &#x02018;fat and lazy&#x02019; phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, by mapping the differential expression of <italic>M.tb</italic> respiratory pathways, the microenvironment surrounding bacilli was predicted to be, at least in part, hypoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This observation was confirmed by 3-dimensional PET-CT imaging of human lungs that highlighted the hypoxic and dynamic nature of lesions within an individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Transcriptional profiling the response of bacilli to drug exposure in vitro has helped to define antimicrobial drug class of action and mechanisms that may influence drug efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These drug-inducible signatures, used as a bioprobe, may also identify drug-tolerant <italic>M.tb</italic> populations by classifying divergent responses to drug exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>This study profiles sputum <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional responses during the first 14 days of standard anti-tuberculous therapy, testing the hypothesis that persister-type bacilli are the dominant population in human sputum. Drug-induced changes in <italic>M.tb</italic> gene expression were observed 3 days after the start of chemotherapy that were not evident at 7 or 14 days. Furthermore, the profile of bacilli derived from sputum one or two weeks after drug therapy resembled pre-treatment sputum bacilli. This suggests that bacilli with a phenotype able to survive drug therapy were already present prior to the commencement of treatment. Bacteria with a drug-responsive phenotype during days 0 to 3 were no-longer present by day 7 and were presumably killed. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the diverse pathology of human disease influences the phenotype of <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli in sputum. We show that microbiological (bacterial load) and clinical (number of cavities) measures of disease were predicted from the changing <italic>M.tb</italic> sputum signature over time, as were parameters with prognostic value (positive TTP or MBL TB test, and bacterial load at 2 months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient sample collection, clinical and molecular parameters</title><p>Subjects with active pulmonary tuberculosis (HIV negative, sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB) were recruited in primary healthcare tuberculosis clinics in the Western Cape Province, South Africa following local ethical approval (Stellenbosch University Health Research Ethics Committee, Study no 99/039).

Clinical parameters measuring severity of disease, such as average chest radiograph (CXR) score and number of observable cavities, were recorded. Briefly, full-sized CXRs (postero-anterior and lateral) were obtained and read by a pulmonologist blinded to patient clinical history using a standardized protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Expectorated sputum was immediately collected into 4 M GTC solution at the clinic as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and frozen at -80 &#x000b0;C. For each patient, samples were collected before the start of chemotherapy, and 3, 7 and 14 days after initiation of treatment. Standard 5 day/week clinic-based directly observed treatment (DOT) was given by routine clinic nurses using fixed-dose combinations, with dose adjustment based on patient body weight. Treatment consisted of a 2-month intensive phase of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, followed by a 4-month continuation phase of rifampicin and isoniazid. Treatment was monitored using microbiological (BACTEC 460) time-to-positivity scores (TTP) at diagnosis (day 0), day 7 and day 14, and by the molecular bacterial load (MBL) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] at diagnosis (day 0), day 3, 7, 14 and 56.

To investigate whether the gene expression trajectories over the first two weeks of therapy followed classifiable patterns, the patients (k) were divided into two classes based on the variance of the PC data points along the principal component axis: <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212; 1, <italic>if var</italic>(<italic>PC</italic>1)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;<italic>var</italic>(<italic>PC</italic>2) <italic>and y</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, <italic>otherwise</italic>. That is, the class corresponds to the principal component axis along which the PC data points of a patient has larger variance. These target classes were modelled using support vector machine (SVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] with gene expression data or clinical/microbiological variables as the predictors to define gene signatures or clinical variables, after applying stability selection or forward feature selection, respectively, that explained the patient trajectories.</p><p>The relationships between the <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional profile and patient clinical/microbiological variables were defined using machine learning methods.

A total of 500 sub-sampling iterations were performed with a sub-sample that consisted of 500 features (columns in <italic>X</italic>) and 2/3 of the samples (rows in <italic>X</italic>). Stability selection yielded a set of stable, most predictive features of a particular clinical variable, which was used to train a regression or classification model. To optimize the number of features and to determine the predictive performance of the models, nested leave-one-out cross-validation was carried out, in which the inner loop determined the optimal number of variables and the outer loop the error of the model (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S1). The reported errors are the average prediction errors of the test samples in the outer loop. Continuous clinical variables time-to-positivity and average chest X-ray score were modelled with L1-norm regression (Lasso) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the performance evaluated with root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient between the fitted and true values.

A total of 1083 genes were significantly differentially expressed in sputum-derived bacilli (day 0) compared to log phase growth, which revealed adaptations to respiratory and metabolic pathways (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>/<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2 and Figure S3). The sputum transcriptional signature was dominated by the repression of genes involved in intermediate metabolism (II.A) and ribosome synthesis (II.A.1). These functional categories (defined by Cole et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) were significantly over-represented amongst down-regulated genes (hypergeometric probabilities of 9.4x10<sup>-15</sup> and 3.1x10<sup>-30</sup>, respectively). This drop in markers of cellular activity was accompanied with the repression of central metabolism and lipid biosynthesis, including the citric acid cycle (<italic>gltA2</italic>, <italic>kgd</italic>, <italic>mdh</italic>, <italic>korA/B</italic>, <italic>sucC</italic>, <italic>rv0247c/48c</italic>, f<italic>umC</italic> and <italic>mqo</italic>), FAS-1 (<italic>fas</italic>), FAS-II (<italic>fabD</italic>, <italic>acpM</italic>, <italic>kasA</italic>/<italic>B</italic>, <italic>fabG1</italic> and <italic>inhA</italic>), and mycolic acid synthesis and modification (<italic>mmaA2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>/<italic>4</italic>, <italic>cmaA2</italic>, <italic>pcaA</italic>, <italic>fadD32</italic> and <italic>pks13</italic>) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Conversely, genes involved in the glyoxylate shunt pathway and methylcitrate cycle (<italic>icl</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic> and <italic>rv1129c</italic>), catabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and the predicted triacylglycerol synthases (<italic>rv1425</italic>, <italic>rv1760</italic>, <italic>rv3087</italic> and <italic>rv3371</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] were induced in sputum-derived bacilli. Thus, the <italic>M.tb</italic> sputum transcriptome suggests that central carbon metabolism and general metabolic activity is reduced in bacilli expectorated from the lungs of tuberculosis patients, with an increased emphasis on lipolytic pathways. The transcriptomic evidence also predicted that the respiratory state of bacilli was altered in sputum with the down-regulation of NADH dehydrogenase I (<italic>nuoD</italic>/<italic>E</italic>/<italic>F</italic>/<italic>G</italic>/<italic>K</italic>), cytochrome C reductase (<italic>qcrA</italic>/<italic>B</italic>/<italic>C</italic>) and aa3 cytochrome C reductase (<italic>ctaC</italic>/<italic>D</italic>/<italic>E</italic>) pathways that are utilized in aerobic and microaerophilic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Correspondingly, genes involved in nitrate reduction (<italic>narK2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>) were induced, indicating the potential for a switch to alternative electron acceptors and anaerobic respiration. These adaptations are likely to be mediated in part by the transcriptional regulator DosR (DevR) that is induced by hypoxia and nitric oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], with several DosR-regulated genes significantly up-regulated in sputa (<italic>nrdZ</italic>, <italic>narK2</italic>, <italic>rv1738</italic>, <italic>pfkB</italic>, <italic>hspX</italic>, <italic>hrp1</italic>, <italic>rv3126c</italic> and <italic>rv3128c</italic>). Energy metabolism was also affected as ATP synthase genes (<italic>atpA</italic>-<italic>G</italic>) were repressed in sputum-derived bacilli; unsurprisingly the functional categories for aerobic respiration (1.B.6.a) and ATP-proton motive force (1.B.8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] were significantly enriched in those genes down-regulated in sputum (hg p-values 6.5x10<sup>-5</sup> and 3.2x10<sup>-8</sup>, respectively).

Thus, the gross changes to metabolic and respiratory pathways are comparable between sputum-derived bacilli before and during chemotherapy. However, the magnitude of transcriptional adaptations was elevated at day 14 compared to day 0; using aerobic log phase bacilli as a comparator, 594 genes were significantly induced (605 genes repressed) at 14 days in contrast to 528 up-regulated genes (555 down-regulated genes) at day 0 (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: Figure S2, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S2).

Therefore, the PC trajectories were grouped into two classes according to the direction of movement in principal component space (South-North or East-West).

This conclusion is supported by evidence from other studies identifying large non-culturable on solid media or rpf-dependent <italic>M.tb</italic> sub-populations in sputum prior to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>An inflection point in the mRNA profile 3 days after the start of drug treatment, of stress-responsive genes including mediators of drug efflux, likely represents the effects of anti-TB drug action, using bacterial mRNA responses as a bioprobe for cidal drug action during natural disease. This transcriptional signature was only observed 3 days into therapy and was absent after 7 or 14 days, where the mRNA patterns were more similar to sputa bacilli before treatment. We hypothesize that the mRNA signature at day 3 marks the killing of a drug-sensitive sub-population of bacilli, since these responses are not detected after drug exposure in phenotypically drug-tolerant bacilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. By mapping previously-characterized in vitro <italic>M.tb</italic> transcriptional responses to antimicrobial drugs, we were able to define the in vivo action of standard regimen chemotherapy in a clinical setting. The expression of isoniazid-inducible benchmark genes (<italic>iniB</italic>, <italic>efpA</italic>) at day 3 alone suggest that the sputum bacterial population profiled here 1 week after the start of chemotherapy no longer respond to the antimicrobial actions of isoniazid. This finding supports the Walter et al. study that detected an isoniazid response in sputa bacilli 2 days after the start of drug therapy that disappeared 7 days into treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and mirrors evidence describing the bimodal early bactericidal activity of isoniazid in combination regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>This study should be seen as capturing changes in <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA abundance rather than differential transcriptional regulation since the structure of the underlying <italic>M.tb</italic> population is unknown. Therefore, the transcriptional read-out described here represents the average changes in gene expression from shifting mycobacterial sub-populations found in sputum. As such, lack of a response to drug therapy might reflect limited exposure of bacilli to antimicrobial drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and/or the presence of drug-tolerant bacterial populations that are able to survive drug treatment. The development of mycobacterial phenotypic drug tolerance has been described in many in vitro models for tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is often associated with a slow/non-replicating bacterial state, such as that inferred from the sputum <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA signature. Moreover, recent observations using single cell reporter technology described the development of non-growing but metabolically-active mycobacterial sub-populations during murine infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our study further emphasizes the significance of drug-tolerant bacilli in human tuberculosis, identifying a transcriptionally-active <italic>M.tb</italic> population that persists through 2 weeks of standard chemotherapy.</p><p>Modelling <italic>M.tb</italic> gene expression in the sputa of patients over time revealed that the transcriptional pattern of bacilli varied from patient to patient with drug treatment. Correlation of patient indices of disease severity with bacterial mRNA signatures showed that basic microbiological (time-to-positivity, bacterial load at day 0) and clinical (chest radiograph score) parameters were reflected in the divergent <italic>M.tb</italic> responses. These associations suggest that factors such as bacterial load and disease pathology influence the host-pathogen interplay and, thus, the phenotypic state of bacilli, which in turn might affect the natural history of patient disease. Importantly, this demonstrates for the first time that the diverse pathology of tuberculosis affects measurable changes on the phenotype of <italic>M.tb</italic> bacilli in sputa. Notably, transcriptional signatures were also identified that predicted measures of early treatment success (rate of decline in bacterial load over 3 days, MBL or TTP positivity at 2 months, bacterial load at 2 months). Although this study was not significantly powered to test these signatures, these observations highlight the potential use of assaying dynamic bacterial phenotypes through drug therapy as biomarkers for treatment efficacy. These data are supported by recent evidence suggesting that higher percentages of lipid-body-positive acid-fast bacilli 3&#x02013;4 weeks after the start of treatment, rather than initial baseline counts, correlated with treatment failure or relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. We demonstrate here a novel concept and proof-of-principle that proposes using the changing transcriptional state of infecting bacilli to monitor treatment success.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study defines the transcriptional signature of bacilli in sputum after 2 weeks of drug treatment, mapping the molecular phenotype of persister-type bacilli. We demonstrate for the first time that variability in clinical manifestations of disease are detectable in bacterial sputa signatures, and that the changing <italic>M.tb</italic> mRNA profiles 0&#x02013;2 weeks into chemotherapy predict the efficacy of treatment 6 weeks later. These findings advocate a novel biomarker discovery strategy, profiling the phenotype of infecting bacteria, to find predictive markers of treatment success that are desperately needed in clinical trials and to stratify at-risk patients in the clinic.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Fully annotated microarray data have been deposited in ArrayExpress, accession number: E-MTAB-3872.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12916_2016_609_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Participants&#x02019; molecular, microbiological and clinical parameters.
