Numerous studies have established a close correlation between the development of tuberculosis and the roles of neutrophils. Recently, a distinct population of CD15<sup>+</sup> granulocytes was found to be present in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction in humans. This population of granulocytes, termed low-density granulocytes (LDGs), was reported to be elevated and associated with disease activity or severity in a number of different conditions including SLE, asthma and HIV infection. However, both the frequency and clinical significance of LDGs associated with tuberculosis are unclear. Here we determined LDG levels and made comparisons between subjects with active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and healthy controls, between PTB patients with mild-to-moderate disease and patients with advanced disease, and among PTB patients following anti-tuberculous therapy of varying durations. The direct correlation between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection and LDG levels was confirmed by in vitro infection of whole peripheral blood and isolated granulocytes with mycobacteria. Our results demonstrated that PBMCs in PTB patients contained significantly elevated percentages of LDGs compared with control subjects. LDGs in tuberculosis expressed higher levels of activation markers compared to normal-density granulocytes (NDGs). <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> induced the generation of LDGs in both whole blood and isolated NDGs from control subjects, which suggests that LDGs associated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection are likely to originate from in situ activation.

Numerous studies indicate that the immune response of the host critically influences the progression of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; therefore, understanding the interaction between <italic>Mtb</italic> and the host is crucial for controlling tuberculosis.</p><p>Studies of the immune response to <italic>Mtb</italic> have focused primarily on T cells and macrophages, while little is known about neutrophil responses. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in humans and play crucial roles as sentinels and the first-line of defense against pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Research has demonstrated a characteristic neutrophil-driven transcriptional signature in the blood of patients with tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and that neutrophils are the predominant cell type in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; thus, neutrophils are implicated in immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic>. Furthermore, it was found, in both experimental and clinical studies, that active pulmonary tuberculosis is accompanied by massive influx of neutrophils into the lung tissues [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although the specific role and clinical significance of neutrophils in tuberculosis are still controversial [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], these studies established a close correlation between the development of tuberculosis and infiltration of the tissues by neutrophils. However, the role of circulating neutrophils in the development of tuberculosis is largely unknown.</p><p>Recently, a distinct population of CD15<sup>+</sup> granulocytes was found to be present in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction in humans. Since these cells co-purify with PBMCs in density gradient centrifugation, this population of granulocytes was termed LDGs. These cells can be distinguished on the basis of density from normal-density granulocytes (NDGs), the other population of granulocytes that co-purify with the erythrocyte fraction. In recent years, elevated LDG levels have been reported in a number of different conditions including SLE [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], asthma [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, studies demonstrate that LDG frequency is associated with disease severity in some autoimmune diseases and HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, at present, both the frequency and clinical significance of LDGs in tuberculosis are unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we determined the frequency and characteristics of LDGs in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, and conducted a preliminary investigation of the origin of LDGs in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection using an in vitro infection system. The correlation between LDG frequency and disease severity was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects and samples</title><p>Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) were recruited from the Jiangxi Chest Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from April 2014 to January 2015. The TB diagnostic criteria and treatment procedures followed were in accordance with the &#x02018;Guideline of clinical diagnosis and treatment: TB section&#x02019; of China [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were: patients with a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary TB; male or female; aged between 16&#x02013;65 years. Exclusion criteria were: pregnancy; comorbid conditions of HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Patients with PTB were further classified as acid-fast bacillus (AFB) positive and negative according to sputum AFB microscopy, and classified as mild-to-moderate (PTB-mod) and advanced (PTB-adv) according to the extent of disease evident on chest radiography [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Asymptomatic healthy volunteers were recruited from April 2014 to October 2014 and assessed by tuberculin skin testing (TST) with a purified protein derivative of tuberculin. Age- and sex-matched, TST negative volunteers were selected as the control group (HC, <italic>n</italic> = 16) for the study.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University and was carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

The PBMC and NDG fractions were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, 3 ml of venous blood was diluted 1:1 with sterile saline and was centrifuged on Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) in a 15-mL polystyrene conical centrifuge tube for 30 minutes at 300 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> (4&#x000b0;C). The PBMCs were carefully collected by aspiration from the plasma-lymphocyte separation medium interface and washed once in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). When indicated, LDGs were sorted in PBMCs based on forward scatter (FSC) profile, side scatter (SSC) profile, CD14 and CD15 expression (CD14<sup>low</sup> CD15<sup>+</sup>) by using a MOFLO cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).NDGs were isolated from the erythrocyte fraction by dextran sulfate sedimentation. Briefly, a quarter volumes of 6% Dextran / 0.9% NaCl solution were pipeted into the erythrocyte fraction. The mixture was pipetted into a 15-mL polystyrene conical centrifuge tube and let stand at room temperature for 45 min. The supernatant was then layered over equal volume of Ficoll-Hypaque in a new 15-mL polystyrene conical centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml PBS or RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% human AB serum. All experiments were performed using fresh cells, immediately after processing. Typan Blue Staining Cell Viability Assay Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu) was used to determine the cell viability in this study. Cytospin preparations were prepared and treated with Wright-Giemsa stain for morphological observation.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>The PBMCs or granulocytes (10<sup>6</sup> cells each) were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, washed once and incubated with FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) for 5 min. The cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature without or with the following mixture of fluorescent-labeled anti-human monoclonal antibodies: CD14-ECD, CD15-PE-Cy5 (Beckman Coulter); CD16-FITC, CD33-FITC, CD66b-FITC, CD62L-FITC (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Cell doublets were eliminated based on the size of the event (FSC).

The bacterial aggregates were shattered by gentle agitation with 3-mm-diameter glass beads. The resultant bacteria were diluted in PBS. The solution was left standing for 15 min before the supernatant was collected and adjusted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5 (approximately 10<sup>7</sup> individual bacteria/mL).</p><p>For in vitro infection, whole blood or purified NDGs were infected by mycobacteria at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (bacteria to neutrophils) for indicated times. Following the infection of whole blood, discontinuous density gradient centrifugation was performed and the LDGs and NDGs were counted by flow cytometry using aforementioned methods. Following the infection of purified NDGs, cells were washed once and resuspended in 3 ml sterile saline, then added to 3 ml of autologous uninfected whole blood. LDGs in this mixture and uninfected venous blood were counted by flow cytometry following discontinuous density gradient centrifugation using aforementioned methods. PI positive dead cells were excluded by PI staining. The number of LDGs in infected neutrophils was calculated by subtracting the number of LDGs in uninfected blood with LDGs in the mixture. All performance involving bacterial handling was performed in class &#x02161; biological safety laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Measurement of reactive oxygen species</title><p>The levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent dye H<sub>2</sub>DCF-DA (2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were loaded with 10 &#x003bc;M H2DCF-DA (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C in the dark, then washed once with PBS and analyzed immediately for ROS levels by flow cytometry (FCM).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Phagocytosis and bactericidal characteristics assay</title><p>LDGs and NDGs (1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells) were plated in 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% human AB serum and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

First, the levels of LDGs were significantly elevated in tuberculosis. Compared to autologous NDGs, the LDGs found in the present study expressed elevated levels of CD15, CD33 and CD66b, decreased levels of CD62L and similar levels of CD16. Furthermore, the LDGs in tuberculosis patients were found to contain significantly higher amounts of ROS. The ROS production and the profile of surface molecule expression (with the exception of CD33), suggest that LDGs in tuberculosis are activated neutrophils that have degranulated. Thus, LDGs in tuberculosis display an activated or primed neutrophil phenotype, which is similar to that of the LDGs described previously in patients with autoimmune diseases and those with HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, our study shows for the first time that in vitro infection with <italic>Mtb</italic> induces the generation of LDGs.</p><p>Second, we found that the generation of LDGs following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is dose- and time-dependent. Furthermore, our study showed that avirulent mycobacteria are more powerful than virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> in inducing the generation of LDGs, and that the levels of LDGs induced by live <italic>Mtb</italic> were significantly decreased compared to the levels induced by heat-killed <italic>Mtb</italic>. These results demonstrate that live <italic>Mtb</italic> inhibits the production of LDGs to some extent via a mechanism that is related to its virulence and metabolic activity.</p><p>Third, we found that the levels of LDGs in patients with advanced tuberculosis were significantly higher than those in patients with mild-to-moderate disease and that ATT significantly decreased the percentage of LDGs in PTB patients. These results revealed a correlation between LDG levels and the severity of tuberculosis. Although the contribution of these elevated levels of LDGs to the severity of tuberculosis remains to be determined, this preliminary study does highlight the potential of elevated levels of LDGs to serve as a biomarker of tuberculosis severity.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that LDGs contribute to tissue damage in some autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In accordance with these reports, a correlation between the frequency of LDGs and the severity of tuberculosis was observed in the present study, which suggested that LDGs might play a pathogenic role in tuberculosis.</p><p>However, we also found that when compared to avirulent and dead mycobacteria, virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> inhibited the generation of LDGs to some extent. Combining with the elevated expression of activation markers and increased intracellular ROS in LDGs, this finding made us speculate that LDGs might possess more powerful potential in killing Mtb. However, our results revealed that LDGs can not kill <italic>Mtb</italic>, which is similar to NDGs in this study and neutrophils in reported researches [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies indicate several possibilities concerning the origin of LDGs. On the basis of high expression levels of CD33, a marker of immature neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], some studies proposed that LDGs arise as the consequence of disruption of granulocyte development [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, characterization of the surface molecule expression and nuclear morphology conducted as part of this and other studies [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] indicate that LDGs are a population of fully mature granulocytes. Besides functioning as a marker of developing or immature granulocytes, CD33 is also involved in adhesion and migration of neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0153567.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that the increased expression of CD33 represents an elevation in the adhesion or migration capacity of LDGs; however, this requires confirmation in further studies. Based on studies in SLE, it has also been speculated that LDGs are derived by in situ activation of NDGs. Results of the present study indicate that LDGs are activated neutrophils that have degranulated. Moreover, results from the in vitro infection studies demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic> can rapidly convert NDGs to LDGs. Furthermore, the profile of LDGs derived from in vitro challenge with <italic>Mtb</italic> is very similar to that of the LDGs in patients with tuberculosis. Thus, these results reveal that in situ activation contributes to the generation of LDGs in tuberculosis.</p><p>There are, of course, some limitations to this present study, including the fact that the blood samples from TB patients receiving no ATT or ATT of varying duration were not collected from the same individuals in a paired manner. Patient variability may also affect the analysis of our results. Furthermore, because of the limitation of research subjects, we did not assess the LDG levels in patients who did not respond to ATT. Nonetheless, the striking consistency in the levels of LDGs observed among the different groups investigated suggests that this difference is meaningful.</p><p>In summary, the present study provides the first evidence of activated LDG levels in the PBMC fraction of peripheral blood in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, established a correlation between the frequency of LDGs and the severity of tuberculosis, and revealed the possible origin of LDGs following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. Nonetheless, further investigations are required to elucidate the clinical significance of the elevated levels of LDGs in tuberculosis. The signals resulting in activation of neutrophils and their development into LDGs following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection also remain to be clarified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153567.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Detection of selected surface CD molecules and ROS generation in LDGs and NDGs.</title><p>LDGs and NDGs from patients with tuberculosis (TB) and healthy control subjects (HC) were analyzed by FCM for the expression levels of CD15, CD16, CD33, CD66b and CD62L, and the amounts of ROS (MFI).</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153567.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153567.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Replication of <italic>M</italic>.<italic>tuberculosis</italic> incubated with or without neutrophils.</title><p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv was incubated with (at the MOI of 1) or without neutrophils for indicated times and the colony forming units (cfu) were monitored over times.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153567.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0153567.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bishai</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name>.
