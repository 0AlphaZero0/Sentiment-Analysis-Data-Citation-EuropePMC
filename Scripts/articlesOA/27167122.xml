However, limitations in the performance of these tests results in a failure to identify all infected animals. In attempting to increase the range of diagnostic tests for tuberculosis, measurement of the cytokine IP-10 in antigen-stimulated blood has previously been shown to improve the detection of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection, in humans and African buffaloes (<italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>), respectively. In the present study, 60 cattle were identified by the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test as tuberculosis reactors (n = 24) or non-reactors (n = 36) and the release of IFN-&#x003b3; and IP-10 in antigen-stimulated whole blood from these animals was measured using bovine specific ELISAs. There was a strong correlation between IP-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; production in these samples.

Moreover, because <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected animals are a potential source of infection for humans the disease is subject to comprehensive control measures in order to limit both zoonotic transmission and economic losses. Such control is typically based on test-and-slaughter schemes, which require the accurate diagnosis of infected animals.</p><p>The tuberculin skin test is the most widely used test to detect <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in cattle; however, the more sensitive interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) release assay (IGRA) is used as an ancillary ante-mortem test [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The latter assay detects the release of IFN-&#x003b3; following antigenic stimulation of whole blood with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> purified protein derivative (PPDb) [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The PPDb comprises a complex mix of antigens that are not wholly specific to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> and in order to take account of cross-reactive sensitization to other mycobacteria, the specificity of the assay is enhanced by comparing the PPDb-specific IFN-&#x003b3; response with that in response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> PPD (PPDa). Alternatively, antigens that confer superior test specificity for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, i.e. early secretory antigenic target 6 kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10), have been incorporated into IGRAs [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the sensitivity of these highly specific tests is lower than those using PPDb and PPDa [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One approach to improving the performance of such diagnostic assays is to identify additional biomarkers of immune activation. In humans, a number of alternatives to IFN-&#x003b3; have been evaluated for the diagnosis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of these, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) has proven particularly noteworthy [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The production of IP-10 is strongly induced by IFN-&#x003b3; in human antigen presenting cells [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and human and murine neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, in cattle, transcription of the gene that encodes IP-10, i.e. <italic>CXCL10</italic>, is induced by IFN-&#x003b3; in endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and is highly correlated with the transcription of IFN-&#x003b3; mRNA in antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In bovids, ESAT-6/CFP-10 stimulation of whole blood from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected African buffaloes (<italic>Syncerus caffer</italic>) induced greater quantities of IP-10 than IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and measurement of IP-10 significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis of this infection [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, in a study evaluating the diagnostic utility of this cytokine in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected cattle, IP-10 was not found to be a useful biomarker [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it was suggested that this might have been a consequence of limitations in the sensitivity of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used to measure this molecule [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, this study employed a human IP-10 ELISA [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] whereas the studies conducted in buffaloes used a commercially available bovine IP-10 assay [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Given that the measurement of antigen-induced IP-10 might increase the diagnostic sensitivity of tests of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection, the aim of the present study was to resolve these conflicting results by re-evaluating IP-10 as a biomarker for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in cattle using a bovine-specific ELISA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>Cattle from herds naturally infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> and cattle with no history of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> exposure were tested using the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) as part of the national bTB eradication programme. Animals were classified as either reactors (SICTT-positive) or non-reactors (SICTT-negative) and assigned to 3 experimental groups. Group 1 consisted of twelve reactors, which were relocated and maintained at an approved research farm facility. Water and food of the highest quality were provided at all times and animals were cared for and monitored daily, with veterinary oversight according to approved standard operating procedures. There was no deviation from normal housing practices and animals were never kept in isolation. When required, cattle were humanely slaughtered at an approved slaughterhouse. Following slaughter, these animals presented with gross macroscopic lesions consistent with advanced bTB and were confirmed as bTB-positive. Hereafter, an additional 12 reactor and 16 non-reactor cattle were randomly selected from an <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected herd in the national herd (Group 2) and were included in the study together with 20 non-reactor cattle with no known <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> exposure (Group 3). Heparinised blood samples for cytokine analysis were collected from all animals by a Senior Veterinary Inspector of the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food &#x00026; the Marine under a research license issued by the Department of Health &#x00026; Children.

Anti-bovine CXCL10 antibody (Kingfisher Biotech Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) in PBS (1 &#x003bc;g/ml; 100 &#x003bc;l/well) was incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C in 96-well Nunc Maxisorb microtitre plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Between subsequent steps, wells were washed with Bovigam<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Wash Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Prionics AG) and all further reactions were done at room temperature. Wells were blocked for 1 h with 200 &#x003bc;l Assay Buffer consisting of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 0.05% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in PBS. After blocking, plasma samples (diluted 1:5 in Assay Buffer) were incubated in duplicate wells for 2 h (100 &#x003bc;l/well). Additionally, samples from selected cattle were incubated in parallel with a dilution series of recombinant bovine CXCL10 (Kingfisher Biotech Inc.). Hereafter, plates were incubated with biotinylated anti-bovine CXCL10 antibody (Kingfisher Biotech Inc.), diluted in Assay Buffer (0.2 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 1 h (100 &#x003bc;l/well) followed by incubation with Streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase (R &#x00026; D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), diluted 1:200 in Assay Buffer, for 30 min (100 &#x003bc;l/well).

For selected animals, the OD values of a standard dilution series of recombinant IP-10 were used to quantify IP-10 concentrations in PPDb- and PPDa-stimulated blood samples by linear regression analysis. For these samples, the correlation between IP-10 and IFN-&#x003b3; release was calculated as Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Within animal groups, plasma IP-10 release under each experimental condition was compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. To investigate the diagnostic potential of IP-10, the accuracy of a test utilizing the &#x00394;PPD results for reactor and non-reactor cattle was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

In this study we have shown that the measurement of IP-10 release in whole blood of cattle is a sensitive marker of antigen recognition and immune activation and a promising diagnostic biomarker of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection.</p><p>The release of IP-10 was highly correlated with that of IFN-&#x003b3; and after 24 h of blood culture, all reactor cattle showed consistently greater PPDb-induced IP-10 responses when compared with stimulation by PPDa. Moreover, as has been reported for humans [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and African buffaloes [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antigen-induced IP-10 was released at far greater concentrations than have previously been reported for IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Together, these findings are evidence that IP-10 is a useful measure of antigen-specific cell mediated immunity in cattle. Because IP-10 is produced in response to IFN-&#x003b3;, we considered that the optimal incubation time of an assay measuring this cytokine might be different than that for an IGRA. However, in the bTB-positive cohort, the differential in the IP-10 response to PPDb and PPDa detected after 24 h of blood stimulation diminished after 48 h of incubation. It is therefore possible that a shorter incubation time might provide for even greater resolution between these responses, though this remains to be determined. Nonetheless, measurement of &#x00394;PPD after 24 h allowed for the highly accurate discrimination between Bovigam/SICTT-positive and Bovigam/SICTT-negative animals and indicates the potential of IP-10 as a highly specific diagnostic biomarker of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in cattle. Notably, selection of a &#x00394;PPD threshold with a specificity of 100%, i.e. 0.13, distinguished between these groups with a sensitivity of 96% suggesting that this marker does not significantly compromise diagnostic specificity in cattle. This finding is in agreement with human studies that have shown IP-10 assays to have a specificity of close to 100% [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A more sensitive cut-off value of 0.11 detected all Bovigam/SICTT-positive cattle and one additional &#x00394;PPD-positive individual. While the true infection status of this animal was not determined, this result may indicate the potential for the IP-10 assay to increase the accuracy of diagnosis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in cattle.</p><p>The release of IP-10 also shows promise as a marker of immune sensitization to the highly specific <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Importantly, measurement of IP-10, in combination with IFN-&#x003b3;, has been shown to improve the detection of ESAT-6/CFP-10 sensitization in humans and African buffaloes [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In cattle, use of these antigens would be particularly useful for specifically detecting <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-infected animals that have been vaccinated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> BCG [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and for testing herds with high rates of false positive reactions to standard PPD assays [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, in our study, the measurement of ESAT-6/CFP-10-specific IP-10, with reference to levels of this cytokine in unstimulated blood, was in some cases compromised by its release in control samples. The spontaneous production of IP-10 in blood from cattle has previously been reported and may reflect the <italic>in vivo</italic> induction of this cytokine [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This is consistent with findings from human studies that have identified a peripheral whole blood gene transcription signature in tuberculosis patients that is dominated by a neutrophil-driven interferon-inducible gene profile [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In other instances in the present study, IP-10 release in unstimulated blood exceeded that in response to ESAT-6/CFP-10 and PPD. While the mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear, the activation of antigen-specific memory lymphocytes may have resulted in reduced IP-10 production via the release of inhibitory cytokines, e.g. interleukin-10 [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, numerous proteases are secreted from activated leukocytes and proteolysis of plasma IP-10 might obscure detection of its release [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>An earlier study with cattle experimentally infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> found that IP-10 responses to PPDb did not exceed the respective responses to medium alone at any time point over the course of the infection [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding, in part, may have been a consequence of the high levels of IP-10 measured in unstimulated control samples in that study. However, limitations in the availability of suitable samples, and the use of a human ELISA, may have influenced these earlier findings [<xref rid="pone.0155440.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study we used a bovine-specific ELISA to measure IP-10 and showed that significant release of this protein occurs following antigenic stimulation of whole blood of cattle.</p><p>The current study was not designed to determine the diagnostic performance of the IP-10 release assay in herds undergoing episodes of tuberculosis: the animals were recruited to the study based on their skin test status. In infected herds, the IGRA is often used in parallel to the skin test in order to maximise the detection of infected animals. Whether the IP-10 test can detect additional infected animals that are undisclosed by current tests remains to be investigated. In cases where the skin test and IGRA results are inconclusive, the measurement of IP-10, which is produced in abundance in response to IFN-&#x003b3;, might serve to amplify an <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-specific signal in an infected animal.</p><p>In summary, IP-10 release in stimulated whole blood is strongly correlated with that of IFN-&#x003b3; and is a robust biomarker of antigen-specific immunological memory in cattle. However, the spontaneous release of the cytokine in unstimulated blood requires further investigation in order to understand its origin and regulation as it might limit the performance of the assay when utilizing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic>-specific antigens. Nonetheless, the release of IP-10 in response to PPDb and PPDa antigens is a valuable biomarker of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infection in cattle and measurement of this cytokine might improve the diagnostic performance of whole blood stimulation assays.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155440.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Measurement of antigen-specific IP-10 release shows extremely good agreement with the Bovigam assay and single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT).</title><p>Whole blood from Bovigam/SICTT-negative (n = 36) and Bovigam/SICTT-positive cattle (n = 24) was incubated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> PPD and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> PPD for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C and the difference in IP-10 release in these samples (&#x00394;PPD) was determined by ELISA.
