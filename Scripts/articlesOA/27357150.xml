Emerging data suggest more diverse roles exist for PCs as regulators of immune and inflammatory responses via secretion of factors other than Igs. The extent to which such responses are preprogrammed in B-lineage cells or can be induced in PCs by the microenvironment is unknown. In this study, we dissect the impact of IFNs on the regulatory networks of human PCs. We show that core PC programs are unaffected, whereas PCs respond to IFNs with distinctive transcriptional responses. The IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) system emerges as a major transcriptional output induced in a sustained fashion by IFN-&#x003b1; in PCs and linked both to intracellular conjugation and ISG15 secretion. This leads to the identification of ISG15-secreting plasmablasts/PCs in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, ISG15-secreting PCs represent a distinct proinflammatory PC subset providing an Ig-independent mechanism of PC action in human autoimmunity.</p></abstract><counts><fig-count count="7"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="79"/><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The polarization of immune cell populations for the secretion of distinct profiles of extracellular signaling molecules to drive and modulate immune responses has emerged as a recurrent feature across adaptive and innate immunity. For the B cell lineage, initial descriptions centered on an immune regulatory function and the secretion of IL-10 (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>); more recently, additional secretory capacity has been identified in murine models, including the secretion of TNF-&#x003b1;, NO, IL-17, and IL-35 (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>An important feature that distinguishes the B cell lineage from other cellular populations is the capacity for fundamental reprogramming toward dedicated high-level secretory capacity associated with the plasma cell (PC) state. This high-level secretory activity is first acquired in proliferating PC precursors, known as plasmablasts, and because exit from cell cycle is the principal feature separating these cell states, both plasmablast and PC populations are referred to as Ab-secreting cells (ASCs). The canonical secretory product of ASCs is their specific Ig; however, the importance of alternate bioactive secretory products is increasingly being appreciated (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Such non-Ig secretory activity in ASCs has been primarily characterized in murine model systems highlighting specific relationships between selected pathogens and ASC-derived cytokine secretion. Although in some instances non-Ig secretory functions have been shown to develop during differentiation to the PC state (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), in other instances, the rapidity with which cytokine-secreting PCs emerged after infectious challenge suggested the possibility that the response may have developed in previously established ASCs (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). An ability of ASCs to respond to environmental cues by acquiring polarized immune modulatory functions would resemble responses in macrophage/monocytes, in which functional polarization is determined by the prevailing milieu and can represent a labile phenotype within a cell population (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>In humans, the importance of non-Ig secretory activity from ASCs is less well characterized. PCs are, however, maintained in a variety of distinct microenvironmental states including both primary and secondary lymphoid tissue and tissues undergoing acute and chronic inflammation. The latter environments are frequently accompanied by polarization of other lymphoid and innate immune cell populations for specific secretory activity.</p><p>One of the most important autoimmune conditions in which ASCs play a role is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE shows a strong pathogenic association with both autoantibodies and IFN responses (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Evidence for IFNs as immediate drivers of such pathology is provided by the monogenic IFNopathies, in which sequence variants in diverse upstream regulators lead to exaggerated IFN responses and convergence on autoimmune features closely related to SLE (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Type 1 IFN in particular secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells has been identified as a factor that can enhance the generation of PCs in vivo (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and we and others (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) have shown that IFN-&#x003b1; can contribute to the generation and maintenance of long-lived human PCs in vitro. Although autoantibodies play an important role in SLE and other autoimmune pathology, there is considerable interest in defining potential mechanisms linking the B cell lineage, including ASCs, to autoimmune pathology that are independent of Igs (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>An important question also relates to the interaction between type 1 and type 2 IFN-mediated immune responses. Again, monogenic diseases have been informative in this regard, and the type 1 IFN-responsive gene IFN-stimulated gene 15 (<italic>ISG15</italic>) has emerged as a potentially critical bridge. ISG15 has a complex biology linked, on the one hand, to covalent intracellular modification of target proteins, ISGylation, a process analogous to ubiquitinylation, and on the other hand to a role as an extracellular signaling molecule/cytokine (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the latter role, ISG15 has been known for several years as an activator of NK cells and a driver of IFN-&#x003b3; secretion (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the context of monogenic disease affecting ISG15 in the patients so far described, the primary determinant of disease phenotype was the presence or absence of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccination (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the presence of BCG vaccinations, patients presented with disseminated mycobacterial infection attributable to the failure of ISG15-dependent extracellular signaling and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;driven immune responses. In contrast, the absence of BCG vaccination in a second set of patients revealed a critical function for intracellular ISG15 in the inhibition of type 1 IFN responses and mutations in <italic>ISG15</italic> led to an IFNopathy (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of ASCs in SLE, and our identification of IFN-&#x003b1; as a factor capable of sustaining long-lived PC survival, we were motivated to dissect the effect of IFN-&#x003b1; in more detail. In this study, using detailed gene network analysis of the plasmablast to PC transition, we show that IFN-&#x003b1; provides a potent environmental signal driving a distinct program of gene expression in PCs, mirroring patterns observed in SLE, without globally impacting on the fundamental processes of entry into cell cycle, quiescence, or the completion of secretory reprogramming. We identify the sustained and functional induction of <italic>ISG15</italic> and components of ISGylation machinery (<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) as a primary effect of IFN-&#x003b1; on human ASCs. Critically, this is accompanied by direct secretion of ISG15, a feature that is also observed in primary human ASCs cultured in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1; and spontaneously from plasmablasts of patients with SLE. These data characterize a new population of human inflammatory PCs polarized for the secretion of the proinflammatory mediator ISG15, identifying an Ig-independent mechanism of PC action in human autoimmunity. This establishes the basic principal that human PCs are subject to polarization by the microenvironmental milieu to acquire the capacity for immune modulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Abs and reagents</title><p>Reagents were human IL-2 (Roche); IFN-&#x003b3; (Sigma-Aldrich); IL-6, IFN-&#x003b1;, and IL-21 (PeproTech); goat anti-human F(ab&#x02032;)<sub>2</sub> fragments (anti-IgM and -IgG; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories); HybridoMax hybridoma growth supplement (Gentaur); Lipid Mixture 1, chemically defined (200&#x000d7;) and MEM Amino Acids Solution (50&#x000d7;; Sigma-Aldrich); CountBright beads (Invitrogen); and 7-aminoactinomycin D (BD Biosciences).

Furthermore, it remained unknown whether IFN exposure impacted on the core processes of PC differentiation or acted to impose an additional distinct functional signature on a conserved differentiation pathway. In SLE, it is well established that the peripheral blood can show signatures indicative of an active IFN response (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), and such responses may in part derive from circulating ASC populations at the plasmablast to PC transition. We therefore focused on a detailed analysis of the effects of IFNs at this final differentiation step of the B cell lineage.</p><p>To address this question, we employed our differentiation model focusing on ASCs undergoing the transition from an actively cycling population (plasmablasts) to cell cycle quiescence (PCs), as previously defined in our system (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and undertook a detailed time-course analysis of gene expression during this transition. Phenotypic maturation was monitored by the loss of B cell marker CD20 and concomitant acquisition of PC markers CD38 and CD138. Within 48 h of initiating the plasmablast to PC transition in media, containing IL-6 and IL-21 alone or supplemented with either IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3;, a CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> population was readily detectable in all culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). The proportion of cells with PC phenotype increased with time, reaching &#x0223c;90% by day 20. Overall, there were no consistent differences observed in the cell surface phenotypes obtained in the three conditions. A reproducible feature of our previous experiments was the ability of IFN-&#x003b1; to enhance the number of viable PCs (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In contrast to IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b3; failed to increase the number of PCs, even in comparison with cells maintained only with added IL-6 and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p>Characterization of the impact of IFN on in vitro PC generation.

To gain an overview of the impact of IFN, we assessed the overall pattern of the variation in gene expression. Notably, IFN-&#x003b1; stimulation produced a profound change at the early time points, showing a maximal change of 427 genes (versus no IFN; false discovery rate 0.05) at 6 h and reaching a plateau from 12 h onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Table I</xref>). Incubation with IFN-&#x003b3; produced an early change in gene expression that was sustained and gradually increased over the 5-d period.

The resulting patterns demonstrated that the majority of these gene probes displayed similar kinetics, regardless of culture conditions. There were large cohorts of genes, including prototypical B cell and PC identifiers, components of secretory pathways, and genes associated with metabolic function for which the overall pattern of regulation was preserved in the presence or absence of IFN. Among these genes, there were subtle differences in the kinetics for individual donors, but the overall picture remained consistent. However, as anticipated from the initial analysis, there were blocks of genes that showed specific changes in response to either IFN-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><fig id="fig02" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p>Longitudinal gene expression profiling of differentiating ASCs exposed to IFN.

In these plots, genes positioned centrally show neither change in expression nor change in degree of module connectivity; however, these can still be highly connected genes that may function during this phase of PC maturation irrespective of additional environmental stimuli. An example is the transcription factor <italic>KLHL6</italic>, which has previously been implicated in B cell receptor signaling and is recurrently mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Genes that do not appreciably change expression between conditions, but change degree of connectivity may exhibit different roles as the plasmablasts continue to differentiate under the influence of inflammatory cytokines. <italic>IL10RA</italic> falls into this category; IL-10 is known to potentiate PC differentiation (<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), but our data suggest that its effect may be altered in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1;. Additionally there is a cohort of genes that change in expression, but retain a similar degree of module connectivity. Importantly, although the degree of module connectivity may not change, the individual genes contributing to connectivity often change significantly. Thus, a gene may show no overall change in degree of connectivity but entirely change the genes with which it is connected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Table II</xref>).

The sustained and prominent induction of ISG15 among PCs cultured in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1; is therefore of particular relevance and if secreted in vivo would potentially place such PCs alongside granulocytes as a bridge between type 1 and type 2 IFN responses. We therefore assessed whether plasmablasts were capable of secreting ISG15.</p><p>To directly monitor secretion of ISG15, we developed an ELISPOT assay to interrogate secretion from in vitro&#x02013;generated plasmablasts, which were cultured in the presence or absence of IFN-&#x003b1; for 20 h on anti-ISG15 capture wells.

Hence, in addition to the pathogenic role of autoantibodies themselves, the potential involvement of the B cell lineage in disease biology in a fashion independent of Ag specificity would be of great interest.</p><p>A striking feature of the modular network analysis was the strong overlap of IFN-associated PC modules with signatures derived from the peripheral blood of patients with SLE as indicators of disease activity (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Although IFN-&#x003b1; plays a central role, other studies in patients with SLE also point to an association with IFN-&#x003b3; signaling. Given the potential interplay between IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;mediated induction of soluble ISG15 and subsequent IFN-&#x003b3; production by responding NK or T cells, we therefore directly evaluated whether plasmablasts present in the peripheral blood of patients with SLE showed evidence of ISG15 secretion. Plasmablasts from patients with active disease were identified and sorted based on surface phenotype of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup>CD27<sup>hi</sup> and assayed by ELISPOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7E</xref>). ISG15 secretion was detected in 8 out of 10 samples and was particularly notable in a patient with very active disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DC1">Supplemental Table IV</xref>). These data confirm that SLE is characterized by the generation of a proinflammatory ASC population that secretes ISG15 and identify a novel mechanism by which inflammatory ISG15-secreting ASCs may contribute to pathogenesis in a fashion that is independent of Ig.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s22"><title>Discussion</title><p>Protective immunity in part hinges on the successful and appropriate production of Abs. Particular biological contexts can elicit highly variable Ab responses in terms of magnitude, kinetics, affinity, and isotype produced. In each scenario, the outcome is dependent upon the ordered process of transforming an activated B cell into an Ab-secreting PC. During this transition, transcriptional programs governing the B cell phenotype give way to the program that defines secretory potential. The extent to which PCs may acquire the capacity to secrete cytokines and other immune modulatory products during this differentiation process is only just beginning to be elucidated. Furthermore, the extent to which such non-Ig secretory capacity may be imposed upon differentiated ASCs rather than determined by the nature of the immune stimulus initiating differentiation has not been defined. Given the dedicated secretory capacity of the mature PC and the potential of such cells for extended survival, such function would provide a significant contribution to modulation of inflammatory and immune responses. The analysis presented in this study points to the capacity of human PCs to be polarized for proinflammatory immune modulatory function in response to their cytokine environment in disease. This polarization for proinflammatory function is superimposed as part of a distinct gene expression module onto the programs governing the primary facets of the PC state. This establishes a paradigm for functional polarization of differentiated PCs in response to their microenvironments and points to the potential existence of a range of functionally distinct ASCs.</p><p>Many of the central players essential for the differentiation of B cells to PCs have been determined. However, less is known about the impact of individual biological contexts on the underlying regulatory programs. A recent study from Corcoran and colleagues has provided tantalizing insights into the nature of wider transcriptional differences obtained in different ASC populations (<xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). For example, the authors identified that the tissue residence of the evaluated PC biased the underlying gene expression patterns. Additionally, they found that ASCs generated in vitro by exposure of murine B cells to either the T-I stimulus LPS or the T-D mimic CD40L/IL-4/IL-5 displayed a less mature transcriptional profile when compared with in vivo counterparts, but were also characterized by &#x0223c;200 unique stimulus-dependent transcripts. Our data now provide direct evidence that ASC populations may be modified by inflammatory signals to induce functional gene modules superimposed on the core ASC state. Rather than examine a purified population of phenotypically mature PCs that have reached some degree of transcriptional stasis, we elected to perform a detailed temporal analysis of all responding cells to capture the dynamics of the response. The data sets were subjected to weighted gene correlation network analysis to define groups of coordinately regulated genes and highlight pathways operating during differentiation. This analysis has the potential to uncover previously unanticipated players in the regulation of PC differentiation, thus providing a resource for further exploration of potential core transcriptional regulators of PC differentiation.</p><p>Moreover, rather than comparing the effect of initial stimuli that impose a change on B cells, we instead focused on the window of plasmablast to PC transition. We reasoned that plasmablasts are likely to encounter novel signals as they transit from the site of initial stimulation that may have short- or long-term effects on gene expression. In particular, we were interested in the effect of IFN, given its association with PC survival and autoimmune pathology. The emergence of the ISG15-conjugating system as the most prominent pathway associated with IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated plasmablasts suggested that ISG15 or modification of cellular proteins by ISG15 could potentially alter functional output. Upon examination of IFN-&#x003b1;&#x02013;stimulated plasmablasts, we detected a rapid and prolonged induction of both unconjugated ISG15 and numerous ISGylated substrates. In PCs that were maintained in the presence of IFN-&#x003b1; for an extended period (36 d), prominent ISGylated proteins were detected, indicating that sustained contact with IFN-&#x003b1; leads to a gradual increase in the accumulation of ISGylated proteins. Previous studies investigating the effect of modification of proteins by ISG15 have identified a range of effects. For example, ISGylation of 4EHP enhances m<sup>7</sup>GTP cap structure-binding activity to suppress translation (<xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), whereas modification of IRF3 inhibits ubiquitin-mediated degradation resulting in sustained activation (<xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In most instances, the focus has been on the impact of ISG15 on the antiviral properties imparted by IFN-&#x003b1;. To explore the consequences of expressing ISG15 in a setting detached from infection, we performed mass spectrometry on ISG15 immunoprecipates prepared from IFN-&#x003b1; treated plasmablasts. Although the majority of targets were consistent with previous reports, we identified several novel ISGylated proteins of particular relevance to the B-cell lineage and confirmed that a fraction of the tyrosine kinase SYK contains this previously uncharacterized posttranslational modification. The impact on SYK function remains to be determined; however, ISG15 is conjugated to lysine residues of target substrate proteins in a similar fashion to ubiquitin. As SYK has previously been shown to be ubiquitinated after GPVI activation in platelets resulting in enhanced activity (<xref rid="r69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that ISG15 modification has an analogous effect. Indeed, a unique population of memory-like B cells expressing high levels of SYK has been identified in patients with SLE (<xref rid="r70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), in whom exposure to IFN-&#x003b1; drives expression of ISG15.</p><p>Most of the work to date on ISG15 has focused on the intracellular modification of proteins; however, recent data have revitalized an interest in the function of the secreted molecule. The identification of patients lacking ISG15 has confirmed in vitro observations that production of IFN-&#x003b3; is a major physiological consequence of encounter with secreted ISG15 (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In the setting of mycobacterial infection, lack of ISG15 secretion in affected patients was largely attributed to production by neutrophils, although lymphocyte populations also have the capacity to secrete ISG15. Our data now document the capacity of plasmablasts and PCs, cell types specialized for high-level secretion, to produce soluble ISG15. Most importantly, we provide evidence of ISG15 secretion from ASCs in patients with active SLE, thus linking this aspect of ISG15 function to inflammatory disease.</p><p>Murine models of lupus and genetic association studies have long indicated a role for type 1 IFN in the pathogenesis of SLE (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and endeavors characterizing type 1 IFN&#x02013;induced transcripts in blood and tissue samples from patients with SLE have confirmed a significant connection to IFN-&#x003b1; in particular (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Although IFN-&#x003b1; has been considered to lie at the heart of lupus-associated pathology, there have been a number of reports that provide evidence for a contribution to the disease-associated signature by type 2 IFN (<xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Most recently, Chichel et al. (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) have employed modular transcriptional repertoire analysis to monitor the dynamics of IFN signatures across patients with SLE and within individuals over time. They identified three distinct modules that were differentially associated with disease severity, with notable representation of IFN-&#x003b2;&#x02013; and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;driven transcripts in the modules typifying patients with active disease. Thus, the progression of the disease may mirror a transition from type 1 to type 2 IFN involvement. Given that, the SLE IFN signature also contains a PC-related module absent in other diseases with prominent IFN-inducible gene profiles such as tuberculosis (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that CD19-enriched cells are a source of IFN module gene expression in SLE, including ISG15 and correlating with the SLE Disease Activity Index score (<xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Moreover, in active SLE, CD19-enriched cells also display gene expression patterns consistent with ASC differentiation. Taken in conjunction with our data, this would be consistent with the principle origin of IFN signatures from CD19<sup>+</sup> ASCs. Because ISG15 can act as a bridge between type 1 and type 2 IFN through the activation of NK cells and T cells, these data fit with a model in which the secretion of soluble ISG15 by ASCs contributes to the shift toward IFN-&#x003b3; in more aggressive disease.</p><p>The secretion of functional products other than Ig by PCs has now been documented in range of disease contexts, including the development of an SLE-like disease in <italic>Lyn</italic>-deficient mice. In this instance, the secretion of IL-10 by ASCs provided protection against inflammation caused by myeloid and T cell activation (<xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Immunosuppressive PCs have also been demonstrated in a murine model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium infection in which IL-10&#x02013;expressing CD19<sup>+</sup>CD138<sup>+</sup> cells were detected within 24 h of administering the bacteria (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This finding was solidified in a further study that matched the level of IL-10 secretion to the maturation stage of ASC populations in animals challenged with <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The phenotypically most mature cells that expressed high levels of <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf4</italic> also expressed the highest levels of IL-10. These results were bolstered by a similar observation in the setting of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in which CD138<sup>hi</sup> PCs were the major B cell&#x02013;derived source of IL-10. Moreover, PCs in both models of disease also produced the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-35; however, the two cytokines were not detected simultaneously, suggesting that PCs or their precursors might differentially respond to initial triggers.</p><p>The above models suggest a strong association between PCs and the suppression of inflammation. However, cytokine production by PCs is not limited to those with anti-inflammatory properties. In two further murine models that generate polyclonal PC responses, there is strong evidence that the major source of critical proinflammatory cytokines is a PC population. In the first instance, the authors described the contribution of PC-produced IL-17 to the control of acute <italic>Trypanonsoma cruzi</italic> infection (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In this report, a <italic>trans</italic>-sialidase produced by the parasite was identified that could directly stimulate primary mouse or human B cells to make IL-17 using a retinoic acid&#x02013;related orphan receptor &#x003b3;t&#x02013;independent transcriptional program. In the second example, IgM-secreting CD138<sup>+</sup> PCs were shown to account for &#x0223c;75% of GM-CSF&#x02013;expressing cells in the spleen in a murine model of sepsis (<xref rid="r76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Deletion of these cells had a profound impact on bacterial clearance and culminated in septic shock.</p><p>Not only do PCs contribute in novel ways during infection, they also participate in maintaining the homeostatic balance of the gastrointestinal tract. The production of IgA by mucosal-associated PCs is an essential component of gut homeostasis and is initiated by exposure of B cells to inducible NO synthase and TNF-&#x003b1;. Surprisingly, IgA<sup>+</sup> PCs resident in the lamina propria of the small intestine were shown to be the primary local source for both these pathways (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). An engineered inability of B-lineage cells to secrete inducible NO synthase and TNF-&#x003b1; had a compound effect on gut biology, including loss of IgA production, altered microbiota composition, and diminished response to the pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. Thus, PCs in the microenvironment of the gut are identified as crucial effectors, both in terms of the Ig as well as the cytokines they secrete.</p><p>The current body of data indicate a diverse role for ASCs beyond the primary task of Ig production. Although most of the examples described thus far arise in the context of stimulation through microbial-derived molecules, it seems likely that alternative signals will generate PCs with distinct secretory profiles. In particular, our data are consistent with an inflammatory niche-driven generation of ISG15-secreting PCs. Additionally, the documentation of activating/prosurvival signals provided by diverse cells contributing to the multicomponent PC niche (<xref rid="r77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>), such as eosinophils, megakaryocytes, and basophils, suggests that other settings may be able to impart unique functional capabilities to the responding PCs (<xref rid="r78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="r79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Given the new range of activities that can be attributed to ASCs, one of the challenges will be to determine the extent to which these cells remain committed to a particular phenotype. One can envision at least three scenarios that give rise to functionally distinct PC subsets: 1) a deterministic model in which B cells with a pre-established program differentiate into a fixed polarized effector; 2) an instructive model in which B cells initiate differentiation in a polarizing context leading to a fixed polarized effector; or 3) a responsive model in which established ASCs are exposed to a polarizing context that generates labile polarized effectors. Our results suggest that cells committed to Ab secretion are indeed malleable in different environmental conditions and point to as yet undiscovered roles for PC contribution to immune regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="DC1"><label>Data Supplement</label><media id="d36e249" xlink:href="JI_1600624.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the University of Leeds, St. James's Campus Infrastructure and Facilities Flow Cytometry and Imaging Facility for technical support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="grant" fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported by <funding-source id="gs01">a Cancer Research UK</funding-source> Senior Clinical Fellowship (<award-id id="gn01">C7845/A10066</award-id> to R.M.T.) and by a <funding-source id="gs02">Cancer Research UK</funding-source> Programme Grant (<award-id id="gn02">C7845/A17723</award-id>).</p></fn><fn id="dep" fn-type="other"><p>The array data presented in this article have been submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE75007.</p></fn><fn id="supp" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jimmunol.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.4049/jimmunol.1600624/-/DCSupplemental">supplemental material</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="abbreviations"><fn id="abbr" fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations used in this article:<def-list><def-item><term id="G1">ASC</term><def><p>Ab-secreting cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G2">BCG</term><def><p>bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G3">GO</term><def><p>gene ontology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G4">IRF</term><def><p>IFN regulatory factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G5">ISG15</term><def><p>IFN-stimulated gene 15</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G6">PC</term><def><p>plasma cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G7">SLE</term><def><p>systemic lupus erythematosus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G8">TOM</term><def><p>topological overlap matrix</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="G9">WGCNA</term><def><p>weighted gene coexpression network analysis.</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></fn></fn-group><sec id="s23" sec-type="financial-disclosure"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors have no financial conflicts of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mizoguchi</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mizoguchi</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Takedatsu</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>R.
