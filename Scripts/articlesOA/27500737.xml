To induce IFN&#x003b2;, Mtb must gain access to the host cytosol and trigger stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling. A recently proposed model suggests that Mtb triggers STING signaling through bacterial DNA binding cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) in the cytosol. The aim of this study was to test the generalizability of this model using phylogenetically distinct strains of the Mtb complex (MTBC). We infected bone marrow derived macrophages with strains from MTBC Lineages 2, 4 and 6. We found that the Lineage 6 strain induced less IFN&#x003b2;, and that the Lineage 2 strain induced more IFN&#x003b2;, than the Lineage 4 strain. The strains did not differ in their access to the host cytosol and IFN&#x003b2; induction by each strain required both STING and cGAS. We also found that the three strains shed similar amounts of bacterial DNA. Interestingly, we found that the Lineage 6 strain was associated with less mitochondrial stress and less mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol compared with the Lineage 4 strain. Treating macrophages with a mitochondria-specific antioxidant reduced cytosolic mtDNA and inhibited IFN&#x003b2; induction by the Lineage 2 and 4 strains. We also found that the Lineage 2 strain did not induce more mitochondrial stress than the Lineage 4 strain, suggesting that additional pathways contribute to higher IFN&#x003b2; induction. These results indicate that the mechanism for IFN&#x003b2; by Mtb is more complex than the established model suggests. We show that mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA contribute to IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb. Moreover, we show that the contribution of mtDNA to the IFN&#x003b2; response varies by MTBC strain and that additional mechanisms exist for Mtb to induce IFN&#x003b2;.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Bacterial strains from the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) infect one in three humans, however not all infected individuals progress to active tuberculosis disease. It is unknown why immunocompetent individuals develop tuberculosis, and this presents a significant challenge in preventing the disease. One proposed explanation is that individuals that progress produce higher levels of the innate cytokine type I interferon, due to bacterial and/or host determinants. Therefore we set out to determine whether MTBC strains from distinct phylogenetic lineages induce distinct levels of type I interferon, and to determine a mechanism of type I interferon induction by each strain. We found that a Lineage 6 strain induced lower levels of type I interferon in macrophages than Lineage 2 and 4 strains. Additionally, this strain induced low levels of mitochondrial stress. We showed that improving mitochondrial function by treating macrophages with a mitochondria-specific antioxidant reduced type I interferon induction by Lineage 2 and 4 strains. Our results indicate that differential mitochondrial stress contributes to differential type I interferon induction by distinct MTBC strains. This suggests that mitochondria-specific antioxidants may be a means of reducing the pathogenic type I interferon response.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Student Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiens</surname><given-names>Kirsten E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI051242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ernst</surname><given-names>Joel D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>JDE received the National Institutes of Health (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>) grant R01AI051242.

Studies have shown that active tuberculosis (TB) is associated with expression of interferon-inducible genes [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], lepromatous <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic> lesions are enriched in IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;-inducible mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and that interleukin-1 confers resistance to Mtb by limiting IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; induction [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is also evidence that IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; is protective in certain contexts [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and thus it is likely that a balance of this cytokine is required for optimal protection. Given the complex role of IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling during Mtb infection, discovering a model for how Mtb induces IFN&#x003b2; gene transcription&#x02014;the first step required for IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; signaling&#x02014;has been an active and challenging area of research.</p><p>Several groups have recently proposed a mechanism for IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb. In this model, the first step in the pathway occurs when Mtb gains access to the host cytosol [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], such as through phagosome permeabilization [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The second step is initiation of the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) signaling pathway. STING can be triggered by bacterial cyclic dinucleotides [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or through DNA binding to cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) in the cytosol [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The established model suggests that bacterial DNA shed from cytosolic mycobacteria binds to and activates cGAS in order to induce IFN&#x003b2; [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this model does not take into account the contribution of DNA from other sources, such as mitochondria. Furthermore, this model has only been tested with strains from MTBC Lineage 4 and it is unknown whether the mechanism is generalizable to strains from other phylogenetic lineages.</p><p>The two important outstanding questions that we address in this study are: 1) Do phylogenetically distinct mycobacterial strains induce distinct levels of IFN&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic>? and 2) What are the mechanisms underlying IFN&#x003b2; induction by these strains? Identifying a mechanism by which distinct MTBC strains promote IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; induction would provide crucial insight into a mechanism of Mtb pathogenesis and into the evolution and diversity of mycobacterial strains.</p><p>Therefore, in order to examine the model for IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb, we infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with bacterial strains from three phylogenetically distinct MTBC lineages and assayed cytosolic signaling and IFN&#x003b2; induction by each. The MTBC strains we chose were 1182 (Lineage 6; also known as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>africanum</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], H37Rv (Lineage 4) [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and 4334 (Lineage 2) [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005809.s001">S1 Table</xref>). We find that 1182/Lineage 6 induces significantly less, and 4334/Lineage 2 induces significantly more, IFN&#x003b2; than H37Rv/Lineage 4. Additionally, we find that strain differences in IFN&#x003b2; induction are not due to differences in cytosolic access or bacterial DNA shedding. Instead, we provide evidence that IFN&#x003b2; differences are due, at least partially, to differences in mitochondrial stress and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol. Moreover, we show that additional mechanisms exist for Mtb to induce IFN&#x003b2; and thus that the mechanism for IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb is much more complex than the established model has implied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>IFN&#x003b2; induction is bacterial strain-dependent during Mtb infection</title><p>To determine whether distinct mycobacterial strains induce distinct levels of IFN&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic>, we infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) with strains from three distinct phylogenetic lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005809.s001">S1 Table</xref>).

We found that CFU and TNF did not explain variation in IFN&#x003b2;, while bacterial strain did, at each MOI. This suggested that IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb was bacterial strain-dependent and that strain differences were not explained by differences in bacterial growth or accompanied by global differences in inflammatory cytokine production. We also assayed interleukin-1 (IL-1) secretion, which negatively regulates IFN&#x003b2; [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We found that IL-1 levels were below the limit of detection during infection with each strain, and thus variation in IL-1 likely did not explain IFN&#x003b2; variation in this system.

We infected BMDM cultured in media lacking glucose and supplemented with galactose to prevent BMDM from using glycolysis for ATP production.

To determine whether mycobacterial strain-dependent differences in IFN&#x003b2; were due to differential accumulation of ROS, we treated BMDM with the antioxidant MitoQ and assayed accumulation of cytosolic DNA and IFN&#x003b2; protein secretion induced by each strain. MitoQ is coenzyme Q attached to a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium cation. Coenzyme Q is a strong reducing agent and thus acts as an antioxidant by transferring electrons to superoxide. The lipophilic cation causes accumulation of the molecule specifically in the mitochondria [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We used decyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (dTPP) as the negative control.

It is possible that 1182/Lineage 6 secretes reduced levels of a virulence factor that targets and disrupts mitochondria. Examples of such virulence factors in other pathogens include <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> &#x003b1;-toxin and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> pneumolysin [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. 1182/Lineage 6 contains a premature stop codon in Rv3879c of the Esx-1 gene locus [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which does not impact ESAT-6 secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but may impact the secretion of other virulence factors. It is also possible that 1182/Lineage 6 secretes higher levels of an antioxidant that prevents mitochondrial toxicity. A third possibility is that 1182/Lineage 6 secretes reduced levels of a metabolite that feeds into the citric acid cycle and drives mitochondrial ROS. Succinate secretion is upregulated in mycobacteria under conditions of hypoxia [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and perhaps a similar metabolic change occurs upon macrophage entry that drives mitochondrial ROS. This function been proposed for citrate produced by Salmonella during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and studies are ongoing to address these questions.</p><p>Our results provide an alternative view of cytosolic signaling and IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb than previous studies. First, we show that IFN&#x003b2; induction is not necessarily a measure of cytosolic access, as 1182/Lineage 6 induced lower levels of IFN&#x003b2; than the other two bacterial strains but, as indicated by three distinct assays, gained similar access to the host cytosol. Second, we show that bacterial DNA is probably not the predominant danger signal in the cytosol during Mtb infection; mtDNA released from stressed mitochondria likely binds cGAS to induce IFN&#x003b2;. We did not observe complete reduction in IFN&#x003b2; with MitoQ treatment. This could be due to residual superoxide and cytosolic mtDNA present in MitoQ-treated cells or it could be due to an additional mechanism that acts in concert with mitochondrial stress to promote IFN&#x003b2; signaling. Perhaps bacterial DNA contributes to differential IFN&#x003b2; induction but cannot be detected by the gene-specific primers that we used in our assays. We propose that we were able to discover this mechanism, while previous studies did not, for several reasons. First, we used diverse clinical isolates to test the model. Second, we used low bacterial doses (MOI of 1, 5, or 10) throughout the study and carefully controlled for any effect that CFU might have had on our results (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005809.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005809.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005809.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The study that showed mycobacterial DNA bound to cGAS used a high dose of bacteria (MOI of 20) and did not show CFU or mtDNA results [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies that showed that Lineage 2 strains induce more IFN&#x003b2; than Lineage 4 strains [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This suggests that the ability to induce mitochondrial stress and/or IFN&#x003b2; may contribute to the global dissemination and virulence of this lineage [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, further studies would be required to determine how widespread this pathway is in Lineage 2. Our data also suggest that additional mechanisms exist for Lineage 2 strains to induce high levels of IFN&#x003b2;, as 4334/Lineage 2 induced less mitochondrial stress than H37Rv/Lineage 4. We propose that 4334/Lineage 2 induces cGAS signaling by an as of yet undetermined mechanism. We noted that 4334/Lineage 2 interacted differently with FK2 and Galectin-3 than H37Rv/Lineage 4 and 1182/Lineage 6, indicating that this strain may behave differently in the host cytosol and may induce entirely distinct signaling pathways.</p><p>It also remains unknown if the reduced ability to induce mitochondrial stress and IFN&#x003b2; is widespread in Lineage 6 strains. If so, these factors likely played a role in the evolution of Lineage 6. Lineage 6 strains exhibit low virulence and are geographically restricted to West Africa [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; reduced ability to induce mitochondrial stress and IFN&#x003b2; may contribute to this attenuation. Interestingly, Lineage 6 is currently not being outcompeted by Lineage 4 and Lineage 2 in areas where it is prevalent [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus reduced mitochondrial toxicity and the ability to cause slower disease progression may have been selected for in Lineage 6, and future studies are warranted to investigate this possibility.</p><p>Ultimately, understanding IFN&#x003b2; induction by Mtb may facilitate the development of host-directed TB treatments. Treating mice with prostaglandin E2 and zileuton, which limit IFN&#x003b2; induction, confers tolerance to Mtb [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and zileuton has been developed as a drug that can be administered to TB patients to enhance the efficacy of antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1005809.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our data suggest that mitochondria-specific antioxidants could be another means to limit the pathogenic type I interferon response. Studies that identify additional mechanisms by which Mtb induces type I interferon would then be indispensible as they could provide additional targets for TB prevention and therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were done in accordance with procedures approved by the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, Laboratory Animal Care Protocol: 150502&#x02013;01).
