This depends on microbiological identification of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), commonly undermined by the need to obtain poorly accessible samples from the site of disease and by its poor sensitivity in extrapulmonary TB (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The GeneXpert MTB/RIF PCR test for nucleic acid detection can give positive results within hours (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), but the fastest liquid culture systems detect bacteria in 10 to 19 days and require 6 weeks to obtain a definitively negative result, thereby delaying clinical decisions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Development of novel TB diagnostics is focused on rapid tests in easily obtained clinical samples (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These aim to give better negative predictive value than current tests, particularly when clinical sampling of the site of disease is difficult and in high-transmission settings. They are also required to provide high positive predictive value in regions of low TB incidence where alternative infections are more likely, and in immunocompromised patients who are at risk of diverse infectious diseases.</p><p>Whole-blood transcriptomics has emerged ahead of proteomics and metabolomics for diagnostic biomarker discovery in TB as a result of well-established sample-processing pathways, and has led to development of rapid sample&#x02011;in-answer-out multiplex PCR platforms (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Numerous studies have described differential gene expression signatures in patients with active pulmonary TB compared with healthy uninfected individuals and those with latent TB infection (LTBI) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). There has been comparatively little assessment of blood transcriptomes in extrapulmonary TB and limited evaluation of the specificity of TB-associated blood transcriptional signatures in comparison with other infectious or inflammatory diseases. The most recent studies have sought to reduce the number of genes in a diagnostic signature, achieving as few as 3 or 4 genes to discriminate active TB from healthy individuals with or without LTBI, or to discriminate active TB from other diseases with variable accuracy (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In the present study, we sought to rank the genes that individually or in combination discriminated patients with active TB from all healthy individuals in diverse study cohorts including asymptomatic individuals with no prior TB exposure, those with LTBI, and those who have recovered from TB. We then proceeded to test the specificity of peripheral blood gene expression signatures associated with active TB by comparison with a diverse repertoire of other infectious diseases in patients presenting to hospital and extended our assessment of these diagnostic transcriptional biomarkers to HIV&#x02011;infected patients and those with extrapulmonary TB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Comparison of blood transcriptomes in active TB and after long-term recovery.</title><p>We first sought to identify the peripheral blood transcriptional signature of active TB by comparison with subjects sampled from the same cohort after recovery, 2&#x02013;4 years after completion of TB treatment using samples obtained from the AdjuVIT study population comprising HIV-negative patients with smear- and culture-positive pulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). This analysis revealed statistically significant and greater than 2&#x02011;fold gene expression differences in 204 unique protein-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Like other published data, active TB in this cohort was associated with increased expression of genes associated with immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), which showed some overlap with 2 other published blood transcriptional signatures in adult patients with active pulmonary TB compared with either healthy volunteers (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) or subjects with LTBI (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), these transcripts showed significant enrichment for components of IFN&#x02011;associated pathways (Supplemental File 2; supplemental material available online with this article; doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.87238DS1">10.1172/jci.insight.87238DS1</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Application of support vector machine learning with feature selection to discriminate active TB from healthy states.</title><p>Our aim was to identify the fewest transcripts that may be used as a diagnostic biomarker for active TB. We used support vector machines (SVMs) to derive discriminating models in the transcriptomic data from patients with and without active TB. This approach allowed us to calculate a weighting for each dimension of the data, relative to its influence in the classification model, and thereby provided an approach to selecting the discriminating features in genome&#x02011;wide data. We trained the SVM model on multiple random samples of half the transcriptomes from the AdjuVIT cohort of active TB and postrecovery cases and ranked all the genes in order of average SVM weightings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). The relative expression of the highest ranked transcripts was generally higher in active TB compared with postrecovery cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We tested a cumulative number of genes in rank order of their average weightings for their ability to discriminate between active TB and postrecovery cases using data from half the samples to train the model, and the remaining half of the data to test the classification accuracy. In order to mitigate against sampling error, we performed 100 random train/test sequences to give average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, this analysis showed that the highest ranked transcript alone consistently achieved ROC AUC scores of greater than 0.95. This transcript represented expression of the IFN-inducible gene for basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2 (<italic>BATF2</italic>), which was consistently the most highly ranked feature of the data in all the SVM models derived from multiple subsamples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BATF2 discriminates active TB from healthy states in multiple study cohorts.</title><p>Having identified peripheral blood <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels as a biomarker for active TB in the AdjuVIT cohort, we sought to test its ability to discriminate active TB from healthy states in multiple independent cohorts. <italic>BATF2</italic> expression in patients with active TB was significantly higher than that of healthy volunteers (Berry cohort) (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and patients with LTBI (Bloom and Kaforou cohorts) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), irrespective of HIV status, representing data from 402 patients in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Among HIV-negative patients in these studies, peripheral blood <italic>BATF2</italic> expression discriminated between active TB and the various healthy cases described in each cohort with ROC AUC scores of 0.93 to 0.99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>BATF2</italic> levels discriminated less well between active TB and LTBI cases amongst HIV-infected patients in the Kaforou cohort (ROC AUC of 0.84). In this cohort, high <italic>BATF2</italic> expression in patients with active TB was not significantly affected by HIV coinfection, but LTBI cases with HIV coinfection had significantly higher <italic>BATF2</italic> levels than HIV-negative cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>), partially confounding accurate discrimination between active and latent TB in HIV-infected patients by this measurement. An SVM model trained using genome&#x02011;wide data from the AdjuVIT trial to discriminate active TB and postrecovery cases also achieved a ROC AUC of 0.85 for classification of active and latent TB among HIV-infected patients from the Kaforou cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). This analysis suggests that in the context of HIV&#x02011;1 infection, inclusion of additional parameters, even up to a genome&#x02011;wide level, may not achieve substantially better classification accuracy than <italic>BATF2</italic> alone, although the use of alternative kernel functions in the SVM model that may improve classification accuracy were not evaluated in the present study (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Of note, the original description of the Kaforou cohort identified a 27-gene signature that discriminated active TB and LTBI in HIV-infected subjects with a ROC AUC of 0.97 (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Two other reports have recently proposed the application of a 4-gene transcriptional signature comprising <italic>GBP1</italic>, <italic>ID3</italic>, <italic>P2RY14</italic>, and <italic>IFITM3</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and a separate 3-gene transcriptional signature comprising <italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>DUSP3</italic>, and <italic>KLF2</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), as the basis of potential diagnostic tests for active TB. In order to compare their performance with that of <italic>BATF2</italic> alone, we trained SVM models based on each signature using the AdjuVIT active TB and postrecovery samples and tested their classification accuracy in the Berry, Bloom, and Kaforou datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). The ROC AUC scores for each signature ranged from 0.91 to 0.99 in HIV-negative cases, and was 0.88 in HIV-positive cases. The same HIV-positive cases in the original reports of these alternative gene signatures achieved a ROC AUC of 0.84 using random forest models with <italic>GBP1</italic>, <italic>ID3</italic>, <italic>P2RY14</italic>, and <italic>IFITM3</italic> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and a ROC AUC 0.89 using the difference of means of <italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>DUSP3</italic>, and <italic>KLF2</italic> (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that these 2 alternative multiparameter transcriptional signatures were also partially confounded by HIV infection and achieved only modestly better performance than <italic>BATF2</italic> used as a single biomarker.</p><p>The likelihood of any test giving a true result (predictive value) is a function of the pretest probability of the diagnosis combined with the false-positive and false-negative error rates. Bayes&#x02019; theorem of conditional probability is widely used to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a test (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In the different study cohorts described above, we used this calculation to evaluate the PPV and NPV of blood <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels for identifying active TB cases from different healthy states for pretest probabilities of active TB ranging from 1% to 50% in order to reflect contexts encompassing low and high incidence of active TB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). At the optimal threshold of <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels, defined by the ROC curve Youden index (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), the PPV depended strongly on the assumed pretest probability. Across the full range of pretest probabilities of 1% to 50%, the NPV ranged from 85% to 100% in HIV-negative cases and 76% to 100% in HIV-positive cases. Restricting the analysis to pretest probabilities of 1% to 10% generated NPVs of 97% to 100%, irrespective of HIV status. Different <italic>BATF2</italic> threshold levels could be used to achieve optimal PPV or NPV depending on the pretest probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>SVM classification of active TB by comparison with other febrile illnesses.</title><p>Elevated blood <italic>BATF2</italic> expression in HIV-infected patients with LTBI suggested that increased levels of <italic>BATF2</italic> may not be specific to active TB. Therefore, we compared <italic>BATF2</italic> expression levels in the blood transcriptomes of the AdjuVIT cohort active TB cases to those of patients presenting to hospital with febrile illnesses (Fever cohort), representing a diverse spectrum of non&#x02011;TB infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). <italic>BATF2</italic> levels among Fever cohort samples showed a wide range that overlapped with those of active TB cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, we inferred that higher levels of <italic>BATF2</italic> may reflect nonspecific host responses to infection, much like the acute-phase reactant, serum C&#x02011;reactive protein (CRP) that is widely used as a biomarker for infection and was also not significantly different between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>BATF2</italic> and CRP levels among these patients showed a relatively poor correlation coefficient, suggesting that the 2 parameters were not coregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, neither CRP nor <italic>BATF2</italic> levels in peripheral blood were able to discriminate between active TB and Fever cohort samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>The alternative 4-gene and 3-gene transcriptional signatures for active TB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) were also reported to show good specificity for TB compared with other diseases (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Using SVM models trained on half the AdjuVIT active TB and Fever cohort cases and tested on the second half of data blinded to the training, we showed that each of these alternative signatures performed substantially better than <italic>BATF2</italic> in discriminating between active TB and other infectious diseases in the Fever cohort, achieving ROC AUCs of 0.82 to 0.83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar results were achieved with <italic>GBP1</italic>, <italic>ID3</italic>, <italic>P2RY14</italic>, and <italic>IFITM3</italic> using random forest models that were utilized in the original report of this signature (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the difference of means of <italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>DUSP3</italic>, and <italic>KLF2</italic> advocated in the original report of this signature (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) only achieved a ROC AUC of 0.69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). Despite performing better than <italic>BATF2</italic> for discriminating between active TB and Fever cases, these ROC AUCs were significantly lower than those achieved by these signatures in comparing active TB with healthy states.</p><p>Therefore, we sought to further improve the classification accuracy by identifying novel peripheral blood transcripts that best differentiate active TB from other infections represented in the Fever cohort. We used half the combined AdjuVIT active TB and Fever cohort transcriptional data sets for SVM training on multiple random subsamples to identify their rank order of average weightings for discriminating active TB from Fever cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Then we tested a cumulative number of genes in rank order of their weightings for their ability to discriminate between active TB and Fever cohort cases for their classification accuracy. We carried out 100 random train/test sequences in each case using the other half of the data, and then calculated average ROC AUC scores. AUC scores increased from approximately 0.9 using the top-ranked gene alone, to 0.99 using the top 4 genes together, with no significant further gains by inclusion of additional genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Each of the 4 genes in this discriminating signature showed significantly different blood transcript levels in active TB compared with Fever cohort samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>). <italic>CD177</italic> and haptoglobin (<italic>HP</italic>) were expressed at higher levels in the Fever cohort samples, whereas immunoglobulin J region (<italic>IGJ</italic>) and galectin 10 (<italic>CLC</italic>) were expressed at higher levels in the active TB samples.</p><p>In order to validate their potential to discriminate between active TB and Fever cases, an SVM model was trained with transcriptional data for these 4 genes using the entire first half of AdjuVIT active TB and Fever cohort cases, and tested on the entire second half of the cases that had not been included in the identification of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>). The 4-gene signature provided almost perfect classification of the test samples with a ROC AUC of 0.99. For comparison, we also tested the top-ranked gene, <italic>CD177</italic>, which discriminated between active TB and Fever cohort test cases with a ROC AUC of 0.94. CD177 is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed by subpopulations of neutrophils (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), but the correlation coefficient with neutrophil counts in the AdjuVIT active TB and Fever cohort samples was only 0.23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8C</xref>). This suggested that increased levels of <italic>CD177</italic> in the Fever cohort samples are not simply a surrogate for increased frequency of circulating neutrophils, but may represent transcriptional upregulation of <italic>CD177</italic> in these cases compared with active TB. We also noted that HP is recognized as an acute-phase reactant and tested the correlation of <italic>HP</italic> transcript levels with levels of circulating CRP, but found very modest correlation between these 2 parameters as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8D</xref>). These data suggest that increased levels of <italic>HP</italic> transcripts in non&#x02011;TB infectious diseases cases reflect context-specific transcriptional upregulation rather than a surrogate for nonspecific acute-phase responses.</p><p>There were significant differences in ethnicity, age, and sex between the AdjuVIT active TB and Fever cohort patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). However, the different patterns of gene expression that discriminate between the 2 cohorts were evident in all ethnic groups and not confounded by age or sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, training the 4-gene-signature SVM model using data from each ethnic group allowed accurate classification of cases in all other ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10, A&#x02013;C</xref>). In addition, significant differences in age and blood neutrophil or lymphocyte counts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd">Supplemental Table 2</xref>) discriminated poorly between active TB and Fever cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10, D&#x02013;F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Derivation of a single risk score for test cases.</title><p>Binary classification of cases by SVM does not provide a case-by-case estimate of confidence in the accuracy of the classification. In order to achieve this, we fitted the distance of each test case from the SVM separating hyperplane to a sigmoid logistic regression function to give a probability estimate between 0 and 1 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), thereby generating a risk score for each of the test cases based on the SVM model derived from our 4-gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11A</xref>). Given that <italic>BATF2</italic> can discriminate between active TB and healthy cases, and that an additional 4 genes can discriminate active TB from a wide range of other infectious diseases presenting with fever, we sought to combine the expression levels of <italic>BATF2</italic> with <italic>CD177</italic>, <italic>HP</italic>, <italic>IGJ</italic>, and <italic>CLC</italic> in a single SVM model to discriminate active TB from postrecovery cases in the AdjuVIT cohort, and from other diseases in the Fever cohort. The SVM model was trained using the 5-gene signature on half of the AdjuVIT active TB cases in 1 group and half of the AdjuVIT postrecovery TB cases pooled with half of the Fever cohort cases in a second group. This model was then used to classify the remaining second half of the cases in all 3 groups, providing a single risk score of active TB for each case and giving a ROC AUC of 0.95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figure 11, B and C</xref>).</p><p>Bayes&#x02019; theorem was also used to calculate the PPV and NPV of using <italic>CD177</italic> alone or the combination of <italic>CD177</italic>, <italic>HP</italic>, <italic>IGJ</italic>, and <italic>CLC</italic> to discriminate active TB from other infections, and the combination of <italic>BATF2</italic>, <italic>CD177</italic>, <italic>HP</italic>, <italic>IGJ</italic>, and <italic>CLC</italic> to discriminate active TB from either healthy states or other infections for a range of pretest probabilities, revealing the optimal PPV or NPV that can be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>). At the optimal Youden index threshold, the application of the potentially novel 4-gene signature to discriminate active TB from other infectious diseases, generated wide-ranging PPVs dependent on the pretest probability but an NPV of 100%, even assuming the highest pretest probability for TB of 50%.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood transcriptional signatures for active TB are independent of the site of disease.</title><p>All the active TB cases in the AdjuVIT, Berry, and Bloom cohorts were of pulmonary TB. Novel diagnostic biomarkers for TB are particularly needed for extrapulmonary TB in which existing microbiological diagnostics have the lowest sensitivity. Therefore, we obtained new blood transcriptomic data from additional independent cases to evaluate the utility of <italic>BATF2</italic> and the 4-gene TB&#x02011;specific transcriptional signature described above by comparison of healthy individuals and those with LTBI, active pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB, and non&#x02011;TB respiratory tract infection before any antibiotic treatment. By comparison with healthy volunteers, blood <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels were significantly higher in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13A</xref>). Elevated <italic>BATF2</italic> classified cases of pulmonary TB with a ROC AUC of 0.98 and extrapulmonary cases with a ROC AUC of 0.96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13B</xref>). Finally, an SVM model trained with data from AdjuVIT active TB and all Fever cohort cases using the 4-gene TB-specific signature of <italic>CD177</italic>, <italic>HP</italic>, <italic>IGJ</italic>, and <italic>CLC</italic>, discriminated between new pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB cases and non&#x02011;TB febrile pneumonia with ROC AUCs of 0.99 and 1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 13, C and D</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that <italic>BATF2</italic> and the 4-gene TB blood transcriptional signatures performed equally well in classification of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have identified and validated elevated <italic>BATF2</italic> levels as a discriminating blood transcriptional biomarker for active TB compared with healthy uninfected individuals, people with LTBI, and people with long-term recovery from active TB. Our assessment of 226 cases of TB and 176 healthy individuals among HIV-seronegative adults across 4 separate study cohorts with diverse ethnic backgrounds consistently gave ROC AUCs of 0.93 to 0.99. The performance of <italic>BATF2</italic> as single transcriptional biomarker in these cohorts was comparable to the performance of other recently reported transcriptional signatures of active TB based on 4 genes (<italic>GBP1</italic>, <italic>ID3</italic>, <italic>P2RY14</italic>, and <italic>IFITM3</italic>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or 3 genes (<italic>GBP5</italic>, <italic>DUSP3</italic>, and <italic>KLF2</italic>) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>BATF2 belongs to the activator protein 1 (AP&#x02011;1) transcription factor family, with IFN&#x02011;inducible expression in mononuclear phagocytic cells, and is upregulated by innate immune stimulation with lipopolysaccharide or Mtb. BATF2 interacts with IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) to mediate downstream proinflammatory responses, some of which are also recognized as components of the host response to Mtb (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Given that systemic IFN activity is widely recognized in active TB (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), increased <italic>BATF2</italic> expression is most likely due to IFN responses rather than direct Mtb stimulation of circulating blood cells. Discrimination of active TB and LTBI in HIV-infected individuals using blood <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels achieved a ROC AUC level of 0.84. <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels in HIV-infected and uninfected active TB cases were not significantly different, and the variance of <italic>BATF2</italic> in all study groups was broadly similar. Instead, reduced classification accuracy was due to higher levels of <italic>BATF2</italic> in HIV-infected LTBI cases, which we speculate reflects chronic HIV-associated IFN activity (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Longitudinal comparison of <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels in HIV&#x02011;1&#x02013;infected patients before and after initiation of HIV treatment and completion of TB treatment may offer the opportunity to dissect the independent effects of HIV and TB infection on <italic>BATF2</italic> levels.</p><p>Our current data suggest that in HIV-infected cases, <italic>BATF2</italic> transcript levels may be expected to offer better negative predictive value as a biomarker for active TB than positive predictive value. Interestingly, discrimination of active TB and LTBI cases in HIV-infected people using genome&#x02011;wide transcriptional data did not yield a better ROC AUC than <italic>BATF2</italic> by itself, suggesting that even combinations of other transcripts will not afford better classification accuracy using SVM. This hypothesis is partially borne out by the assessment of the alternative concise transcriptional signatures described above which achieved a ROC AUC of 0.88 in the same analysis, but more complex transcriptional signatures of 27 genes were reported to achieve a ROC AUC of 0.97 to discriminate between active TB and LTBI in HIV-positive adults (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Even in the context of HIV infection, at the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity in ROC curve analysis, the negative predictive value of <italic>BATF2</italic> as a biomarker for active TB only falls below 95% if the pretest probability of active TB is greater than 15%. In settings with high pretest probability (up to 50%), alternative threshold <italic>BATF2</italic> levels can yield greater than 95% negative predictive value while retaining a positive predictive value of 80%. These provide better risk stratification of active TB in HIV-infected patients than any other single biomarker described to date.</p><p>Consistent with our observations in HIV&#x02011;1 infection, we found that elevated <italic>BATF2</italic> levels were not specific to active TB, but were also variably elevated in HIV-negative patients presenting to hospital with diverse infectious diseases. Like other nonspecific markers of inflammation such as serum CRP, they did not discriminate TB from other infections. Instead we identified and validated a separate transcriptional signature comprising 4 genes that can be summarized into a single probability score to discriminate these classes with ROC AUCs of 0.96 to 1, in analyses including 84 patients with active TB and 90 patients with other infections. This transcriptional signature provided much better discrimination of TB from the spectrum of infectious diseases included than other recently reported blood gene signatures (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In addition, we showed that the transcriptional signature was independent of multiple potential confounders such as sex, age, and ethnicity for which there were significant differences between the 2 groups. Within this 4-gene signature, transcript levels for a neutrophil G protein&#x02013;linked surface glycoprotein (<italic>CD177</italic>), and the acute-phase hemoglobin scavenging plasma protein (<italic>HP</italic>), were elevated in non&#x02011;TB infection cases. By contrast, active TB cases showed elevated transcript levels for <italic>IGJ</italic> and the glycan-binding protein, galectin 10 (<italic>CLC</italic>). Given the association between CD177 and neutrophils, and that blood neutrophil counts in active TB were significantly lower than the non&#x02011;TB infection group, lower <italic>CD177</italic> transcript levels in active TB might also have been expected, but the correlation coefficient between these variables was relatively low and <italic>CD177</italic> by itself provided much better discrimination between the classes than neutrophil counts. Hence, we conclude that <italic>CD177</italic> transcripts were not simply a surrogate for neutrophil counts but also reflected differential transcriptional regulation between the 2 classes. Likewise, <italic>HP</italic> levels showed only very modest correlation with the archetypal acute-phase reactant, CRP, also suggesting context&#x02011;specific transcriptional upregulation rather than a component of nonspecific acute-phase responses. The mechanistic model for increased transcript levels of <italic>IGJ</italic> and <italic>CLC</italic> in active TB is unclear, but we note that galectin 10 has previously been evaluated as a biomarker for eosinophilic lung inflammation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). This raises the possibility that the inclusion of galectin 10 in this transcriptional signature may be confounded by overrepresentation of pulmonary diseases in active TB cases used in the SVM training cohort. However the 4-gene signature performed equally well in discriminating extrapulmonary TB from non&#x02011;TB pneumonia cases in independent datasets, thereby increasing our confidence that the discriminating transcriptional signatures were not confounded by the site of disease, and importantly, may be equally valid in pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Further assessment of these transcriptional signatures is needed in different clinical contexts to evaluate the impact of different repertoires of non&#x02011;TB diagnoses, partially treated infections, and HIV coinfection, on their performance as diagnostic biomarkers. In this respect the greatest challenges are likely to arise in individuals with sarcoidosis, which shares the hallmark of granulomatous inflammation, and in advanced HIV infection, where coinfection with multiple opportunistic pathogens is common. We speculate that it is unlikely that a single concise diagnostic blood transcriptional signature will provide adequate specificity for active TB compared with all possible differential diagnoses, but that a repertoire of diagnostic signatures will emerge to support context&#x02011;specific clinical decisions. Additional studies are also required to test whether the same gene products may function as biomarkers in protein assays, which remain more economically viable than transcriptional assays and have better opportunities for development as point-of-care tests.</p><p>The present study focused on symptomatic patients. Importantly, identification of active TB in asymptomatic patients also represents a substantial burden for clinical TB services among patients with chest radiographic changes compatible with TB, contacts of patients with active TB, and in other systematic programs for active case finding, including screening of migrants, health care workers, and HIV-1&#x02013;infected patients before starting antiretroviral therapy (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In these settings, preclinical diagnosis of progressive TB is likely to have a significant beneficial effect on reducing onward transmission of infection. Further longitudinal cohort studies are required to test the performance of these biomarkers in asymptomatic patients. Of note, in one such study from South Africa and The Gambia, <italic>BATF2</italic> was included in a 16-gene blood transcriptional signature with 66% sensitivity and 80% specificity for predicting diagnosis of active TB among asymptomatic subjects within the following 12 months (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Test performance might be expected to improve significantly at shorter intervals before the onset of symptoms.</p><p>The analysis of the transcriptional biomarkers identified in the present study suggests that their performance in diagnostic tests meets WHO targets (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We conclude that it may be possible to use a single biomarker (<italic>BATF2</italic>) to rule out active TB, but multiplex technology will be required to discriminate TB from other diseases. The development pathway to translate these biomarkers to novel diagnostics will require standardization of measurements and thresholds. In addition, the design of future studies to provide extended validation and clinical trials to test their impact should incorporate consideration of the pretest probabilities for TB, which may have substantial impact on the positive and negative predictive value of each test. In general, our analyses show that the NPV of the transcriptional biomarkers identified was better than the PPV, suggesting that application of these tests may have greatest impact as a triage test to rule out active TB or otherwise identify patients for further investigation. Additional risk stratification to modulate the pretest probabilities or use of alternative threshold values in different clinical contexts may be necessary to realize maximum beneficial impact on clinical decision support. These transcriptional biomarkers offer exciting opportunities for the development of new rapid diagnostics in TB to overcome the current limitations in microbiological diagnosis, particularly in extrapulmonary disease or in active case finding, and in order to avoid unnecessary investigations, unnecessary treatment, and delays in initiation of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study approval.</title><p>Blood sampling for transcriptomic analyses was approved by UK National Research Ethics services (reference numbers: 09/H0701/103, 14/EE/0097, 06/Q0605/83; 12/LO/0504).
