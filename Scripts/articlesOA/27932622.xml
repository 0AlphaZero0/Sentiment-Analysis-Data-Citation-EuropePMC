A severe complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in these patients is neurological tuberculosis&#x02013;immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), but its underlying cause remains poorly understood. To investigate the pathogenesis of TBM-IRIS, we performed longitudinal whole-blood microarray analysis of HIV-infected patients with TBM and reflected the findings at the protein level.

After ART initiation, a significantly higher abundance of transcripts associated with canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes was detected in patients with TBM-IRIS than in non-IRIS controls. Whole-blood transcriptome findings complement protein measurement from the site of disease, which together suggest a dominant role for the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of TBM-IRIS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tuberculosis meningitis</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd><kwd>inflammasomes</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Wellcome Trust</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source><award-id>WT 097254</award-id><award-id>081667</award-id><award-id>084323</award-id><award-id>097684,</award-id><award-id>104803</award-id><award-id>098316</award-id><award-id>TW007373-01A1</award-id><award-id>TW007370-01A1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">National Research Foundation of South Africa</named-content></funding-source><award-id>96841</award-id><award-id>85858</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Francis Crick Institute</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</named-content></funding-source><award-id>10126</award-id><award-id>10218</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research UK</named-content></funding-source><award-id>SP.2011.41304.074</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation of South Africa</named-content></funding-source><award-id>64787</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-id">National Department of Health</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009041</named-content></funding-source><award-id>TB/HIV/AIDS-01-2014</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>

</p><p>Tuberculosis is the most common cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization recommends early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all patients coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although increased ART coverage of has significantly improved the clinical outcome of patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, it also leads to an increased incidence of tuberculosis&#x02013;immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Paradoxical tuberculosis-IRIS is a condition in which patients receiving tuberculosis treatment experience new, recurrent, or worsening of previously stabilized tuberculosis symptoms after commencement of ART. HIV-1&#x02013;positive patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are at particularly high risk of developing neurological tuberculosis-IRIS (47%). TBM-IRIS is associated with a mortality rate of up to 30% [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref>].</p><p>It is well established that serum hypercytokinemia is a major pathological consequence of tuberculosis-IRIS [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similar observations were also reported from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in neurologically compartmentalized TBM-IRIS, with significantly higher concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected in patients who developed IRIS compared with those who did not [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recently, our group and others have reported that inflammasome activation underlies the immunopathogenesis of tuberculosis-IRIS and that its inhibition results in reduction of cytokine production [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. Inflammasomes are immune complexes of receptors and sensors that mediate innate immune responses and induce inflammation. Canonical inflammasomes are mediated via NOD&#x02013;like receptor proteins (eg, NLRP3 or NLRC4) or AIM2 and activate caspase 1 to cleave pro&#x02013;interleukin 1&#x003b2; and pro&#x02013;interleukin 18 into their mature forms [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Noncanonical inflammasomes, on the other hand, activate caspase 4/5 (caspase 11 in mice) to cleave pro&#x02013;interleukin 1&#x003b1; into its mature form and induce pyroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is known to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and contribute to the tissue-damaging innate inflammatory responses [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether inflammasome activation also characterizes the pathogenesis of the highly compartmentalized TBM-IRIS. We performed transcriptomic profiling using microarray on longitudinal whole-blood samples from patients with TBM who did, or did not, develop IRIS after ART. We further performed protein immunoassays on serum and CSF in order to investigate whether TBM-IRIS is associated with a proinflammatory inflammasome-activated innate immune response.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>The study was approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC No. 350/2013).

Eligible patients were adults (aged &#x02265;18 years) with serologically confirmed HIV-1 infection and a diagnosis of TBM according to a published clinical case definition [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. All patients received antitubercular therapy and prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/d) from the time of TBM presentation and started ART 2 weeks after antitubercular therapy initiation. All <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid, with the exception of 1 isolate from a patient with TBM-IRIS, who was susceptible to rifampicin but not isoniazid. Patients were tracked longitudinally for the development of TBM-IRIS, which was diagnosed according to a published definition [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<bold>Figure S1</bold>). Patients who experienced TBM-IRIS received an increased dosage of, or had treated restarted with, prednisone. In patients who did not develop TBM-IRIS, the dosage of prednisone was weaned after 4 weeks of tuberculosis treatment. Another group of HIV-infected, ART-naive adults without tuberculosis and meningitis were enrolled as controls [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Blood and CSF Sample Collection</title><p>Paired blood and CSF samples were collected from patients longitudinally at the following time points: TBM presentation, 2 weeks later at the beginning of ART, 2 weeks after ART initiation, and at the time of TBM-IRIS presentation [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Plasma and CSF were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until batch RNA analysis and protein determination were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>RNA Extraction and Processing for Microarray Analysis</title><p>RNA was extracted from whole blood in PAXgene tubes using PAXgene Blood RNA kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol. Total RNA (2 &#x003bc;g) was then globin reduced using the GLOBINclear 96-well plate format kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The total RNA yield after globin reduction was determined in a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and its integrity was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). All RNA samples had an integrity number <bold>&#x0003e;</bold>6.0 and were determined to be acceptable for analysis. Approximately 250 ng of globin-reduced RNA was used to prepare amplified and biotinylated antisense complementary RNA targets, using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Labeled complementary RNA (750 ng) was hybridized overnight to Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 BeadChip arrays (Illumina), which contained &#x0003e;47 000 probes (for transcripts). Some genes were represented by &#x0003e;1 probe per transcript. The arrays were then washed, blocked, stained and scanned on an Illumina BeadStation 500. Signal intensity values from the scans were generated using Illumina BeadStudio v2 software. All samples were randomized during all stages of processing to avoid any batch effect. The microarray data from this study have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#x02019;s Gene Expression Omnibus (accessible through GEO Series accession No. GSE83892).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Microarray Data Analysis</title><p>Raw microarray data were background subtracted, and scaled data were generated using Illumina BeadStudio v2 software. A stringent filter was implemented to select only those transcripts present in 100% of samples from either the IRIS or the non-IRIS group. The transcripts in TBM-IRIS samples were further filtered to have &#x0003e;1.5-fold change in expression compared with the non-IRIS samples. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test with the Storey bootstrapping post hoc test was applied with a <italic>Q</italic> value cutoff of &#x0003c;0.05. The transcripts identified were then clustered using a hierarchical algorithm with the Pearson uncentered distance metric and average linkage. The weighted temporal molecular distance was used to determine whether the raw expression value of each differentially expressed transcript in each sample lay within or outside 2 SDs of the baseline control. Mean transcript abundance in patients without meningitis and not receiving ART was used as baseline control. To quantify, transcripts had to differ by &#x02265;200 U in raw signal intensity and &#x02265;2 SDs from the baseline control. The weighted distance is the group mean of the sum of the total SDs for all transcripts meeting these criteria. Functional pathways overrepresented by differentially abundant transcripts were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction</title><p>Total RNA (500 ng) was first reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before being used for quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

At time of TBM-IRIS presentation, 15 patients underwent brain imaging, including computed tomography (CT) (n = 14) or magnetic resonance imaging (n = 1). Imaging showed features of TBM in 14 of these patients and normal findings in 1. CT brain abnormalities (excluding generalized atrophy) included extensive focal meningeal enhancement (n = 3), tuberculoma (n = 6), infarcts (n = 4), basal meningeal enhancement (n = 2), and hydrocephalus (n = 2). Of 4 patients in whom CT scans were obtained at TBM diagnosis and at TBM-IRIS presentation, 2 showed worsening radiological features of TBM at TBM-IRIS, including new ring-enhancing lesions (n = 1) and increasing basal meningeal enhancement (n = 1). Serial CT brain findings showed evolving basal ganglia infarcts in the other 2 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was performed in 2 of 3 patients with paraparesis, and both had features of radiculomyelitis.</p><p>Longitudinal blood samples for RNA analysis were available for 33 of these patients (16 in the TBM-IRIS and 17 in the non-IRIS group) who were included in this study. Seventeen HIV-1&#x02013;infected patients without tuberculosis or meningitis were included as controls [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A tuberculosis diagnosis was excluded in the control patients by lack of tuberculosis symptoms, normal chest radiograph, and absence of tuberculosis treatment. Compared with patients with TBM (TBM-IRIS and non-IRIS), control patients without tuberculosis or meningitis had significantly lower HIV-1 load, CSF lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

At the time of TBM diagnosis, inflammasome transcript perturbation did not differ between patients who would eventually have TBM-IRIS and those who would not.

Together, these data indicate an early transcriptional increase in proinflammatory mediators and effectors in peripheral blood that precedes the TBM-IRIS episode and suggest that the immunopathological mechanism of IRIS is associated with increased inflammasome activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Compared with those who have pulmonary and other forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis-IRIS, patients with neurological tuberculosis-IRIS often exhibit severe disease, a poorer outcome, and higher mortality rates [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To better understand this advanced form of tuberculosis disease, we investigated the transcriptional response in TBM-IRIS, using whole-blood microarray because extraction of disease site-specific RNA was not feasible. Based on past findings in pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we speculate that whole-blood transcriptome would also provide insights on the cellular signaling across the blood-brain-barrier. Furthermore, measuring transcriptional changes in whole blood provides a noninvasive approach to monitor disease prognosis and progress, as an alternative to using CSF samples.</p><p>We identified differentially abundant transcripts associated with TBM-IRIS both before and during disease onset, which indicated a key role for neutrophil-dependent and inflammasome-associated proinflammatory responses in the pathogenesis of TBM-IRIS. Previous analyses of CSF from this patient cohort have revealed that increases in bacterial burden, neutrophil counts, and concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#x003b1; at time of TBM diagnosis predicted future TBM-IRIS [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. </p><p>In accordance with the CSF data, whole-blood microarray analysis in this study also identified several neutrophil-dependent inflammatory mediators, including MMP9, as having significantly higher transcriptional abundance in patients with TBM-IRIS throughout the course of disease development. MMPs are known to cause lung tissue damage in pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the central nervous system, evidence suggests that MMP not only facilitates blood-brain-barrier disruption, which results in leukocyte influx [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but also up-regulates microglial secretion of cytokines [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated CSF MMP9 concentrations have been associated with poorer outcome, including death [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and neurological complications [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], in patients with TBM. In addition to increased CSF concentrations of MMP9 associated with TBM-IRIS, elevated mRNA expression and serum concentrations of MMP9 have also been reported in pulmonary tuberculosis-IRIS [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We hypothesize that the consistently high abundance of MMP9 in TBM-IRIS suggests degradation of the extracellular matrix as a mechanism of tissue damage in the central nervous system that is systemically reflected in the blood.</p><p>Furthermore, despite having a highly compartmentalized inflammatory response in the CSF, TBM-IRIS seems to share the same underlying pathogenic mechanism with other forms of tuberculosis-IRIS in which inflammasome activation play a key role, and again, this is reflected in the peripheral blood. We have previously shown that Toll-like receptor signaling and inflammasome activation are key mediators of dysregulated cytokine production in a cohort of patients with heterogenous presentations of paradoxical tuberculosis-IRIS [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most recently, Tan and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have also reported that monocytes from patients with tuberculosis-IRIS displayed aberrant inflammasome activation and had greater cell death both before and after ART. </p><p>In keeping with these observations in general tuberculosis-IRIS, we also identified that both canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation was involved in the pathogenesis of TBM-IRIS. Although there was no discernible difference in the blood transcriptional activity of inflammasomes at the baseline (time of TBM diagnosis), significant transcript perturbations after antitubercular therapy were observed and continued after ART initiation in patients who would go on to have TBM-IRIS. At the site of infection, CSF concentrations of caspase 1 were significantly higher in patients with TBM-IRIS both at TBM diagnosis and also during the IRIS episode, demonstrating that inflammasome activation was both compartmentalized in the central nervous system and reflected systemically at an early stage. Given that inflammasome activation can contribute to pyroptosis [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], an inflammatory cell death distinctive from apoptosis, tissue injury (eg, disruption of the central nervous system architecture and degradation of the extracellular matrix) observed in TBM-IRIS may be partly induced by inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.</p><p>Finally, although patients were prescribed prednisone before any IRIS onset, repression of proinflammatory transcription factors (eg, NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1) by this anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was insufficient to prevent the production of inflammatory mediators. Given the unwanted side effects of prednisone, treatments more specific to the pathological mechanism of tuberculosis/TBM-IRIS should be considered. The existence of a small molecule inhibitor (MCC950), which targets the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], suggests more effective ways to both prevent and treat the inflammatory symptoms of tuberculosis-associated IRIS and should be explored in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
