DLL4 is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a MyD88-dependent manner. We found that DLL4 expression was upregulated on bone marrow progenitor cells and APCs in mice infected with BCG <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>. Transfer of DLL4<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells from infected hosts resulted in an increase DLL4<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in the spleen, indicating that expression of the <italic>dll4</italic> gene is propagated throughout hematopoiesis. We also found an increase in DLL4<sup>+</sup> monocytes from individuals who were infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. In latent individuals, DLL4 expression correlated with increased cytokine production from T cells in response to PPD stimulation. Finally, antibody blockade of DLL4 reduced T cell cytokine production from na&#x000ef;ve T cells stimulated with antigen. These results demonstrate that the Notch ligand DLL4 can influence T cell cytokine production in both humans and mice, and further reveal that expression of DLL4 is upregulated on early hematopoietic progenitors in response to chronic mycobacterial infection. These data suggest that widespread DLL4 expression may occur as a result of mycobacterial infection, and that this expression may alter CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to both previously encountered and novel antigens.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>monocytes</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000050</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">HL112897, HL31237, HL89216</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000060</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">AI083156</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">Francis Family Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100005834</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7593"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is a growing body of evidence that the innate immune response to pathogen exposure can extend beyond the site of infection to alter both the rate of production and the function of newly formed white blood cells. For example, hematopoietic stem cells are known to respond to IFN&#x003b3; with increased cell cycling (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), and bone marrow progenitor cells are known to respond to TLR agonists both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Some of these changes may result in alterations in the innate immune response, a concept known as trained immunity (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). In one study, trained immunity resulting from vaccination with bacille Calmette&#x02013;Guerin was correlated with decreased morbidity resulting from pathogen exposure, and this vaccination resulted in overall reduced mortality compared to unvaccinated individuals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Although many of these studies focus on altered differentiation of innate immune cells, there is little evidence that changes that occur at the stem cell level as a result of pathogen exposure can also alter the adaptive immune response. If changes relevant to adaptive immunity did occur in myeloid progenitor cells, these alterations would be most relevant in the adaptive immune response to chronic infection. Chronic infections are the result of immune responses that sub-optimally contain a pathogen at the expense of the host, resulting in tissue damage.</p><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (mTB) is responsible for approximately 1.5 million deaths each year and has infected between one-quarter and one-third of the world&#x02019;s population (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), thus classifying this disease as a worldwide epidemic. The immune response to mTB is characterized by the formation of granulomas comprised of necrotic tissue and a milieu of cells that work in concert to contain the bacterium without effectively clearing it. Many researchers have demonstrated the importance of T cell participation in the containment of mTB (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). A recent study further suggests that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell:antigen-presenting cell (APC) interaction plays a critical role in pathogen clearance and requires direct contact between the APC and the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell for an effective immune response (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Other works have identified that APC-expressed costimulatory molecules aid in proper T cell activation in response to mycobacterial antigens (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>In the studies outlined below, we suggest that the Notch system provides an ideal target for long-term regulation of the adaptive immune system by APC in the setting of mTB infection. The Notch system consists of five ligands that signal promiscuously through four receptors to activate target gene transcription (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The receptors Notch 1 and Notch 2 are expressed at every stage of the T cell lifecycle, and Notch signaling has demonstrated importance in thymic maturation (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), effector function (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and the formation and maintenance of immunological memory (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The Notch ligand delta-like 4 (DLL4), which aids in T cell differentiation, is specifically upregulated on APCs only as a result of TLR signaling <italic>via</italic> a MyD88 pathway (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated the importance of DLL4 in the T cell response in multiple diseases including respiratory syncytial virus (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), and the mycobacterial-elicited pulmonary immune response (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). DLL4 expression by APCs during viral infection reduced IL-4 and IL-13 production and increased production of IFN&#x003b3; (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In the mycobacterial- and EAE-driven responses, DLL4 increased IL-17 production from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In type 1 diabetes, blockade of DLL4 decreased T cell activation and increased T regulatory cell differentiation (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These data suggest that the DLL4 ligand can alter the T cell-driven immune response in a context-specific manner.</p><p>Here, we outline a pathway whereby DLL4, which is upregulated in the lung during BCG mycobacteria infection in mice, is also increased systemically on the cell surface of APC as a result of exposure to this pathogen. Increased DLL4 protein can be observed on early progenitor cells in the bone marrow and on APCs in the spleen. We also demonstrate that DLL4 expression is maintained during short-term hematopoiesis in the absence of pathogenic stimuli using bone marrow chimeras. Finally, we demonstrate that DLL4 is upregulated on peripheral blood monocytes in a cohort of patients with latent or active TB infection and demonstrate that the presence of DLL4 on monocytes correlates with the T cell immune response in those patients that are latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Mycobacterial Culture</title><p>BCG <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> (TICE strain) was obtained from Merck.

Experiments in mice have demonstrated that infectious processes at sites distal to the bone marrow can affect stem cell cycling and differentiation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). We hypothesized that mycobacterial infection may also alter the phenotype of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells. By investigating sites distal to the lung, we were able to determine that there is a systemic increase in the percent of cells expressing DLL4<sup>+</sup> cells as a result of mycobacterial infection. In addition to the lung, we observed an increase in DLL4<sup>+</sup> cells in spleen and bone marrow of infected mice, including all splenic DC subsets and bone marrow multipotent progenitors (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C,G). In the lung, an increase in DLL4 expression was most prominent on CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E,F), with no increase in DLL4 expression observed on alveolar macrophages or CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs. Although we observed a slight increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of DLL4 as a result of infection, this did not reach statistical significance (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,D,F). We observed that the increased DLL4 expression in the bone marrow and spleen was correlated with an increase in granuloma size and CFUs in the lung (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H,I). In the bone marrow, resolution of infection decreased the amount of DLL4 expressed on the surface of multipotent progenitor cells. We also observed age-related changes in DLL4 expression in uninfected mice, a finding that may reflect previous research demonstrating changes in Notch ligand expression in stromal cells as a result of time in human tissues (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). We were able to verify that our antibody was specific for DLL4 using dendritic cells derived from <italic>Mx<sup>Cre</sup>Dll4<sup>ff</sup></italic> mice (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). We did not observe an increase in expression of DLL4 in lymphocyte subsets (B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells), hematopoietic stem cells, or common myeloid progenitor cells (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). DLL4&#x02009;+&#x02009;erythroid progenitors (pre-erythrocyte, pro-erythrocyte, or pre-megakaryocyte) were present in very low numbers and difficult to distinguish from background staining.</p><p>To determine if the expression of DLL4 was propagated throughout the hematopoietic system as a result of hematopoiesis, we isolated DLL4<sup>+</sup> and DLL4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Sca1<sup>+</sup> cKit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells from the bone marrow of BCG-infected mice by FACS. Isolated cells were engrafted into lethally irradiated hosts and splenocytes were assessed for DLL4 expression at several time points post engraftment. We observed a significant increase in DLL4 expression in the spleen by flow cytometry on CD11b<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from recipient mice at 4&#x02009;weeks post-engraftment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). QPCR from whole spleen demonstrated a 1.8-fold increase in expression of <italic>dll4</italic> at the RNA level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B).

We did not observe an increase in DLL4 expression in mice receiving DLL4<sup>+</sup> LSK cells at 7&#x02009;days post-engraftment or at 8&#x02009;weeks post-engraftment, suggesting that the expression of DLL4 as a result of hematopoiesis is transient in the absence of BCG infection, and is dependent on donor cell expression of this ligand.

For example, we have previously demonstrated that T cell-derived IL-17 production is increased as a result of Dll4 expression in a model of mycobacterial infection (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). To determine if DLL4 expression altered cytokine production from T cells in humans infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, we assessed the CD4 T cell production of TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3;, and IL-2 in response to characterized mycobacterial antigens including ESAT-6, TB10.4, Ag85A, CFP-10, and PPD by intracellular cytokine staining in both actively and latently infected individuals. We also assessed the production of these same cytokines in response to the superantigen <italic>Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B</italic> (SEB) as a positive control. We then performed PCA using these data, including the percentage of DLL4<sup>+</sup> monocytes as a factor to determine if DLL4 expression in monocytes was correlated with cytokine production from T cells in latently and actively infected individuals. PCA analysis is routinely used to reduce the number of dimensions in a data set by determining if specific variables track together as a component (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Our analysis of latently infected individuals resulted in two components each with an Eigenvalue &#x02265;4. The values in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> state that the correlation between each variable and the two discovered principal components on a scale of 1 to &#x02212;1, with 1 being a 100% correlation. Values of less than 0.3 are considered non-significant. Based on this analysis, we determined that DLL4 expression was correlated with cytokine production from CD4 T cells as a result of stimulation with specific TB antigens including ESAT-6 and PPD in an antigen-specific component. The second component contained all of the cytokine data related to SEB stimulation and was not correlated with DLL4 expression on monocytes. Interestingly, CFP-10 cytokine secretion was associated with the SEB component, suggesting a different pattern of cytokine secretion than that induced by the other antigens. Based on our component matrix (Table S1 in Supplementary Material), which correlates all variables in the data set, we determined that DLL4 expression was most closely correlated with the cytokine response following stimulation with PPD (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). Table S2 in Supplementary Material states that the component containing SEB cytokine stimulation was not related to the component containing DLL4 expression and cytokine production in response to TB antigens. Performing dimension reduction analysis on individuals diagnosed with active TB disease did not result in a component containing DLL4 expression. This analysis informed us that DLL4 expression on monocytes was associated with T cell cytokine production in latently infected individuals. We then performed linear regression analysis to determine if there was a direct correlation between cytokine production and DLL4 expression in both latent infection and active TB disease. Our results indicate an <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> value of 0.54 when correlating the percent of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN&#x003b3; and the percentage of monocytes expressing DLL4 in response to PPD.

This systemic upregulation is likely derived both from <italic>de novo</italic> exposure of immune cells to mycobacterial products and from the maintenance of <italic>dll4</italic> expression through hematopoiesis. As a small number of DLL4<sup>+</sup> cells were derived from DLL4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material), we do not believe that exposure to <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> or mycobacterial products is the only way to induce expression of this ligand. Several studies support the notion that low-level DLL4 expression is a normal part of the hematopoietic process (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Our data suggest that the number of DLL4<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells increases as a result of mycobacterial infection, and that this increased expression is passed on to the progeny of these cells, thus increasing the total amount of DLL4 found within the immune system. Therefore, it is likely that there are a small number of DLL4<sup>+</sup> stem and progenitor cells that exist under non-infectious conditions, and these cells will generate DLL4<sup>+</sup> daughter cells.</p><p>Our findings were confirmed using peripheral blood samples from a cohort of patients with either latent or active mTB infection. In both human and mouse, antigen-specific T cell cytokine production is influenced by DLL4 on the cell surface of APCs that occurs as a result of mycobacterial infection. It has previously been reported that certain T cell cytokine responses and expression of cell surface molecules including CD127 correlate with latent and active disease (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Although these changes in gene expression hint at a profound change in the innate immune system as a result of immune mTB infection, this response has not been fully characterized.</p><p>As the immune response to PPD is correlated with DLL4 expression in individuals with LTBI but not active TB infection, further study of the Notch system in TB may aid in characterization of the differences between immune responses in the setting of LTBI and active TB disease. Previous research suggests that DLL4 can alter the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell cytokine response and T cell survival (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Our current data indicate that DLL4 expression on APCs influences the T cell immune response during mTB infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DLL4 is upregulated on myeloid progenitor cells as a result of mycobacterial infection, and that this upregulated expression is passed on to daughter cells even after the microbial stimulus was removed. As we were able to observe a DLL4-dependent increase in OT-II T cell cytokine production when stimulating these cells with APCs from BCG-infected mice, we believe that the outcome of this aspect of trained immunity may extend beyond simple increased activation of the innate immune cells. The ability of DLL4 to increase the cytokine response of a na&#x000ef;ve T cell, and the data we present here indicating that expression of this molecule is system wide, indicate that the entire immune response is &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; for pathogen exposure.</p><p>It is of interest that DLL4 expression did not correlate with CD4 cytokine production in patients with active TB disease. This warrants further study and may indicate that Notch signaling is aberrant in those patients with active disease. One possibility is the increase in type 1 IFN pathway that is associated with active TB disease (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) may alter the expression of Notch ligands on the surface of myeloid cells. Type 1 IFN is known to increase in <italic>dll1</italic> expression in murine macrophages, and this ligand has been demonstrated to increase the T cell response to H1N1 influenza infection (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). In a model of T cell development, low levels of DLL1 and DLL4 expression were found to produce functionally distinct outcomes, with DLL4 inducing more expression of Notch target genes (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the type 1 IFN pathway may alter the adaptive immune response to mycobacterial infection through altered Notch ligand expression. Further examination of monocytes from patients with active TB disease and individuals with LTBI may yield pertinent data on the role of Notch ligand expression in the anti-mycobacterial immune response.</p><p>It is of note that the ESAT-6-specific immune response has been documented as differing in both cytokine production and frequency of response in infected individuals when compared to the PPD-specific immune response (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). It is also possible that PPD, as a mix of antigens, elicits a stronger and more diverse response than a single antigen including ESAT-6 or others. These possibilities may explain why DLL4 expression correlates more strongly with one antigenic response than another.</p><p>The systemic wide upregulation of DLL4 may have effects on other cell types besides T cells. For example, macrophages are known to respond to Notch signaling with increased activation (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). DLL4 is also essential for proper thymocyte development from common lymphoid progenitors (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Therefore, a systemic increase in expression of this molecule may alter the host immune response in numerous ways that allow for more effective immune responses to pathogen challenge. Finally, as DLL4 expression is reduced in individuals who have been treated for mycobacterial infection, it is possible that the measurement of this ligand in peripheral blood will generate a biomarker to distinguish infected and uninfected individuals.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MS designed and performed experiments, and analyzed data.
