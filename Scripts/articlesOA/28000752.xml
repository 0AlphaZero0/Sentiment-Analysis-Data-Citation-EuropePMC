Infergen has immunomodulatory activity and is effective against <italic>hepatitis C virus</italic>. However, the effect of Infergen (IFG) on <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> has not yet been reported. Therefore, for the first time, we have studied the influence of IFG in constraining the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> in human macrophages. We observed that IFG significantly enhanced the maturation and activation of macrophages. Further, it substantially augmented the secretion of IL-6, nitric oxide (NO) and antigen uptake. Moreover, macrophages exhibited remarkably higher bactericidal activity, as evidenced by reduction in the <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. Infergen-mediated mechanism was different from the type-1 interferons; since it worked through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, phosphorylation of STAT-3 and Akt-PI3K that improved the bactericidal activity through autophagy and NO release. In future, IFG immunotherapy can be a novel strategy for treating patients and controlling TB.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>In spite of the fact that effective drugs like rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, etc., are available to treat tuberculosis (TB); the disease continues to inflict a detrimental impact on public health worldwide. Nearly one third of the world population is infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> and about 1% develops new infection annually, accounting for total 9.6 million new cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In 2014, there were about 1.5 million allied deaths; typically occurring in the developing countries [WHO, 2015]. The problem is further aggravated with the emergence of MDR-TB (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis), XDR (extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis) and TDR (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis) strains of <italic>Mtb</italic>, AIDS-pandemic and failure of BCG vaccine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify newer drugs and develop radical changes in the current therapeutic strategies to control TB.</p><p>Interferons (IFNs) are naturally occurring immunomodulatory cytokines.

Infergen is quite distinct from type-I IFNs, since it is derived from the sequences selected from several &#x003b1;-IFNs (interferon &#x003b1;2a and interferon &#x003b1;2b) and then producing a consensus gene product<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

However like IFN-&#x003b3;, type-1 IFNs are reported to kill <italic>Mtb</italic> by bolstering host immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Although, IFG shares biological and pharmacological properties with type 1 IFNs, it follows a unique and distinct signaling pathway. Infergen exhibits potent immunomodulatory activity in human cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Furthermore, it is known to control viral infection by enhancing the activation of T cells through an augmented viral peptide presentation by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Unfortunately, nothing has been reported regarding the therapeutic aspect of IFG on <italic>Mtb</italic>. Therefore, we thought that it would be interesting to study the impact of IFG in restricting the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> and the mechanism involved therein.</p><p>Autophagy plays an essential role in protection against <italic>Mtb</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. It targets the <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens to lysosomes for their degradation and clearance. Further, autophagy enhances the antigen presenting ability of APCs to T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. At the same time, it inhibits detrimental inflammatory responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Nitric oxide (NO) is known to confine the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Taking into account these evidences, we were interested to monitor the influence of IFG on the activation of <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages, thereby restricting the survival of the <italic>Mtb</italic>. It was quite fascinating to observe that IFG stimulated macrophages displayed significantly improved skill to restrict the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. The mechanism involved was through the augmentation of autophagy and release of NO. Both these pathways are considered crucial in curbing the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Therefore, this study illustrates that IFG may have enough potential to work as an immunotherapeutic agent against TB.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>IFG restricts the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p><italic>Mtb</italic> not only infects macrophages but also it can survive in the hostile environment of these cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Thus, in the initial phase of the study, we investigated the impact of IFG on avirulent strain of <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Ra infected THP-1 macrophages (H37Ra-M&#x003c6;). It was quite exciting to note that IFG stimulated macrophages (M&#x003c6;IFG) showed significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) reduction in the intracellular survival of <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, as compared to unstimulated control [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>]. The decrease in the CFUs was observed in a dose dependent fashion. Likewise, substantial (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0008) decline in the growth of virulent strain H37Rv (<italic>Mtb</italic>) was noticed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>]. Furthermore, we proved the above event through time-point kinetics by demonstrating a extensive (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) increase in <italic>Mtb</italic> killing (GFP-H37Ra) by flow cytometry assay [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C</xref>]. Thus, validating the potent role of IFG in inhibiting the growth of both virulent and avirulent <italic>Mtb</italic>. The concentration of 64&#x02009;ng/ml of IFG showed the maximum intracellular killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> and was not toxic to M&#x003c6; and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1A&#x02013;C</xref>]. Hence, this dose was chosen in all the subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IFG augments the secretion of cytokines</title><p>IL-6 is a major cytokine produced by macrophages in response to intracellular pathogens<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.

IFG stimulated H37Ra infected M&#x003c6; produced considerably (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) higher level of IL-6, as compared to unstimulated (no Infergen) macrophages infected with H37Ra [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1D</xref>]. The increase in IL-6 was observed in a dose dependent manner. Further, these results were corroborated by <italic>IL-6</italic> gene expression by RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1E</xref>]. Additionally, we confirmed these results by observing a significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) increase in the level of IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; by IFG stimulated H37Ra infected macrophages isolated from human PBMCs [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1F,G</xref>]. Infergen is reported to promote Th1 polarization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.

Further, MHC and costimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of the macrophages are crucial for the optimum activation of T cells. It was noticed that <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected IFG stimulated THP-1 macrophages (<italic>Mtb</italic>-M&#x003c6;-IFG) exhibited substantially (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.02) higher expression of costimulatory molecules CD40 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0004), CD80 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), CD86 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.02) and MHC-II (HLA-DR) (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.003) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A&#x02013;D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3A&#x02013;D</xref>]. These results were substantiated using CD11b<sup>+</sup> human macrophages. We observed that IFG induces significant upregulation of CD80 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), CD86 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), compared to unstimulated controls [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3E,F</xref>]. Thus, our data suggest that IFG not only augments the activation and maturation of <italic>Mtb</italic> infected M&#x003c6; differentiated from THP-1, but also macrophages isolated from human peripheral blood.</p><p>We further checked the activation status of other immune cells like B cells and T cells. As compared to untreated B cells, IFG treated B cells displayed a higher expression of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR, [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4A&#x02013;F</xref>]. We also noted significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) upregulation of the activation marker CD25 on CD8 T cells treated with IFG [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5A</xref>]. Moreover, IFG incubated CD8 T cells showed substantial improvement (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) in their ability to lyse the target cells [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5B</xref>]. Furthermore, IFG induced significant (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) proliferation of PHA elicited human PBMCs [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5C</xref>]. These results designate that IFG not only stimulates the macrophages, but also B cells and CD8 T cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IFG activated macrophages show enhancement in antigen uptake</title><p>Macrophages are extremely efficient APCs responsible for phagocytosis. Therefore, we were curious to check whether IFG stimulated macrophages acquire an enhanced capacity to phagocytose <italic>Mtb</italic>. Consequently, we stimulated macrophages with IFG and then infected them with <italic>Mtb</italic>. The extracellular bacteria were removed by extensive washings and subsequently treated with amikacin. Later, the cells were lysed and bacterial growth was enumerated by CFU plating. Remarkably, IFG significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) improved the ability of macrophages to phagocytose H37Ra, compared to unstimulated control [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>]. These results were further supported by increased uptake of other mycobacterial strains <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>] and <italic>Mtb-</italic>H37Rv [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3C</xref>]. Furthermore, our flow cytometry and confocal microscopy experiments substantiated higher uptake of GFP<sup>+</sup>-H37Ra by IFG stimulated M&#x003c6; [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6A,B</xref>]. The Z-stack [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6C</xref>] and live imaging videos [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">2</xref>] also confirmed the presence of GFP<sup>+</sup>-<italic>Mtb</italic> inside the macrophages. In addition, we validated the higher uptake capacity of GFP<sup>+</sup>-H37Ra by IFG stimulated M&#x003c6; through time point kinetics assay by flow cytometry [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3F</xref>]. Thus, these results signify the potential role of IFG in enhancing the phagocytosis by macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Induction of iNOS expression by IFG is necessary for autophagy</title><p>We next monitored the mechanism of action operating in IFG stimulated cells in restricting <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. Intriguingly, we observed that inhibition in the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> by IFG stimulated cells was operating through NO production, as evidenced by an increase in the expression of <italic>INOS</italic> by RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>], as well as through expression of iNOS in the cytosol by Western blotting experiments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>]. Further, <italic>Mtb</italic> infected M&#x003c6; on stimulation with IFG produced remarkably more nitric oxide (NO), as compared to either unstimulated or infected control macrophages [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>]. Nitric oxide is an established indicator of bactericidal activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. We substantiated the specificity of the induction of iNOS by treating <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages with iNOS inhibitor [(N-monomethyl-L-arginine), NM]. Interestingly, we observed significant decline in the NO production (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and increase in the bacterial CFUs (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) upon treatment of <italic>Mtb</italic>-M&#x003c6;IFG with NM [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C,D</xref>]. We also showed that there was downregulation in the autophagy marker LC3, when iNOS was inhibited by NM [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>]. Thus, establishing that iNOS activity is required for autophagy. Furthermore, autophagy inhibitor 3 methyl adenine (3MA) was used to unambiguously establish the induction of autophagy in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected M&#x003c6; treated with IFG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>]. Rapamycin was used as a positive control. Moreover, blocking of Akt-PI3K and NF-&#x0043a;B pathways by their respective inhibitors, substantially reduced the secretion of NO [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4F</xref>].</p><p>Autophagy plays a fundamental role in inhibiting the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Interestingly, IFG stimulation exhibited higher conversion of LC3I to LC3II, a hallmark of autophagy. We observed further amplification of autophagy by rapamycin treatment of the infected macrophages stimulated with IFG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>]. Thus corroborating the IFG induced autophagy. Additionally, blocking of Akt and PI3K pathways by their respective inhibitors inhibited the induction of autophagy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5B</xref>]. Furthermore, augmentation (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) of the autophagy genes ATG5, ATG7 and BECLIN1, categorically established the involvement of autophagy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5C&#x02013;E</xref>]. Finally, we verified this finding by observing the over expression of autophagy influx by LC3 puncta formation in GFP-H37Ra infected macrophages through confocal microscopy after IFG and rapamycin treatment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5F,G</xref>]. We observed that virulent and avirulent mycobacteria have similar responses with respect to autophagy. Interestingly, we also observed that IFG itself has an ability to induce autophagy influx in macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S7A,B</xref>). Likewise, the acidic vacuoles were stained with acridine orange dye to show the induction of autophagy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5H,I</xref>]. We also monitored autophagy by treating cells (infected and IFG stimulated) with rapamycin and correlated this with NO production and CFU burden [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5J,K</xref>]. Autophagy specific inhibitors 3MA and chloroquine (CQ) were used to establish the role of autophagy in restricting the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> by IFG stimulated M&#x003c6;. Substantial (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) reduction in the secretion of NO and increase in the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> was noticed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5L,M</xref>]. Thus, these results signify that the function of iNOS and autophagy are interlinked with each other and are possible mechanism operating in M&#x003c6;IFG in constraining the <italic>Mtb</italic> growth.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IFG induces the phosphorylation of STAT-3 and activates Akt-PI3K pathway</title><p>It has been well established that IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; interacts with its receptor IFNAR and activates tyrosine kinase Jak-1 along with Tyk-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Jak-1 stimulates and phosphorylates STAT-1/STAT-3. As a result, Akt is activated through STAT-3 along with PI3K and translocates into the nucleus. Further, it helps in delivering survival signal through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. It has been reported that like IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, IFG exhibits affinity for IFNAR and activates tyrosine kinase Jak-1 along with Tyk-2. Therefore, we investigated the mechanism involved in IFG-mediated signalling events responsible for activating macrophages to restrict the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb. Mtb</italic> infected macrophages were stimulated with IFG and phosphorylation of STAT-3, PI3K and Akt molecules were monitored by Western blotting in the cytosolic extract. Noticeable augmentation in the phosphorylation of STAT-3, PI3K and Akt was observed in the M&#x003c6;IFG [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A&#x02013;C</xref>]. The decrease in the phosphorylation of STAT-3 and PI3K was checked in M&#x003c6;-IFG by treating with their respective inhibitors [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A,B</xref>]. Further, augmentation in the anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-xL was noticed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6D</xref>]. Bcl-xL plays a vital role in providing a survival signal to the cells.

Infergen has been reported to upregulate MHC-I expression and enhance the presentation of viral peptides by APCs.

Further, like IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, IFG exhibits an optimized affinity for IFNAR and augments the survival and activation of neutrophils, macrophages, DCs, NK cells, B cells and CD8 T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Furthermore, it is reported that IFG activates various cell types to endorse viral clearance by promoting apoptosis of infected cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Unfortunately, nothing has been reported regarding the role of IFG against <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>In the past, regular efforts have been made to investigate the impact of new molecules or delineate novel role of previously established molecules in the treatment of TB. Therefore, keeping in view the above-mentioned reports, we thought to evaluate the impact of IFG on the activation of macrophages and inhibition of the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Following major findings have emerged from our study. IFG significantly i) inhibited the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the macrophages; ii) augmented the secretion of IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3;; iii) upregulated the expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86; iv) enhanced phagocytic potential of macrophages; v) enhanced CD8 T cell mediated target lysis; vi) the mechanism elucidated in curbing the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> was through the involvement of nitric oxide and autophagy; vii) signaling pathway induced by IFG was through phosphorylation of STAT-3, Akt and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B.</p><p>For the optimum activation of T cells, two signals are required. First is the occupancy of T-cell receptor (TCR) by MHC-peptide complex. Second signal is also APCs driven in the form of costimulatory molecules like CD80 and CD86. In the absence of second signal, T cells undergo anergy, i.e. a state of unresponsiveness. Upregulation of HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 by IFG indicate its potential role in the optimal activation of T cells. Further, it will help in counteracting <italic>Mtb</italic>-mediated downregulation of costimulatory molecules and thereby avoiding T cell anergy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. IFG predominantly promotes the generation of Th1 cells and CD8 T cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Both these cells are responsible for cell mediated immunity and play a cardinal role in protection against <italic>Mtb</italic>. CD8 T cells lyse the infected cells and release the intracellular <italic>Mtb.</italic> The IFN-&#x003b3; secreted by Th1 cells activate macrophages and consequently they phagocytose and eliminate the bacterium. It was an exciting observation that IFG elicited macrophages showed enhanced phagocytosis and killing of <italic>Mtb</italic>. These results reveal a novel role of IFG against <italic>Mtb.</italic></p><p>IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; interacts with IFNAR receptor and induces the activation of Jak-1 and Tyk-2. Jak-1 stimulates and phosphorylates STAT-3<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Consequently, Akt-PI3K is activated through STAT-3 and translocates into the nucleus. Further, Akt-PI3K-STAT-3 signaling helps in delivering survival signal through the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Like IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, IFG [(IFN)-&#x003b1;2b] also exhibits a specific affinity for IFNAR and activates tyrosine kinase Jak-1 along with Tyk-2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. It is also important to mention that signaling through IL-6 also follows the gp130/Jak/STAT pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. We investigated the signaling mechanism mediated by IFG in activating macrophages to restrict the intracellular survival of <italic>Mtb</italic>. We observed that <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages when activated with IFG showed release of IL-6, but no noticeable change was seen in <italic>IL-1&#x003b2;, TGF-&#x003b2;, IL-10, TNF-&#x003b1;</italic> genes except <italic>IL-6</italic> gene expression and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT-3 and Akt but not STAT-1. This indicates that IL-6 pathway is involved in IFG signaling. Phosphorylation of STAT-3 and Akt-PI3K delivers a survival signal to macrophages through upregulation of Bcl-xL and activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, thereby ensuring cell survival, activation and induction of autophagy. We speculate that STAT-3 binds to a promoter sequence of <italic>INOS</italic> gene, enhances the synthesis of iNOS and therefore production of NO that ultimately leads to the killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>]. The data were validated by blocking the Akt-PI3K, iNOS and autophagy by their respective inhibitors to establish the role of autophagy in restricting the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> by IFG stimulated macrophages. Blocking of Akt-PI3K, iNOS and autophagy, and substantial reduction in the secretion of NO and autophagy, as well as increase in the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> signifies that autophagy is directly involved in the killing of <italic>Mtb.</italic> Further, the function of iNOS and autophagy are interlinked with each other. This provides the unambiguous evidence of a possible mechanism operating in constraining the <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. It has been reported that NO suppresses mTOR expression, which leads to autophagy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Corroborating with this observation, we hypothesize that NO directly suppresses the expression of mTOR, as shown by the enhancement of NO release by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (autophagy inducer), which led to the induction of autophagy in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected and IFG stimulated human macrophages. In essence, this study provides a novel immunomodulatory and therapeutic role of IFG against intracellular pathogen <italic>Mtb</italic>, which may have enough potential in future to treat TB patients.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was permitted by the Institutional Biosafety and Ethical Committees of Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India.

We investigated the role of IFG mediated signaling mechanism in activating macrophages to restrict the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. <bold>[1]</bold> The phosphorylation of STAT-3 is induced by Jak-1. <bold>[2]</bold> Subsequently, Akt is activated through STAT-3 along with PI3K. <bold>[3,4]</bold> This signaling translocates NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus and upregulates the IL-6 secretion, which receives a feed-back mechanism through pSTAT-3, Akt and therefore induces autophagy.

<bold>[6]</bold> We propose that pSTAT-3 binds to the promoter sequence of <italic>INOS</italic> gene to produce ions in the cytosol that generates NO, a potent antimicrobial agent that may ultimately restrict the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. The data were validated by blocking the Akt-PI3K, iNOS and autophagy with their respective inhibitors to establish the role of autophagy in restricting the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> by IFG stimulated macrophages. <bold>[7]</bold> Blocking of the Akt-PI3K, iNOS (NM), autophagy (3MA|CQ) with their specific inhibitors and therefore substantial reduction in the secretion of NO and autophagy, as well as increase in the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> signifies that autophagy is directly involved in the killing of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Signifying that the function of iNOS and autophagy are interlinked. Overall, this mechanism illustrates that IFG plays a key role in controlling the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> inside macrophages.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep39492-f7"/></fig></floats-group></article>
