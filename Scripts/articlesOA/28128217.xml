However, the inverse relationship between tuberculosis and type 2 immunity is still elusive. Although type 1 immunity is essential to protection against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> it might be also detrimental to the host due to the induction of extensive tissue damage. Here, we determined whether lung type 2 immunity induced by allergen sensitization and challenge could affect the outcome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We used two different protocols in which sensitization and allergen challenge were performed before or after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We found an increased resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> only when allergen exposure was given after, but not before infection. Infected mice exposed to allergen exhibited lower bacterial load and cellular infiltrates in the lungs. Enhanced resistance to infection after allergen challenge was associated with
increased gene expression of alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages) and IL-33 levels. Accordingly, either adoptive transfer of M2 macrophages or systemic IL-33 treatment was effective in attenuating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Notably, the enhanced resistance induced by allergen exposure was dependent on IL-33 receptor ST2. Our work indicates that IL-33 might be an alternative therapeutic treatment for severe tuberculosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, remains a major public health problem with high morbidity and prevalence. It has killed almost 2 million individuals worldwide, and it is estimated that one-third of the world&#x02019;s population is infected<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Currently, one reason for its high morbidity is the appearance of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. The protective cellular immune response is associated with IFN-&#x003b3;-producing T cells and classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages). These cells produce several antibacterial effector molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and NO, which are responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory mononuclear cells, granuloma formation and mycobactericidal activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Although IFN-&#x003b3; is crucial for TB protection and a gold standard parameter of potential TB vaccines, it is apparent
that host interaction with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is extremely complex and cannot rely entirely on the induction of IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated immune responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. For instance, Th1 cells and M1 macrophages are associated with type IV hypersensitivity, a pathological immune response associated with necrosis, progressive lung damage, discharge of bacilli from the cavity and enhanced bacterial transmission<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Indeed, the paradoxical association between enhanced transmission and polarized inflammation is illustrated by clinical observations that HIV-AIDS individuals who have impaired type 1 immunity and are co-infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> experience very high bacterial loads but transmit relatively fewer bacteria from person to person<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Collectively, these studies highlight the complex balance between type 1 immunity, tissue damage and bacterial control.</p><p>The concept that type 1 and type 2 immunity are mutually inhibitory has been applied in experimental asthma with promising results, as shown by several reports indicating that mycobacterial infections or antigens induce both prophylactic and therapeutic protective effects in allergic lung disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. However, the reverse situation is more complex to ascertain because one must consider bacterial multiplication in addition to preventing tissue immunopathology. Nevertheless, type 2 immunity is associated with M2 macrophages that promote wound repair and tissue regeneration that in turn, might protect lung from tissue destruction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In contrast, M2 macrophages exhibit low antimicrobial immunity, which might be detrimental to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Here, we determined the impact of lung type 2 immunity induced by ovalbumin as an allergen on the outcome of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. For
this purpose, we established two basic protocols in which allergen sensitization and challenge was given before or after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. We found that increased resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection was achieved when allergen was administered after infection. Enhanced resistance of allergen-exposed mice compared to infected mice was associated with augmented population of lung CD11c<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells expressing the mannose receptor (CD206) and increased gene expression of M2 macrophages. Moreover, adoptive transfer of M2 macrophages or systemic IL-33 treatment was also effective in controlling <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Importantly, the enhanced resistance induced by the allergen was dependent on the IL-33 receptor ST2. Our data indicate a new mechanism for enhanced resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection mediated by IL-33/ST2 axis and suggests an alternative therapeutic treatment for severe TB.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Allergen exposure after ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection increases resistance</title><p>To assess the impact of Th2 immunity on the outcome of mycobacterial infection, we first infected mice with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and then sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (TB/OVA group) as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>. We expected that by inducing OVA-specific Th2 immunity, the resistance to mycobacterial infection would be impaired. Surprisingly, we found that after allergen challenge, mice were more resistant to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection as revealed by significantly decreased CFU (Colony Forming Unit) counts in TB/OVA group compared to TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). BALF differential cell counts showed that the number of eosinophils was increased and neutrophils was significantly reduced in TB/OVA group compared with TB group, while there was no difference in macrophage and lymphocyte counts between both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection inhibited OVA-induced lung allergic responses
such as eosinophilia, IL-4 and IL-5 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>&#x02013;e). However, when lung cell cultures were re-stimulated with Ovalbumin (Ova) the TB/OVA group produced significant levels of IL-4 and IL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1f</xref>,g). Mucus production revealed by PAS staining (Mucus index) was also reduced in TB/OVA group when compared to OVA group. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1h</xref>,i). Histopathological analysis showed that the lungs of both groups exhibited a multifocal granulomatous response, but areas of lung infiltrates were significantly decreased in the TB/OVA group compared to the TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1j</xref>&#x02013;k). Remarkably, IFN-&#x003b3; production by lung cells cultured with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens was not significantly different between the TB and TB/OVA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1l</xref>). Allergen exposure was without effect on the levels of IgG1 or IgG2a against mycobacterial antigens
(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>,b). Finally, when the TB/OVA protocol was extended to 80 days post-infection as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>, we still observed significantly decreased lung CFU counts in the TB/OVA group compared with the TB group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). We conclude that airway allergen exposure given after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection improves mycobacterial clearance and lung pathology. However, the reverse situation as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref> was detrimental to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2d</xref>), but reduced Th2-associated allergic responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2e</xref>&#x02013;h).</p><p>Collectively, our results show that Th2 immunity established after, but not before mycobacterial infection, increases resistance to infection, while mycobacterial infection, irrespective of the time, protects against asthma development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Allergen exposure after ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection results in mixed expression of M1/M2 macrophage markers in lungs</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> primarily infects macrophages that in turn, when properly activated, express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that is associated with resistance to experimental tuberculosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Because <italic>iNOS</italic> expression is a marker of M1 macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and Th2 immunity induce M2 macrophages, we decided to investigate the expression of M1 and M2 markers in the lung. For this purpose, we evaluated <italic>iNOS</italic> expression as a M1 marker and Arg1, Fizz1 and Ym1 gene expression as M2 markers. Allergen exposure did not affect the expression of <italic>iNOS</italic> as revealed by similar <italic>iNOS</italic> gene expression in the TB group compared to TB/OVA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, the expression of M2 markers was significantly increased in TB/OVA mice when compared to TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results indicate that allergen exposure in infected mice up regulated gene expression associated
with M2 macrophages. Because PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates M2 polarization and affects <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, we determined PGE<sub>2</sub> production in TB/OVA mice. We found that allergen exposure did not affect PGE<sub>2</sub> production (data not shown). To further characterize the M2-like phenotype in the lungs, we performed FACS analysis on lung cells expressing the mannose receptor (CD206), another M2 marker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and CD11c, which is known to be expressed by lung macrophages and dendritic cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. We found that the number and the frequency of CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly higher in the lungs of TB/OVA mice than in the TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Finally, we measured the TNF expression as a marker of lung inflammation and found a lower expression of TNF in TB/OVA than in TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). We conclude that allergen exposure
increased M2-type myeloid cells and decreased TNF expression, but did not affect <italic>iNOS</italic> expression. Therefore, our results indicate that a mixed M1/M2 lung immunity and lower TNF expression is associated with better outcome of mycobacterial infection.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Airway adoptive transfer of M2 macrophages enhances resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>To directly evaluate the role of M2 macrophages in resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, we generated M2 macrophages from bone marrow cultures and administered them to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice by intra-tracheal route. Remarkably, animals that received M2 macrophages on 30 days post-infection exhibited significantly lower lung CFU counts than infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). Accordingly, lungs from infected and adoptively transferred mice exhibited higher <italic>Fizz1</italic> but lower <italic>iNOS</italic> gene expression than infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3c</xref> confirms that bone marrow-derived M2 macrophages stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) reached the lungs. These results indicate that M2 macrophages have a beneficial effect on mycobacterial infection. To mimic the microenvironment occurring <italic>in vivo</italic> in our experiments, we evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic> the phagocytic and
microbicidal activity of M2 macrophages in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;. In absence of IFN-&#x003b3;, M2 macrophages showed higher phagocytic activity than M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>) and as expected, M1 macrophages exhibited higher microbicidal activity than M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>). However, upon stimulation with IFN-&#x003b3;, M2 macrophages increased their bactericidal activity, which was even higher than that obtained with M1 macrophages. Taken together, these results indicate that M2 macrophages in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;, a likely situation that occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, exhibit strong mycobactericidal activity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Enhanced resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection after airway allergen challenge is critically dependent on IL-33 receptor ST2</title><p>Since enhanced resistance to ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection after allergen exposure was associated with M2-like cells and M2 macrophage cell transfers proved to be beneficial on mycobacterial infection, we were interested in determining the cytokines that could be involved in this process. Among type 2 cytokines, IL-33 plays a pivotal role in type 2 immunity, induces M2 macrophage polarization and it is known to induce pleiotropic and protective functions in Th1 pathologies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Therefore, we first performed <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with bone marrow differentiated M0, M1 and M2 macrophages stimulated or not with Poly I:C<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and found that IL-33 was secreted only by M2 macrophages (Poly I:C stimulated 354&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;37 vs Medium 68&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). To ascertain the role of IL-33 in our model, we first used the IL-33 receptor ST2
knockout mice (ST2KO mice). For this, we evaluated the bacterial loads in the lungs of animals with ongoing mycobacterial infection that were sensitized and challenged with allergen. Infected WT and ST2KO mice (TB groups) showed similar bacterial loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). However, after allergen exposure (TB/OVA groups), bacterial load decreased in WT but not in ST2KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). The <italic>iNOS</italic> gene expression in the lungs of ST2KO-TB and ST2KO-TB/OVA mice was similar, and this expression was higher than those in their respective WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Accordingly, M2-type phenotype revealed by Arg1 and Fizz1 gene expression as well as by the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs, was significantly lower in ST2KO-TB/OVA mice than in WT-TB/OVA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>,e). These results clearly indicate that IL-33 receptor ST2 is critical to induce enhanced
resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection after allergen exposure and gene expression associated with M2 macrophages.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>IL-33 treatment ameliorates ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection</title><p>Our results indicated that IL-33 production appears to be critical in the protective effect on mycobacterial infection. Therefore, we determined the levels of IL-33 in our model and found that the levels of IL-33 in the lungs of TB/OVA mice, but not in OVA/TB (data not shown), were higher compared to the TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). Hence, to directly test the role of IL-33 in mycobacterial infection, we treated 30-day-infected mice with recombinant IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). We found that treatment with IL-33 (TB&#x02009;+&#x02009;IL-33) resulted in a significant decrease in lung CFU counts compared with non-treated infected mice (TB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). Since, previous reports indicated that IL-33 treatment induce type 2 cytokines production and recruitment of eosinophils and mononuclear cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, we determined the magnitude of airway inflammation after IL-33 treatment. We found that IL-33-treated
animals showed lower number of total cells and neutrophils in BALF when compared to non-treated TB group and surprisingly IL-33 did not induce eosinophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). These results indicated that IL-33 treatment in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice has an anti-inflammatory activity. Accordingly, the expression of IL-1&#x003b2;, another broad marker of inflammation, was reduced in IL-33-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>). Importantly, the number of CD11c-positive cells expressing CD206 increased after IL-33 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5f</xref>) indicating that IL-33 induced M2-type cells. Accordingly, the lungs of IL-33-treated mice showed decreased expression of M1 marker (<italic>iNOS2</italic>) and increased expression of M2 markers (<italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Ym1</italic>) compared to the TB group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5g</xref>&#x02013;i).</p><p>All together, these results indicate that IL-33 treatment ameliorates ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection that is associated with increased M2 gene expression and with a population of myeloid cells expressing CD206.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is now recognized that new therapeutic strategies are needed to improve the control of all forms of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Macrophages are key cells in mycobacterial infection, and although M1 macrophages are essential in pathogen killing, they are also involved in tissue damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Therefore, one potential target for therapeutic intervention is the control of lung tissue damage as consequence of the host inflammatory responses. In autoimmune diseases, the control of tissue inflammation is a therapeutic gold standard. However, in infectious diseases, the control of tissue inflammation might lead to uncontrolled pathogen multiplication. M2 macrophages are involved in tissue repair and are associated with Th2 immunity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>, while mycobacterial infections are known to protect against allergic lung inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Here we asked whether allergen challenge in animals sensitized to OVA after
established mycobacterial infection could affect the outcome of ongoing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The findings reported here show that airway allergen challenge in mice previously infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (TB/OVA) decreased bacillus multiplication in the lungs. The enhanced resistance experienced by TB/OVA group was associated with gene expression of M2 macrophages, mannose receptor (CD206)-expressing myeloid cells and IL-33. Importantly, airway allergen challenge did not reduce the production of IFN-&#x003b3; and iNOS2 gene expression that are associated with a protective cellular immune response against experimental TB<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. However, TNF-&#x003b1; production, which is also associated with M1 macrophages, was decreased in our TB/OVA model. This decrease in TNF-&#x003b1; levels might indicate a decreased lung inflammatory response resulting from reduced bacterial load, while <italic>iNOS2</italic> expression might be associated
with IFN-&#x003b3; production. Recently, humoral immunity has been implicated in the control of mycobacterial infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. However, in our model, allergen challenge did not affect the production of IgG1 and IgG2a against mycobacterial antigens. Neutrophils might have a protective role during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, however we found a reduction in the number of neutrophils in the BALF and a reduction of mycobacterial load in TB/OVA compared to TB group. Therefore, we favor the notion that the reduced neutrophil infiltration in our model might be a consequence of reduced lung inflammation.</p><p>Although CD206 is a marker of M2 macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, its expression by myeloid cell population found in the lungs does not necessarily indicate that in fact M2 macrophages are responsible for the beneficial effect on the infection. To directly address the participation of M2 macrophages in resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, we performed experiments with M2 macrophages derived from bone marrow-cultures. We found that adoptively transferred M2 macrophages enhanced the resistance of infected mice compared to those animals that did not receive cell transfer. In addition, upon stimulation with IFN-&#x003b3;, a situation that mimics the <italic>in vivo</italic> microenvironment in the lungs of infected mice, M2 macrophages increased their bactericidal activity. These unexpected findings suggest a new role for M2 macrophages in infections by showing that in addition to controlling tissue damage M2 macrophages might also control bacterial growth in a
pro-inflammatory microenvironment. This type of response is similar to the concept of tolerance to infection that is defined as a host defense strategy that reduces the negative impact of infection on host fitness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, avoiding tissue damage. In this scenario, the granuloma is initially associated with host protection because it circumvents the infectious focus and avoids spreading. However, in the chronic phase, large granuloma may contribute to the progression of bacillus growth because it dampens the interactions between T lymphocytes and infected cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Moreover, the recruitment of highly polarized M1 macrophages may result in tissue necrosis and the dissemination of bacilli. In our study we observed a reduction in the sizes of granuloma-like structures in the lungs of TB/OVA mice. Accordingly, Hammar&#x000e9;n <italic>et al</italic>. recently showed that low bacterial loads found in zebrafish infected with <italic>M. marinum</italic> were
associated with induction of a type 2 immune response 30 days post-infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Conversely, the lack of a Th2 immune response was associated with TB progression due to excessive Th1 responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. Excessive inflammation was also shown to occur in <italic>Tir8-</italic>deficient mice that succumb rapidly to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis,</italic> despite efficiently controlling the infection in different organs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>. Because Tir8 is a negative regulator of TLR/IL-1R signaling, the high mortality of <italic>Tir8-</italic>deficient mice was attributed to a massive inflammatory response. IL-33/ST2 axis has also been implicated in down modulation of TLR signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. ST2 is an inhibitor of interleukin 1 receptor and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling and maintains endotoxin tolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. We found that among type 2 cytokines involved in allergic responses or lung damage, IL-33 was increased in the lungs of infected mice exposed to
the allergen. Therefore we studied ST2KO mice in our model. Our results showed that infected ST2KO mice exhibited no difference in lung CFU recovery compared with infected WT mice and are in line with those reported by Wieland <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. Notably, we found that IL-33 receptor ST2 deficiency abolished the enhanced resistance of infected mice exposed to allergen challenge and all type 2 responses associated with enhanced resistance. These findings indicate a pivotal role of IL-33/ST2 axis in protection to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Therefore, we treated infected mice with recombinant IL-33 and found that the treatment reproduced the observed resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection associated with allergen exposure or M2 macrophage cell transfers. Our work are in line with previous work showing a protective effect of IL-33 treatment in cerebral malaria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, another example of severe inflammation. Because we found decreased
<italic>iNOS2</italic> expression during IL-33 treatment and in experiments with M2 cell transfers, we suggest that other alternative mycobactericidal activity might be operating. Recent report showed that itaconic acid produced by macrophages has antimicrobial activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Also, the production of itaconic acid is regulated by IRG1 gene, which in turn, is activated by molecules (IL-10, HO-1 and CO) that can be associated with M2 macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. However, IL-33 was described as a promising adjuvant that increased the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine expressing <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigen 85B<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, suggesting that it could be an effective tool for the development of vaccines against TB. It should be noted that the beneficial effects of type 2 immunity are time- and context-dependent. For instance, established type 2 immunity before mycobacterial infection is detrimental to the host as previously shown by Potian for helminth
infection<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and by us in the OVA/TB model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>,d). In a similar approach employed with a keratitis model induced by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> corneal infection, Hazlett <italic>et al</italic>. showed that treatment with recombinant IL-33 was protective<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. It is highly desirable that new therapies for TB should involve two approaches: to improve cellular effector mechanisms and to prevent lung damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Indeed, tissue damage as a consequence of sustained inflammation causes permanent debility even in cured TB patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Our results show the potential therapeutic effects of IL-33 in established mycobacterial infection and highlight that IL-33 might represent an alternative therapeutic agent for advanced TB.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Female BALB/c and ST2KO mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks) were obtained from the breeding facility of the Medical School of Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, University S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FMRP-USP).
