It is generally assumed that this protection is due to direct inhibition of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) growth, which prevents subsequent pathological inflammation. In contrast, we report NO primarily protects mice by repressing an interleukin-1 and 12/15-lipoxygenase dependent neutrophil recruitment cascade that promotes bacterial replication. Using Mtb mutants as indicators of the pathogen's environment, we inferred that granulocytic inflammation generates a nutrient-replete niche that supports Mtb growth. Parallel clinical studies indicate that a similar inflammatory pathway promotes TB in patients. The human 12/15 lipoxygenase ortholog, ALOX12, is expressed in cavitary TB lesions, the abundance of its products correlate with the number of airway neutrophils and bacterial burden, and a genetic polymorphism that increases ALOX12 expression is associated with TB risk. These data suggest that Mtb exploits neutrophilic inflammation to preferentially replicate at sites of tissue damage that promote contagion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">Despite Mtb's ability to sustain a persistent infection that can last for decades, most individuals remain asymptomatic because their immune response effectively contains the pathogen. Only a fraction of those infected with Mtb will develop the progressive inflammatory disease, tuberculosis. In these individuals, continual bacterial replication and progressive necrosis produces cavitary lesions contiguous with the airway, which allow bacteria to exit the host and infect others<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. While all infected individuals mount a robust immune response to the pathogen, the immune mechanisms that differentiate protection from disease remain unclear.</p><p id="P3">Protective immunity to TB requires T cell-derived interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;), which induces expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) required for generating nitric oxide (NO) in macrophages. Animals lacking either of these factors suffer from severe TB disease characterized by high bacterial loads and granulocytic inflammation<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. This correlation between neutrophils, Mtb burden, and pathology is a common feature of both animal models and human TB<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Since NO can kill Mtb in axenic culture, most models of protective immunity posit that this mediator primarily acts by inhibiting bacterial replication, which limits the subsequent inflammatory tissue damage. However, NO also inhibits inflammation by repressing the Caspase1-dependent processing of pro-IL-1&#x003b2;, and this activity prevents persistent neutrophil recruitment<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. We sought to quantify the individual contribution of these two distinct activities of NO.</p><sec id="S1"><title>The primary protective role of NO is anti-inflammatory</title><p id="P4">Upon infection with Mtb, mice deficient for inducible NO generation, either due to genetic deletion of the <italic>Nos2</italic> gene<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> or chemical inhibition with aminoguanidine (AG)<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>, suffer from high bacterial burdens, weight loss, and progressive granulocyte accumulation that correlates with increased IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig.1a-e</xref>). The granulocytes that accumulate in the lungs and spleens of <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals were predominantly CD11b+, Gr1<sup>hi</sup>, Ly-6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly-6G<sup>hi</sup>, and had the nuclear morphology of neutrophils (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1f-i</xref>). A smaller proportion of Gr1<sup>int</sup> myeloid cells with more heterogeneous cytological appearances was also present, as shown in other susceptible mice<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Bone marrow chimeric mice were created to identify the source of protective NO and determine if this compound's cell-intrinsic antimicrobial activity is responsible for inhibiting disease. Hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with wild type, but not <italic>Nos2</italic>-deficient, bone marrow cells inhibited all metrics of disease; weight loss, neutrophil influx, and bacterial replication (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). To determine if the loss of <italic>Nos2</italic> diminished the cell-autonomous anti-microbial capacity of the macrophage, wild type recipients were reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of bone marrow cells from congenically marked wild type or mutant mice lacking either <italic>Nos2</italic> or the IFN&#x003b3; receptor (<italic>Ifngr</italic>). After a month of infection, chimerism of the CD11b+ myeloid compartment was maintained, indicating that both genotypes populated the lung and that no obvious differences in cell death were apparent (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b-c</xref>). At this time point, leukocytes were isolated from the lung, the wild type and mutant cells were separated, and the bacterial burden in each subpopulation was quantified. The relative proportion of Ly6G-positive and &#x02013;negative cells recovered from each set of chimeric animals varied to some degree, but the purified cells were found to be an accurate representation of the populations found in the lung (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d-e</xref>). While <italic>Ifngr-</italic> deficient cells harbored significantly more bacteria than wild type, no difference in bacterial burden was observed between wild type and <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, though both <italic>Ifngr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> chimeric mice had relatively higher bacterial load in their lungs than the wild type (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-d</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary figure 2f-g</xref>). It is possible that diffusible NO might partially complement an anti-microbial defect in the <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. However, the greater effect of <italic>Ifngr</italic> deletion indicates that IFN&#x003b3;-dependent anti-microbial processes<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> are important for the control of Mtb replication, and that these processes are largely independent of Nos2.</p><p id="P5">Since we were unable to detect a cell-autonomous antimicrobial function for Nos2, we hypothesized that NO's IL-1 modulating anti-inflammatory activity might be responsible for protection. IL-1 plays a complex role in TB. This cytokine is produced early in infection, when it promotes anti-bacterial activity in macrophages<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and is essential for the establishment of immunity<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Later, upon onset of adaptive immunity, IL-1 production is suppressed by NO and the over-production of this cytokine can promote neutrophil influx and disease<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Thus, to specifically assess the importance of NO's ability to prevent IL-1 dependent neutrophil recruitment, we allowed the infection to progress for two weeks before inhibiting IL-1 signaling with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Rn) and/or depleting granulocytic precursors with the cytosine analog gemcitabine. Gemcitabine treatment reduced the number of lung neutrophils, histopathological disease, and wasting observed in Mtb-infected <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, and the co-administration of IL-1Rn accentuated this effect (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). These treatments specifically affected the accumulation of neutrophils in the <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, as the numbers of other leukocytes were not altered (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Remarkably, the anti-inflammatory activity of these treatments also restored control of bacterial replication. In this experiment, the number of neutrophils in the tissue correlated with bacterial burden and weight loss, and combination therapy returned these metrics to a level comparable with wild type C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). This observation suggested that sustained neutrophil recruitment might be the primary cause of both failed anti-mycobacterial immunity and tissue damage in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p id="P6">To further investigate the relationship between neutrophils and bacterial replication, we employed more specific reagents to inhibit the accumulation of these cells. CXCR2 signaling promotes neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of Mtb-infected mice<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. We confirmed that lung-infiltrating neutrophils expressed CXCR2, and that <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice recruited more CXCR2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Like gemcitabine and IL-1Rn, pharmacological inhibition of CXCR2 reduced the number of neutrophils and bacteria in the lungs of <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). The same effect was observed upon administration of the anti-Ly6G antibody, 1A8, which depleted Gr1<sup>hi</sup> neutrophils (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3c-d</xref>). We conclude that NO's primary protective function in this model was to restrict the accumulation of neutrophils, and its direct anti-microbial activity played a relatively minor role. To extend the observations beyond the <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse model, we investigated the role of neutrophils in the susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mouse. These animals develop inflammatory TB lesions due to increased macrophage necrosis, and accumulate a large number of neutrophils in their lungs and spleen, relative to C57BL/6 mice<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1h and 3e</xref>). As observed in <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals, 1A8 administration depleted Gr-1<sup>hi</sup> neutrophils, and reduced lung bacterial burden in C3HeB/FeJ mice (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3f</xref>), verifying that neutrophil influx promoted bacterial replication in multiple models of TB susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Neutrophilic inflammation creates a growth-permissive environment for Mtb</title><p id="P7">The ability of neutrophil influx to increase the burden of Mtb suggested that this generally anti-microbial immune response was paradoxically creating a growth-permissive environment for Mtb. To investigate whether a change in the leukocytes encountered by Mtb could contribute to these environmental alterations, mice were infected with fluorescent Mtb that could be quantified by flow cytometry. We found that the loss of <italic>Nos2</italic> altered the distribution of bacteria between myeloid populations. In both lung and spleen, the primary reservoir of Mtb changed from CD11b+, Ly-6G- monocytes/macrophages in wild type mice to CD11b+, Ly-6G<sup>hi</sup> neutrophils in <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> animals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-d</xref>).</p><p id="P8">Unlike activated macrophages, neutrophils do not produce significant amounts of NO<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and have a very limited capacity to restrict the replication of Mtb <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. We confirmed that while wild type and <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils were equally capable of killing gram-negative bacterial pathogens in <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture, these cells did not alter the viability of Mtb (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a-c</xref>). As a result, we hypothesized that neutrophil-rich lesions might represent a relatively benign niche for Mtb. To understand how growth in association with neutrophils altered the bacterial environment, we profiled the behavior of a bacterial mutant library in mice that develop histiocytic (C57BL/6) and granulocytic (<italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) lesions. To assess the impact of altered host cell association, and not simply the loss of NO <italic>per se</italic>, we also included the C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain in which neutrophil depletion reduce bacterial burden (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Each mouse was infected with a saturated library of &#x0223c;50,000 independent Mtb transposon mutants, in which every non-essential gene is disrupted by insertion. One month after intravenous infection, bacteria were recovered and the relative abundance of each bacterial mutant in the three differentially selected libraries was compared by deep sequencing the amplified transposon-chromosome junctions. This approach provides a measure of each gene's contribution to the pathogen's fitness under conditions encountered in each mouse strain<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. To maintain the complexity of the library in every animal, we assessed the relative fitness of bacterial mutants in the spleen, which represented a tractable model for the differential association of Mtb with macrophages versus neutrophils (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). The majority of mutants with significantly altered representation in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice displayed comparable differential growth in C3HeB/FeJ animals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), indicating that the bacterium is encountering a similar environment in these two mouse strains.</p><p id="P9">This analysis predominantly identified genes that were less stringently required for growth in the more permissive, hyper-inflammatory hosts (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, green quadrant). The genes of known function belonged to a small number of pathways related to stress responses and nutrient acquisition. One class of differentially required genes contained functions implicated in NO resistance that were less-stringently required in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These included the <italic>ctpC</italic> and <italic>sseA</italic> genes that are necessary for toxic radical resistance<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, the Mpa subunit of the proteasome that influences NO sensitivity<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, and genes required for the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a lipid that inhibits the recruitment of Nos2-expressing myeloid cells<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). Together, these mechanisms appear to make Mtb resistant to the levels of NO encountered <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="P10">A second class of pathways related to nutrient acquisition was found to be less important in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and C3HeB/FeJ mice. Mutants lacking genes required for Mtb's only iron scavenging siderophore (<italic>mbtGFEADCBA</italic>)<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> were lost specifically from the C57BL/6-passaged pool, indicating scavenging this micronutrient is less important in the susceptible mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e-f</xref>). Neutrophilic inflammation also appeared to alter macronutrient availability. Mutations in central metabolic genes and regulators indicated that genes necessary for long-chain fatty acid uptake (Mce1)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, lipid catabolism (KstR regulon)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and conversion of lipid substrates to biomass through gluconeogenesis (PckA)<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> were more important for bacterial growth in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and C3HeB/FeJ animals (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, g</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). We infer that Mtb growing in association with neutrophils encounters a more hospitable environment that is replete with micronutrients, such as iron and lipid carbon sources.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>IL-1 dependent 12/15-lipoxygenase expression promotes neutrophil recruitment and disease</title><p id="P11">We hypothesized that the pathological neutrophil recruitment cascade that is derepressed in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice might be a more general mechanism promoting TB susceptibility in some individuals. Since previous work found that neutrophil influx into the lungs of <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice required NLRP3 inflammasome dependent IL-1 production<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, we sought to define the inflammatory pathway downstream of IL-1 that is responsible for disease in these animals. To do this, we profiled the expression of a panel of proinflammatory mediators in animals that were lacking either <italic>Nlrp3</italic> or the <italic>Il1r1</italic>. This panel focused on TNF as a known inflammatory cytokine regulated by IL-1, and the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, which produce potent inflammation-modulating eicosanoids<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>). To eliminate the contribution of differential bacterial replication in these mice, we used an auxotrophic strain of Mtb that is unable to replicate during infection, but remains viable and promotes an inflammatory reaction<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. As expected, deletion of either <italic>Nlrp3</italic> or <italic>Il1r1</italic> abolished neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of infected animals, even when Nos2 was inhibited (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Of the eicosanoid-biosynthetic enzymes that we profiled, only the expression of <italic>Alox15</italic>, which encodes the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) enzyme, correlated with neutrophil influx (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). <italic>Alox15</italic> mRNA levels were significantly increased upon Nos2 inhibition, and this induction depended upon both Nlrp3 and the ll1r1. Alox15 protein was predominately associated with the leukocytic infiltrate in mouse lung, and was particularly abundant in the context of Nos2 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Consistent with these observations, <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice recruited very few neutrophils to their lungs upon Mtb infection, when compared to wild type controls. Even Nos2 inhibition did not promote neutrophil recruitment in <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). In contrast, deletion of <italic>Alox5</italic>, which encodes the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), had no effect on neutrophil recruitment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>). Similarly, mice lacking the leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (<italic>Ltb4r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), which governs neutrophil chemotaxis in response to 5-LOX derived LTB4<sup>30</sup>, had a relatively minor impairment in neutrophil influx when compared to <italic>Alox15</italic> deletion (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). As we observed with neutrophil depletion in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the reduction in lung neutrophils in <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice correlated with a reversal in weight loss, improvement of histopathological disease, and restoration of bacterial control after Nos2 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). Neither neutrophil depletion or <italic>Alox15</italic> deletion significantly affected CFU numbers in Nos2-sufficient animals, likely because relatively few neutrophils infiltrate the lung in this situation. Pharmacological blockade of 12/15-LOX<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, had a qualitatively similar effect as genetic deletion of <italic>Alox15</italic>, ruling out unappreciated developmental effects of the <italic>Alox15</italic> mutation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). By these metrics of disease, <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were essentially resistant to the exacerbated TB disease caused by Nos2 inhibition (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).

No significant alterations in COX products were observed between these cohorts. The abundance of both the 5-LOX product, LTB4, and the 12/15-LOX product, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), correlated with the degree of inflammation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). As both of these products are produced by inflammatory leukocytes, we concluded that LOX products are markers of neutrophil influx. However, our genetic data specifically implicated 12/15-LOX products as the primary drivers of inflammation.</p><p id="P14">12/15-LOX produces 12-hydroperoxyeicosateraenoic acid (12-HpETE) and 12-HETE which could be responsible for pro-inflammatory effects either by acting directly on neutrophils<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> or through conversion into more potent chemotactic mediators<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. To verify that 12/15-LOX products could contribute to neutrophil recruitment during Mtb infection, we supplemented <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals with 12-HETE. This treatment restored neutrophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to wild type levels (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). The opposing effects of <italic>Nos2</italic> and <italic>Alox15</italic> were manifested predominantly in the airway, modulation of these mediators had only a modest effect on the number of neutrophils remaining in the lung after lavage, and no significant effect on the number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>/Ly-6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). 12-HETE supplementation of both wild type and <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice increased the total number of lung neutrophils, and the numbers of these cells correlated with bacterial burden throughout this experiment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>).

Significant differences in eicosanoid pathways exist between mice and humans. For example, the 12- and 15-LOX activities possessed by murine 12/15-LOX are expressed by separate human proteins. To account for these differences, a total of 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six eicosanoid-modifying genes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>) were genotyped in a cohort of TB patients and healthy controls. These SNPs were prioritized based on their minor allele frequency (&#x0003e;10%) and their position in 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; untranslated regions that could alter gene expression.</p><p id="P16">Polymorphic alleles of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene were previously associated with TB susceptibility<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. In general support of these findings, our diseased group was enriched for the minor alleles of two LTA4H SNPs. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance after multiple testing correction (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Similarly, no significant association was found for SNPs in genes encoding COX-1 (PTGS1), COX -2 (PTGS2), or 15-LOX1 (ALOX15). In contrast, among 12 SNPs in the 5-LOX gene (ALOX5), one was significantly associated with TB. More notably, two SNPs (rs3840880 and rs9904779) near the myeloid/platelet-expressed 12-LOX (ALOX12) gene, which produces 12-HETE in humans, were associated with TB (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Both rs3840880 and rs9904779 are located in the promoter region of the ALOX12 gene. Using a luciferase reporter system, the TB-associated allele of rs3840880 produced significantly higher transcriptional activity than its allelic variant, indicating a direct effect of this polymorphism on ALOX12 expression. No significant difference in transcription was observed between allelic variants at position rs9904779 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-b</xref>). These results provided genetic evidence that increased ALOX12 expression could promote TB.</p><p id="P18">To further investigate whether human 12-LOX activity correlates with inflammatory TB, we assessed the concentration of its product, 12-HETE, in relation to disease, bacterial burden, and neutrophil infiltration. The 12-HETE concentration in peripheral blood of TB patients was significantly higher than in healthy cohorts (HC) or patients with non-TB lung diseases. (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Plasma 12-HETE levels decreased significantly over the first three months of TB chemotherapy (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>) mirroring the clearance of bacteria. Moreover, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of TB patients, the level of 12-HETE positively correlated with the abundance of neutrophils (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). This association was similar to that observed previously for IL-1&#x003b2; and neutrophils in BALF of TB patients<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">The association between 12-LOX and granulocytic inflammation was further investigated in human cavitary TB lesions using quantitative immunohistochemistry. These lesions consist of an acellular necrotic center (caseum), which is sequentially surrounded by a myeloid cell-rich region (&#x02018;macrophage rim&#x02019;) and a fibrotic capsule. Quantification of multiple lesions indicated that inflammatory markers, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and myeloperoxidase (MPO) expressing neutrophils, were found in the region adjacent to the caseum (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-g</xref>). This region encompassed both the cellular and fibrotic outer edge of the cavity and the macrophage rim. Consistent with the pro-inflammatory role played by its murine ortholog, we found that human 12-LOX expression was concentrated in this TNF-&#x003b1; and MPO-rich region of the cavitary granuloma (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>) which was previously defined as an inflammatory region<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Collectively, these clinical and histopathological observations indicate that ALOX12 expression and 12-HETE levels correlate with TB disease, the burden of bacteria, and the recruitment of neutrophils. More generally, these findings support a coordinated role for IL-1 and 12-LOX products in the generation of inflammatory lesions that promote the replication and dissemination of Mtb.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S5"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P20">The protective roles of IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b3;-inducible NO are often attributed to a direct anti-microbial activity, and our data confirm that IFN&#x003b3; signaling is essential for the control of Mtb intracellular growth (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In contrast, the basis for susceptibility <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was not related to cell-autonomous anti-microbial defect. Instead, NO's primary role was anti-inflammatory, and the lack of Nos2 increased susceptibility by providing a growth-permissive milieu for the pathogen in association with neutrophils. Since NO cannot account for the observed anti-microbial activity of IFN&#x003b3; signaling, other effector mechanisms induced by this cytokine<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, must be responsible for IFN&#x003b3;'s ability to control the replication of Mtb.</p><p id="P21">While neutrophil depletion can extend the survival of Mtb-susceptible mouse strains other than <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the relative contributions of neutrophil-mediated tissue damage versus the amplification of bacterial replication have not been determined in these models. As a result, it is currently unclear if the neutrophils in other mouse models are functionally similar to those found in <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Indeed, Ly6G<sup>+</sup> granulocytes are now appreciated to encompass a variety of subsets that serve both phagocytic and immunomodulatory roles<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.

Instead, Mtb appears to exploit the increased accessibility of nutrients in granulocyte-rich lesions (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). We speculate that the inferred abundance of nutrients is due to the cell death observed in advanced TB lesions, which are rich in the lipid carbon substrates preferred by Mtb<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and are likely to contain iron sources such as heme that Mtb can acquire without mycobactin<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. A remarkable similarity between these two pathogens is the common reliance on inflammation for efficient transmission, salmonella via generation of bacteria-rich inflammatory diarrhea, and Mtb via generation of cavitary lesions that facilitate the production of infectious aerosols. Enhancement of transmission provides strong selection for these pathogens to thrive at sites of intense inflammation that would be lethal to other microbes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Mice</title><p id="P23">C57BL/6 (stock no. 000664), <italic>Nos2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129P2-Nos2&#x02122;<sup>1Lau</sup>/J, stock no. 002609), <italic>Alox15<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S2-<italic>Alox15&#x02122;<sup>1Fun</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 002778) and <italic>Alox5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S2-<italic>Alox5&#x02122;<sup>1Fun</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 004155), C3HeB/FeJ (stock no. 00658), B6.SJL-<italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup> Pepc<sup>b</sup></italic>/BoyJ carrying the pan leukocyte marker CD45.1 or Ly-5.1 (stock no. 002014), <italic>Ltb4r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S4-<italic>Ltb4r1&#x02122;<sup>1Adl</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 008102), <italic>Il1r1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S7-<italic>Il1r1&#x02122;<sup>1Imx</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 003245and <italic>Nlrp3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B6.129S6-<italic>Nlrp3&#x02122;<sup>1Bhk</sup></italic>/J, stock no. 021302) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

Sections were stained for nuclei (DAPI, blue staining), ALOX12 (Alexa488, green staining), myeloperoxidase, MPO, to identify granulocytes (Cy3, red staining), and Iba-1, a macrophage marker (Cy5, cyan staining). As controls, pre-immune serum and isotype matched controls were used (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary figure 8</xref>). After incubation, the tissues were washed several times with sterile TBS at room temperature and incubated in the respective secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-goat or anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa-488, Alexa588, or Alexa-647) and streptavidin conjugated to Texas-red for mycobacterium detection for at least 1h at room temperature. Tissue sections were mounted using Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen, grand Island, NY) with DAPI, and the tissue sections were examined in an A1 confocal microscope equipped with a spectrum detection and unmixing systems (Nikon Instruments Inc., Japan).

To analyze and quantify abundance of the study proteins, the number of positive pixels as well as their intensity in macrophages were measured in specific regions of interest. In addition, for each cell population, a linear intensity histogram was generated to examine the expression of each enzyme inside defined cell types or in caseum. To measure the distance from the center of the granuloma or cavity in a manner that was consistent across lesions with caseous foci of varying diameters, we used the macrophage layer directly subtending the caseum as the &#x02018;anchor point&#x02019; and computed pixel density both in the inward and outward directions from the anchor point. To compare protein abundance across tissues, similar numbers of cells and areas were included in the 3D deconvoluted optical reconstructions. This analysis avoids problems associated with inflammatory versus normal tissues where density and structure of the tissue are different. Adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin &#x00026; eosin (H &#x00026; E), correlate the confocal findings with histopathology of the same tissue sections. Co-localization and numbers of positive pixels for each color was quantified by using the imaging software NIS Elements (Nikon, Japan).
